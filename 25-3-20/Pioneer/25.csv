0,25-3-20,India’s lost opportunity,"It is possible to convert all homes into learning centres through the use of communication technology. But we were not ready for it

Health and education are the main concerns of all families and Governments during calamities. Governments which can think, plan and lead their country during difficult times are sure to survive any disaster. The world is passing through a great crisis right now due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Hospitals are being flooded with patients and schools have been closed. This is no time to find fault but it is definitely an opportune time to assess how prepared India was for this situation. And what we should do now, so that once this crisis is over the country is ready for a similar situation, if and when, it arrives.

What is in short supply during a crisis is professionals and experts. For now, healthcare professionals are in short supply and also teachers, because children can’t reach school and teachers can’t reach homes of the learners. In terms of medical facilities, we can convert school buildings into hospital wards but how can we turn every household into a classroom? By no means can we multiply the number of teachers and arrange doorstep educational facilities. But it is possible to convert all households into learning centres through the use of modern communication technologies. Thankfully we are able to maintain electronic communication right now and this can be used to beam academic lessons to all households. This is the time to review some of the initiatives we took in this direction.

In 2002, during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Government, it was decided that we needed to launch a satellite for education as schools, teachers and related facilities were in short supply. As a consequence in September 2004, we launched a satellite exclusively for education known as Educational Satellite (EduSat). The cost of a satellite is massive and it is not an easy decision to dedicate one solely to education. But India definitely needed to do this because of the large number of learners, who could make use of it in the absence of good teachers in institutions established in different parts of the country. The satellite had a life of seven years but it died in 2010 and we could not even use ten per cent of its capacity.

In 2015, once again, the then Human Resource Development (HRD) Minister Smriti Irani took two initiatives. One was starting a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platform known as SWAYAM and the second was a bouquet of Direct To Home (DTH) educational channels known as Swayam Prabha. Both the platforms cover content from pre-school to doctoral studies. Both have a larger participation than any other platform of any other country but still it is not able to fill the gap it was expected to, in the present crisis. A large number of Secondary school students are watching channel number 27, Panini and Senior Secondary students are watching channel number 28, Sharda of the Swayam Prabha DTH channels. However, compared to the number of learners, who are confined to homes, the viewership is minuscule. The broadcast is backed by a live question-answer session where the teacher answers queries of the students when they call on the toll-free numbers that have been provided to facilitate this.

This was the foresight of the leader and had we pursued with our efforts and hooked up all Secondary and Senior Secondary learners to these platforms at that time, we would not have had to worry about closing down our schools, at least for academic transaction.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted India to reach out to learners in all the States and also our neighbouring countries through satellite and he had mentioned this in his speech in Parliament. In keeping with the PM’s wish Irani also initiated the Bharat Vani project wherein textbooks were developed in 100 mother tongues of India. And in keeping with Modi’s wish to provide content to the learners in South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries in their own language, Irani responded by forming a task force to develop learning material in text and media formats and many more. Our satellite broadcast reached 95 per cent of our landmass and also our neighbours. If we develop material in languages like Nepali, Bengali, Tamil, Urdu and so on, we would be beaming good content to not only our citizens but also to learners in SAARC nations. This was the best time to not only help our own schoolchildren but also children in the South Asian countries, stay back home and continue their studies. By not pursuing the Bharat Vani project, we have lost the opportunity to be of help to our students, neighbours and failed our PM’s mission. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS), the largest open school in the world, has in the last five years developed e-content which is available on the SWAYAM and has four 24X7 DTH channels. We could have filled the gap, which has been created by the closure of the schools across country due to Covid-19. Language and location would have been no barrier. The NIOS broadcast and live classes are becoming popular by the day. But it had massive potential and it could have played a larger role if we had prepared distance/open schooling through dual mode schooling. It is a missed opportunity and it is too late to do anything now. However, we must learn from our mistakes and take these initiatives to their logical conclusion once the Coronavirus threat is over.

1,25-3-20,Together we can beat the Coronavirus,"Experts say that quarantine is one of the most effective ways of containing an epidemic. Therefore, it is imperative that more than the steps taken by the Government, we impose self-restrictions at an early stage to limit the COVID-19 spread and help each other in this trying time

Most of India is in a lockdown as the country collectively tries to prevent the deadly Coronavirus from spreading into the community. We began the exercise to beat the virus on March 22 with the unprecedented voluntary 7 AM to 9 PM “Janta (public) Curfew” in response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s televised appeal to people to stay indoors.

Given our numbers, a whopping 1.3 billion people, it was by far the biggest social-distancing exercise in the world against the Coronavirus outbreak.

The country has been in a lockdown ever since and the Prime Minister gave a hint of what was to come when he said that India should be prepared for a long haul. Modi tweeted on Sunday night, “Today’s #JantaCurfew may get over at 9 PM but that doesn’t mean we should start celebrating. Do not consider it a success. Today the countrymen have declared we are capable, if we decide we can beat the biggest challenge together.”

India stands at the tipping point, having reached Stage-III of the pandemic as confirmed by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on March 22. From here it could take a flat curve like Korea or an upward curve like Europe. The “Janta Curfew” was Modi’s idea of mobilising public support to fight the Coronavirus through extended lockdowns soon afterwards. It was a bid to create greater awareness in the country about the danger of the pandemic and remind everyone of their duty towards the nation.

All epidemics evoke fear and panic since they result in fatalities and the Coronavirus is no exception. However, in its management, four elements are important: Science; the public healthcare system; political will and public support. Where science is concerned, human trials of the Coronavirus vaccine have already begun and doctors are experimenting with the use of various drugs that already exist to fight the pandemic. However, in India, much more needs to be done on the public healthcare front, which is not equipped to handle a medical emergency of this scale. As far as political will and support is concerned, Modi’s appeal and the subsequent lockdowns by various State Governments across the nation show that we are doing well on this front. And the fact that the Prime Minister’s appeal for the “Janta curfew” and the subsequent lockdowns received overwhelming support across the spectrum shows that people are behind the Government, too.

India was never as united as it is today. Several Chief Ministers, Members of Parliament, political parties, sports personalities, film stars and TV celebrities came on board to make the “Janta Curfew” and the lockdowns that have followed it, a success. The support for the Union Government also came from unexpected quarters, including the Congress and other Opposition parties.

Even religious institutions don’t seem averse to the Government’s measures, as temple authorities across the country have come on board and closed temples in an unprecedented move. Priests in a temple in Varanasi decided to put masks on the idols and posters have been put up urging devotees to refrain from touching the idols. Even most churches across India are shut and most Sunday services were either suspended or held online. This is quite a feat given that this is the Holy Lenten month for Christians across the globe and churches are usually full at this time of the year.

Now that the country is in a lockdown, the question is what lies ahead? The challenge before the Modi Government is formidable. Many nations have announced support for their economies and businesses and people who are losing out on their livelihoods. The UK proposes to spend 330 million pounds and the US close to a trillion dollars. Even European countries like France, Spain and Italy are getting ready to spend billions of euros. The Modi Government, too, will have to mobilise all the resources at its disposal to keep the country pandemic-free and also ensure that the livelihoods of people are safeguarded. The Centre and the States will have to focus on how to deal with lakhs of people who will be in dire straits due to the lockdown. This is particularly so in the case of construction workers, taxi and auto-rickshaw drivers, daily-wage earners, domestic help, small business enterprises and so on. The Government has to think of a huge economic package to tide over the present crisis. The more drastic the precautionary health measures, the greater will be the fallout on the economy. Modi has announced an economic task force under the Finance Minister but they are yet to come up with welfare schemes, though Nirmala Sitharaman did extend the last date of filing income tax returns on Tuesday. However, some States like UP, Telangana and Delhi have come out with relief packages.

Also, at a time like this, the people have to realise that pursuing one’s own self-interest is not done and each citizen also has to think of public interest. While we all have the legal right to buy as much hand sanitiser and face wipes we can find, what about the welfare of the society in which we live? India believes in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the whole world is one family) so now is the time to prove this with our behaviour.

Experts say that quarantine is one of the most effective ways of containing an epidemic. Therefore, it is imperative that more than the steps taken by the Government we impose self-restrictions at an early stage to limit the Coronavirus spread and help each other in this trying time. As Dr Paul, head of the medical task force at the Centre, commented in a TV show, “The Coronavirus is a once-in-a century epidemic and has to be fought as such.” Indeed desperate times need desperate measures.

4,25-3-20,Curfew imposed in Himachal,"A day after the neighbouring Punjab and Chandigarh imposed curfew, Himachal Pradesh government on Tuesday also imposed an indefinite statewide curfew to combat coronavirus after it was found that many people defied the lockdown orders.

Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said the curfew will come into force in all 12 districts of the hill state at 5 pm on Tuesday.

He made the announcement at 3.15 pm after the district authorities in Una, Kangra and Mandi had already imposed a curfew to contain the spread of the disease.

The CM took the decision after reviewing the situation at a high-level meeting with the ministers and officers. After the meeting, the CM told the media that the state government was forced to take the step as many people defied the lockdown clamped in the state since Monday. ""Several people were moving on the roads despite the restrictions. So, the state government was left with no option but to impose a curfew in the entire state,"" he said.

Thakur urged people to follow the instructions issued by the state and central governments and remain indoors.

Una was the first district in Himachal Pradesh which imposed the curfew in the state. Una Deputy Commissioner Sandeep Kumar said curfew was imposed in the district at 1 pm. Subsequently, Kangra and Mandi DCs Rakesh Prajapati and Rugdev Thakur, respectively, announced an immediate imposition of the curfew in their districts.

Kangra is the only district in the state where three coronavirus cases have been detected so far. A 32-year-old man from Harchakkian tehsil and a 64-year-old woman from Dohabe village in Shahpur subdivision were tested positive for the disease on Friday. A 69-year-old man who recently travelled from the US and came to Kangra on March 21 in a taxi from Delhi had died of the infection at Tanda''s Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College on Friday.

Earlier on Monday, the staff of a private hospital in Kangra district where the man had initially gone for treatment was kept under isolation. The taxi driver, his family members and those who remained in the man's touch were also quarantined.

The CM said district-level coordination committees have been constituted for an effective and better coordination with the district administration so that the people do not face any inconvenience and essential services could be provided without any hiccup.

5,25-3-20,Haryana releases appointment letters to 447 recently selected doctors,"To contain coronavirus, Haryana government on Tuesday decided to appoint over 400 recently selected doctors besides creating a revolving fund of Rs 100 crore each for the departments at the forefront of the battle against the infection, including the departments of Medical Education and Research, Health, Revenue, Home and Urban Local Bodies for COVID-19 related mitigation measures.

Among the other health measures, the government decided to notify hospitals for the treatment of the victims apart from allowing private laboratories at four places to conduct tests. The cost of tests referred to the private laboratories will be borne by the state government.

Sant Nirankari Mission President Gobind Singh, popularly known as Bhaiyaji, also extended a similar offer for utilization of Nirankari Bhawans and their facilities in the state’s battle against the Coronavirus. He also offered the services of their volunteers to help out the state government in this hour of crisis. In this regard, instructions have already been conveyed at all Bhawans, he informed the Chief Minister.

7,25-3-20,Foreign policy put to test,"For Nepal, balancing India and China is challenging; expecting it to also balance America and Beijing would be walking a tightrope. For India, regaining space lost to China will be a long haul

I go to Nepal twice a year. Once during Holi and the other on Tihar (Nepali bhai dooj) that comes after Dussehra. The normal format is: Fly to Kathmandu, spend two to three days there, then fly to Pokhara for a two-week trek and then revival. The pre-Holi Kathmandu weather this year was a spoilsport — cold, bleak and rainy — amid the Corona scare, though Nepal had registered just one case and that figure remains intact even today. Just this week, Nepal went into total lockdown till March 31. One-third of its population of 30 million people works abroad, mainly in the Middle East, South-east Asia and India. Their earnings account for nearly one-third of its gross domestic product (GDP) of $35 million.

Many Nepalese wear face masks throughout the year in Kathmandu and elsewhere due to garbage and pollution. Everything appeared normal at the Tribhuvan International Airport, including the temperature gun aimed at people. The country has for the moment cancelled its inaugural Sagarmatha Sambad, a three-day conference on climate change, which Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali said would be postponed to October. He also said he was pleased with India-Nepal relations now that the Foreign Secretary-level Kalapani dialogue is about to start shortly and the Eminent Persons Group (EPG) report appeared on the horizon.

My lecture at Nepal’s Institute for International Cooperation and Engagement on a holiday (Saturday, March 6) was well-received. It was preceded by a presentation on the Coronavirus and the world economy. The theme of my presentation was: “India-Nepal Relations: Mind the Gap — Where China Fits in.” The Kathmandu Post, the capital’s leading English newspaper, was recently stung by a stern rebuke by the Chinese Embassy for reproducing a syndicated column on Coronavirus by a former US Ambassador, who was critical of China. While this intrusion was condemned by the Nepalese media, not a word was said by the Prime Minister KP Oli-led Government.

During the royal rule, the Chinese used to say that they do not interfere in the internal affairs of the host Government. This is now a thing of the past. That the Chinese assault on freedoms guaranteed by the Nepalese Constitution went officially unresponded was not surprising. Any similar affront by India would have attracted loud and collective protests by the media and the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP), which is inarguably pro-China. Clive Hamilton’s Silent Invasion: China’s Influence in Australia and Jonathan Manthorpe’s Claws of the Panda: Beijing’s Campaign of Influence and Intimidation in Canada are books reflecting on China’s global outreach and blatant intrusions.

Like in the rest of the world, politics is on long pause in Nepal. Reason: Oli’s health and the spread of Coronavirus. The main topic of discussion after Oli received his second kidney replacement is his political rejuvenation. Unless his health deteriorates, rendering him dysfunctional, he will continue to lead the country by remote control. Fortunately, the Coronavirus epidemic appears controlled for now and life goes on happily without fear or scare throughout Nepal.

I arrived in Pokhara a day before Holi on an Air Buddha flight, which took all of 25 minutes. The only BMW in Pokhara, belonging to Nepali Congress’ Buddhiman Gurung, drove me to Lameahal, 15 km east of Pokhara. Holi is celebrated on the 6,000 ft high newly-built Manithan temple at An Phu village, where the bhale (male chicken) or boka (male goat) are sacrificed till the brown hilltop turns red. The pujari (priest) has to first persuade bhale and boka to accept becoming the sacrificial offering before their beheading by the khukuri-wielding priest. Side by side, dry colours mix freely with local dance and drinks as tribal Gurungs bring out their best. From Lameahal, one has to cross the Seti river on a swing bridge, climbing about two hours to reach An Phu top, which makes for a healthy

daily trek.

Meanwhile, with regime change in the Oli-led NCP unlikely till next elections in 2023, it is the latent power struggle between Oli and party president Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda that is making the gossip. Given Oli’s uncertain health, Prachanda has played his cards cleverly to ensure that sooner than later, the power hierarchy in Kathmandu could look like this: Madhav Kumar Nepal, former Nepal Prime Minister, Jhalanath Khanal, the President of Nepal, and Prachanda, the undisputed president of the party. The opposition Nepali Congress in Nepal, like Indian National Congress, is on a decline. Nepali Congress (NC), which was split into three factions — SB Deuba, RC Poudyal and KP Sitaulla — has two additional wings: The Koirala legacy and Ganesh Man Singh groups. Both NCP and NC will have their first and 14th general conventions in 2021.

While in NC, Deuba remains the top leader, other parties have opted for joint or collective leadership to avoid infighting. For example, the royalist Rashtriya Prajatantra Party, which merged recently, has three presidents. The Rashtriya Janata Party (RJP) has a six-member presidium led by Mahanta Thakur. The Samajwadi Party (SP) has a triumvirate leadership — former Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai, Upendra Yadav and Ashok Rai. The RJP and SP, who together rule number two province, are considering merger after unification talks. They have been pressing the Oli Government to amend the Constitution, incorporating pending issues of the Madhesis, janjatis and marginalised communities.

Two years on, the Opposition parties are complaining that the ruling NCP is besieged by scandals — gold, wide-bodied aircraft, NCell and a close aide of Oli, Banskota — and misgovernance but have no alternate vision plan to offer. While China will ensure the NCP stays united and the Government does not fall, India is loath to being seen as having favourites or indulging in regime change. The Government is seized with matters like the US-sponsored Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and the Indo-Pacific, which are seen as means of challenging China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and containing it. Die-hard communist members of NCP are unwilling to countenance this. For Nepal, balancing India and China is challenging enough; expecting it to also balance the US and China would be walking a tightrope.

For India, regaining space lost to China will be a long haul. In the meantime, it can invest in improving its declined image, damaged by the blockade of 2015, which gave rise to anti-Indianism and fillip to China. It has chosen a competent and promising Ambassador, Vinay Kwatra, for the job. On March 18, when I was at Pokhara airport bound for New Delhi, one of my Nepalese friends made this irresistible offer: “Mehtaji, why don’t you stay in Lameahal till the Coronavirus dries up?” Back in Noida, I am confined to Ram Vihar instead of climbing to An Phu top and breathing a daily dose of crisp Himalayan air.

8,25-3-20,Economic pandemic,"Very few Indians can sustain a prolonged shutdown but can the Government jumpstart the economy once India reopens?

Truly speaking, the press conference held by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman offered no relief package when much was desired considering the stressed times due to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. All that it offered were announcements of deferments for tax compliance issues. Undoubtedly, this was much-needed. Such concessions, coupled with reductions in interest penalties and extension of some schemes and the fact that there will be no minimum balance or debit card charges over the next three months in banks, is welcome. However, the country and its citizens were expecting something more: They wanted a relief package. From large corporations to daily-wage labourers, everyone was expecting some measures on the part of the Government to mitigate the economic impact of COVID, some sort of a relief package, some numbers or a liquidity measure. This was a fine-print press conference, an obvious one after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) extended the financial year to June 30. Sure, there were some positives pertaining to the bankruptcy and insolvency code as account departments across firms are not functional. While the Government managed to pat itself on the back for the Unified Payment Interface (UPI), it was necessary to implore the public to not go to the banks. It is becoming increasingly clear that March 31 is not an expiry date to the Wuhan contagion’s spread in India. This will only show just how successful the lockdown, the biggest across the world, has been in controlling the spread of the disease. Fighting the outbreak is crucial but the economic policies of the Government have received much criticism, too. As it is even before the pandemic struck, the Indian economy was already in the grip of a slowdown. Post the spread of the disease, forecasts have reached a new low. Oxford Economics slashed the country’s January-April growth forecast to three per cent, a number not seen even during the worst of the global financial crisis. The main equity gauge slumped by a record 13.2 per cent and the rupee weakened past 76 a dollar for the first time ever. Foreign investors have already started selling Indian assets at an unprecedented pace. It is also very likely that the lockdown, at least in some form or the other, will carry on till mid-April. And even when India reopens for business, trains and planes will take weeks to get back to their normal schedules. As far as foreign travel is concerned, it appears that a few commercial flights will operate to international destinations till the middle of the year until the disease subsides in Western Europe and the US. This will hurt both Indian immigrants abroad and their families back home. Meanwhile, there will be a lot of tragic stories, of children being unable to attend their parents’ funeral, for example.

What is clear, however, is that an extended lockdown will lead to a lot of shock for the economy, and not in a good way. While some State Governments are providing free rations, limited financial help for daily-wage labourers and the homeless as India’s migration to urban centres reverses, it may be impossible to reach the countless millions who have gone back to Bihar and Jharkhand. How much money can Governments provide? Where will the money be spent? Can India even afford to give money out like that when the very survival of certain sectors of the Indian economy — aviation and travel being top of the radar — are at stake? This will not be an easy task for the Narendra Modi Government. It is fate that has determined that he is our Prime Minister during this crisis. How he handles this further will not just determine the course for the next few years but for the next three decades.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/economic-pandemic-2020-03-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/economic-pandemic.html
9,25-3-20,Back to the people,"Omar Abdullah is free and used his appeal, that at one time was considered incendiary, to calm his people amid virus fears

Yes, former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and National Conference (NC) leader Omar Abdullah has been released from detention. But the circumstances surrounding his release are just as hazy as his arrest. In the dark shadow of COVID-19, Omar decided that though it was a different Kashmir he was returning to, there was a bigger question of life and death at the moment and so spread the Government’s message of social distancing and quarantine. If the Government’s charges for booking him after the abrogation of Article 370 — that his messages were divisive and could incite people and youngsters — are an estimate of his appeal, then Omar certainly proved how the Government bungled in underestimating his positive net worth. For he used the same appeal to ask his people to be calm in the time of a horrid pandemic and follow protocol, politics could come later. Clearly, NC chief Farooq Abdullah, who was released earlier and Omar, both of whom had been allies of the BJP Government, and not too troublesome ones at that, could have been used to normalise the bridge with civil society in Kashmir despite its changed status as a Union Territory. And by equating the old political leadership with terrorists, when in fact the Abdullahs were much of a filter, the Modi Government cannot walk the talk of ushering in development in Kashmir. It still needs the mediatory presence of local parties but has blunderously pushed them away. In their absence, the ruling BJP could not conduct the panchayat and local-level polls successfully, although it has been hoping to build a new narrative ground up with candidates friendly to it. Such was the boycott then that over 12,000 panchayat seats continue to be vacant. Panchayats have made it clear that any electoral process would have to be preceded by the release of jailed NC and People’s Democratic Party (PDP) leaders. Clearly, without traditional politicians, the BJP is finding it extremely difficult to re-engage with people. Already payments are pending for work done under MGNREGA scheme over the last several years. And in the trough of COVID-19, the Government might face more ire locally. Neither has the BJP been able to raise an alternative front or a political climate. It may have encouraged the formation of the Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party (JKAP) drawing rejects from PDP and NC, but it cannot generate reassurance, least of all credibility.

Besides, the Modi Government has failed to justify why it used the Public Safety Act (PSA) to book Omar. The law was passed in 1978 by Sheikh Abdullah, who founded the NC. Over the years, it has been used indiscriminately to curb dissent, invoked most frequently against separatist leaders and protesting teenagers. One can understand the dynastic hatred involved in arresting Omar under a law passed by his grandfather. But beyond the theatrics of a “great fall,” it is the dossier of charges against him that defied reason and bordered on the ridiculous. Omar’s ostensible crime was the capacity to influence people and his ability “to convince his electorate to come out and vote in huge numbers even during the peak of militancy and poll boycotts.” If this swaying ability, something that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime used to build a bridge over the conflict, is not an asset, then one wonders what is. If his persistent calls to resolve the conflict through democratic processes are not Centrist, then one wonders what separatism is. For these abilities, which the current regime could have used to transition to a new narrative, have been wasted away. Omar, the genial, quiet and engaging fighter, once seen as a puppet prince, will now be Kashmir’s face of quiet resistance. The captivity has given him the halo he needed.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/back-to-the-people-2020-03-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/back-to-the-people.html
10,25-3-20,Much ado about Gogoi,"There are many other judges who retired from the Bench and who later took up political postings offered by the parties in power

Ranjan Gogoi, the newly sworn-in member of the Rajya Sabha, is the cynosure of all eyes as well as the favourite whipping boy, at the moment, depending on which side of the fence people are on.

His critics say that the decision of the former Chief Justice of India (CJI) to accept the nomination to the House of Elders by the President of India is an act against all ethics mentioned in the Constitution of India. Since this writer is no authority on the Constitution, let the experts discuss the issue and quote the relevant portions from the Indian Constitution which show beyond doubt that Gogoi has cocked a snook at the founding fathers’ vision.

Those who support Gogoi point out that there were instances of retired judges of the Supreme Court getting nominated to the Rajya Sabha in the past and there is nothing “official” about the former’s decision to take up the offer of the Government of India.

Given Gogoi’s extensive knowledge and experience of the law, he does qualify to be a notable who can contribute valuably to the Upper House. Also, he is not the first retired Chief Justice to have benefitted from the executive’s generosity. There have been others like him who have propped up by several regimes as a reward for services that were “friendly” to them. There’s enough counter-logic going around as to how Justice S Fazl Ali was the first Supreme Court judge to be made Orissa Governor in 1952 and was the beginning of the Congress’ endorsements of judicial luminaries that continued till the party was in power.

From Assam itself, there’s the example of Justice Baharul Islam, who began as an advocate in the Assam High Court in the early 1950s and went on to serve a decade-long term as Rajya Sabha member.

As far as controversial rulings go, then the Congress suitably accommodated former Chief Justice Ranganath Misra, who gave a clean chit to the Rajiv Gandhi-led Congress in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case. After his retirement, he was made the first chairman of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and was even elected to the Upper House on a Congress ticket in 1998. The examples are so many that at one time, there was much debate over how judges should not be encouraged to take up the offer of the Government’s post-retirement benefits, like heading commissions of inquiry, simply because that could cloud their impartial judgments and colour their opinions in sensitive cases.

One wonders, why then is there such discomfort over Gogoi’s induction in the Rajya Sabha? Is it that there’s much criticism of Gogoi because he was at one time considered a “rebel” judge and, therefore, now looks like a test case of how the institution of the executive superseded that of the judiciary and a one-time warrior appeared to have fallen in line? For the uninitiated, Justice Gogoi and three of his brother judges shot into national prominence on January 18, 2018, when they staged a press conference in the national Capital, which was described as extraordinary by the “pundits” in the media. The judges cautioned the nation by giving “advance information” about the threat faced by the nation and the judiciary. Gogoi had specifically made a reference to the selective allocation of sensitive files. Therefore, there was a sense of expectation built around him, one of them being that he would ensure the independence of the judiciary. The four senior-most judges of the apex court led by Gogoi warned that democracy was in peril. “Unless this institution of the Supreme Court is preserved, democracy will not survive in this country,” warned J Chelameswar, a colleague of Gogoi, during the press meet, who, too, has retired.

I remember many Opposition leaders waxing eloquent on the four judges who held the extraordinary press conference. Immediately after the meet, a Left leader went to the residence of Chelameswar (through the back entrance).

Nothing discernible happened after this extraordinary washing of dirty linen in public. The then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra retired on October 2, 2018, and Ranjan Gogoi was sworn in as the new Chief Justice. The rebel judges or the “young Turks” of the Supreme Court retired one by one and all are living happily ever since.

People living in South India are not fortunate enough to get the latest news on the “palace intrigues” taking place in the power corridors in New Delhi. Gogoi retired on November 17, 2019 and Sharad Bobde was sworn in as the new Chief Justice of the country. This is an ongoing process as the judiciary, too, works on the principle “me today, you tomorrow.” Justice Bobde, too, would be retiring once he reaches the magical figure of 65, the age for superannuation.

The issue is whether the former Chief Justice of India was right in accepting the Rajya Sabha nomination offered by the President of India so soon after his retirement. Well, there are no records to show that Gogoi was even remotely connected with any political party till the day he retired from service. He is the son of KC Gogoi, former Chief Minister of Assam who was a Congress leader. Ranjan Gogoi’s career at the Bench began in 2001 when he was appointed as a judge of the Guwahati High Court in 2001 and culminated with his appointment as the country’s 46th Chief Justice in 2018. But there were many legal wizards in the Supreme Court who had stints in politics before their elevation to the Bench and till this day one is yet to hear about the ethics practiced by these gentlemen.

VR Krishna Iyer, a noted judge who became a pioneer of judicial activism in India and has ever since been eulogised for his concerns for human rights and the poor, was appointed as a judge of the Kerala High Court in 1968. Before entering the precincts of the judiciary, Iyer was a full-fledged politician, a Communist to be precise. He was the Home Minister in the EMS Namboodiripad-led Communist Government of 1957, which was dismissed by Jawaharlal Nehru following the liberation struggle waged by the Congress in association with the powerful Church and the Muslim community. It was during the tenure of Iyer as Home Minister that Kerala saw the first-ever police firing on cashew company workers agitating for their rights.

Iyer, who was defeated in the next Assembly election, was elevated to the Bench in 1968 at the instance of Namboodiripad. This has been mentioned by Iyer himself in his autobiography Wandering in Many Worlds (Longman Pearson 2009). “EMS Namboodiripad sent his Cabinet colleague, Gouriamma, to persuade me to accept the offer. She pleaded that State power was a necessary tool for transformation of India into a socialist republic. She pressed home this point and left,” writes Iyer on page 159. The book hit the shelves across the nation in 2009 and Gauriamma is yet to react to what Iyer has written.

The Communists and the Congress were hands in glove, though it was invisible to most. Iyer’s was not a one-off inclusion of a professional politician into the Bench. We have the case of Kurian Joseph, who as a student of the Sree Sankara College, Kalady was the leader of the student wing of the Kerala Congress (Mani), and had the backing of the party all through his career. He was one of the judges who took part in the “extraordinary press meet” along with Gogoi to warn the nation that democracy was in danger.

Joseph has reportedly said that Gogoi compromised the noble principles of the independence and impartiality of the judiciary by accepting the nomination to be a MP. “According to me, the acceptance of nomination as member of Rajya Sabha by a former CJI has certainly shaken the confidence of the common man on the independence of the judiciary, which is also one of the basic structures of the Constitution of India,” Joseph has been quoted as saying.

Let’s accept what Joseph has said about Gogoi, but we have had many judges and Chief Justices in the past, who, had no hesitation in accepting the crumbs thrown at them post-retirement. Joseph’s predecessor from Kerala, KG Balakrishnan, had no qualms in accepting the post of the Chairman of the NHRC. There are many judges who retired from the Bench who later took up political postings offered by the parties in power. HR Gokhale, Baharul Islam are just some of the names that come to the mind. We cannot expect every judge to be like MN Venkatachaliah and SH Kapadia, synonyms for justice and propriety.

11,25-3-20,"60 FIRs filed, 100 held for defying orders in Hry","Entire Haryana went under lockdown on Tuesday, a day after the state government issued the order to help check the spread of coronavirus. However, at some places, police had a tough time persuading people who were out for non-essential work and sending them back to their houses.

To enforce lockdown, Police carried out flag march in Sonepat and other places in the State. Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij said, ""We will ensure that the lockdown is strictly enforced, though essential and emergency services will be maintained.""

He said State borders will remain sealed during the lockdown period and inter-state bus services suspended. Section 144 of the CrPC which prohibits the assembly of five or more people has been imposed in the State. Those violating the lockdown will invite punishment under the law, Vij warned while appealing to people to cooperate with the government. So far, 14 people have tested positive for COVID-19 in the State.

Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Navdeep Singh Virk said that as per last reports collected from the field units more than 60 FIRs have been registered and more than 90 persons arrested against those who were not following orders. Hundreds of challans have been issued and vehicles of violators were also impounded. Being the first day of state wide lockdown, people were also being educated and warned wherever minor non compliance was noted. He said Haryana Police is continuing to work to enforce strict lockdown in the entire state to break the chain of transmission of COVID-19. People were being facilitated to shop for the “very basic necessities” but after following strict social distancing norms.

The State government had earlier ordered lockdown in Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonipat, Panipat, Jhajjar, Rohtak and Panchkula districts till March 31 but later decided to extend the measure to entire Haryana. However, all essential and emergency services are exempted, officials said.

As per report, in Bhiwani, at a check barrier, the police had to deal with a number of two-wheeler riders many of them who were out on roads for non-essential work. ""We are persuading them and sending them back to their homes,"" said a police personal on duty at one such check barrier in Bhiwani.

In Jind, Rewari, Sirsa and Rohtak as well, policemen were seen persuading and even warning people who were out for non-essential work.

There were a couple of instances where the police made a group of youngsters do sit-ups because they defied the lockdown order and they warned them not to repeat the offence. Police personnel and administration officials could be seen appealing to people at many places across the state to stay indoors.

Meanwhile, Virk posted a series of tweets to explain to people what a lockdown means. ""It is a situation where because of a public health emergency all public and private offices/shops/ establishments are closed by law (except those exempted) and restrictions are imposed on movement of people,"" Virk said in one such tweet.

On public queries if they can come out to purchase essential items, Virk in another tweet, said, ""If urgent may go to buy essentials to a shop in your locality either alone or at most be accompanied by one family member after following the social distancing norms."" He also said that lockdown has been ordered by the government under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and those not obeying the lockdown order are liable to be arrested and prosecuted under relevant provisions of law.

During the lockdown, all commercial establishments, shops and factories will remain closed, except those dealing in essential commodities like food, grocery, medicines, the officials said. Other essential services such as water supply, sanitation and electricity supply are also exempted from the lockdown, the officials said.

Public transport services, including taxis and autorickshaws, will be off the roads in the state, they said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/60-firs-filed--100-held-for-defying-orders-in-hry.html

But these ‘unsung’ heroes, the ‘safai mitr and swachhta didis who work invisibly in the background, away from the public glare, go unrecognized for their valuable contribution against the fight to stop the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

The safai mitr and swachhta didis or the cleaning or sanitation officials and employees are working day and night to ensure that disinfectants are sprayed and pure drinking water supply is uninterrupted across the state even during the lock down.

But these faceless warriors never get the recognition they deserve.

Official figures show that there are more than 9,000 swachhta didis across the state, who are going from door to door, collecting more than 16 lakh kg of household waste and garbage every day even during the lockdown.

More than 15,000 safai mitr’ rush to different areas, early every morning, to spray disinfectants within the city limits.

Responding to a call of the chief minister, they are working in two to three shifts to reach every area of the urban civic bodies across the state.

The coronavirus outbreak has struck in the urban bodies more than the rural areas.

The urban administration and development department has been working to ensure that people do not face any problems in disposing of the household waste and drinking water supply.

A control room has also been set up, from where monitoring of the 166 civic bodies of the state, especially spraying, cleanliness, disinfection and other work, is being done every day.

The department has also set up a toll free number ‘Nidaan-1100’ for citizens to register their complaints.

In the last two days alone, more than 20,000 complaints have been resolved on a priority basis.

Through the control room, it is being ensured that all complaints are attended to on the same day.

This apart, the supply of cleaning materials, chlorine, sodium hypo-chloride, disinfectants are continuously ensured in the civic bodies.

With this willful violation of the prohibitory orders promulgated under the Section 144 of the CrPC, the district and police administration have decided to take stern action against those defying the lockdown.

The relaxation in the lockdown time is been given from time to time to people to procure essential daily-use items and vegetables. They are, however, asked to rush back home after they finish their shopping.

But a large number of people are not taking the directives seriously and are moving around aimlessly, district officials said.

Even Kotba nagar panchayat chairman Virendra Kasim and other public representatives have been making announcements on regular basis, requesting people not to venture out of their homes.

All though the borders of the Jashpur district have been sealed, reports said that a wholesale vegetable market at Tapkara was open during the day and there was a large crowd of shoppers at the market, violating lockdown orders.

Photographs of the crowded market went viral on social media, alerting the police and district administration.

Following which, police took stern action against the people on two-wheelers moving within the town the limits and also people moving in groups.

16,25-3-20,Baghel to rescue Jharkhand labourers,"Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel on Tuesday came to the rescue of over 50 Jharkhand labourers, who were stuck at Bilaspur in the neighbouring State while returning home from Maharashtra amid the Coronavirus pandemonium.

The labourers, mostly tribal, were stuck in Bilaspur as all trains to Jharkhand have been cancelled to prevent the entry of the lethal virus in the State, sources said.

Responding to a tweet by Chief Minister Hemant Soren, in which he sought help of his Chhattisgarh counterpart in helping the labourers, Baghel tweeted, “Our Government will render complete support to the labourers. We will also ensure that they get food during this period and are safely escorted to Jharkhand.”

Several districts in Maharashtra – one of the worst-affected States in India with nearly 100 cases of Coronavirus – have been locked down leaving thousands of daily wage labourers jobless. Labourers from Bihar and Jharkhand often migrate to the developed states for employment. However, most of them had to return home during the lockdown as they were left with no means of eking out a living. While only 50 odd labourers were stuck in Chhattisgarh, there is no count of the total number of labourers who have returned to Jharkhand since the Coronavirus outbreak. The Government has strengthened the screening process in Jharkhand in a bid to ensure that no infected person goes unchecked, and further spreads the virus here.

However, activists and doctors say that the labourers returning from other States should also be screened and quarantined for at least 14 days as they could be potential carriers of the virus.

Meanwhile, all hell broke loose in suburban Ranchi’s Bundu subdivision after the police learnt that at least 11 foreigners, including a few from China, were staying at a Mosque in the area without providing any intimation to the local authorities.

Police on Tuesday sent all 11 foreign residents to Musabani Training School in East Singbhum, where they will be quarantined.

Deputy Superintendent of Police, Ajay Kumar said that all the police were scrutinising the documents of the foreign residents.The Government has by now collected samples of 77 Coronavirus suspects here and 61 of them have come out negative.

However, the results of 16 more samples sent for lab tests are awaited, and the officials here have their fingers crossed.

19,25-3-20,CAPT TERMS FM’s ANNOUNCEMENTS AS INADEQUATE,"Expressing disappointment over the announcements made by the Union Finance Minister, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday termed them as “inadequate” to address the concerns of the people, businesses and industry in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic gripping the nation.

“The announcements made by Nirmala Sitharaman do not fully reflect the concerns in the prevailing situation,” said the Chief Minister, underlining the need for a comprehensive package to build the confidence of all sectors of the economy and support the poor or underprivileged in this hour of need.

“It is the need of the hour for the Centre to urgently come out with a detailed economic package without further delay,” said Capt Amarinder, pointing out that the Union Finance Minister had failed to come out with details of the Task Force announced by the Prime Minister to work on such a package.

No suggestions had been taken so far from the states on the composition of the Task Force, nor any details shared, he said, hoping that it would be representative and would rise to the occasion triggered by this unprecedented crisis.

Noting that Punjab had already sent in its suggestions to the Prime Minister and the Union Finance Minister on the interventions required by the Central Government, the Chief Minister expressed the hope that those would be taken cognizance of.

“I have hopes for more than mere postponement of date of filing tax returns. Even the due date has not been changed in spite of the fact that most states are under curfew or lockdown,” he pointed out adding that the Finance Minister had even failed to make any mention of EMIs on loan repayments and default.

“There is no adequate attention being paid to the plight of the poor, especially the unorganized workers, which all the states have been pressing for…There is urgent need to double the PDS quota and provide free of cost ration at least for two months to the people in the prevailing situation, as already sought by the Punjab Government,” he said.

Capt Amarinder pointed out that he had also sought from the Centre lump sum assistance for stakeholders in tourism and hospitality sector, such as taxi drivers, freelance tour guides, unregistered tour operators, dhabawala, restaurant, rehriwala, who had been severely hit by the lockdowns across states.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/capt-terms-fm---s-announcements-as-inadequate.html

Announcing a series of measures to ease the problems faced by the people and to enable the police and civil administration to manage the situation more effectively, the Government has decided to ensure door-to-door delivery of essential commodities, such as groceries, milk, fruit, and vegetables through pre-identified hawkers or distributors wherever possible.

“Given the need to continue with the curfew which has received good response, it is essential to minimize the hassles faced by the citizens,” said the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, adding that the new curfew guidelines would be implemented strictly under the overall supervision of the Deputy Commissioners, who would ensure that the people have access to essential supplies and services.

Stressing that he understood the problems of the people in the prevailing conditions, the Chief Minister said that the Deputy Commissioners had been asked to ensure door-to-door delivery of essential commodities, such as groceries, milk, fruits and vegetables, through pre-identified hawkers or distributors, wherever possible.

Earlier, for Rs 100, I bought at least 2 to 3 kg of different vegetables. Now, I cannot even buy half of it with the same money, said Vinod Kumar another buyer.

“The administration should take measures to control the overpricing.” Since there is a huge gap between demand and supply due to lockdown, the retail price is bound to increase, said Manoj a trader at Bokaro. The State Government has warned traders against hoarding. The officials have been asked to keep a close watch on hoarders and black marketers.

Taking stiff action Sub-Divisional-Officer Dhanbad Raj Maheswaram and SDO Chas and Bermo warned traders against black marketing. SDO Dhanbad conducted raids in the vegetable market at police line, Bartand, Hirapur, Steel Gate in a bid to check on onion and potato price.

The citizens state that they do support the decision taken by the Government in order to stall the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) but they are not happy with the approach of administration towards the management of the household things required for the survival at every home.

In Dehradun and some other cities, some citizens complained that the administration is compelling the citizens to stay at home due to lockdown but failing to ensure the provision of necessary items through the proper implementation of law and order. ""I called the grocery shops on Tuesday which were apparently marked by district administration for the home delivery of necessary grocery items but none of them agreed to deliver at our home. Most of them refused saying that they cannot send people further than two kilometres or stated that they do not have enough staff. I and some of my neighbours asked them to bring essential items for five families thinking that the shop owner will deliver the items considering the profit but they did not agree,"" said Jakhan resident Amar Singh.

Karnpur resident Shruti Khansali said, “I called one of the grocery stores in Hanuman Chowk which was in the list issued by the Police department for the home delivery of the grocery items. The woman who received the call refused of even having a grocery store on being asked about the home delivery facility. I got the same response from three other stores. At last, I had to request the store owner near our locality to provide me some household items. I do not know how we will tackle the situation if the government extends the lockdown period after March 31 with such management.”

Besides the grocery items, some people also had to suffer because of the pending deliveries of cooking gas cylinders, medicines and newspapers. “I booked my gas cylinder last week which was supposed to be delivered on this Monday but I have not got it till now. The gas agency told me that they are facing a shortage of delivery men due to the threat of coronavirus so it will cause some delay in the delivery. We are happy to cooperate with the government but we do need basic amenities for survival during the lockdown. It is very hard for old people like us,"" said Dev Dutt, a senior citizen living in Haldwani.

On being asked about not complaining about their issues to the police, most of the people said that they were not aware that police can be contacted for such issues. While some of them were confused if such issue will be taken seriously by the police, the remaining people opined that they have never contacted police ever, so approaching police for a problem that might appear 'petty' to police felt unworthy.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-wide-lockdown.html

58,25-3-20,‘Gene Drive’ to curb malaria raises ethical questions as well,"A new technology ‘Gene Drive’ for mosquito control is currently confined to the laboratory since it raises an ethical question, if such a technology could in future be misused to the detriment of humanity.

Malaria control: Ronald Ross (1987) discovered malarial parasites in the stomach of Anopheles mosquitoes and proved that bite of female mosquitoes, transfer these parasites to humans and cause malaria. According to Cumbers (2019) half a million lives are lost annually by malaria. Other mosquitoes causing diseases are dengue, Zika, Chikungunya and yellow fever, each taking their toll of human lives and their livelihoods.

Several methods are used around the world for control of malaria. These include spray of insecticides, fumigation, destroying mosquito habitats, using bed nets for protection from their bites and many other innovations. All of these methods need to be implemented on a massive scale with sustained efforts regularly for protection from malaria. Mosquitoes and the malarial parasites they harbour have increasingly developed resistance to chemicals used for their elimination.

Recently many methods based on genetic control of mosquito population such as, use of sterile males, conditional lethal genes, microbe mediated infertility etc. have been tried but did not give desired results.

Gene drive: Andrea Crisanti and Kyros Kyron (2018), geneticist at the Imperial College, London, have developed a new method called ‘Gene drive’ for mosquito control.

Only female mosquitoes bite humans, to drink their blood as their food and produce eggs. If they are infected by malarial parasites, they pass on the parasites to the bitten person. When other mosquitoes bite the infected person, they are infected with the parasites. They transfer the parasites to other persons, when they bite them and the chain of infection spreads to a large human population.

Crisanti and Kyron (2018) have developed a CRISPR Cas9 (Pioneer, June 20, 2018) based Gene Drive, which carries a molecular scissor called Cas9 endonuclease and a guide RNA (gRNA), which are essential for cutting the DNA at a specific site within the genome.The gene drive targets fertility genes, essential for development of female mosquitoes.Similar to humans, mosquitoes carry two copies of each gene for every trait on each pair of their DNA’s. They have altered the nucleotide sequences of one of the copies to carry the code of gene drive and a cargo DNA that causes female sterility. The Cas9 endonuclease present in the gene drive cuts the second copy of the DNA and incorporates female sterility gene through an indigenous DNA repair mechanism. When male mosquitoes mate modified females in a normal population, they produce only sterile female mosquitoes, which cannot bite orproduce offspring. This results in a disproportionate increase in sterile females, which cannot lay eggs.

In course of time there is a collapse of the mosquito population. Their laboratory study showed that they could successfully bring the population of mosquitoes to zero within 6 months.

Theoretically gene drive once released into a fraction of population in the wild may spread nonstop to each individual in that population and beyond it and cause total elimination of the entire race.

Gene drives may also be developed to control household and agricultural pests replacing use of pesticides. It is a powerful technology, which has the potential for misuse by wrong people. With suitable modification it can be used to eliminate an entire race of animals, considered undesirable by human beings.

Gates foundation has invested more than $75 million on gene drive research at the Imperial College, London. The US military is also funding such research possibly to develop it as a biological weapon not to be brow beaten by its enemies (Brossard and others, 2019). There are no laws to prevent such misuse.

The California Cherry Board is funding research on gene drive to control invasive fruit flies that ruin their cherry crops (Regalado, 2017). It is also being considered for rodent control, wherever they have turned into uncontrollable pests.

An interdisciplinary panel discussion was held in November 2017 to examine complexities of Gene Drive application as a part of the Third Sackler Colloquium, in the University of North Carolina, USA. Social scientists, life scientists and journalists discussed the problem from each of their unique perspectives.

Journalism, especially science journalism, has an important role to play in helping the public understand complex and technical subjects, especially those that raise ethical issues. Technical assessment of risks involved in use of such a technology requires responsible decision making by multiple actors(Brossard and others, 2019).

In an article written by Jennifer Kahn in New York Times on January 8, 2020, entitled ‘The Gene Drive Dilemma: We can alter entire species, but should we?’ the author states that ‘Gene Drive’ seems almost tailor-made to tap into our worst fears: a powerful, invisible technology that spreads of its own, carrying out a fundamental transformation of nature. It’s a situation that practically invites us to imagine evil corporations on the move or secret military experiments going amok.

There are several factors which may hinder successful application of Gene Drive. The engineered insects may not survive in harshness of the wild. They may not be attractive to wild mosquitoes for mating. Gene Drive may have to be designed exclusively for different insects taking into account their speed of multiplication and adaptability to specific environment.

What will be the impact of application of gene drive on environment if an entire species is removed from the eco-system? Several species have already gone extinct due climate change. This needs careful assessment.

However extinct of anopheles mosquitoes may not have much impact since it is one of the 3,000 mosquito species found around the world (American Mosquito control Association, 2020).

Gene Drive needs to be applied rationally for each species taking into account its overall importance to maintain diversity of an ecosystem.

Since gene drive modified organisms can spread of their own in large geographical areas, decisions need to be taken involving countries and communities who are likely to be affected.

66,25-3-20,"‘Rest assured, AMOFOI marriage corona-proof'","Of all the marriages, the AMOFOI marriage of love birds by exchange of garlands in the the most modest way is the best, said the organisation.

The truth is traditional marriage is very risky when the deadly disease Coronavirus (Covid-19) is around. Authorities may ban such a marriage because it is a health hazard.

Social distancing is now in operations in several countries of the World. Foreign travel has virtually come down to a negligible figure. Compared to all these difficulties the AMOFOI love marriage is Corona-proof.

AMOFOI marriage is held in the absence of the priest. It takes only 1 hour and 30 minutes to complete the wedding process. The AMOFOI Certificate of Marriage in laminised form is handed over to the couple then and there. Its greatness lies in the fact that it requires only the presence of 8 to 9 persons to solemnise the marriage.

The AMOFOI Marriage Certificate carries 2 joint passport size photographs of the lovers. Such joint photos are affixed and they are sealed and signed by the AMOFOI secretary. In addition, the AMOFOI Marriage Certificate carries with it eight signatures.

AMOFOI Love marriage can be held even if the scare of the Coronavirus is very much there in the neighbourhood. To remove the caste system in toto, we need to have more and more of AMOFOI brand of priestless love marriage. The lowcost marriage is held by spending minimal amount of money.

Common people to contractors, no one is prepared to engage them in work in fear of contamination. Notably, these are mainly their employers. They result is they are passing through very hard days now.

“We can manage for a few days from our little saving. But this will not serve if the crisis continues for long days,"" said Raju Khara, a daily labourer of Budharaja area.

“We don’t know how to feed our children and meet rest of our needs thereafter,” Khara added.

Many other labourers who gather at the Fatak railway station everyday at 8 am in search of works are in dire straits to get employers now-a -days. Even civil contractors have stopped their construction works and some of the labourers from out of Odisha and mainly from Murshidabad of WB have left for their respective homes.

But local labourers and those from Titlagarh area who have been staying here since long and working as daily labourers are passing through uncertainty.

Interacting with media via video conferencing, Kejriwal announced that the number of night shelters in the city has been increased and more food is being distributed for homeless people.

Kejriwal said that due to curfew, several people were not able to get food, and urged the public to send such people to the nearest shelters of Delhi Government, where food was arranged.

“Today I want to tell you that in the last 40 hours there has been not a single new Coronavirus positive case in Delhi. Earlier we had total 30 such positive cases and among them, many people are getting better and going home.” “Till now 5 people have survived and gone home. Right now we have only 23 positive cases in Delhi. But I want to tell you that this is good news but there is no need to cheer yet because the number of cases can increase any time if we do not put proper restrictions or if you do not follow the restrictions. In Italy, in the last 24 hours, more than 600 people have died and in America, in the last 24 hours, more than 150 people have died,” Kejriwal added.

He said that this is an alarming situation worldwide that is why Delhi Government has imposed such tough restrictions like lockdown and curfew. “We are trying our best because we understand that these restrictions have brought many difficulties in your life but this is something we have to do because we want to save you, your family, your neighbours and every resident of Delhi,” said Kejriwal

He further added that the beauty of India is humanity. “Yesterday I requested the residents of Delhi to come together and help each other in this tough time. Today I am very happy that many people are coming forward and helping each other. In Delhi, nobody should suffer in hunger and it is our collective responsibility to stand beside each other.”

Urging house owners in Delhi, he appealed them not to force the tenants if they cannot pay the rents.

“I am not suggesting to not take the rent but the owners can delay the collection or take it in instalments. It is very encouraging that many people have responded to this call and I have received hundreds of messages where people have described how they are helping each other,” “I am proud of such citizens and I want to tell them that you are the real patriots of India.”

Citing few examples, CM thanked Delhi house owners who take the lead and said, “I want to take the name of Raj Bainsla Ji who has decided that he will not take the rent for the month of March from any of his tenants. Anil Kaushik Ji has informed that he will not take rents from his tenants and drivers for the months of March and April. Naveen Nambardar Ji has also decided not to take rent of this month from his tenants.”

“Azad Shaukeen Ji has also decided the same. Sukant Ballav Ji is an additional DCP of North East Delhi, has taken an old man on his car to the hospital for dialysis. I want to thank all these people for such encouraging steps in this tough time,” he said further.

Delhi government is working to ensure that not a single person in Delhi should suffer from hunger. “We have already started distributing food in all the night shelters of Delhi where any person can come and eat.” “We have witnessed that the number of people is increasing, therefore, we have also decided to increase the number of such night shelters and we will also increase food distribution, said Kejriwal “But again I want to tell you that I am very happy to know that many people are coming forward to volunteer in the distribution of foods. Many people have said that they will ensure not a single person in their area will suffer from hunger.”of our country,” said Mr Kejriwal.

Citing the example of Prime Minister Narendra Modi about his message to public on Janta Curfew, at 5 PM all came to the balconies and clapped as a mark of encouragement to the people who are serving us in this tough time, Kejriwal said, “We want to show our gratitude to the nurses, doctors, pilots, air hostess, and other people working on this battle. But with much regret, I am saying that I have received complaints in many places in Delhi that these great people are facing discrimination.” “Somewhere the people did not allow a pilot to enter the colony because they thought that he could be affected by Coronavirus and the same has happened in some other cases. This is something absolutely unacceptable and such discrimination should not happen in our country. The people who are working as doctors, nurses, pilots, air hostess their responsibility is also ours. If anyone is affected by Coronavirus it is our responsibility to do their treatment so that they can recover fast but if they are not affected then they should not face any kind of discrimination. These are the people who are working relentlessly to give you proper medication and support, therefore, these people should be welcomed and they should not face any kind of discrimination,” Kejriwal said.

He added, “From today we have started preparation to build a foolproof health system to combat the situation if ever we get into stage three of this pandemic. Under senior Dr Sareen, I have constituted a team which will make all the preparations and submit me a report within 24 hours. We do not want to get into stage three but we have to be fully prepared in terms of medical support.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/amid-lockdown--rs-5k-each-for-construction-workers.html

92,25-3-20,Astrologers say corona result of Jupiter's asymmetric movement,"Though medical scientists are yet to come out with answers to doubts about coronavirus which has claimed millions of lives across the globe, astrology has the answer for what caused the pandemic.

Modern science and liberals may look down on this ancient system of Indian knowledge with contempt and disgust and they portray as reactionary and regressive any efforts to describe this branch of knowledge as a science.

Whether one agrees or disagrees with the observations by persons who have mastered the science of astrology, it is interesting to note their conclusions about coronavirus.

Parappanangadi Unnikrishna Panickar and Pandhappalli Gopala Menon , two leading Thantrik scholars who learnt astrology as part of their training in Sanskrit literature pointed out to The Pioneer that the present pandemic is the result of the haphazard movement of planets from one position to another during a single calendar year. “There is a law which governs the movement of planets from one Raassi to another. The established pattern stands disturbed and this is the reason behind the pandemic,” said Panickar who usually shuns the media. Panickar is known for his closeness to former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa.

An authority on Sanskrit language and literature, Panickar says the pandemic is the effect of the asymmetrical movement of Jupiter. “The calendar year is experiencing this disordered movement of Jupiter and that too three times during 2019 to 2020. It vaults from Scorpio to Sagittarius and then to Capricon. Moreover the coming together of Mars, Saturn and Jupiter is a dangerous sign, the result of which could be death and destruction,” he told The Pioneer.

Interestingly, The Pioneer was privy to a closed door meeting held by Panickar for a top government official in November 2019 when he told the latter that the country and the world was in for major disaster in months to come either due to war or epidemic. “This phase is known as Vasundhara Yogam , as per the Vedas. What is worrying is the fact that this phase has been aggravated by Kala Sarppa Yogam which also is an indicator of bad times,” he had said.

“Loke Bahu Vinasahakrith,”(World is in for destruction) Panickar had told the official who was facing a number of hardships.

Pandhappilli Gopala Menon, thanthrik scholar based in Kerala’s Kayamkulam, agreed with what Panickar told about the movement of Jupiter. “Jupiter is the divine planet which plays major role in our fortunes and misfortunes. It’s disorderly movement and that too three times in a single year has resulted in natural disasters , earthquakes and pandemics. Kings (rulers) are forced to face crisis after crisis because of this planetary movements,” said Menon.

He pointed out that the situation has arisen out of the misdeeds by people in higher places as well as their associates who engage in activities which do not synch well with Dharma mentioned in Vedas and Upanishads.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/astrologers-say-corona-result-of-jupiter-s-asymmetric-movement.html

100,25-3-20,Mumbai Police confiscates 2.5 mn masks worth Rs 15 cr,"In a major swoop, Mumbai Police have seized three truckloads of 2.50 million masks worth Rs 15 crore hoarded illegally and busted a four-member gang, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said here on Tuesday.

""The masks were being hoarded by the gang and were intended for sale in the black market. The seizure includes over 325,000 N-49 masks, plus others of different varieties,"" Deshmukh told mediapersons.

He said that at the height of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, Maharashtra is facing a massive shortage of all types of masks and this seizure is expected to ease the problems somewhat.

The seizure came after a tip-off received by Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh last week on a gang hoarding the heavy-demand masks for exorbitant prices.

Accordingly, a trap was set up by Senior Inspector of Police (Crime) Mahesh Desai who posed as a customer and finally managed to bust the gang by raiding locations in Mumbai and Thane.

While four persons have been arrested, the police are on the lookout for two absconders, said Deshmukh.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Akbar Pathan said the four accused were produced before a magistrate and remanded to police custody till March 27. Since one consignment was found near the Mumbai Airport Cargo Complex and another in a warehouse in Bhiwandi, Pathan said the investigations will focus on whether attempts were underway to export the masks to other seriously affected countries where they are in huge demand. It may be recalled that recently the Maharashtra Food & Drugs Administration had banned the sale of the N-49 masks without medical prescription after people resorted to panic buying leading to an artificial shortage.

So far, Maharashtra has recorded 107 COVID-19 positive cases besides four deaths including a 68-year-old Fillipino.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mumbai-police-confiscates-2-5-mn-masks-worth-rs-15-cr.html

We urge you to implement Janata Curfew for 14 more days to break the chain as 14 days is considered to be the maximum incubation period for this virus.”

He added that the microbiologists “are sure” that implementation of the Janata Curfew for continuous 14 days will control the outbreak and “succeed to bring the outbreak in reverse direction”.

Deshmukh also warned that the situation will be “unmanageable” by the last week of April if not taken seriously.

He asserted that the the one-day curfew helped a lot and now we need to extend it to 14 days. If we do, then India will not have a single new case. According to his calculations, he said, India will record 1,000 positive coronavirus cases by 30 March.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/take-corona-threat-seriously--warn-microbiologists.html

118,25-3-20,"Moody’s downgrades ONGC rating on uncertain oil prices, Govt guidelines on dividend","Moody’s Investors Service on Tuesday downgraded state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation’s (ONGC) rating in view of the uncertain oil price environment, depleting cash reserves of the government and government guidelines constraining its ability to lower dividends.

The rating agency downgraded ONGC’s local and foreign currency issuer ratings to Baa2 from Baa1. It also downgraded the ratings of the unsecured bonds issued by ONGC and those issued by its subsidiary ONGC Videsh Ltd.

The outlook on all ratings remains negative, it said. “Given the increasingly uncertain oil price environment, ONGC’s depleted cash reserves, and government guidelines that constrains state-owned enterprises’ ability to lower dividends, ONGC’s ratings are materially challenged at the previous rating level and its credit profile insufficient to remain above India’s Baa2 sovereign rating. The rating outlook is negative in line with the outlook on India’s sovereign rating,” said Vikas Halan, senior vice-president, Moody’s.

“Further, the downgrade reflects our expectation that ONGC’s credit metrics will weaken beyond the tolerance level for its ratings, if oil prices remain low for a prolonged period,” he said.

Against the backdrop of a significant deterioration in oil prices over the last month that is predicted to persist for most of 2020, ONGC decided to pay an interim dividend of Rs 5 per share last week, resulting in cash outflows of Rs 6,300 crore, which has reduced its cash reserves.

ONGC had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of Rs 6,700 crore as on September 30, 2019. “ONGC’s dividend policy is based on the guidelines issued by the Government of India in May 2016, which requires all government-owned companies to pay a minimum annual dividend equal to 5 per cent of their net worth even if they do not have sufficient profits,” Moody’s said. Despite depleted cash reserves, ONGC is expected to meet its debt repayment obligations given its access to capital as a state-owned company. “However, its lower cash reserves have diminished the company’s capacity to protect its credit profile from oil price shocks,” Halan said.

ONGC’s cash reserves, which provided protection against the oil price decline in 2016, have been depleting over the past three years because of high dividends, share buyback in 2019, and its acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) in 2018.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/moody---s-downgrades-ongc-rating-on-uncertain-oil-prices--govt-guidelines-on-dividend-2020-03-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/moody---s-downgrades-ongc-rating-on-uncertain-oil-prices--govt-guidelines-on-dividend.html

127,25-3-20,‘Unprecedented collapse’ for eurozone businesses,"Businesses in the eurozone suffered “an unprecedented collapse” in March because of the novel coronavirus pandemic, according to a closely watched indicator released on Tuesday by IHS Markit.

Provisional data showed the slump in activity in the 19-nation zone in March “far exceeding that seen even at the height of the global financial crisis,” with the company’s PMI survey diving to 31.4.

A reading below 50 points indicates a contraction. In February, the index had stood at 51.6. The latest reading for March is the lowest since IHS Markit started its PMI survey in 1998.

The indicator reflected a near-shutdown of eurozone economies as COVID-19 sweeps across Europe.

Major economies Italy, France, Germany and Spain are all deeply affected and have implemented severe social and business restrictions to try to slow the virus’s spread, by keeping potential carriers at home.

The eurozone’s economic struggle was worsened by some EU member states closing off their borders to neighbours, limiting the flow ofgoods and people within the single market. EU countries are starting to deploy massive state spending and loan guarantees to prop up businesses and employment, with the EU dropping its strict rules on budget deficits.

The IHS Markit survey showed the services sector was pummelled the worst, sliding to well below where it was at during the 2009 global financial crisis. Manufacturing was also hit, supply chains were being badly degraded, and there was “a record fall in export business as cross-border trade flows seized up”. Employees are being let go at the fastest rate since June 2009.

“Expectations of future output also deteriorated markedly to reach an all-time low, with record degrees of pessimism about the year ahead seen in both manufacturing and services,” IHS Markit said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/---unprecedented-collapse----for-eurozone-businesses.html

At a press conference on Tuesday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the government has waived charges on cash withdrawals from ATMs of other banks as a precursor to a broader stimulus package for the economy distressed by the coronavirus outbreak.

“Waiver of penalty, late fee and interest on GST will also help industry cope up with the huge cash crunch, and thus, tide through these tough times,” CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said. Deloitte India Partner MS Mani said the extension of GST return filing timelines together with the deferment of e-invoicing and new returns announced earlier would allow businesses to focus on resumption of business processes once normalcy resumes in future.

“These proactive steps are the need of the hour to mitigate some of the hardships that the businesses are going through,” said Sohinder Gill, director general, Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles. Suntuity Renewable Energy India Director (Operations) Imaan Javan said, “We express relief towards the finance minister’s move of extending the date of filing IT and GST returns from March 31, 2020, to June 30, 2020. The decision taken by the finance minister is a timely move considering that the economy is on its knees as of now” said .

Companies like Amazon Prime Video are also temporarily lowering bit rates — a measure of how much data is being transferred — to ease pressure on telecom network infrastructure.

Consumption of digital content has gone up manifold as people are forced to stay indoors as almost the entire country is under lockdown to contain the spread of the deadly COVID-19.

A Facebook spokesperson said, “To help alleviate any potential network congestion, we will temporarily reduce bit rates for videos on Facebook and Instagram in India”.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/netflix--facebook-to-reduce-bitrate-to-help-mitigate-network-congestion.html
131,25-3-20,"Deaths mount in US, Europe","Medical personnel help each other suit up at a federal COVID-19 drive-thru testing site.

As virus deaths mounted and Americans hoped for some economic relief Tuesday from their divided government, heath officials and leaders warned that the world was entering a critical period that would determine just how deeply the pandemic slices through their nations.

While Chinese authorities said they would finally end a two-month lockdown in hard-hit Hubei province where the coronavirus outbreak first began, nations in Europe, North America and elsewhere pressed harder to enforce the stay-at-home restrictions placed on 1.5 billion people worldwide.

Those measures could significantly impact the trajectory that the virus will take as it spreads across the world. World Health Organization warned that the outbreak is accelerating but said nations and individuals can all have an important impact.

We are not helpless bystanders, said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, noting that it took 67 days to reach 100,000 cases worldwide but just four days to go from 200,000 to 300,000.

We can change the trajectory of this pandemic. One viral social media video showed Italian mayors, sometimes profanely, berating their fellow citizens for not staying inside.

On Capitol Hill, a nearly $2 trillion plan that would prop up businesses and send checks to American households has stalled in Washington for days, but officials said they expect to reach a deal later Tuesday. Democrats have argued that it was tilted too much toward corporations rather than helping American workers and health care providers.

It appears that it will be soon that the U.S., which has more than 46,000 infections and 530 deaths, overtakes hard-hit Italy in the number of infections.

Authorities say the U.S. is on track to eventually overtake China’s nearly 82,000 infections and how soon that happens depends on how seriously Americans take the state-at-home restrictions.

In New York, now one of the world’s biggest virus hot spots, authorities rushed to set up the thousands of hospital beds they will need in just weeks to protect the city’s 8.4 million people. More than 12,000 people have tested positive in the city and 125 have died. A state-wide lockdown took effect Monday.

The mayor warned that the city’s hospitals are just 10 days away from shortages in basic supplies, while the state’s governor announced plans to convert a New York City convention center into a hospital.

This is going to get much worse before it gets better, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tighted all travel restrictions, demanding that people do not visit family members or friends and stick with only the people they live with.

Nearly 384,000 people worldwide have been infected and more than 16,500 have died from the virus, according to by Johns Hopkins University. In Italy, Spain and France, the pandemic is pushing national health systems to their breaking points.

The outbreak has killed more than 6,000 Italians, the highest death toll of any country. Officials said Monday the virus had claimed just over 600 more lives, down from 793 two days earlier, offering some glimmer of hope.

The risks remain for doctors, nurses and others on the front lines: Italy has seen at least 18 doctors with the coronavirus die. Spain says 12% of its cases more than 3,900 health care workers have become infected.

A Madrid ice rink is now being used as a makeshift morgue as the number of bodies of virus victims in the Spanish capital mounts.

Overwhelmed by a virus hotspot in its eastern city of Mulhouse France was getting help from hospitals in neighboring Germany and Switzerland.

Confusion rippled through Britain on the first morning after Johnson ordered a three-week halt to all nonessential activity.

The government has told most stores to close, banned gatherings of three or more people and said everyone apart from essential workers should leave home only to buy food and medicines or to exercise. But photos showed crowded trains Tuesday on some London subway lines.

I cannot say this more strongly: we must stop all non-essential use of public transport now,” London Mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted.

“Ignoring these rules means more lives lost. Asian stock markets reacted positively Tuesday, markets in Japan and South Korea posting significant gains after the Federal Reserve said it will lend to small and large businesses and local governments to help them through the crisis.

The move toward lockdowns has been influenced by the success of such measures in China, where the virus was first found late last year in the central city of Wuhan. China barred people from leaving or entering the city on Jan. 23, and soon expanded that to cover most of Hubei province, home to 70 million people.

On Tuesday, after more than a week in which China said the vast majority of new virus cases were imported from abroad, authorities said the restrictions in Hubei would end. People cleared by health authorities would be able to leave the province after midnight. Wuhan itself will remain locked down until April 8.

For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever or coughing. But for some older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Some 102,000 people have recovered, mostly in China.

In contrast to other European nations, German health authorities offered some hope that the country has flattened the exponential spread of the virus, which has already infected nearly 30,000.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/deaths-mount-in-us--europe.html
132,25-3-20,Russia to use mobile phones to track people at risk of coronavirus,"Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin on Monday gave the authorities five days to develop a system to track people who have come into contact with anyone with coronavirus by using mobile phone geolocation data.

Under the new system, people would be sent information if they came into contact with someone who was infected and the same information would be passed on to special regional headquarters set up to fight the respiratory disease pandemic.

The Kremlin said the measure was legal and part of a raft of measures Russia is taking to try to halt spread of the virus.

The measure will trace “citizens who are in contact with patients with new coronavirus infection on the basis of information from cellular operators about the geolocation of a cell phone of a particular person, which would allow citizens to be notified (over the phone) if they have been in contact with a person suffering from the new coronavirus, sending relevant messages to inform them of the need for self-isolation...” the communications ministry said in a statement.

Russia closes its borders to foreigners amid the coronavirus outbreak. President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday said the coronavirus situation was “under control” in Russia and outbreaks of infection had been contained.

Russia, which has a temporary ban on the entry of foreigners in place, has 438 confirmed cases of coronavirus so far and one virus-related death - less than many European countries.

On Monday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin told residents of the Russian capital over the age of 65 and those with chronic illnesses to remain at home. Russia is gradually tightening quarantine rules and readying its healthcare system for more cases. Sobyanin told the elderly and other vulnerable residents to only make trips to pharmacies and shops if absolutely necessary from Thursday until April 14.

Where possible, he also advised the elderly to leave the city and stay at their dachas - out-of-town cottages on private plots of land which many Russian families traditionally own.

134,25-3-20,Can blood from coronavirus survivors treat newly ill?,"Hospitals are gearing up to test if a century-old treatment used to fight off flu and measles outbreaks in the days before vaccines, and tried more recently against SARS and Ebola, just might work for COVID-19, too: using blood donated from patients who’ve recovered.

Doctors in China attempted the first COVID-19 treatments using what the history books call “convalescent serum” -- today, known as donated plasma -- from survivors of the new virus.

Now a network of U.S. hospitals is waiting on permission from the Food and Drug Administration begin large studies of the infusions both as a possible treatment for the sick and as vaccine-like temporary protection for people at high risk of infection.

There’s no guarantee it will work.

“We won’t know until we do it, but the historical evidence is encouraging,” Dr. Arturo Casadevall of Johns Hopkins University’s school of public health told The Associated Press.

Casadevall drew on that history in filing the FDA application. The FDA is “working expeditiously to facilitate the development and availability of convalescent plasma” a spokesman said.

Here are some questions and answers about this latest quest for a treatment.

WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS POSSIBLE THERAPY?

It may sound like “back to the Stone Age,” but there’s good scientific reason to try using survivors’ blood, said Dr. Jeffrey Henderson of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, who coauthored the FDA application with Casadevall and another colleague at the Mayo Clinic. When a person gets infected by a particular germ, the body starts making specially designed proteins called antibodies to fight the infection. After the person recovers, those antibodies float in survivors’ blood -- specifically plasma, the liquid part of blood — for months, even years.

One of the planned studies would test if giving infusions of survivors’ antibody-rich plasma to newly ill COVID-19 patients would boost their own body’s attempts to fight off the virus. To see if it works, researchers would measure if the treatment gave patients a better chance of living or reduced the need for breathing machines.

One caution: While regular plasma transfusions are a mainstay of medicine, very rarely they can cause a lung-damaging side effect.

COULD IT ALSO ACT LIKE A VACCINE?

Sort of, but unlike a vaccine, any protection would only be temporary. A vaccine trains people’s immune systems to make their own antibodies against a target germ. The plasma infusion approach would give people a temporary shot of someone else’s antibodies that are short-lived and require repeated doses.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/can-blood-from-coronavirus-survivors-treat-newly-ill-.html
135,25-3-20,Fill skill gap,"Lack of job-readiness remains a major concern for a large number of graduates.Dr BK Panigrahy tells you how institutes can tackle this and make students job-ready

According to different estimates, India produces around 15 lakh engineers every year and three lakh management graduates. However, an important question here is whether all of them are employable? Do degree holders also bring with them the skills needed on the job? The answer unfortunately is in the negative!

India’s industry leaders and corporate houses have long been complaining of the gap between market demand and student academic knowledge. Lack of job-readiness remains a major concern for a large number of graduates and organisations underscore that they have to invest considerable time and money in equipping the fresh hires with the requisite training to be able to join the workforce effectively. Most engineering students in India have mainframe knowledge but lack job specific skills. This statement was confirmed when a machine learning based assessment of software development skills was conducted for over 36,000 engineering students. The recently concluded aspiring minds study found out that there is a massive skill gap when it comes to job specific requirements with employability for electronic engineers 7.07 per cent, designer engineer’s 5.55 per cent, civil engineers’ 6.48 per cent and for chemical design engineer’s 1.64 per cent.

Theoretical knowledge of the domain, through absolutely critical, is not sufficient to make engineering graduates job ready. This is why apart from domain-based education, educational institutions must also modify their curriculum patterns to serve the objectives of giving practical knowledge, skill training and personality development.

Personality Development and communication skills

No matter how good an engineer you are, you also need to be a congenial personality to be able to work in a team. Interpersonal skills and the art of communicating effectively are very important skills particularly for people whose work requires people handling. Personality development and communication skills programmes will assist people in realising their true potential as well as instill in them some significant interpersonal skills. Colleges must focus on inculcating traits like positive attitude, right body language, power dressing, importance of commitment and choosing the correct words while communicating — both written and verbal.

Industry internship programmes

Prior industrial experience and exposure to practical training are the most critical elements that make an individual job-ready. This is why it is very important to ensure that students undergo several internship programmes during the course of their education.

Closer industry-academia ties

For educational institutions to be able to train students in what is exactly needed on the job, they must have a close understanding of the same. This is why it is extremely important for educational institutions to develop closer ties with the industry. This must be done through regular visits and mentorship programs with industry leaders. At the same time, industry members must also be taken on board while deciding the curriculum of courses and modifications needed in it.

Foreign language courses

Engineering is a thriving industry which employees around 10-15 million people across the globe which means engineers from one part of the world may at some point or another work with those of a different country which is why a foreign language course will come in handy especially when they have to work together. From automotive, aerospace, construction to civil, chemical and IT engineers play a key role in many sectors which is why colleges and universities must offer foreign league courses to engineering students as it helps them adapt well to challenges and make them a global entity.

Flexible curriculum

Future engineers need to be more than just technically competent as they must be able to refresh their skills continually to remain relevant in an ever-changing world. Introduction of provisions for additional courses, electives and micro specialisation will help students gain the upper hand in job interviews as well pursue other topics of interest study of which can come in handy if the need to utilise the specific knowledge arises.

137,25-3-20,E-learning way forward,"Implementing e-learning plans including digital and distance learning will ensure the continuity of education among children at a critical juncture in their student journey, says Narendra Shyamsukha

Coronavirus has affected approximately 119 countries in the world claiming the lives of more than 13,000 people and currently infecting around 48,000 patients. This has led to massive preventions and containment drives by Governments and world health bodies across the globe to stop this disease from causing any further havoc. Some countries like China and Italy where the disease has caused more damage than others have enforced complete lockdown whereas other countries are increasing its awareness about its symptoms as well as telling people to take early diagnosis as when detected early in patients it has better chances of being effectively treated.

Some education institutes and other professional places have shut down to prevent the number of cases from rising as well as offered employees to work from home in order to limit contact. Students are the future of the world which is why education institutions should take safety precautions to fight against this global epidemic and protect children successfully.

Disseminate critical information

With the help of collaboration and coordination with State and local health departments schools and colleges can disseminate critical information about the disease and how it is transmitted. They must also promote everyday disease prevention strategies like if you are sick stay at home, avoid close contact with those who are really sick, quality checking of food, cover nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing with a tissue or the crook of your arm, wash hands with soap and water as well as avoid touching nose, eyes and mouth.

Temporary suspension of foreign exchange programmes

Many universities across the world have suspended their foreign exchange programmes for the health the safety of all students. Study trips have also been rescheduled with many universities and schools switching to online teachings in place of classroom sessions. Graduation ceremonies have also been postponed for students who finished their academic studies as well as diplomas. Implementing e-learning plans including digital and distance learning will ensure the continuity of education especially among children who are at a critical juncture in their student journey. However, the biggest challenge here is to impart education to students who don't have a computer or laptop at home. This problem can be solved by asking their parents to educate them and sending them the lessons by mail or post. Moreover, the schools which are still open have ensured that there are no group events or extracurricular activities, school assemblies, pep rallies, field trips as well as sporting events.

Regular health sessions

According to a child care specialist children are important drivers of influenza infections because they have more interactions with people than adults and give off more of the viruses. Sessions on how to self isolate yourself if there’s a chance you could have coronavirus are also important and helpful for students who have been diagnosed with the disease or have a family member who is a patient.

Coronavirus self isolation advice urges patients to stay at home and not go to work, avoid using public transport like trains, buses as well as taxis, ask family and friends to do errands for you and avoid having any visitors. These classes will help allay the fear of being shunned by others as they will understand that for their own safety and that of others this treatment in isolation is the correct way.

138,25-3-20,Numbers speak,"The person with the 19 number karmic debt will learn independence and the proper use of power. He will be forced to stand up for himself, and often be left to stand alone, difficulties will be faced and overcome through personal struggle.

One of the central lesson for people with the 19 karmic debt is that you stubbornly resist help. The 19 karmic debt can become a self-imposed prison if you do not open up to the reality or interdependence and the mutual need for love.

It is developed from the abuse of power in a past life-acting in a completely self-centered manner, blind to everything except a selfish fulfillment of one’s own desires, don’t want to listen to others, don’t accept the help or advice of others. The subject may be completely immersed in his own concerns and may have great difficulty becoming aware of others’ needs.

In this life, the subject will continue to meet with substantial difficulties unless he can look past his own needs to the needs of others, or he can work toward independence no matter what forces are tending to keep him weak and dependent. Awareness of the karmic debt will produce clarity about one’s own needs, others’ needs and the relation between them. If, instead, the subject continues to be egotistical, dominating and aggressive, or lazy, fearful and servile, the problems will be magnified.

The most important lesson for the 19 karmic debt is: while you seek to stand on your own feet, you are still a human being deeply connected with others, and in need of the support, assistance, and human understanding that all people need. Those with 19 karmic debt will learn the hard way that ‘no man is an island’, and that we are indeed, ‘all bits of the main’.

Johnson on Monday enforced the strictest curbs on movement of people for at least three weeks as the death toll from COVID-19 in the country rose to 335.

In a televised address to the nation, Johnson issued the central message of: “you must stay home” and gave police powers to enforce the order. However, there are concerns around the clarity of the message and police forces around the country said they had been inundated with calls asking what was still allowed.

Transport Secretary Gant Shapps in a tweet on Monday advised people to stay at home if possible.

“Concerning to see images of packed trains this a.M. The advice is clear: STAY HOME if possible. That is the way to SAVE LIVES,” he said. “We are working with train operators to introduce a small number of trains for KEY WORKERS to have space to be safe,” he added.

The German higher education is one of the best in the world. Whether it's cars or education, people everywhere recognise Made in Germany as a seal of quality. One can benefit from Germany's long and famous university tradition especially in the fields of engineering and science. A German university degree is highly respected by employers around the world.

The country’s higher education system has something for everyone. There are almost 450 State-accredited universities with some 15,000 degree programmes in Germany. The universities offer degree programmes in every possible subject and academic level.

Around 12 per cent of students at German universities come from foreign countries. One can make friends from around the world, become acquainted with different countries and expand horizons.

Germany due to its aging population is in huge need of young work force. More than 35% of their population is above 55 years. Going to Germany at a young age, getting familiar with their culture and language makes one the most deserving candidate. Germany in general is in need of fice lakh engineers and IT professionals.

The wages being offered are unmatched to India. As a fresh engineering graduate an individual gets nothing less than Rs 2.5 lakh per (month approximately) and as a post graduate you can earn at least Rs 3 lakh per month.

German student visa is Schengen Visa hence allowing you access to the 26 Schengen or EU countries. Thus providing an opportunity to explore the entire European culture while studying and adding a new dimension in ones personality. The visa also allows working for 20 hours per week as a par time job when pursuing the degree programme.

You are permitted to work for 120 full days or 240 half days in a year.

This visa also allows multiple entry and exits in Germany. Once the study programme gets over irrespective of the university, course and location the student is allowed to get a 1.5 years of job seeking visa. Three-year of full-time job makes the student eligible for a Permanent residency as well.

Life comes first, sport can wait. This was the collective view of India’s top Olympic-bound athletes, including stalwarts such as M C Mary Kom and Saina Nehwal, as they lauded the Tokyo Games’ postponement.

“The situation right now is not good. Life always comes first, everything else can wait. Players’ safety is paramount. I think it’s (postponement) good for everyone. Now I get more time to prepare, our training plans can be extended. And it’s not just for me, it is true for everyone around the world.”

“Happy that it’s postponed even though some of us haven’t qualified. We are eager to know what the qualification (process) would be like going ahead. As an athlete who’s played Olympics before I would say it’s good as everyone can chill now and not worry about preparations amid a lockdown. We all have to be safe first and then we can think about preparations.”

“It’s a good decision because everyone is disturbed. Athletes’ health is paramount. No one is training properly. It’s not just about India, it’s also about the entire world. We first have to save people from this epidemic.”

“Whatever happens, happens for a good reason. Now we have more time to prepare. It’s good for my performance. I will continue training.”

“...Since training had stopped, we would have needed another three-four months time to prepare. So, we wanted postponement. Now we can refresh ourselves and restart the competitions (training).”

“We were prepared for this year’s Olympics. We were ready but what do you do when something like this happens. It’s beyond everyone’s control. We will again prepare for 2021. I would have fought well this year also, but now I have more time to toughen up.”

“At the moment it’s the right decision to take. It’s sad but at the moment it is a sensible decision to take...There’s disappointment obviously but well things are not really in your hand.”

“It is very disappointing that the Olympics will not go ahead in 2020, but given the unprecedented circumstances facing the world at present it is totally understandable and expected.”

“I just had a meeting with the team and broke this news to the group. Though it is disappointing, the girls told me, ‘It’s ok, Coach. We will continue to work the way we are and this probably gives us more time to prepare for the Olympic Games & be our best.”

“...It was really required as no athlete is able to train all over the world...It’s good that the Olympic is postponed and now we have proper time to train and prepare and plan.”

151,25-3-20,Japan put brakes on torch relay,"Japan postponed the Olympic torch relay on Tuesday after the Tokyo 2020 Games were delayed for a year, extending what has already been a troubled journey for the ceremonial flame.

The torch, lit earlier this month in Greece, had been due to start its nationwide tour on Thursday from Fukushima, an area devastated by the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown.

“The Olympic torch relay, which was scheduled to start from 26th (March), will not start,” Tokyo 2020 president Yoshiro Mori told reporters.

Mori said the flame will remain in Fukushima for now, but it was not clear how long it will stay there.

COVID-19 has overshadowed the flame’s progress after the elaborate lighting ceremony in ancient Olympia proceeded without spectators, to avoid spreading the disease.

The Greek leg of the torch relay was then scrapped when large crowds mobbed Hollywood actor Gerard Butler as he lit a cauldron in the city of Sparta.

The flame arrived to a muted welcome in northern Japan in front of a few dozen officials and guests, after plans to invite 200 schoolchildren were abandoned.

It has been on display in Japan and attracted large crowds, despite calls from organisers to avoid mass gatherings because of the virus.

Mori said he recognised the decision to postpone the Games would be “very disappointing” for athletes.

“I am sorry about that,” he said. “I also know that athletes have strong spirits able to overcome difficulty. I hope that they will do their best.”

He said the Games had been postponed for a year rather than a shorter period because there was no certainty on when the pandemic would be over.

“There are many opinions, and there is no agreement. Will it end in three to four months?” he said.

“Unless the coronavirus (pandemic) ends, we won’t be able to even start the torch relay,” he added.

“This year is off the table.”

Organised under the slogan ‘Hope Lights Our Way,’ the torch relay was considered a key part of the bid to showcase recovery in parts of northeastern Japan that were devastated by the 2011 disaster.

Mori pointed to his own health problems — he was diagnosed with cancer — as proof that difficulties can be surmounted.

“We have no choice but to have hope. I myself suffered cancer... But I was saved by a new drug. I am here, allowed to live.

“Let us hope for these things.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/japan-put-brakes-on-torch-relay.html

Bach says the exact dates is a question for the Tokyo organizing committee and an International Olympic Committee panel overseeing the preparations.

He said “alarming figures” in the past few days about the coronavirus were key to deciding the Tokyo Olympics must be postponed.

Bach cites the World Health Organization “saying in the last couple of hours that Africa has to prepare for the worst.”

The IOC has been advised by the WHO, which said Monday the pandemic is accelerating.

157,25-3-20,Be grounded,"Students are required to have knowledge, skills and competencies in agriculture and technology, says Dr Rana Singh

Agriculture has a growing scope in India as India has been an agro-based economy. Agriculture is the prime source of generating food for living beings. The growing population has increased the demand for food and the increasing population is going on occupying more and more land and the land for cultivation of crops is going on decreasing.

The demand for food grains is going on increasing and the land for cultivation of crops is going on decreasing; such a situation deserves the emergence and development of agriculture technology to maximise food productivity to cater to the growing demand of increasing population in India and abroad. The technology in the domain of agriculture needs to be enhanced and hence more people will be required who would have the knowledge, skills and competencies in the converged the domain of agriculture technology.

The agricultural production in India is more or less consistent and is not increasing significantly in the absence of some breakthrough technological innovation in the domain of agriculture. In situations of unpredictable monsoon, it is imperative on the part of agriculture professionals to evolve and develop the latest technologies to maximize agricultural yield and productivity. This gives a big opportunity to further maximize per acre productivity so as to maximize the overall revenue with the farmers.

The 7.73 billion global populations today is inching towards 8 billion. The Indian population of 138 crores is inching towards 150 crores at a very fast pace. The increasing population of India and the rest of the world is increasing the pressure of demand for food which in turn is mounting up the pressure for increasing the agricultural output.

Agriculture in India contributes to around 14 per cent of the GDP but it involves the employment of around 42 per cent of the Indian population. The agriculture sector witnessed super normal productivity due to better monsoon which ultimately led to lower prices to the farmers for many agricultural products.

If one can pursue a career in agriculture sector there are certain traits are required.

Skills

The students are required to have optimum knowledge, skills and competencies in the domain of agriculture, technology and allied areas. They should have a strong passion in the field of agriculture and allied technologies.

The students are required to have an optimal blending of domain knowledge as well as knowledge about the emerging technologies in the domain. A qualification from an institute of repute is not just an option but has become mandatory to enable one to penetrate the Agriculture sector. Technology skills and engineering skills optimally integrated with the domain knowledge of agriculture would be an added advantage.

Scope

The job opportunities in the domain of agriculture technology will also, increase with the increase in the rate of growth of population in India and abroad. There are a plethora of career options to choose from.

Agriculture Scientist, Agriculture Equipment Manufacturer, Agricultural Equipment Maintenance Manager, Agriculture Portal Developer, Agriculture Software Developer, Agricultural App Developer, Plant Protection and Quarantine Manager, Agricultural Pesticides Manufacturing Manager, Agriculture Research and Development Manager, Agricultural Product Marketing Manager, Agricultural Supply Chain Manager, Agricultural Equipment Maintenance Manager, Agricultural Products & Services Manager, Agricultural Product Patenting Manager, Agricultural Software Services Manager, Agriculture Technology Research Manager, Agriculture Manager, Agriculture Technological Products E-Commerce Portal Developer, Agriculture Technology Development Manager, Agriculture Technology Accelerator / Centre Manager, Agriculture Technology Incubation Centre Manager, Agriculture Technology Commercialization Centre Manager, Agriculture Equipment Designer, Agriculture Equipment Electrical Services Manager and various other allied positions.

158,25-3-20,‘Doors opening for allied healthcare workers’,"The country’s healthcare sector is on a growth trajectory offering plenty of lucrative options in radiography, says ARUNA SINGH

Have you ever noticed people in hospital gowns who escort patients for an X-Ray CT-Scan or chemotherapy? They are the one who operate the machine for you and later interpret the results for doctors. The word used for them are radiographers. They are equipped with the technological skills to handle imaging equipment and the interpersonal skills necessary for patient care. Educational and licensure requirements vary by state and profession, though completion of a certificate or two-year degree programme is common for radiologic technologists. Today, India’s healthcare sector on a growth trajectory, the career opportunities for such allied healthcare workers with expertise in diagnostic science have never been better. Services of diagnostic professionals can be essential for medical treatments and their demand is on the rise.

Nature of work: Radiologic technologists perform medical imaging exams and administer radiation therapy treatments. With the help of various imaging technologies, these professionals take pictures of a patient’s body for radiologists, who will then interpret the images. Radiologic technologists often specialise in a particular exam technique, such as mammography or bone densitometry. These professionals can also assist oncology teams in delivering radiation therapy to cancer patients. The technicians work in hospitals, clinics, imaging centers, private physician offices or even mobile imaging service centres.

Opportunity: You could specialise in dozens of clinical areas ranging from prenatal care to orthopedics. You could manage an entire radiology department, including its budget and personnel. You could teach, inspiring new generations of radiologic technologists, or you could perform research that leads to breakthroughs in diagnostic imaging or radiation therapy. With additional education, you could become a radiologist assistant, expanding your capabilities by serving as a radiologist extender. The boundaries of your career in radiologic technology are determined only by your own abilities and interests.

Skills: Good communication skills, a focus on detail, and careful attention to procedure are essential to success as a radiology technician. Physical strength is needed to position patients, and at times, to lift them onto examination table. As with health care professionals in general, empathy, cultural sensitivity, and high ethical standards are necessary as well.

Eligibility: The curriculum for radiologic technology and related programmes includes coursework as well as a series of supervised clinical exercises where students learn how to position patients and perform procedures. A background check, immunisations, and a physical examination may be required prior to entering these programmes. Applicants can pursue certificate courses, diploma courses, as well as bachelor’s course in the field of radiology. Duration of the diploma course is one-year and two-year, eligibility is 10+2 preferably with Physics, Chemistry and Biology/Math or equivalent in any stream from a recognised Board or university.

Remuneration: The average starting salary ranges between Rs 7,000-Rs 10, 000 per month in Government/private hospitals. However, earnings are more in private practice as compared to salaried jobs. A large aging population in need of imaging to diagnose and treat medical conditions should keep demand strong for radiologic technologists. The Bureau of Labour Statistics predicts employment growth of about nine per cent between 2014-2024 for this profession, and 17,200 new positions will need to be filled.

Opportunities are also there in Middle-eastern countries. In these countries radiographers get salaries between Rs 30,000-Rs 50,000 per month. In the UK, the average starting salary of a newly qualified radiographer is around £17,000 per year which is much more than what it is in India.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---doors-opening-for-allied-healthcare-workers----2020-03-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/---doors-opening-for-allied-healthcare-workers---.html
159,25-3-20,mindIT,"We are living in a time where there is no dearth of disposable income amongst middle class Indians; the pleasure-seeking principle has modified the lens through which an individual explores the possibilities open to him. There is an explosion in the demand for hedonistic attributes of products and services associated with essential necessities.

The mushrooming of SMEs (small and medium scale enterprises) brought on by an increasing trend towards entrepreneurship, has led to a greater demand for graphic and communication designers to design their web pages and develop out-of-the-box communication design strategies for their promotional content on social media.

A growing demand for designers: Hence, there is a growing demand for designers in almost all major disciplines of design — spatial design, architecture, communication design, graphic designing and fashion designing. Having a flair for design is an essential attribute but it needs to be backed by a sound technical education in that particular discipline. You need to have a conceptual understanding of the dictums of that pedagogy, along with a study of what has worked in the past, what has not, and knowledge of evolving global and local trends.

A qualification from an institute of repute is not just an option but has become mandatory to enable one to penetrate the design community. Immersing oneself for a few years through the rigours of a design college, delivering outcomes under the pressure of project deadlines and working in teams, imparts the requisite skill-set and training for entering the design ecosystem.

During the tenure of your studies, you will get several opportunities to volunteer and participate in seminars, lectures, workshops, events and master classes. Never forfeit these opportunities to network with industry professionals. You can leverage them to your advantage by making contacts with professionals to procure projects and find mentorship.

Freelance projects: After you have understood the fundamentals of design in the first year and assessed your own designing sensibilities, you will be able to take on freelancing projects by the time you enter second year. These will help build your portfolio and be a point of connect with the design industry before you get absorbed finally.

Internships: An opportunity to intern with a good design studio can lay the brickwork towards a rewarding career. Ensure that you add significantly to your design portfolio during your internship. Displaying your talents and dedication to your internship project can result in the much coveted offer from the company, after you graduate.

Academia: All those of you who are passionate about teaching, can enter the world of academia by gaining an in-depth industry exposure of 6 to 10 years as a professional or as an entrepreneur. After having worked for a decade or so, you will come to understand the nuts and bolts of the industry and its workings.

Getting the required exposure: There are many design exhibitions and art fairs held in the various metropolises of India, each year. India Art Fair (IAF) is conducted in Delhi each year; it features both veterans and upcoming artists. Amazon India Fashion Week (AIFW) is another exhibition where upcoming fashion designers and established players participate each year. India Interior Retailing - Conference, Awards and Exhibition is another exciting event, usually held in October in Delhi. The UXINDIA was held at Hyderabad in 2019. That was a great platform where graphic and communication designers of India and the world had converged to discuss new ideas and trends. Try to optimise the opportunities that present themselves to you and attend as many events as possible. Such kind of exposure will stretch your imagination beyond the confines of the college walls and enable you to come up with ingenious yet commercially viable ideas.

161,25-3-20,IPL cancellation on cards after three-week lockdown,"The BCCI will be under tremendous pressure as cancellation of Indian Premier League looks inevitable after Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared a 21-day lockdown to tackle COVID-19 pandemic.

When the BCCI had postponed the IPL to April 15 earlier this month, it had said hosting the tournament would only come into the picture if the situation around the pandemic improves. However, it has only worsened since then with cases surging towards the 500-mark in India.

Speaking to PTI, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly did not have much to say considering the grim scenario.

“I can’t say anything at the moment. We are at the same place where we were on the day we postponed. Nothing has changed in the last 10 days. So, I don’t have an answer to it. Status quo remains,” Ganguly’s helplessness was palpable.

Kings XI Punjab owner Ness Wadia was more forthright.

“The BCCI should really consider postponing the IPL now. As a premier event, we need to act with great responsibility. Contemplation of IPL is inhumane right now,” KXIP co-owner Wadia said.

“Lets say even if the situation improves by May and I hope it does, who is going to come and play? Will the (foreign players) be even allowed to enter the country?” he asked.

Earlier on Tuesday, the concall of BCCI offficials and team owners was postponed as the COVID-19 cases continue to rise in the country and around the world.

The star-studded eight-team league was originally scheduled to start on March 29 in Mumbai. It seems the BCCI is deferring the announcement hoping against hope for things to improve.

“If Olympics can be postponed by a year, IPL is a much smaller entity in that regard. It is becoming increasingly difficult to organise. At this point the government is not even thinking about allowing foreign visas,” a BCCI official in know of things said.

Currently, each stakeholder is discussing ways to limit the financial damage with insurance companies as well as broadcasters.

“With 21 day lockdown, it is virtually impossible that things will return to normalcy by April 14. It might improve but a lot of restrictions will be in place. So it will be foolish not to cancel the league,” a BCCI veteran said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ipl-cancellation-on-cards-after-three-week-lockdown.html

FIFA said it is also exploring ""alternative solutions"".

The coronavirus outbreak has so far claimed lives of over 20,000 people across the world while infecting more than 425000.

In India, the pandemic has affected over 600 people besides 10 deaths.

""FIFA is currently monitoring developments regarding the coronavirus outbreak in India to decide the future of the U-17 Women's World Cup which is slated to be held in the country in November,"" the apex body said in a statement after PTI inquired.

Sixteen teams will take part in the World Cup, of which only three have sealed their berths.

Mufti, Naeem Akhtar, Ali Mohammad Sagar, Peer Mansoor and Shah Faesal are some of the known faces who continue to be detained under the Public Safety Act, which was slapped on them during their preventive detention in the wake of the revocation of the erstwhile state's special status under Article 370 in August last year.

168,25-3-20,"Jaan hai to Jahan hai, stay indoors: PM","PM declares 21-day pan-India lockdown to defeat corona

Forget about leaving home for the next 21 days,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Tuesday night, adding, “If you cross the Lakshman Rekha, you will invite the virus home.”

In his second address to the nation within a week, the PM said the country will be under a complete three-week lockdown from Tuesday midnight to fight the spread of coronavirus. “This lockdown will be strictly imposed in every village and every lane. According to health experts, 21 days are necessary to break the cycle of coronavirus. If these 21 days are not observed as a lockdown, it will take us back 21 years,” the PM said.

The essential services that were functional on March 22 during the Janata Curfew will remain operational even during the complete nationwide lockdown announced by the PM on Tuesday. This includes grocery stores, among other facilities.

“From midnight, the entire country will be in lockdown, total lockdown. To save India, to save its every citizen, you, your family... every street, every neighbourhood is being put under lockdown... 21 days’ lockdown may seem to be a long time, but this is the only way to ensure everyone is safe. If we don’t handle these 21 days well, then our country, your family will go backwards by 21 years,” the PM said, folding his hands.

Referring to efforts made by the world to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, Modi said that the precaution of social distancing is a tried and tested way of succeeding in curbing the pandemic. “There is a misconception that social distancing is only for those who are sick. Social distancing is for everyone, even the Prime Minister! Some people are spreading false information, which will affect every single citizen of the country. And if all citizens are affected, the negative effects are unimaginable,” he said.

The Centre and States are working to ensure that essential supplies are not disrupted, he said, adding that his Government had set aside Rs 15,000 crore to strengthen the health infrastructure to tackle coronavirus. Asserting that India was at a critical stage in its battle against coronavrius, Modi said even a single mistake could see the deadly virus spreading like wildfire. “Some think social distancing is only for patients. That’s not correct. Social distancing is the only way to fight the virus. It is for every citizen, every family, every member, even for the Prime Minister.”

“Experts say if a person is infected today, it takes many days for them to display symptoms, and they unknowingly infect all who come in contact with them in this period. A single infected person can infect hundreds in weeks, it spreads like fire,” the Prime Minister said. Referring to a WHO report, he pointed out that COVID-19 took 67 days to spread to one lakh people.

To reach two lakh people, it took 11 days. But it took only four days to reach another lakh, taking the total spread to three lakhs. Today’s action would decide how much India could stop the spread of the pandemic, Modi said, and shared a social media post.

“Those who are inside their homes are informing people with the new innovative ideas. I am sharing the banner which I liked. Corona means ‘koi road par na nikle’,” the PM said.

In the backdrop of reports of harassment of doctors and Air India staff by people under the impression that they could spread the disease, Modi appealed for compassion towards those engaged in serving the people during this critical time. Modi said that every citizen should be compassionate and grateful for those in essential services like doctors and nurses and police, and even the media and hygiene workers who are sanitising public areas. Making a strong pitch for social distancing, Modi said, “People in countries like America have adhered to the quarantine guidelines laid down by the Government to the last letter, which is how they are starting to overcome the disease now. Social distancing - from the Prime Minister down to the last citizen in every village, has to follow self-isolation.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/jaan-hai-to-jahan-hai--stay-indoors--pm-2020-03-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/jaan-hai-to-jahan-hai--stay-indoors--pm.html

170,25-3-20,"Napoli, Lazio backtrack on return to training","Italian clubs Napoli and Lazio have both postponed their planned return to training this week due to the coronavirus pandemic which has killed over 6,000 people in Italy.

Italian football has been on hold since March 9 because of the COVID-19 outbreak which has become the Mediterranean nation’s biggest disaster since World War II.

But some clubs had been thinking of resuming training behind closed doors.

“SSC Napoli announces that sports activities are suspended until a date to be decided,” the southerners said in a statement.

“The resumption of training sessions will be established in relation to the evolution of the health emergency regarding the spread of Covid 19.”

Napoli are sixth in Serie A and last trained on March 12, before their Champions League last-16 second leg against Barcelona was postponed.

They had been planning to return to training on Wednesday.

The south of Italy has not been as badly hit by the virus as the epicentre in northern Lombardy.

League rivals Lazio and Cagliari also pushed back the date for a return to training.

Capital club Lazio — just a point behind champions and Serie A leaders Juventus — have had said they wanted to start training as early as Monday, as had Sardinian outfit Cagliari.

171,25-3-20,Bundesliga clubs take pay cut,"Footballers at Germany’s top teams including Bayern Munich have agreed to take pay cuts to help clubs survive the economic impact of the coronavirus, media reports said on Tuesday.

Newspaper Bild reports that players and club officials at champions Bayern have accepted a 20 percent cut in their salaries.

Like all top European leagues the German top flight is losing income from broadcasting, sponsorships and ticket sales during the COVID-19 pandemic, with matches in Germany suspended until at least April 2.

Bayern has a massive wage bill which reached 336 million euros (364 million dollars) last year, almost half of club turnover.

Players at Borussia Moenchengladbach were the first in the Bundesliga to propose a pay cut, followed by others at Werder Bremen and Schalke 04.

172,25-3-20,2020 Tokyo Olympics postponed,"The 2020 Tokyo Olympics have been postponed to no later than the summer of 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe, the International Olympic Committee announced on Tuesday.

The Games were scheduled for July 24-August 9, but after telephone discussions between IOC president Thomas Bach and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a historic joint decision was taken to delay the Olympics — the first time that has been done in peacetime.

Abe said Bach was in “100 percent agreement” when Japan asked the IOC to push back the Games.

In a joint statement, the pair said that based on current World Health Organization information, the Tokyo Games “must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community”.

“The leaders agreed that the Olympic Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times and that the Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present.

“Therefore, it was agreed that the Olympic flame will stay in Japan. It was also agreed that the Games will keep the name Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020,” the statement concluded.

The Olympics, which has experienced boycotts, terrorist attacks and protests, but has been held every four years since 1948, is the highest-profile event affected by the virus that has killed thousands and closed sports competitions worldwide.

Bach said the decision to postpone was “about protecting human life”.

Crowded calendar

Squeezing in the 16-day Games into what will already be a hugely crowded 2021 calendar is another major headache, with arguably the two biggest sports, swimming and athletics, due to hold their world championships that summer.

However, World Athletics has already said it was prepared to shift its world championships, scheduled for August 6-15 next year in Eugene, Oregon, to accommodate a rescheduled Games.

“World Athletics welcomes the decision of the IOC and the Japanese Government to postpone the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games to 2021,” track and field’s global governing body said.

“It is what athletes want and we believe this decision will give all athletes, technical officials and volunteers some respite and certainty in these unprecedented and uncertain times.”

British sprinter Dina Asher-Smith, the world 200m champion, posted on Instagram: “#Tokyo2021, Same fire, new dates. Stay at home and stay safe everyone xxx.”

The international federation of the number two Olympic sport, swimming, added that it would also work with local organisers “in order to determine flexibility” for their scheduled July 16-August 1, 2021 world championships in the Japanese city of Fukuoka.

World football’s governing body FIFA said it “firmly believes that the health and well-being of all individuals involved in sporting activities should always be the highest priority, and as such we welcome today’s IOC decision”.

Devastating for Tokyo

The decision to postpone will be a devastating blow for the city of Tokyo, which had won widespread praise for its organisation, with venues finished well ahead of time and tickets massively oversubscribed.

British Olympic Association chairman Hugh Robertson said it was “heartbreaking news for our many friends in Japan who have done superbly well to prepare for what I know will be an outstanding Games”.

“However, the IOC had no option under the present circumstances but to reach the decision they did.”

The IOC came under increasing pressure in recent days to postpone the Games, with 1.7 billion people across the planet in lockdown to prevent the further spread of COVID-19.

Training has become impossible for many athletes and exposes them to the risk of contracting or spreading the disease. Competitions and qualifying events have been scrapped, while international travel is severely limited.

On Sunday, the IOC had initially given itself a deadline of four weeks to come up with a proposal to postpone the Games, a Herculean task that touches on every aspect of Tokyo 2020 planning from venues to security to ticketing.

But after Canada and Australia withdrew their teams and the powerful US Olympic Committee and World Athletics also joined the chorus calling for a postponement, the writing was on the wall.

Tokyo was spending some $12.6 billion to host the Games, according to its latest budget, and experts believe a postponement could cost it some $6 billion in the short-term before recouping it when they eventually go ahead.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/2020-tokyo-olympics-postponed-2020-03-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/2020-tokyo-olympics-postponed.html

""We look forward to outstanding Olympic Games in Tokyo next year!""

On Tuesday, the IOC and the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee said in a joint statement that the committee's president Thomas Bach and Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed that the Games have to be ""rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021.""

This thus makes it the first Olympics to be postponed with the Games being cancelled previously in 1916 due to the First World War and 1940 and 1944 due to the Second World War.

The joint statement said that the postponement comes in response to the coronavirus pandemic that has led to restrictions over people's movements in countries around the world.

Chopra qualified for the Olympics at the Athletics Central North East Meeting League meeting in Potchefstroom, South Africa earlier this month, making an impressive return to the circuit after recovering from an elbow injury.

""I think this was a welcome decision for us athletes in the circumstances and not something that came as a surprise. While we were looking forward to Tokyo2020, the environment wouldn't have been appropriate for the event to be celebrated the way it should be,"" the Commonwealth and Asian Games champion said in a statement.

""I would say we should look at this positively as it would allow us a year more to plan and train for the Olympics, which is the biggest sporting event for many athletes.

""There will be some impact on preparations over the next few months till the situation is brought under control, but that is something that all athletes are facing equally,"" he added.

Two-time Olympian boxer Vikas Krishan Yadav (69kg), who is also an Asian Games and Commonwealth Games gold-medallist, also felt the same. Yadav has returned to amateur boxing after an unbeaten stint in the pro circuit.

""At the end of the day, humanity has to trump sport, so I'm happy that the decision was made to postpone the Olympics amidst the coronavirus situation,"" he said referring to the outbreak which has claimed close to 19,000 deaths the world over.

176,25-3-20,Centre asks States to pay 3.5 cr construction workers from Rs 55K fund,"The Centre on Tuesday asked all Chief Ministers to provide financial aid to millions of construction workers from the cess available with them amid Covid-19 outbreak. Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar issued an advisory to all the States and Union Territories asking them to provide succour to nearly 3.5 crore construction workers from Rs 52,000-crore construction cess under their disposal.

The decision followed a letter by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to roll out emergency welfare measures for the construction industry workers.

“Under Section 60 of the Building and Other Construction Workers (BOCW) Act, 1996, all States/UTs have been advised to transfer funds in the account of construction workers through DBT (direct benefit transfer) mode from the cess fund collected by the Labour Welfare Boards under the BOCW cess Act,” Gangwar wrote to Chief Ministers and Lieutenant Generals.

The Minister has stated in the letter that in this challenging situation, it is imperative that we devise probable mechanism to support unorganised workers, who sustain their livelihood on daily wages.

The Minister also said that State building and construction workers welfare boards have collected sufficient funds. The cess has been levied and is being collected at 1 per cent of the cost of construction as notified by the Central Government in its official gazette.

The BOCW Welfare Cess, 1996, provides for levy and collection of cess at such rate not exceeding 2 per cent, but not less than 1 per cent of the cost of construction as the Central Government may notify.

Sonia pointed out to the Prime Minister that the construction industry employed over 44 million people, and the workers should be given wage support.

Over the last week, lakhs of migrant workers in major cities across India have left for their hometowns and villages, fearing a prolonged economic downturn.

As the second largest employer in India, over 44 million construction workers are now faced with a precarious future. Many are stranded in cities and are deprived of their livelihoods due to stringent lockdown measures,” Sonia said in her letter to the Prime Minister.

The Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Condition of Service) Act 1996 provides for various welfare measures for workers. The Act also provides for State Welfare Board and the constitution of welfare funds. It is reported that the Welfare Boards collected Rs 49,688.07 crore till March 31, 2019. However, only an amount of Rs 1,93,79.922 crore had been spent,” she noted.

Pointing out that several countries, most notably Canada, have announced wage subsidy as part of its COVID-19 Economic Response Plan, the Congress chief said, “I request you to consider advising the State Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Boards to roll out emergency welfare measures, particularly wage support, to construction workers who are in distress”.

In separate letters to the Chief Ministers of Congress-ruled States, Sonia said the construction industry that was reeling under the impact of demonetisation and Goods and Services Tax (GST) had been hit afresh by the pandemic.

180,25-3-20,Trudeau urges parliament to pass COVID-19 bill quickly,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has urged Parliament to pass emergency legislation against the COVID-19 pandemic for Canadians and businesses.

Trudeau said proposed sweeping new powers to let his government spend money without parliamentary approval are needed because the COVID-19 pandemic presents an ""exceptional situation"", Xinhua reported on Tuesday.

Those include broad new powers to authorize the federal cabinet to spend money until December 2021, and in some cases without any time limits at all, without having to put their proposals to a vote in the parliament.

At his daily address to the nation Tuesday morning outside Ottawa Cottage where he has been in self-isolation, Trudeau said his government's intention was not to undermine the role of parliament to act as a check and oversight on federal spending.

Trudeau said he has spoken with opposition leaders Tuesday and that work is underway to strike the right balance between parliamentary accountability and granting the government the power to act quickly.

""We recognize that this pandemic is moving extremely quickly and it is an exceptional situation that requires extreme flexibility and rapidity of response by governments to be able to help Canadians and react to a situation that we've seen is moving quickly every single day,"" he said.

""We've been in close discussion with the opposition parties to find a way to both get that flexibility to be able to get measures out the door and keep in place our democratic institutions and the values that are so important to us all,"" he said. ""We will always ensure that our system works in a robust way both around accountability and helping Canadians as quickly as is necessary in these exceptional circumstances.""

The legislation includes the amendments needed to enact the promised emergent financial package of 82 billion Canadian dollars (about $56 billion), which contain 27 billion Canadian dollars in financial aid for Canadians and 55 billion Canadian dollars in economic stimulus and tax deferral measures for businesses.

All provinces and territories in Canada have declared some form of public health crisis or state of emergency. But questions continue to circulate as to whether the local efforts are enough to deal with those not following the physical distancing measures or whether it's time the Canadian federal government intervene with extreme powers.

As of Tuesday noon, there are 2,176 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 24 deaths in Canada.

Nearly half of Canada's COVID-19 cases are now being acquired through community spread, a significant shift as the number of infections, hospitalizations and deaths rises across the country.

On Monday, the Public Health Agency of Canada said that 44 per cent of all COVID-19 cases in the country are the result of community transmission, meaning they have no link to international travel and Canadians could contract the virus while visiting friends or buying groceries.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trudeau-urges-parliament-to-pass-covid-19-bill-quickly-2020-03-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trudeau-urges-parliament-to-pass-covid-19-bill-quickly.html

182,25-3-20,Guterres calls for multi-trillion-dollar 'war-time' plan,"Ahead of a virtual meeting of the leaders of the G20, UN General-Secretary Antonio Guterres has appealed to them to adopt a multi-trillion-dollar ""war-time"" plan to fight the coronavirus pandemic.

""I urge G-20 leaders to consider the urgent launch of a large-scale, coordinated stimulus package in the trillions of dollars to target the direct provision of resources to businesses, workers and households in those countries unable to do so alone,"" he wrote to them on Tuesday.

Guterres asked the G20 to remove tariffs and other restrictions on medical equipment and medicines to tide over the shortages in some countries.

The leaders of the G20 are scheduled to hold a virtual meeting on Thursday, Guterres's Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.

India is a member of the G20, a grouping of 19 countries and the European Union that deals with financial policy.

Guterres said that the group accounts for 85 per cent of the world's gross domestic product.

He said that he will be launching a humanitarian appeal on Wednesday focused primarily on 40 countries most vulnerable to the impact of Covid-19.

""Without this critical support to countries where health systems are most unable to cope, I fear that the virus may take a deep foothold,"" he warned.

He said that the cost of the pandemic is likely to be trillions of dollars and to make up for it the G20 must ""inject massive resources into economies, reaching double-digit percentage points in the world's gross domestic product.""

The United States Congress is on the verge of voting a $2 trillion relief package for the nation and India is considering a multi-billion-dollar package.

But beyond providing financial aid to the poorest nations, Guterres called for wide-ranging measures like ending protectionism and ensuring that recovery follows the goals of sustainable development.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/guterres-calls-for-multi-trillion-dollar--war-time--plan-2020-03-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/guterres-calls-for-multi-trillion-dollar--war-time--plan.html
183,25-3-20,Rocker Jackson Browne tests positive for coronavirus,"Veteran rock singer-songwriter Jackson Browne says he is recuperating at home after testing positive for the coronavirus.

The 71-year-old musician said he got tested for COVID-19 after feeling ill and experiencing a ""small cough and a temperature"".

""My symptoms are really pretty mild, so I don't require any kind of medication and certainly not hospitalisation or anything like that, Browne told Rolling Stone magazine.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, who has been home for about 10 days, said he ""quarantined immediately"" upon feeling sick.

""It was before the mandatory quarantine orders were issued, because you don't know if you had it or not. I'm in the middle of trying to call everyone I know to discuss with them how they are feeling and whether or not they have symptoms,"" he said.

""You have to assume you have it. You need to assume that you in some way could very easily pass it to someone else,"" he added.

Browne said he is uncertain where he caught the virus from, but he suspected his recent trip to New York for the annual Love Rocks NYC benefit may have been the source.

The gala also featured Cyndi Lauper, Dave Matthews, Warren Haynes, Susan Tedeschi, and Derek Trucks.

""So many people that have it aren't going to be tested. They don't have symptoms, but they might have it and might be able to pass it on.

""That's what younger readers need to understand: They need to take part in the global response to stop the spread. That means not going anywhere, not getting into contact with anybody, not seeing anybody,"" he said.

Browne joins increasing list of people from the entertainment industry to test positive for the coronavirus after Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Idris Elba, Olga Kurylenko, Rachel Matthews, Daniel Dae Kim, Kristofer Hivju, Indira Verman, Placido Domingo, Aaron Tevit, Andy Cohen and Greg Rikaart.

185,25-3-20,Govt bans export of life-saving goods,"Facing flak for allowing exports of medical equipment and sanitisers when the country needed them the most to tackle the coronavirus outbreak, the Centre on Tuesday banned their exports with immediate effect. In addition, equipment used in intensive care units have also been brought under the purview of the export ban.

Meanwhile, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Tuesday said that at least 118 Government laboratories have been included in its network of coronavirus testing with a capacity to test 12,000 samples daily. The decision came on a day when two molecule diagnostic companies each in Punjab and Pune have developed indigenous testing kit, India’s first, which have been approved by the ICMR.

The export ban came a day after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi accused the Narendra Modi Government of delaying its decision to ban the export of life-saving equipment like ventilators amid the coronavirus outbreak, suggesting a “criminal conspiracy”. “Respected Prime Minister, why did the Indian Government allow the export of all these things till March 19 contrary to WHO’s advice to keep sufficient stock of ventilators and surgical masks. Which forces encouraged these games? Isn’t this a criminal conspiracy,” Rahul asked in a tweet in Hindi.

Rahul Gandhi also tagged a news report which claimed that India did not stockpile coronavirus protective equipment for health workers despite WHO guidelines in this regard.

The Congress on Monday also demanded the dismissal of Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and the Ministry’s Secretary for “allowing the export of masks and ventilators” till March 19 despite WHO caution on the coronavirus outbreak much earlier. “Dear PM, should you not sack the Union Commerce Minister and the Commerce Secretary for permitting exports of ventilators, surgical masks, face masks, raw material for masks till March 19,” Congress chief spokesperson Surjewala said.

“Was this not playing with the health of doctors and paramedics staff and with coronavirus patients who need ventilators. How was their export allowed?” Surjewala said.

“This is criminal as our own doctors, nurses, patients are facing acute shortage of masks and other equipment, besides ventilators,” he said.

Rejecting the Congress charge, BJP leader Amit Malviya said, “The Government of India had banned the export of N95 masks, body overalls and 2-3 ply masks on 31 Jan itself, much before any WHO advisory. N95 respirators and body overalls being the most critical personal protective gear for COVID-19 haven’t been allowed to be exported since.”

As far as the indigenous kit is concerned, developed by the Pune-based Mylab Discovery Solutions it will cost Rs 80,000 and can test 100 patients. ICMR currently has 100,000 test kits and Mylabs says it can make another 100,000 just a week. The ICMR has, however, ordered 200,000 testing kits from Germany. “We can produce 1 to 1.5 lakh tests in a week, we are trying to increase our production for the public. These kits cost 1/4th the price that the imported kits are being sold for,” said Ranjit Desai, a scientist at the lab.

The ICMR said that a total 20,864 samples from 19,974 individuals have been tested for the viral infection so far. A total of 482 individuals have been confirmed positive among suspected cases and contacts.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/govt-bans-export-of-life-saving-goods.html
186,25-3-20,Bid to break virus transmission chain,"With the count of the coronavirus positive cases crossing 500-mark on Tuesday, the Centre asked all the States to further enhance surveillance to trace infected people to break the transmission chain across India and ensure funds for setting up of additional medical facilities like hospitals, clinical laboratories and isolation wards to combat with the endemic. More States and districts also announced imposition of curfew to strictly enforce “social distancing”.

As per the Government data, 519 people in India have tested positive for Covid-19 so far, with 40 cured and 9 deaths, with an addition of 12 new cases on Tuesday. Eleven people have died due to the contagious infection, which originated in Wuhan city of Hubei province in China over three months ago. Over 17,100 people have been killed and almost four lakh are infected worldwide.

In a letter to all the Chief Secretaries of the States, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba asked them to “suitably supplement” State and district surveillance teams as well as the Rapid Response Teams (RRT) to meet any urgency.

“It is absolutely essential that surveillance and contact tracing of all positive cases is taken up and no suspected or high risk person is left out. It is important that while these tasks are being monitored at the State level by the State Health Secretaries, this activity is directly and regularly monitored at the district level by the district magistrates, involving the official machinery available in the district,” Gauba said.

The Centre during a video conference had asked the State Governments on Sunday to identify and earmark hospitals dedicated for management of Covid-19 cases. Gauba asked the State officials to upload the details of both the surveillance measures and the hospitals on the health online portal of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

All violations should be met with legal action, the Cabinet Secretary told the States and UTs.

The State Governments have been conveyed that public gatherings could lead to escalation of the prevailing situation as so far nearly 500 positive cases have been reported from different parts of the country. Of the total cases, 41 are foreign nationals and the eleven deaths reported so far, the Health Ministry said.

Seven deaths were earlier reported from Maharashtra (two), Bihar, Karnataka, Delhi, Gujarat and Punjab.

Thirty-seven people have been cured/discharged/migrated, according to the official data.

“The Central Government has asked all the State Governments to deploy fiscal resources for establishing additional medical facilities such as hospitals, clinical labs, isolation wards, expanding and upgrading existing facilities to combat the challenge posed by COVID19,” an official statement said.

These facilities need to be well equipped with ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPEs), masks and drugs to treat the patients, it said.

Meanwhile, to impose the lockdown strictly, the authorities are tightening screw against the lockdown violators. Thousands of people were booked for violating the norms and issued warnings of arrest with jail terms up to a year if the violations continued. In States like Punjab,Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh, police circulated pictures of violators on social media with messages such as they were “against the society as they will not stay at home.”

The police confiscated vehicles people found violating the norms in States including Haryana and Rajasthan. In some cases police forced the violators to do sit-ups 10 to 20 times as punishments for coming out of their homes. Police also clicked pictures of violators. Barricades were put up across places under lockdown as police checked whether people out of their homes had genuine reasons to do so.

As per data provided by the States, 232 FIRs have been registered and 111 people have been arrested for violating the curfew imposed in Punjab.

Kolkata Police have arrested 1003 people for deliberate violation of “Total Safety Restrictions”.

The Gujarat police has registered 238 cases of breach of lockdown and 426 people in the last 24 hours for violating lockdown rules. In Ghaziabad, 110 FIRs registered against 494 people for violating lockdown.

In Mumbai and Ahmedabad, police have also asked the violators to push up 10 to 20 times on roads in presence of media. Taking a strict action against the lockdown violators, Uttarakhand Police on Tuesday caught people venturing out on streets of Karanprayag city here and clicked their pictures with a pamphlet reading -- “I am enemy of society, I won’t stay inside my home, I want to spread coronavirus.” To teach them a lesson, police personnel handed them a pamphlet which states, “I am enemy of society, I won’t stay inside my home, I want to spread coronavirus”, and posted it on social media.

In West Bengal, the police in Cooch Behar is seen beating up a person found to be roaming in the streets without any credible reason. The police also punctured the tyres of e-rickshaws being driven in the city amid the state-wide lockdown imposed by the government including rural and urban areas to control the spread of COVID-19.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bid-to-break-virus-transmission-chain-2020-03-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/bid-to-break-virus-transmission-chain.html

This information should be shared in newspapers and web portals of the paper, the Prime Minister said.

Terming the media as critical infrastructure, the Centre said the functioning of media is needed in the current situation to deliver information to the public. Earlier, the Prime Minister interacted with over 20 journalists and stakeholders from print media from all over the country via video conferencing.

The PM said media has played a praiseworthy role in disseminating information to every nook and cranny of this nation. This makes the media all the more significant in fighting this challenge and spreading correct information about it at micro level.

He also suggested that information like location of availability of essential items during lockdown can also be shared in the regional pages.

“The Prime Minister asked the media to act as a link between Government and people and provide continuous feedback, at both national and regional level. He underlined the importance of social distancing.

Modi asked media to generate awareness about its importance, inform people about the lockdown decision by States, and also highlight the impact of spread of the virus, through inclusion of international data and case studies about other countries in the papers,” said the PMO in a statement.

The PM emphasised that it was important to tackle the spread of pessimism, negativity and rumour mongering. Citizens need to be assured that the Government is committed to countering the impact of COVID-19.

“The journalists and stakeholders from print media appreciated the role played by the Prime Minister in communicating effectively and leading the country from the front. They said that they will work on the suggestions of the Prime Minister to publish inspiring and positive stories. They also thanked him for reinforcing the credibility of print media and noted that the entire nation has followed his message of coming together to face this grave challenge,” said the PMO.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/credible-print-media-need-of-hour--ensure-its-supply--says-modi.html
191,25-3-20,"Pak suspends domestic flights as coronavirus cases cross 1,000","Pakistan has suspended all domestic flight operations until April 2 to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus after the country reported over 1,000 cases and seven deaths from the COVID-19 infection, authorities said on Wednesday.

The nationwide tally of COVID-19 patients touched 1,037 with 413 cases in Sindh; 115 in Balochistan; 296 in Punjab; 117 in K-P; 80 in Gilgit-Baltistan; 15 in Islamabad; and one in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, The Express Tribune reported.

The National Disaster Management Authority has said that so far 7 people have died due to the novel coronavirus and 18 recovered.

In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, the country has halted its domestic flights operations.

Abdul Sattar Khokhar, the spokesman of Aviation Division, said that the decision was part of ongoing efforts to contain the deadly coronavirus.

The ban will be effective from Thursday, Khokhar said.

According to a statement on the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority's website on Tuesday, the government has ""decided to suspend all types of domestic scheduled/non-scheduled, chartered and private aircraft passenger flight operations with effect from Thursday, March 26, at 6:00am up to April 02, 2020.""

Pakistan has already suspended international flights this week. However, cargo flights are exempted from the flight suspension ban.

Meanwhile, there is complete lockdown in the country and people have been told to remain inside of their homes. They are only allowed to go out in case of emergency.

The government has pledged to increase testing capability and other facilities in hospitals as new medical supplies are expected to start pouring in from China by Friday, according to NDMA chief Lt-Gen Muhammad Afzal.

According to the Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker, there are 417,966 confirmed cases across the world, 18,615 deaths and 107,705 recoveries.

On Tuesday, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan announced a multi-billion rupee stimulus package to combat the deadly coronavirus and to facilitate poor people in the prevailing circumstances.

The government also suspended all passenger train operations through the country till March 31 and deployed army to assist the civil administration to enforce a nationwide lockdown to contain the virus outbreak.

Khan said Rs 200 billion has been allocated for the labour class to mitigate their sufferings, while the government is also reaching provinces and the business community to extend their assistance.

He said the government was highly conscious of its responsibilities and it was due to various policies and steps that the coronavirus was still contained in the country.

192,25-3-20,"Shaheen Bagh cleared, 9 protesters detained","Following coronavirus outbreak, the Delhi Police on Tuesday removed people protesting against the citizenship law at Shaheen Bagh and other places in the national Capital.

According to RP Meena, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Southeast district, a total of nine protesters, including six women, were detained at Shaheen Bagh and taken to a nearby police station.

“People were requested to vacate the site as lockdown has been imposed due to the coronavirus outbreak. However, action was taken when they refused to end the gathering,” said the DCP.

The agitators, mostly women, had been on a sit-in at the site for over three months to protest the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). “Most of the protesters vacated the site after police made an appeal but a few refused. So, police detained them. A decision about resuming the protest will be taken after the coronavirus situation comes under control,” a volunteer at the site requesting anonymity said.

On Sunday, during the “Janta curfew”, only five women were at the site while others had left their slippers as a symbol of solidarity. “The women were taking all precautions amid the coronavirus outbreak and sanitisers had been arranged at the venue to ensure utmost hygiene,” a volunteer said.

Other protest sites, including Jafrabad in Northeast Delhi, Turkman Gate in Central Delhi and Hauz Rani in South Delhi also were cleared by the police.

The move comes two days after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a complete lockdown in the national Capital till March 31 in order to control the spread of coronavirus.

The Delhi Police has imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC in the national capital till March 31 banning protests and other gatherings.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shaheen-bagh-cleared---9-protesters-detained-2020-03-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/shaheen-bagh-cleared---9-protesters-detained.html
193,25-3-20,'She' slips into a zone of plasticity,"""She (Netflix series); Cast: Aaditi Pohankar, Vijay Varma, Vishwas Kini; Created by: Imtiaz Ali; Rating: * * (two stars)

""She"" keeps you guessing right till the end, though probably not in the intended way. Even as the final scenes of the final episode roll, you are left trying to figure out what was it you just watched. Does Imtiaz Ali's new script mean to hold a deeper context, and hence demand a second binge-watch session? Or is it simply an erratic mess reflecting the confusion that seems to have overwhelmed Ali's creativity lately, obvious in the last couple of films he directed?

Showrunner Ali has co-scripted ""She"" with Divya Johri, and the seven-episode series is directed by his brother Arif Ali (who earlier helmed the 2014 dud ""Lekar Hum Deewana Dil"", incidentally also scripted by Imtiaz Ali). It is Arif Ali's co-director who draws your attention -- Avinash Das is a screenwriter-turned-filmmaker who made the interesting little heroine-centric drama of 2017, ""Anaarkali Of Aarah"".

You would expect an engrossing tale of women's empowerment from such a team.

At the core of the plot is Bhumika Pardeshi (Aaditi Pohankar), a constable from a lower-middle class Marathi background who is inducted in the anti-narcotics squad. Bhumika's mission is extremely dangerous. The covert operation aims to bring down the drug mafia, and when she is picked up the kingpin Sasya (Vijay Varma), one would think she has cracked the case. Of course, there are the twists.

""She"" tries moving on twin tracks. There is the suspense drama that the narrative tries setting up as Bhumika pursues her goal. Then there is Bhumika herself, as she struggles to come to terms with using her sexuality as a tool to wrest advantage in her mission. It is something that is meant to give a deeper subtext to the basic storyline.

Imtiaz Ali's writing clicks on the second count. Bhumika has been created with precision -- a very ordinary woman thrust into a job that needs extraordinary looks and skills. Ali has put a lot into imagining the character, and it shows in the way she towers over everything in this show.

The trouble is Ali neglects everything else. Most other players in the drama get almost nothing in terms of character construction. Worse, the drama itself barely sustains a cohesive intrigue quotient through the seven episodes. You tend to get distracted after a point as the story gets repetitive.

Aaditi Pohankar makes most of her authorbacked role, and comes up with a good-enough performance as Bhumika. She uses the conflicts about the character well.

Vijay Varma, who shot to fame with his ""Gully Boy"" act last year, is impressive in the way he lends screen presence to Sasya. He is the only other character apart from Bhumika that means anything in the drama that goes on. Varma does well to sustain Sasya all through, despite the fact that the character gets sketchy after a while.

The trouble with ""She"" is its creator Imtiaz Ali seems wholly overawed by the challenge of creating the ultimate, imposing screen heroine. With that challenge in sight, he ignores everything else that he pens. In the process, the series, its execution and intent slip into a zone of sheer plasticity.

198,25-3-20,Facebook's ad business weakens in nations hit by COVID-19,"Facebook has admitted that its ad business has been adversely affected in countries severely hit by the novel coronavirus while non-business engagement like messaging has exploded which is affecting its services like Messenger and WhatsApp.

As countries after countries announce total lockdown, internet usage has exponentially grown in the past few days, forcing tech companies like Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Google to lower their video quality to let the services up and running.

""Our business is being adversely affected like so many others around the world. We don't monetize many of the services where we're seeing increased engagement, and we've seen a weakening in our ads business in countries taking aggressive actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19,"" said Alex Schultz, VP of Analytics and Jay Parikh, VP of Engineering, in a statement on Tuesday.

Much of the increased traffic is happening on Facebook's messaging services.

""As the pandemic expands and more people practice physically distancing themselves from one another, this has also meant that many more people are using our apps. On many of the countries hit hardest by the virus, total messaging has increased more than 50% over the last month,"" the duo added.

Similarly, in places hit hardest by the virus, voice and video calling have more than doubled on Messenger and WhatsApp.

In Italy, specifically, Facebook has seen up to 70 per cent more time spent across its apps since the crisis arrived in the country. Instagram and Facebook Live views doubled in a week.

""We have also seen messaging increase over 50 per cent and time in group calling (calls with three or more participants) increase by over 1,000 per cent during the last month,"" in Italy, Parikh said.

Facebook said during this emergency, it has been doing everything it can to keep its apps fast, stable and reliable.

""Our services were built to withstand spikes during events such as the Olympics or on New Year's Eve. However, those happen infrequently, and we have plenty of time to prepare for them,"" said the social networking giant.

The usage growth from COVID-19 is unprecedented across the industry, it said, adding that Facebook is experiencing new records in usage almost every day.

""We are working to keep our apps running smoothly while also prioritizing features such as our COVID-19 Information Center on Facebook as well as the World Health Organization's Health Alert on WhatsApp. We're monitoring usage patterns carefully, making our systems more efficient, and adding capacity as required,"" Parikh informed.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/facebook-s-ad-business-weakens-in-nations-hit-by-covid-19-2020-03-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/facebook-s-ad-business-weakens-in-nations-hit-by-covid-19.html

South Africa, which now has the highest numbers of infections on the continent, has ordered a 21-day lockdown which rolls into action at midnight on Thursday.

200,25-3-20,Trump requests virus test kits from South Korea: Seoul,"US President Donald Trump has requested novel coronavirus test kits from South Korea, his counterpart Moon Jae-in said on Wednesday, as Washington pushes for a quick reopening of the world's biggest economy.

The South was once the hardest-hit country outside China, where the virus first emerged, but appears to have brought its outbreak under control thanks to a huge testing and contact-tracing effort.

By midnight on Tuesday more than 367,000 people in the South had been tested -- processes that are free to anyone referred by doctors, those who have links to a confirmed case, and individuals who test positive.

The US has the third-highest number of confirmed cases globally with 55,000, behind China and Italy, and did little testing initially.

Trump's request for test kits came as he called for a quick end to social distancing and declared the beginning of the end of the health crisis in the US.

""President Trump of the United States... made a request to us for the urgent provision of quarantine items such as diagnostic kits,"" Moon said while visiting a test developer in Seoul.

During their phone call Moon told Trump the equipment could require US FDA approval, which Trump said he would seek ""within the day"", the South's presidential Blue House said earlier in a separate statement.

""If there is a domestic surplus, I will support as much as possible,"" Moon told Trump.

No indication was given on quantities, or whether the supplies would be donated or provided on a commercial basis.

The White House confirmed that the two leaders spoke on Tuesday, but did not say whether Trump made any such request.

Trump, who is keen to get his reelection campaign back on track, on Tuesday said social distancing has caused too much pain to the US economy, adding ""we lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu. We don't turn the country off.""

202,25-3-20,"Quake hits off Russia's Kuril Islands, prompts tsunami alert","A 7.2-magnitude quake hit off Russia's Kuril Islands on Wednesday, prompting local residents to seek higher ground due to a tsunami threat, authorities said.

The Russian emergencies ministry said the quake's epicentre was 210 kilometers (130 miles) southeast of Severo-Kurilsk, a town of around 2,500 people on the Kuril island of Paramushir.

Officials reported no casualties or damage but said residents of Severo-Kurilsk were taken to higher ground.

The emergencies ministry reported a small tsunami with a wave of about 50 centimetres (1.6 feet) high.

The ministry said area residents would remain in a safe place for now as the threat of a tsunami remained.

""People's safety for us is the most important thing,"" Sakhalin governor Valery Limarenko was quoted as saying.

The US Geological Survey for its part estimated the strength of the quake at 7.5 magnitude.

The quake hit at a depth of 59 kilometres (37 miles), around 1,400 kilometres (around 850 miles) northeast of the Japanese city of Sapporo, USGS added.

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said ""only very small tsunami waves were generated by this earthquake and there is no further threat"".

Sources said while one suicide bomber detonated himself at the entrance, three IS terrorists stormed the shrine in the Shorbazar area Wednesday morning. Around 150 people were worshipping in the Gurudwara at the time of the attack.

However, the security forces rescued around 80 worshippers from the Gurudwara. The Sikhs constitute a minuscule minority in Afghanistan.

Afghan security forces killed all three terrorists in a day-long gun-battle after which NATO soldiers helped with the clearance operation.

Though initial reports from Kabul suggested that the Ashraf Ghani government had blamed the Pakistan-backed Haqqani network for the terror attack, but the Taliban denied its role.

Violence in Afghanistan continues unabated even as the US and Taliban have signed a peace deal, which entails withdrawal of the US forces.

India strongly condemned the terror attack and extended condolences to the immediate family members of the deceased and wished speedy recovery to the injured.

In an official statement, the government said, ""India stands ready to extend all possible assistance to the affected families of the Hindu and Sikh community of Afghanistan.""

Reacting to the terror attack, India's Housing and Urban Minister and a former diplomat Hardeep Singh Puri on Wednesday tweeted, ""Suicide attack on a Gurudwara Sahib in Kabul needs to be strongly condemned. These killings are a grim reminder of atrocities that continue to be inflicted upon religious minorities in some countries and the urgency with which their lives and religious freedom have to be safeguarded.""

The Chief Minister @ysjagan has allowed only one per family to purchase essentials, gathering more than 5 is strictly prohibited. #AndhraFightsCorona,"" writes a user on microblogging site Twitter.

He accompanied the tweet with a 14 second-long video of the Andhra Pradesh police making defaulters do sit-ups with crossed hands.

A similar awareness tactic was used by the Maharastra police, which in a video posted on social media, is seen making at least nine people do sit-ups near a traffic signal, evoking both laughter and appreciation for the officials.

The central government had last week announced a lockdown till March 31 in 80 districts across India to contain the spread of the deadly coronavirus. The restrictions were extended after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday night declared a 21-day nationwide lockdown.

The virus has claimed nine lives and infected 562 people in the country.

The police forces in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand took their creative ways a notch higher to ensure that the public curfew is followed.

“UP Police punished unnecessary people wandering around in order to make 'public curfew' successful and maintain #Social_Distancing #Covid19India,"" posted a Twitter user.

The accompanying video shows the police resorting to the age old ‘murga' punishment to teach the defaulters a lesson. Murga punishment is a stress position used as a corporal punishment where sit-ups are done holding the ears.

While defaulters in Punjab were asked to either crawl on all fours, or lie down flat on the road; those in Uttarakhand were made to pose with pamphlets that said, “I'm enemy of society; I won't stay home”.

“#PunjabLockDown #PunjabPolice Nagin dance bhi karva do Bhai inse... Why can't people getting in there brains at it is very serious matter... Please stay at home… (police makes people crawl from one place to another) #StayAtHomeSaveLives #StayHomeStaySafe #COVID2019 (sic),” one Twitter user posted along with pictures of people being punished in Punjab.

Niti Aayog chief Amitabh Kant also took to Twitter to praise the Delhi police for its ways of encouraging social distancing.

Sharing a video of a few police personnel driving people out of a public park peacefully while telling them the importance of staying indoors, he wrote, “Delhi Police at its best! As Gr8 Ambassadors of #SocialDistancing ! #StaySafeStayHome""

It was not all praise for the force as many netizens also shared instances of the police crossing the line.

In places like Guntur, Telangana, Sikar (Rajasthan), police is seen beating up those flouting the rules with lathis. In several cases, people who were out for essential activities were harassed by the security personnel. Many Twitter users posted videos of such instances.

“A can driver was basically trashed by police near Guntur bus stand. (you need to educate people and this kind of atrocity will create dissatisfaction and anger among people where you desperately need social cooperation) #AndhraPradesh #APLockDown #fightagainstcorona,” a user posted with an accompanying video.

“This is really appalling! Doctors returning home from the hospital in Telangana are being stopped and harassed by police for breaking curfew. This is even after they have showed the police their ID cards,” another user posted with a video showing an altercation between the police and a group of individuals.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus--sit-ups--squats-----murga--punishment--police-try-new--ways-to-keep-people-at-home-2020-03-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/coronavirus--sit-ups--squats-----murga--punishment--police-try-new--ways-to-keep-people-at-home.html
206,25-3-20,"Apple releases iOS, iPadOS 13.4 with trackpad support","Apple has released iOS and iPadOS 13.4, the latest major updates to the iOS 13 operating system with trackpad support.

Now, one can pair a mouse or trackpad with their iPad and use it to move a cursor on the display.

Apple unveiled trackpad support for iPadOS when it announced the new iPad Pro last week. While the company plans to sell a new Magic Keyboard with a built-in trackpad, one do not need to buy a new iPad or accessory to access the feature.

The iOS and iPadOS 13.4 updates are available on all eligible devices over-the-air in the Settings app. To access the updates, go to Settings > General > Software Update.

The update also adds support for the new Magic Keyboard accessory with built-in trackpod support.

In addition to trackpad support, iOS and iPadOS 13.4 add a handful of features. One can share an iCloud Drive folder with another iCloud user — it works pretty much like a shared Dropbox folder.

There are now nine new Memoji stickers, such as smiling face with hearts, hands pressed together and party face. Apple has tweaked buttons to archive/delete, move, reply and compose and email in the Mail app.

Apple has also added the ability to release a single app binary on all App Stores, including the iOS and Mac App Store. This means that developers can release a paid app on the Mac and the iPhone — and the user only have to buy it once.

209,25-3-20,"Spain overtakes China virus toll with 3,434 deaths: govt","Spain's coronavirus death toll overtook that of China on Wednesday, rising to 3,434 after 738 people died over the past 24 hours, the government said.

Across the world, only Italy now has a higher death toll than that of Spain. In China, where the virus emerged late last year, 3,281 people have died.

The spiralling number of deaths came as Spain entered the 11th day of an unprecedented lockdown to try and rein in the COVID-19 epidemic that has now infected 47,610 people, the health ministry said.

As the authorities stepped up testing, the number of cases showed a 20 per cent increase on the figures for Tuesday, while the death toll showed a 27 per cent rise over the same period.

Despite the national lockdown imposed on March 14, which is to be extended until April 11, both deaths and infections have continued to mount, with officials warning this week would be particularly bad.

""We are approaching the peak,"" the ministry's emergencies coordinator Fernando Simon said in announcing the figures.

Health authorities are hoping it will soon become clear whether the lockdown is having the desired effect.

The Madrid region has suffered the brunt of the epidemic with 14,597 infections -- just under a third of the total -- and 1,825 deaths, or 53 per cent of the national figure.

With hospitals on the brink of collapse from the surge in patients, troops have set up a massive field hospital in Madrid's vast IFEMA exhibition centre which currently has 1,500 beds but which could be expanded to take in up to 5,500 people -- making it the largest hospital in Spain.

210,25-3-20,"India may see up to 13 lakh cases of COVID-19 by mid-May, scientists warn","India could face between 100,000 to 13 lakh confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus by mid-May if the current trend in the growing number of COVID-19 cases continues, according to a report by an international team of scientists.

The report, compiled by COV-IND-19 Study Group, an interdisciplinary team of researchers, said while India seems to have done well in controlling the number of confirmed cases compared to other countries like the US and Italy in the early phase of the pandemic, the country is critically missing a key component in this assessment -- the number of truly affected cases.

This factor depends on the extent of testing, the accuracy of the test results, and the frequency and scale of testing of people who may have been exposed but do not show symptoms, the researchers, including Debashree Ray from Johns Hopkins University in the US, said.

""So far, the number of people tested in India has been relatively small. In the absence of widespread testing, it is impossible to quantify the magnitude of 'community transmission', in other words, estimate how many are infected outside hospitals and health care facilities,"" the scientists wrote in the report.

""Thus our current estimates are at best underestimates for India based on early phase data,"" they said.

According to the report, it is essential for India to adopt ""draconian measures"" to act before the growth of COVID-19 infections starts to accelerate in the country.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Tuesday a total lockdown for 1.3 billion people in India for 21 days, warning that the nation may go back by 21 years and many families could be devastated if we don't abide by the lockdown rules.

In their analysis, the scientists used data on the number of reported cases in India up to March 16, and applied tools of modelling disease transmission.

They estimated the theoretical number of infected at any given time, and compared projections for India against the US and Italy.

The scientists, including those from Delhi School of Economics in New Delhi and the University of Michigan in the US, noted in a blog post on the platform Medium, that the estimates may change as stricter restrictions and measures are adopted by India.

India, according to the researchers, has the most overstretched healthcare system where it is hard to provide care even when the patient volume flowing into hospitals is ""normal"".

Citing World Bank data, they said the number of hospital beds per 1,000 people in India is only 0.7, compared to 6.5 in France, 11.5 in South Korea, 4.2 in China, 3.4 in Italy, and 2.8 in the US.

Owing to this, the scientists said, the predicted surge in the number of cases may make it impossible for the healthcare providers in India to support the sheer volume of cases.

The report also identified the most vulnerable groups of population in India.

Citing multiple studies, the researchers said the number of people in the country without an insurance policy stretched to about 1,100 million as of 2014, with the number of men and women with hypertension, one of the major risk factors for death from COVID-19, being more than 300 million people.

Without enforcing any intervention in the country, the scientists predicted that the number of cases may exceed the estimated capacity of hospital beds in India, which stands at 70 beds per 100,000 Indians.

They cautioned that the critically ill COVID-19 patients -- about 5-10 per cent of those infected -- will require ICU beds, which make up between 5 and 10 per cent of bed capacity in Indian hospitals.

The scientists, however, said their estimates came with limitations, including the uncertainty arising from model assumptions of population size, accuracy of the diagnostic tests for COVID-19, and heterogeneity in the implementation of government-initiated interventions.

The number of coronavirus infected cases in India so far is 562, while the death toll due to COVID-19 in the country is revised down to nine, according to Health Ministry data.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-may-see-up-to-13-lakh-cases-of-covid-19-by-mid-may--scientists-warn-2020-03-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/india-may-see-up-to-13-lakh-cases-of-covid-19-by-mid-may--scientists-warn.html

He said the newly-tested positive patients were in quarantine since March 22 at the Salem Medical College.

Giving statistics, he said 2,09,276 passengers were screened so far and 15,492 were under follow up.

As many as 211 people were admitted in various hospitals while samples of 890 people were tested of which 757 turned negative while 23 positive for COVID-19.

221,25-3-20,'We are collapsing': Virus pummels medics in Spain and Italy,"By the time Patricia Núñez's cough started, she was already familiar with the dreaded dry hacking sound tormenting patients who had for weeks been filling the Madrid emergency ward where she works.

“We were fed up of hearing it at the hospital, so it was just a matter of time before I would contract it,” said Núñez, a 32-year-old nurse who tested positive for the new coronavirus about a week ago.

Speaking via video call from her home, Núñez said she is eager to recover, so she can relieve overworked colleagues dealing with a rising wave of patients and dwindling numbers of healthy nurses and doctors.

“The worst thing is that you need to stay at home, worried about infecting relatives, while knowing that you are dearly needed at work,” she told The Associated Press.

The coronavirus is waging a war of attrition against health care workers throughout the world, but nowhere is it winning more battles at the moment than in Italy and in Spain, where protective equipment and tests have been in severely short supply for weeks.

Spain's universal health care system is a source of national pride and often hailed as a reason for its citizens' legendary longevity, but the outbreak is exposing its shortcomings, some of which are the result of years of budget cuts.

The country's hospitals are groaning under the weight of the pandemic: Video and photos from two hospitals in the Spanish capital showed patients, many hooked up to oxygen tanks, crowding corridors and emergency rooms.

At the 12 de Octubre University Hospital, patients could be seen on the floor as they waited for a bed in recent days. The hospital says the patients have since been accommodated elsewhere.

On Wednesday, the number of medical personnel infected was nearly 6,500 nationally, health authorities said, representing 13.6% of the country's 47,600 total cases and about 1% of the health system's workforce. At least three health care workers have died.

“We are collapsing. We need more workers,” said Lidia Perera, a nurse who works with Núñez at Madrid's Hospital de la Paz, which has 1,000 beds.

This week, 11 of the hospital's 14 floors are devoted to caring for those suffering from COVID-19, and there is still not enough room: The patients with less serious cases of the disease are being put in the hospital's gym or in a large tent outside.

“If you had told me three months ago that I would be working in these conditions in Spain, I wouldn't have believed you,” Perera said, adding that staff at La Paz are only being tested for the virus if they have symptoms. “If they did (regular testing), they might end up without any workers.”

Widespread infections among health workers reflect the universal difficulty of stemming the spread of the pandemic. But sick health workers do double damage: They add to the toll while also hampering the ability to respond to the crisis. On top of that, they raise the specter of hospitals becoming breeding grounds of infection. Spain's experience has been reflected elsewhere.

The World Health Organization's director-general this week called reports of large number of infections among health workers “alarming.” ""Even if we do everything else right, if we don't prioritize protecting health workers, many people will die because the health worker who could have saved their lives is sick,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told journalists. In Italy, where nearly one-tenth of about 70,000 infections are among medical workers, doctors and nurses have been begging the government daily to provide more masks, gloves and goggles. “Please don't leave us alone: Help us help you,"" Dr. Francesca De Gennaro wrote in an open letter, asking for gear. De Gennaro heads a small private medical clinic in hard-hit Bergamo — where some 90 of 460 workers have tested positive.

Italian media have reported at least 19 deaths among health professionals in the country, which leads the world in coronavirus fatalities.

There was no immediately available data on infections among health care workers in the United States. Neither Iran nor France is disclosing those figures.

But in China, where the outbreak started and where more than 80,000 people became infected in three months, over 3,000 medical workers were believed to have fallen ill by the end of February, according to Dr. Liang Wannian, the leader of a team of Chinese experts working with WHO to study the outbreak.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

Spanish authorities have repeatedly said that protecting medical staff is central their efforts to do what's known as “flattening the curve”: spreading out the time period of over which infections occur, in order to reduce the burden on intensive care units.

But health workers say that even simple things such as gowns and masks are still in short supply, as are tests.

“All over the country, you see examples of workers inventing homemade suits using plastics,” said Dr. Olga Mediano, a lung specialist in Guadalajara, some 65 kilometers (40 miles) east of Madrid.

Unions blame budget cuts during the decade that followed the last global economic crisis for leaving Spanish hospitals ill-prepared. In response to the criticism, authorities have promised to distribute hundreds of thousands of masks and COVID-19 fast tests this week.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-we-are-collapsing---virus-pummels-medics-in-spain-and-italy-2020-03-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/-we-are-collapsing---virus-pummels-medics-in-spain-and-italy.html

""The World Bank Group and the IMF believe it is imperative at this moment to provide a global sense of relief for developing countries as well as a strong signal to financial markets,"" the Washington-based development lenders said in a joint statement.

The move is directed at countries that qualify for the most generous aid from the ""IDA"" fund aimed at the ""two-thirds of the world's population living in extreme poverty.""",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/imf--world-bank-call-for-suspension-of-debt-payments-by-poorest-nations-2020-03-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/imf--world-bank-call-for-suspension-of-debt-payments-by-poorest-nations.html
223,25-3-20,"PM warns of strict action against those misbehaving with frontline staff, asks people to cooperate with administration","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday warned of strict action against those misbehaving with people on the frontline of the fight against coronavirus like doctors and airline crew, and sought the cooperation of citizens with administration to deal with the crisis.

Modi chose a video interaction with residents of Varanasi, the constituency he represents in Parliament, to respond to several queries related to the pandemic and his government's response to it, and asserted that focusing on a few incidents of shortcomings will not help at this hour.

Invoking the Mahabharata, he said the epic war was won in 18 days and his government's effort is to win this war against coronavirus in 21 days.

Lord Krishna was the charioteer then and now 130 crore people are the charioteers in this battle, he said.

To a question about the hardships being faced especially by the poor migrants and daily wagers, the prime minister acknowledged that there may be some difficulties.

If he claimed that all is well, then he would be deceiving himself, Modi said, and then added that what is a more important question is that whether the pandemic has to be defeated or not even if it means facing certain difficulties.

Even in normal times, people face certain problems, he said.

Noting that 'Navaratri' has started from Wednesday, he asked people to take care of nine poor families on each of the nine auspicious days, saying nothing can be of more devotion to goddess Durga. They should also tend to animals, he added.

""Karuna"" (compassion) is also a step toward defeating the coronavirus, he said.

The Centre and states are taking measures to help the poor and daily-wagers, he said.

""The difficulties being faced are only for 21 days. But if the coronavirus crisis is not over and its spread is not stopped, then we cannot imagine the harm it will cause,"" Modi said.

Asked about reports of misbehaviour with medical personnel and airline crew, he said he was pained by this and has asked the home ministry and state DGPs to take tough action against culprits.

If anybody targets doctors, nurses and all those rendering their service during this crisis, then it will cost them dearly, Modi said, adding people in white like doctors and nurses are like gods.

Citizens should also object if they see anybody misbehaving with these professionals, he added.

There have been reports of medical personnel and airline crew being harassed in their neighborhood by some vigilante residents because they might have dealt with suspected cases.

Modi also asked people to cooperate with the government and the administration, and not to pressure them, for better results during the lockdown period.

""There may be incidents of some shortcoming or negligence. But looking for such cases and focussing and publicising them, discouraging some sector will not benefit at this time. There can be a thousand reasons to spread pessimism. I am not saying they are all wrong but life runs on hope and trust,"" he said.

Doctors, police personnel and many others have been working very hard and should be encouraged, he said. They should be publicly feted, he said.

Modi also asked people to shun superstition, rumour and self-medication and emphasised his message of self-distancing if the battle against the deadly virus has to be won.

He noted that over one lakh of COVID-19 patients have recovered the world over and many dozens have in India as well.

This disease does not discriminate between the rich and the poor, among regions and infects even those very conscious about their health, he said, adding that social distancing is the only way out and people should have patience and should follow guidelines.

The government has joined hands with WhatsApp to start a help desk, and people can get proper guidelines about the virus by contacting a number (9013151515), the prime minister said.

Kashi, another name for Varanasi, can show the way to the country with its patience, coordination, empathy, peace, tolerance, service and solution, he said, noting that the holy place is known for annihilating sins and crisis.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pm-warns-of-strict-action-against-those-misbehaving-with-frontline-staff--asks-people-to-cooperate-with-administration-2020-03-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/pm-warns-of-strict-action-against-those-misbehaving-with-frontline-staff--asks-people-to-cooperate-with-administration.html
224,25-3-20,"64,000 reached India since March 21; 8,000 in quarantine","Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Wednesday that around 64,000 people have arrived from other countries in India since March 21, out of which about 8,000 have been placed in various quarantine facilities and the remaining 56,000 are in home isolation.
