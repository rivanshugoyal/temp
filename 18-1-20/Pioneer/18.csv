0,18-1-20,Tectonic shift in US’ attitude,"The US no longer views West Asia as critical to its economic well-being as it did in the past, when it depended on the oil from that region

Karl Marx once wrote, “History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.” But often times events tend to combine both the tragic and the farcical in equal measure, just as we are seeing them play out between the Iranians and the Americans. US President Donald Trump’s recent actions remind one of the Hollywood blockbuster, Gunfight at the OK Corral, except for the minor aberration that West Asia is no Wild West and Trump is certainly no Marshal Wyatt Earp.

Whatever reasons he may put forward for his actions, the targetted execution of a serving Iranian General and war hero, Qasem Soleimani, while on an official visit to Iraq raises serious questions of sovereignty, morality, ethical conduct and can never be justified in any civilized society. It was, in fact, a blatant act of aggression in clear violation of international law and a war crime, made even more heinous because neither America nor Iran is at war with each other. It shows up the true face of America for what it is and has been these past decades, a global bully.

More importantly, the rationale and timing of the attack raise grave suspicions as to Trump’s motives. The late General Soleimani was by no means a tactical commander and his neutralisation would hardly stop operations in progress, in this case the launch of “imminent attacks” on American embassies, as has been alleged by the President. What is more likely is that Trump ordered this rash and utterly immoral attack in the vain hope that it would divert attention from his forthcoming impeachment trial, while at the same time make him appear to be a strong and decisive leader. However, make no mistake General Soleimani’s killing was a grievous loss to the Iranian establishment, especially to its “Irregular Warfare” capabilities, something that will take time to rebuild.

While Trump’s action was totally transactional and short-term in nature, it coincided with the American deep state’s far more long- term strategy there, the necessity to squeeze China. Over the past two decades there has been a tectonic shift in the manner the United States (US) views West Asia, ever since it became one of the world’s leading oil producers, exporting more oil than Saudi Arabia. In March last year, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that the US exported more crude and petroleum products than it imported. As senior partner Per Magnus Nysveen of Rystad Energy, a global oil consulting and analysis firm, put it, “The oil market is overly preoccupied with short-term US crude stocks but the big picture tells a new story. Increasingly profitable shale production and a robust global appetite for light oil and gasoline is poised to bring the US to a position of oil dominance in the next few years.”

This fact obviously suggests that the US no longer views West Asia as critically important to its economic well-being as it did in the past, when its economy depended on the oil from that region. For it, the geostrategic value of that region lies more in the adverse impact that any exacerbation of tensions there would have on the Chinese economy, as it is bound to, given Chinese dependence on oil from that region. It, therefore, stands to reason that it no longer finds it necessary to maintain a large troop presence in the region and can achieve its long-term aims through the use of proxies such as Saudi Arabia and Israel. In this context, much has been made of the Russian attempts to fill the vacuum that the US withdrawal has left. However, President Putin must be aware that he is punching well above his weight given the fact that the Russian economy is just around 1/20th that of the US.

Finally, with regard to the US-Iran imbroglio, while it is certainly extremely far-fetched to suggest that World War-III is just around the corner, one can also safely assume that the existing stalemate is not going to last forever and probably the situation is going to get far worse, before it gets better. This is more so if in the coming months the Iranians attempt to utilise their considerable irregular warfare assets to force the Americans out of Iraq, if not the Middle East. Escalation in tensions would then be unavoidable and that would have serious repercussions, with unintended and unpredictable consequences for the world at large.

In this context we would do well to recall the innocuous events that triggered one of the darkest chapters in world history, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife by a 19-year-old Serbian terrorist, Gavrilo Princip. While that event may have occurred in far-away Sarajevo, it did set the world aflame, bringing untold misery to tens of millions over the next four years. It would indeed be unfortunate if this tragedy were to be repeated.

1,18-1-20,States also responsible for economic growth,"If we take stock of all the major areas which need improvement for attracting investment then, barring fiscal and monetary policies, almost all the key items are either in the State List or the Concurrent List of the Constitution

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present her first full Union Budget on February 1 and people are expecting some out of the box initiatives to stimulate the economic growth of the country. Some of the key macroeconomic indicators like the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, tax collection, credit growth and so on, indicate that the economy is grappling with a slowdown which is largely due to a decline in demand.

Global trade protectionism, a looming oil crisis and a rise in retail inflation are further aggravating the situation. Given the current economic scenario, it would be too optimistic to believe that growth will jump and the private sector will start investing all of a sudden in the coming fiscal.

India has a federal structure where sufficient autonomy has been given to State Governments. This autonomy is not just for making legislations and administration over the territory but it extends to the fiscal arena also. The States are getting their fair share of revenue after the implementation of the recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission.

Our constitutional mechanism empowers the State Governments to deal with the matters which come under the State List, as per the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, and they have joint control over the matters coming under the Concurrent List.

Despite the enormous powers given to States and the responsibility entrusted upon the State Legislature, it is a fact that whenever the question of economic growth arises, people always look to the Union Government. The fact that the union is nothing but a sum of all States should be appreciated and, therefore, the journey towards economic prosperity is the equal responsibility of both the Centre and the States. A common man doesn’t want to be entangled in a tug of war between warring politicians but unfortunately, gaining and retaining power is more important for people who are sitting at the helm of affairs than the welfare of the people who put them there.

There is a general perception that a State which is ruled by the same political faction for a relatively longer period offers far more policy certainty and enhances its ability to attract investors. It is also perceived that having a Government of the same party/coalition at both the Centre and State helps in the unimpeded growth of the State.

However, if we see the data for the two most populous States of the country viz. Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Bihar, then these notions will prove to be a myth.

Bihar has been continuously ruled by Nitish Kumar for the last 15 years (except for a short while when Jitan Ram Manjhi was at the helm).

In the case of UP, most of the time the State was ruled by Governments which had allies at the Centre.

However, despite this favourable political environment, these States are not doing well economically and are called the BIMARU States. This means that the State-level politicians are not doing good enough work for their development. This lackadaisical attitude of State Governments stems from the fact that economic growth and job creation are considered the sole responsibility of the Union Government, which it is not.

For Chief Ministers it is easy to pass the buck on to the Centre in case questions regarding the economy and development are asked.

The persona-centric politics of the major parties like the BJP and the Congress is also to be blamed for not grooming the State leadership and not pushing regional leaders to present a development role model for others.

The people of the country all want jobs and a higher income and a better quality of life. For this, we have to start making State-level leaders accountable and question their inability to deliver on their promises made during the election campaigns.

Economic reforms are an ongoing process and investors continuously evaluate various investment options before committing their resources. Land and labour reforms are the most critical of all the structural changes which this country needs. Land comes under the State List and matters related to labour are part of the Concurrent List. Among various things, an investor looks for infrastructure and the law and order situation. These two vital prerequisites for development also fall under the domain of States. If we take stock of all the major areas which need improvement for attracting investment then, barring fiscal and monetary policies, almost all the key items are either in the State List or the Concurrent List of the Constitution.

The rural economy and the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector are facing severe distress. The rural economy is largely driven by agricultural activities and as a matter of fact, the farm sector accounts for almost half of the workforce employed in our country and contributes 18 per cent to the GDP. Similarly, the MSME sector contributes almost 29 per cent to the GDP and more than 45 per cent of product exports come from this sector. State Governments are uniquely positioned to understand local needs and tailor schemes as per those requirements, including tax concessions by reducing State Goods and Services Tax rates. Central schemes are applied across the country and “one size fits all” may not be true in every situation.

If India has to grow, then State Governments should take ownership for development and people should also ask regional leaders to deliver on their promises. This nation belongs to all and therefore development is the collective responsibility of all of us, particularly those who have been given the mandate to rule.

2,18-1-20,Need to objectify history,"As India charters its course through the 21st century, the liberation we all need is not from the glories of the past but from its burdens — communal, economic and psychological

Why, when the nation should be focussing all its resources on remedying its economic slowdown in a fascinating but disruptive world driven by automation and Artificial intelligence (AI), should we continue to be obsessed with the past? Well, because history is no longer the sole purview for reclusive academics tucked away amid lengths of dust-laden bookshelves. It’s being revisited and morphed, bandied about by politicians and re-branded in the media everyday. It’s used as a veritable psychological battleground and there’s a war, for our allegiance. It’s a campaign characterised by selective erasure, of highlighting specific events, the systematic reduction of historical figures to mere unidimensional labels and retro-fitting them into contemporary political positions.

Take the case of Dara Shukoh, the would-be emperor of Hindustan, haloed in his timeless promise of ideal kingship. The traditional tack of pitting him against his nemesis, Aurangzeb, has imploded in recent times. So much so that even the debate of “good Muslim versus bad Muslim, good Mughal versus bad Mughal” has faded away. Dara Shukoh, rescued from centuries of indifference, has re-emerged in his new avatar as “the emblem of Indianness”, confident and consummate. Dara the eternal victim is a notion of the past and we can all pretend that his belligerent brother never existed. Ample reasons are being furnished for this new, posthumous khitab. The Mughal prince was a deeply syncretic thinker, accomplished scholar, poet and a theologian of unusual merit; a calligraphist and connoisseur of the fine arts as well as a dutiful son and warm-hearted family man.

The first stumbling block comes in the nature of an anachronistic fallacy: The idea of retrospectively imposing the concept of “Indianness” — and by corollary, nationhood and nation-state and more specifically, the personification thereof in the form of a deified “Bharat Mata” — onto the Mughal empire of the 17th century. The fact is that in our land, the consciousness of nationhood has evolved as the end-result of a much later historical process: The idealistic, patriotic reaction to the brutal British colonial experience and rather more tenuous associations with 19th century European history such as the Germanic Freiheitzkampf (freedom struggle) during the Napoleonic regime. This is brought out very clearly in Sugata Bose’s book, The Nation as Mother and Other Visions of Nationhood.

There is, however, another challenge. The cherry-picking of only the syncretic attributes of Dara completely leaves out other aspects of his personality. He was habitually cold and arrogant towards the mass of courtiers and commanders, who he felt, were intellectually inferior to him. He was highly superstitious by nature, easily swayed by mystery, magic and all manner of self-styled godmen, a conspicuously uninspiring military commander and an alarmingly poor judge of human character. One can well wonder whether, even assuming he had managed to ascend the throne, his eclectic nature but indifference towards administrative and military matters would have enabled him to hold the empire together. In the years between 1654 and September 1657, when Shah Jahan fell grievously ill — the War of Succession broke out soon thereafter — Dara was the de facto ruler of the empire. This period was characterised by moves to thwart campaigns of territorial expansion in the Deccan and Kashmir, coupled with a reclusive temperament and highly creative outpouring of a philosophical nature. In terms of court politics, Dara displayed a steady, cold hostility towards the senior imperial advisors and commanders and his mutually acrimonious exchanges with the seasoned wazir, Saadullah Khan, almost mirrors the rivalry between the crown prince Salim (later, the emperor Jahangir) and Abul Fazl. But the moot question is: Would the current unidimensional narrative about Dara have even brought up these other facets of his personality and objectively looked at the man in the context of his times?

Separated from Dara Shukoh by almost two-and-a-half centuries but basking in this same Lazarus light is Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. Stymied through the prime of his life by the draconian prisons of the British Raj and then after Independence, even posthumously, by a succession of Congress-led Governments, only in recent years has his release from oblivion taken place. The image of the controversial political leader has been resurrected by the present administration to larger-than-life proportions and with it, his ethos of Hindutva.

This very term has come to denote a number of aspects in our common perception, the re-establishment of rituals and religious practices (including the cult of cow worship) in the heart of societal life, the retention — and at times, deepening — of the fault-lines of caste and a steadfast advocacy of vegetarianism, among other things. Consequently, the image of Savarkar looms before us as an austere, conservative traditionalist, steeped in the rituals of his faith, a sort of archetypal Hindu counterpoint to the ulema. And politically, a Hindu Jinnah.

But is that who he was, in reality? A recent biography, sourcing the treatises, letters and speeches of this polemic leader in the original Marathi, reveals a very different picture. Savarkar’s conception of Hindutva, the book informs us, was essentially political, a move to galvanise the eternally splintered Hindu communities into a homogenous whole — and not an ultra-religious manifesto. In Savarkar’s credo, the key to achieving this was the uniting and unionising of the Hindu polity, across caste lines. Far from being a traditionalist, this high-caste Chitpavan Brahmin established a Patit Pavan temple open to all castes, organised inter-caste dinners and marriages and did not personally care for rituals, including that of cow worship. In this more objective narrative, Savarkar emerges not as a fanatic but an astute rationalist, who rejected the Gandhian project, and wholeheartedly espoused industrialisation as the vehicle of progress in the future.

A significant aspect of Savarkar’s life, unravelled in the biography, further belies the unidimensional label adduced to him. In The Indian War of Independence, his first major literary work that catapulted him to fame — and in the eyes of the colonial rulers, notoriety — he presented his narrative as a unified uprising against the British oppressors, stemming from a strong sense of nationhood. Savarkar’s position in this book is unambiguously secular — Hindu satraps and commanders had rallied in unison against the British under the flag of the Muslim Mughal titular monarch, Bahadur Shah Zafar. There’s no hint of any deep-seated hatred of the Muslims, which henceforth became the quintessential trait associated with him. In fact, it was only later, triggered by particular experiences and tribulations during his long incarceration in the Cellular Jail of the Andamans, that Savarkar developed his animosity towards the Muslims.

We’re now faced with a lingering, larger question, which is central to this whole issue. Is there still a purpose to all this indulging in history in today’s world? The Churchillian, though unoriginal, viewpoint purported to answer this question: “Those who fail to learn from history are condemned to repeat it.” But such aphorisms have long since dissolved into clichés.

Contemporary thinkers such as Yuval Noah Harari are not only more ambitious, they’re also more persistent when demanding our participation: “Though historians occasionally try their hand at prophecy (without notable success), the study of history aims above all to make us aware of possibilities we don’t normally consider. Historians study the past not in order to avoid repeating it — or perpetuate it — but in order to be liberated from it.”

As India charters its course through the 21st century, the liberation we all need is not from the glories of the past but from its burdens — communal, economic and psychological.

3,18-1-20,Talks with Pakistan?,"While UNSC backs India on Kashmir and insists on it being discussed bilaterally, our SCO invite is a smart move

Pakistan may have nudged its all-weather friend China into raising the Kashmir dispute at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) yet again — perhaps going by Western concerns about the continued lockdowns in the erstwhile State that is now a Union Territory — but failed with a big thud. This is the second time that such an attempt, either in the nature of informal consultations or closed door meetings of the Council’s permanent members, has been thwarted convincingly. The message is quite clear. The remaining Big Four (US, Russia, France, UK) are still committed to their position that Kashmir is a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan to be settled within the paradigm of dialogue set by existing agreements among the neighbours. It also means that the UK and the US, while responding to criticism on shutdown in the Valley, have delinked it from the larger Kashmir question and would much rather address it one-to-one. At the same time, certain facts cannot be ignored like China being allowed to raise the issue despite no significant change in collective viewpoints. Or that Pakistan’s lobbying is high-pitch, with its Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi believed to be in New York while China moved the motion. He even met the UN Secretary-General. Clearly, given the emphasis on bilaterals, at some point both India and Pakistan have to sit across the table and look to engage with each other. Perhaps, India’s invitation to Pakistan for a meeting of the regional alliance called Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is an opportunity to thaw relations and set up some sort of interaction on the sidelines. Besides, China is scheduled to take over the rotational presidency at UNSC in March and without some movement from India, it will have no point to neutralise Pakistan with, much as it would want to keep its working relationship with India going. Besides, it has to show something for giving assent to the declaration of Jaish chief Masood Azhar as a UN-designated global terrorist. China and Pakistan back each other up on the world stage, representing each other in official groups of nations where the other is not present. For instance, Pakistan stands up for China in the Non-Aligned Movement and in return, it gets China’s veto power in the UNSC.

India’s bigger challenge though is to manage the SCO, where both China and Pakistan are key members, for its strategic imperatives. Already, we have made noises about jointly strengthening the fight against terrorism, extremism, drug trafficking and organised crime to corner Pakistan as a sponsor of terror. India has to also walk cautiously on economic cooperation with members and ensure that China does not surreptitiously ensure its overlordship as the latter has proposed a free trade area for all. Most members are yet to feel comfortable on multi-lateral trade and cooperation. Besides, all other SCO members have embraced the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which India is opposing. In fact, Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan formed the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), which has signed a non-preferential trade and economic cooperation agreement with China. For all of India’s efforts to highlight its connectivity corridors, like the Chabahar port and India-Myanmar-Thailand highway, Pakistan will always counter their significance with that of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Negotiating terrain with both Pakistan and China, India must find its feet in the SCO if it wants to strengthen its footprint in Central Asia, a diplomatic initiative that the Modi Government is keen on. India’s other counter-balancing act is between Russia and China, both of whom have come closer but are wary of eating into each other’s sphere of influence. India can be the counterweight and use that status to extract its gains. Besides, India needs to work on its economic heft vis-a-vis the SCO majors. Our trade with Russia stands at about a little over $10 billion and is projected to be $30 billion by 2025. In contrast, China’s trade with Russia has already crossed $100 billion. A similar lopsided volume prevails with Central Asian republics. The lack of connectivity has stifled energy cooperation between the hydrocarbon-rich region and India. We cannot miss the bus as the SCO accounts for 20 per cent of the world’s GDP and can guarantee its relevance in the region. But can its bilateral differences with Pakistan and China mean SCO members could set up their own mini-groupings of mutual benefit and derail its very purpose? That’s for India to understand and move adroitly.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/talks-with-pakistan--2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/talks-with-pakistan-.html
4,18-1-20,Bezos’ bummer trip,"From getting a Gandhi quote wrong to drawing the ire of the BJP, the Amazon CEO’s latest trip didn’t go that well

In terms of disastrous visits to India, Amazon’s Chief Executive Jeffery Bezos’s latest trip wasn’t quite up there. No, it will take a lot more to top the stupendous failure of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s visit a few years ago. Despite misquoting Gandhi. Yet, Bezos’ rap on the knuckles delivered by Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, where he straight up accused Amazon of funding its losses in India with its latest investment, was harsh. Even though Goyal was forced to backtrack and claimed that his quote was taken “out of context,” it was strange that a Minister, who speaks decent English, is taken out of context time and again. But the message was clear: Bezos’ ownership of The Washington Post and articles published by it against Prime Minister Narendra Modi counted against him. Also the fact that the BJP still draws huge support from the trading community, which has deeply been affected by the advent of online retailing, has meant that Bezos has had a problematic visit to the country this time. He has even eschewed both the Government and media interactions. Indeed, Bezos’ most high-profile interactions were in Mumbai where he celebrated the success of Amazon’s video streaming service Amazon Prime with Bollywood’s elite and the honchos of several Indian conglomerates.

While Goyal was surprised by the way some reacted to his comments, they did have an element of truth. Although reactions were delivered with the grace of a dancer wearing work boots and quickly retracted, there was no hiding from the fact that the Government wanted Bezos to know it is not very happy with Amazon and his ownership of The Washington Post. While Bezos is unlikely to interfere in the editorial process of his newspaper, it is also clear that he needs India as a market. Most American internet giants are locked out of China and India is the “it” market. This is the case not just for Amazon but also Google, Facebook and Uber. And as India becomes more aware of this, it will flex its muscles economically. Recent actions against Malaysia are a case in point and a decision is also likely to be taken against Turkey for its support to Pakistan-sponsored separatists. It is unlikely that India will act against Amazon in the immediate future but the firm does need to answer some questions as to how it is abusing (or not) its market position. The BJP, too, should understand that it cannot control the narrative in the foreign media. It needs to have better spokespersons who can defend the Government’s position or change perceptions.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bezos----bummer-trip-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/bezos----bummer-trip.html
5,18-1-20,CM to officers: Treat people with dignity,"Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Friday advised senior government officials to treat people with dignity and in a professional and ethical manner.

“Every person visiting any institution will be treated with dignity and his issues have to be treated in a professional and ethical manner,” said he while addressing a senior officers’ conference at the Lok Seva Bhawan here.

Patnaik also administered an oath to this effect to all officers present at the conference.

He said people are the real masters and those who work in the Government are paid by them. “People are the soul of democracy. Every institution in a democracy is for the people created by their money to empower and serve them,” he observed. Patnaik described the senior officers of the Government as ‘the drivers of the transformation agenda’.

“I have a family of four and a half crore people of Odisha. With their blessings, I am serving them for the last 20 years. I want our children to have quality education, our brothers and sisters to have good jobs and our elders to have good healthcare facilities,” the Chief Minister stated.

Patnaik told the senior officers to share their transformational game-changing ideas with him.

On day-2 on Saturday, the officers would be engaged in outdoor and off-site learning situations in the Eco Retreat camp at Konark. They would have field-level experience sharing and motivational talks on citizen-centric governance, people’s empowerment and ethical service delivery.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-to-officers--treat-people-with-dignity.html
6,18-1-20,Road accident deaths reduced in Sambalpur,"Deaths due to road accidents have reduced appreciably in Sambalpur and it is below the stipulated target of Supreme Court of India, informed RTO of Sambalpur Lalit Mohan Behera during the Road Safety Committee meeting here where PD DRDA of Sambalpur, Sukant Kumar Tripathy presided.

“Number of deaths due to road accident in the year 2018 was 235. But it was 203 in 2019,” informed RTO Behera. “The Supreme Court gave the entire country a direction to reduce the accidental death rate at least by 10 per cent. But here in Sambalpur we have achieved more than 15 per cent and we are in efforts to decrease number of deaths further,” Behera added.

PD DRDA Tripathy asked the RTO, MVI, heads of the engineering departments and all the members present for implementation of all proposals taken in the meeting so that it could yield good results and save valuable lives. He also narrated the vulnerable points in the district showing some photographs where little precautions could avert accidents from rural to urban area.

It was further decided to sensitise the school and college students to obey traffic rules. Traffic symbols must be painted in each school boundary that can better guide small boys and girls including public, suggested Tripahty. He asked the District Education Officer (DEO) Meena Rani Mangal to ensure all schools to have such wall paintings.

Construction of FOBs (foot over bridges) in front of every school facing main road, under bridges in places where it is necessary including in front of the new RTO office at Naxapali, filling of the washed away portion near a bridge to Birsinghgarh, cutting old trees on road sides and many other proposals were taken. It was further discussed to improve the U trun at Bhalupali on SH 10, and the rumbles at Sarla on NH 53 to prevent accidents as they have been almost proved accident-prone zones.

All the members present also came up with specific suggestions to prevent accident and thereby save valuable lives. The members stressed on the need for fixing speed limit boards inside town, and SH and NH to curb speed driving.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/road-accident-deaths-reduced-in-sambalpur.html
7,18-1-20,Change or perish,"There is no alternative to sustainability and the present trajectory of economic growth divorced from environmental considerations is dragging us towards mass extinction

Despite the concerns of policymakers and planners regarding the efficient management of natural resources, the threat to them is growing exponentially by the day. This is because the country’s efforts towards market-led development are eating up our social, natural and cultural capital faster than ever. Unfortunately today, the core issue of a preferred pattern of growth is hidden behind the innocuous facade of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth as the supreme objective. Decisions on all matters related to development require the adoption of a holistic approach because the need for environmental improvement is not able to attract appropriate investments. This is mostly owing to the fact that they are essentially long-term in nature and their support to sustained economic growth is seldom appreciated or quantified. In a world which refuses to adopt the concept of a steady state of long-term economic growth, sustainability is seen as absurdity.

Gradually, however, the world is coming to realise that there is no alternative to sustainability and the present trajectory of economic growth divorced from environmental considerations is dragging us towards the reckless path of mass extinction. The fact remains that there is no alternative to a concerted effort towards sustainable management of natural resources that demands collective action at the regional, national and global level.

The key areas in which action is required are big investments designed towards land, water, and biodiversity conservation, apart from simultaneous reduction in emissions on a mass scale. That includes Herculean efforts in jealously safeguarding forests; reduction and diversion in investment in new sources of energy away from dirty sources like coal, crude and nuclear power; improvement in availability and affordability of public transport systems with metro and light rail systems everywhere; switching to material and energy-efficient houses; smart electrical grids carrying renewable energy and all these supported by massive research efforts to improve efficiencies as we move on. Considering the increase in the pressure on forests, sincere efforts to mobilise agroforestry initiatives coupled with adequate scientific support, extension and education in resource literacy are a must. This great leap, however, will necessitate the shedding of our preoccupation with short-term gains that creates hurdles in integrating economic growth-related issues and sustainable management of natural resources. In short, the planners have to accept without any inhibitions the holistic approach which considers ecology, economics and ethics as a part of a whole interconnected circle — which at present appears to have been broken.

A careful consideration of the policy impact of different sectors, the essential trade-off between different sectors for restoration and development of natural resources, would have created huge economic demand and job opportunities for a wider base of poor like tribals and others residing in far-flung areas. One cannot overlook the fact that the economic health of any society or country in the ultimate analysis is supported by its basic ecological status.

Let us take forests as their management is important. However, effective linkage of forestry with other important sectors of the economy is not yet in place. Forest-based activities have largest forward and backward economic linkages. Just to elaborate: Along with the flexibility of capital, skill and energy requirement; it has a spectrum of activities, ranging from value-addition activity at the household level to micro industries and small sawmills to forest-based industries and to a totally computerised ayurvedic drug as also the paper industry. Policy measures and activities in other sectors mar the ability of the forests to perform their economic, social and environmental roles, as much as the policies set in forestry do.

In fact, policy decisions taken outside the forestry sector may be detrimental or beneficial for effective functioning of services from forests on a long-term basis. Let us take, for example, the development of infrastructure. The policy instruments attempting modernisation of transport, telecommunication and highways do create both positive and negative impacts for forest conservation and development. They do improve forest firefighting and public awareness of environmental issues but also create backlash in the shape of forest degradation. Pucca roads through forest habitats serve as barrier for dissemination of pollen grains, mating of smaller animals and recharging of underground water reserves, loss of hybrid vigour due to inbreeding and related extinction, noise and other disturbances resulting in the decline of reproduction or mating of many wildlife species. Measures are needed to strengthen the positive impacts and reduce the negative fallouts.

Careful planning and strict implementation could avoid many such backlashes. Provision of compensatory afforestation elsewhere can never be a substitute for loss of natural forest and its ecosystem services at the point of concern.

An overarching policy of creating a platform for dialogue can remove barriers between sectors and institutions currently working with different myopic mandates. Understanding of involved tradeoffs in natural ecosystems and benefits of harmony among forestry and other land-based sectors are urgently needed. Canada already has the provision for removing barriers between institutions and orienting them towards a philosophy of common goals. An outcome of this is a model forest programme in which forests are managed by a partnership of diverse interest groups of industry, conservationists, community, aboriginals and so on.

Professional forestry in a country like India needs a radical change. Our Government, committed to social justice, has so far failed to adequately recognise that the services needed by people cannot come from the Forest Department staffed by men trained as professional foresters in the core subject.

It is well understood by now that forest ecosystems have multifarious roles to play in helping the country in halting the downward spiral of land degradation; in restoring the vitality of the land; in protecting land from wind and water erosion; in job creation in far-flung areas; in carbon sequestration and of course in combatting climate change-related problems.

A location-specific proper model of agroforestry can promote and sustain an intrinsically-sustainable and resilient agriculture system especially under marginal conditions. There is a whole range of local problems of forestry that requires different solutions based on different strategies. Placements of Indian Forest Service Officers in different development Ministries are adequate proof of the fact that forestry professionals can handle various dimensions of administrative work. Their special inputs, in fact, through provision of new insights in relating conservation and sustainable management of natural resources to their respective sectors of economy will be their most worthwhile contribution to the country.

Gradually provisions are being made for placement of environmental personnel in industries and other Government departments too. Their roles, more often than not, are generally confined towards pollution abatement measures. It will be better if they are designated as natural resource managers with additional mandate of looking at the use or abuse of natural resources for sustainable development. In addition, the time has come for university courses to be re-designed and made compulsory in all branches of education apart from promoting and subsidising the courses of management of natural resources on a sustainable base as the core subject.

The horizon of knowledge about natural resources is ever-expanding and accordingly conservation is reinventing itself. New models in forestry as well as agriculture incorporating the role of trees that are known to exert an influence far beyond their immediate environment, can go a long way to save the farmers from committing suicides and help them go ahead on the path of sustainable development.

Conservation of resources and sustainable development is the bedrock of survival of mankind but conservation today is much more than merely a choice in favour of one’s long-term economic self-interest.

It entails moral choices and responsibilities, too, involving the community of all life forms in the company of which we have evolved and to which we essentially belong. Further, it has to be alive to the issues of inter-generational equity. Conservation and sustainable management of natural resources, within this perspective, is a radical endeavour to save Earth itself and that will essentially have to derive strength from knowledge, ethical value, wealth of our dreams and an understanding of nature as a sacred space.

8,18-1-20,IAS officer arrest: Wife alleges conspiracy,"After almost three weeks of the arrest of IAS officer Bijay Ketan Upadhyaya in a corruption case, his doctor-wife Tushima Mishra on Friday came out alleging that her husband was innocent and he was a victim of a conspiracy. Refusing to name the conspirators, Dr Mishra, who is a doctor in a Government hospital, also apprehended that there is a threat to her career also.

Upadhyaya, who was working as Director of Horticulture, was arrested by the Vigilance police last month for allegedly seeking a bribe of Rs 1 lakh from a supplier through a manager of a private bank. The manager of the bank, which services the accounts of the horticulture department, was also arrested by the Vigilance in the same case.

Speaking to the media, the IAS officer’s wife questioned her husband’s arrest pointing out that the alleged bribe money was reportedly recovered from the bank manager’s possession. “My husband is an honest officer and he had no role in the said corruption case,” she said repeatedly but refused to name the conspirators.

Ever since his arrest on December 30, Upadhyaya is in judicial remand except only the five days of initial police remand. His bail applications have been rejected by the vigilance court as well as the Khurda District Sessions Court. Also questioning the conduct of the Public Prosecutor during the course of hearings of her husband’s bail pleas in the lower courts, Tushima said her husband was mocked in the courtroom as if he was a terrorist or a rapist.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ias-officer-arrest--wife-alleges-conspiracy.html
9,18-1-20,"State to get Rs 1,850 cr from mining firms","On the basis of recent direction of the Supreme Court, more than Rs 1,850 crore may come to Odisha State treasury. After hearing two interlocutory applications, a three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde has passed such order.

Notably, an organisation namely Common Cause had knocked the door of justice in the year 2014 to curb illegal mining in the country. In this case Sarda Mines Pvt. Ltd (SMPL) which was granted lease of Thakurani Block-B iron ore mines in Keonjhar district approached the apex court seeking appropriate direction for resumption of its mining operation which was stopped since March, 2014.

Earlier as per the direction of the apex court, the Central Environment Committee (CEC) had inquired into the matter and submitted its report in 2019 indicating 135,34,703 tons of excess/illegal mining of iron ore by SMPL in violation of environmental clearance granted by the Union Environment and Forest Ministry.

Accordingly the CEC in its report stated that the SMPL is liable to pay Rs 933,60,79,689 in terms of judgment of the apex court. Thereafter, another committee in its report noted that there was no violation of legal provision with respect to mining by SMPL.

The SMPL argued before the SC that the company had suffered irreparable injury because of closer of the mine for more than five and a half years. Therefore, the company prayed the court to allow them to resume mining operations on certain conditions.

After hearing of the matter at length, the SC granted one month time to SMPL to deposit the dues as assessed by CEC on May 8 last.

Further the court directed SMPL to file an undertaking to comply with all the rules, regulations and other mandatory provisions for carrying out mining operations.

Another company namely Mideast through another interim application prayed the SC to permit them to sell 23,51,027.83 tons of iron ore which had been stacked at the dispatched site within the lease hold area and to permit them to deposit the consideration money received from the buyers to the State of Odisha towards demand notice.

Mideast was granted licence for setting up a pig iron and steel manufacturing plant near Duburi. The company was also granted mining lease over 104.68 hectares of Roida-1 iron ore mine near Barbil in Keonjhar district which is valid till 31.03.2020.

Notwithstanding the statutory embargo the Mideast extracted mineral over and above the permissible limit. As the company was found liable to compensate for the illegal extraction, a demand notice for payment of Rs 924,75,24,283 to be paid by 31.12.2017 was served upon. The mining operation was stopped from January 1, 2018 by which date extracted mineral of more than 23.51 lakh ton was stacked in the mining area.

The company approached the court to permit them to sell their stacked iron ore under supervision of State authorities and to deposit the sell proceeds towards outstanding dues. The court in its order allowed the Mideast to sell the iron ore already mined and stacked by it before January 1, 2018 under supervision of an authority to be appointed by the Odisha Government.

The court has categorically held that the sell proceeds in this regard is to be deposited with the Special Purpose Vehicle (OMBADC) towards State arrears. The State Government is also directed to appoint supervisory authority within two weeks and the sell process shall preferably be completed within two months thereafter.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-to-get-rs-1-850-cr-from-mining-firms.html

Vehicular movements on the road came to a grinding halt for around two hours after the tusker, which strayed out of the forest along the main road near Patugadia. The animal was seen chasing the commuters. In a video of the incident, the elephant can also be seen flipping a motorcycle, parked on the roadside by a reporter, who had gone there to cover the incident. The vehicle was partially damaged.

A huge crowd gathered on both sides of the road and screamed in a bid to drive away the elephant. Vehicular movements resumed when the jumbo went back into the forest.

According to reports, after being separated from a herd, the pachyderm has been straying into human habitation for the last two months. It was seen roaming in Talcher town two days ago.

11,18-1-20,Police submit charge sheet against 3 accused,"The Commissionerate police on Friday submitted charge-sheet against three persons in connection with the attack on the Sikh businessman at Laxmisagar in the city on Tuesday.

Report of the Medical Officer, CCTV footages and witnesses’ statements are being relied upon in the case while a prayer has been made by the law enforcement agency before the Court of SDJM here for early cognisance and trial, police sources said.

Notably, the accused, identified as Sankar Rout, Deepak Mohanty and Deepak Jena, were arrested, but they later secured bail in a matter of a few hours.

Assault victim Parvinder Pal Singh has claimed that police did not book the attackers under stringent sections of the IPC, including Section 307 (attempt to murder), for which they were granted bail. He further accused the Commissionerate police of having a nexus with the accused resulting in inadequate action against them.

Singh had been assaulted by a group of youths despite the presence of police at the spot. The attack followed when he asked occupants of a car to move the vehicle as it was parked on road near an apartment causing inconvenience in vehicular movement.

However, they abused Singh, following which he sought the help of police by dialling 100. As cops reached the spot in a PCR van, Singh went near the policemen to apprise them about the matter.

But the accused thrashed Singh and hit his head and eye with a stone injuring him grievously.

14,18-1-20,Let not curative petition be ground to delay justice,"This Tuesday, the Supreme Court dismissed a curative petition of two of the four death row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case, which paved for their execution along with two other convicts. It was the unanimous decision of the bench of Justices NV Ramana, Arun Mishra, RF Nariman, R Banumathi and Ashok Bhushan that there was no merit in the curative petition of Vinay Kumar Sharma and Mukesh Singh seeking reconsideration of death sentence awarded.

Both of them had moved a curative petition in the apex court after a trial court in Delhi issued death warrant in their name scheduling their date of execution to January 22. However, both of them moved to the President of India with mercy petition but the President rejected one of the accused Mukesh Singh’s mercy plea on Januray 17, latest by the time of writing of this piece of article. But this is not the end of the process of postponement of execution for now, since the other two accused persons haven’t yet filed the curative petitions or mercy pleas.

On the judicial side, a curative petition is the last constitutional remedy available to a person whose review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court. Constitution quite explicitly speaks about the review power under Article 137; however, it is completely silent about the ‘curative power’. This is in fact an act of judicial innovation and has come to existence in the case of Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra and another, where the apex court innovated this to prevent miscarriage of justice and abuse of process. The curative power of the court flows from Article 142 of the Constitution, which actually gives the power to optimise the process of justice delivery by doing complete justice. In the case of Rupa Hurra, the Constitution bench of the Supreme Court observed, ""We are of the view that though Judges of the highest court do their best, subject of course to the limitation of human fallibility, yet situations may arise, in the rarest of the rare cases, which would require reconsideration of a final judgment to set right miscarriage of justice complained of. In such case it would not only be proper but also obligatory both legally and morally to rectify the error.""

The bench further remarked, ""Rectification of an order thus stems from the fundamental principle that justice is above all. It is exercised to remove the error and not for disturbing finality. When the Constitution was framed the substantive power to rectify or recall the order passed by the apex court was specifically provided by Article 137 of the Constitution. And Article 145(c) permitted the apex court to frame rules as to the conditions subject to which any judgment or order may be reviewed.” And while putting primacy over the need to uphold the cause of justice, it observed, “The court is thus not precluded from recalling or reviewing its own order if it is satisfied that it is necessary to do so for the sake of justice.”

While dealing with this case the court has relied on the Latin maxim “actus curiae neminem gravabit”, which means an act of the court shall prejudice no one. The applicability of this maxim is attracted when the court is set under an obligation to rectify a wrong committed by the act of the court itself.

Actually, the curative petition is a means to request the court to rethink and revise their own decision once the review petition is dismissed or not considered. However, the court has adopted a cautious approach in considering such petitions. The Supreme Court has clearly stated that such petitions may be used in rarity and to ensure it, it has framed guidelines for filing of the petition, and has further reiterated that such petitions to be entertained only when there is a gross violation of natural justice. While writing his concurring judgment in the Rupa Hurra Case, Justice Banerjee added that, “Curative petitions ought to be treated as a rarity rather than regular.”

As a precautionary measure, it is laid down that, the grounds for filing such a petition to be clearly verified and certified by a senior advocate. The same is to be reviewed by three senior most judges along with the judges who passed the direction or judgment and if the majority so opines that there is a violation, the curative petition is to be allowed.

Another significant feature of the curative petition is that, there is no limitation in filing of the petition, but it should be filed within reasonable period of time. One of the instances where curative petition was allowed is Navneet Kaur Vs State of NCT of Delhi, where the curative petition was filed by the wife of the convict against the dismissal of a review petition, where she had prayed for setting aside the death sentence since there was an inordinate delay of 8 years in disposal of the mercy petition. The Supreme Court in this case allowed the curative petition by commuting the death sentence to life imprisonment on the ground of such inordinate delay and on the ground of insanity.

The courts have always well acknowledged and therefore ruled out the state of absolute infallibility of the judges, since man is to err is as much an axiom, as other axioms of nature. So, the judicial apparatus of curative petition has been devised and designed as a last remedy or course correction in case of an prejudice or any other form of injustice that might have crept-in, even while delivering justice after last scrutiny in the penultimate stage of review.

However, the noble intent behind curative petitions shouldn’t be allowed as a means to frustrate the process of justice. Therefore, it is expedient that, when such petition is being filed by the convicts in rarest of rare crimes, it should be barred by limitation, which may suitably be stipulated by law and in such cases, where there are more than one convict for the same cause of action and offence, separate curative petitions shouldn’t be allowed. And if any of them prefers not to proceed with the curative petition at the same time with the other or others, his right to file the petition should be deemed to have been waived by choice. This shall defeat the dilatory tactics adopted by the convicts in such cases and shall credibly uphold the ends of justice.

“Naveen Patnaik is with the BJP Government (at the Centre). The BJD is supporting the Union Government on every issue. It supported the Citizenship Amendment Bill in Parliament but ambiguously refused to implement the NRC,” said Singh at a Press meet here.

He said people’s representatives hardly rule the State now. “Ministers and MLAs have no accesses to the Chief Minister. The IAS officer, who has become the 5-T Secretary, is taking all the decisions,” he alleged.

To a question as to which party is Congress’ main rival, Singh said, “It is the BJP at the Centre and the BJP-BJD combine in Odisha.”

Hitting out at the NDA Government at the Centre, Singh, who is now Chairman of Parliamentary Committee on Urban Development, said, “There was no requirement of the CAA at all. The Government has enacted the law to avoid people’s attention towards price rise, unemployment and economic slowdown and its all other failures.”

24,18-1-20,States will have to implement new citizenship law: Om Birla,"Amid the raging controversy over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said that citizenship was a subject of the Centre as per the Constitution of India and all state governments would have to implement the new citizenship law passed by both Houses of Parliament in December last year.

Birla also said the unlimited rights of state assembly speakers on anti-defections law were likely to be curtailed as courts had made adverse comments on the conduct of speakers of several state assemblies on the disqualification of MLAs.

Kerala and Punjab state assemblies have passed resolutions against the implementation of the CAA while other opposition-ruled state have announced that they would not implement the new citizenship law.

“The rights and subjects of the Centre and the states are clearly defined in the Constitution. The states can enact legislation on the subjects listed in the State List while the Centre alone can enact laws on the subjects listed in Central List of the Constitution. Both states and the Centre can enact a legislation on subjects mentioned in the Concurrent List,” the Lok Sabha Speaker said here on Friday.

The CAA provides for granting citizenship to the persecuted minority communities like Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Parsi and Christian from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Exclusion of Muslims from these three countries has caused the controversy and sparked nation-wide protests.

“The issue of curtailing the unlimited rights of the presiding officers (speakers) of the state assemblies was discussed during the Dehradun conference of the presiding officers in 2018. A committee headed by PC Joshi, Speaker of the Rajasthan Assembly, is looking into the matter and as soon as the report is received, efforts will be made for consensus among all the speakers of the state assemblies for curtailing the unlimited rights of the presiding officers of the state assemblies,” Om Birla said.

He said the idea behind curtailing the powers of the speakers was seamless and meaningful conduct of the proceedings of the legislature.

He said another committee headed by UP Assembly Speaker HN Dikshit was working on ways and means to end the frequent disruptions leading to adjournment of the proceedings of the legislature.

“If consensus is arrived at, rules will be framed for dealing with the disruptions in the House,” he said.

The Lok Sabha Speaker said a conference of the presiding officers of state assemblies and parliamentary affairs ministers would also be organised soon and the report of the three committees would be placed in the conference for reaching a consensus on the findings of the committees.

Om Birla said the research and reference wing of the Lok Sabha secretariat, in association with the state assemblies, was working on a project for digitisation of the records of the proceedings of Parliament and state assemblies so that the entire record was available on one platform to the people. He said records of 40 lakh debates of the Lok Sabha had so far been digitised and the work was likely to be completed by the end of the 2020.

The Lok Sabha Speaker said for ensuring accountability of the executive towards the legislature, a conference of the chairpersons of Public Accounts Committees (PAC) of all legislatures would be held next year. He said the members of the PACs of all state assemblies would also attend the conference apart from economists and experts.

He said the idea behind the conference was to ensure proper utilisation of budgetary grants so as to benefit the common man.

“The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) meeting also decided that for capacity building of the elected representatives, regular training programme for MLAs will be organised by the Lok Sabha secretariat in next three years. Similar programmes are also proposed to be organised for the other elected representatives of urban local bodies and three-tier panchayat institutions so that they conduct their affairs in more organised manner after debate over the budget and its utilisation,” Birla said",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/states-will-have-to-implement--new-citizenship-law--om-birla.html

26,18-1-20,CPA India Region Conference concludes Patel: Legislators judged on basis of their works,"The two-day seventh conference of Commonwealth Parliamentary Association’s India Region on ‘Role of Legislators’ concluded here on Friday.

Thirty-five delegates from various branches of CPA India Region and also from Australia and South East Asia Region participated in the event. Besides several ministers, as many as 270 members of Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Sabha and Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Parishad attended the two-day conference.

Addressing the valedictory function, UP Governor Anandiben Patel said that the nature of the legislatures had changed over the years.

“The legislature is not only doing the work of law-making but is also at the forefront of the economic and social change. The role of people’s representatives as members of the legislative bodies has also undergone sea change,” Patel said.

“Legislators are judged on the basis of their works and actions in and outside the House. They are thus expected to understand social problems and play a leading role in their redressal through legislatures and Parliament. As the people’s representatives, it is necessary that they use parliamentary traditions, rules and procedures in such a way that the development work and the welfare of the public is ensured,” she added.

Thanking the delegates for their lively and meaningful participation in the deliberations of the conference, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, in his valedictory address, said that such exchange of ideas and experiences helped in consolidating and strengthening democracy by overcoming challenges faced by legislators.

Birla underlined that legislative institutions were credible platforms for highlighting the concerns, hopes and aspirations of the common people, which should be effectively voiced by their representatives on the floor of the House.

Referring to the first plenary of the conference viz. ‘capacity building of legislators for scrutinising budgetary proposals’, Birla said that the legislatures should act as a watchdog on the financial accountability of the executive.

“For this, it is necessary that they have a better understanding of financial terminology and budgetary processes,” he added.

On the second plenary on ‘enhancing focus of legislators on legislative business’, Birla said that legislators should use all available procedural devices effectively.

He suggested that state legislatures should also consider conducting briefing sessions on legislative business during the sessions on the pattern introduced by the Lok Sabha.

Thanking the delegates, UP Assembly Speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit said that the mandate of legislators had increased with the changing times. He said that legislators should understand that knowledge and experience were important for performing their work.

Dikshit, however, cautioned the legislators that mere reading of the Constitution or the rules of the business of the proceedings of the assembly was not enough. “It is important that legislators participate in the proceedings of the House regularly and articulate their views in a dignified manner,” he said, adding that legislators should look at the House with a sense of respect and dedication.

Earlier on Friday, the conference took up discussion on enhancing focus of legislators on legislative business.

Delivering the keynote address, Union Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that legislators were primarily required to engage in law-making and therefore they must be able to identify a policy issue, potential legislative options to address that issue and consult relevant stakeholders.

Ensuring the accountability of the executive is also one of the core functions of the legislature. To perform these legislative responsibilities, it is imperative that legislators have access to sector-specific research support, he said.

The CPA India Region, which was earlier a part of CPA Asia Region, became an independent region from September 7, 2004. The India Region of CPA consists of the India Union Branch (Parliament of India) and 36 states/Union Territories branches. Such conferences of the CPA India Region are held once in two years and the sixth conference was held in 2018 in Patna.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cpa-india-region-conference-concludes--patel--legislators-judged--on-basis-of-their-works.html
27,18-1-20,Conference of CPA at Lucknow,"The speaker of Uttarakhand Vidhan Sabha Prem Chand Agarwal has said that increasing capacity of members of legislative bodies is important for success of parliamentary democracy in the country. He was speaking during the seventh conference of Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) at Uttar Pradesh (UP) Vidhan Sabha at Lucknow on Friday.

Speaking during the inaugural session, the Lok Sabha speaker, Om Birla said the responsibility of public representatives has increased in recent years with increase in faith of people in democracy.

The chief minister of UP, Yogi Adityanath said that disruption of the house not only obstruct the work of democratic institutions but also weaken the basic essence of democracy.

The Uttarakhand speaker said that the constitution has provided elaborate powers to the members of the assemblies for fulfilling their duties. He said that more than 100 amendments in the constitution suggest that the process of law making is sensitive and full of life. Agarwal regretted that the inclination of the members towards making laws is getting decreased and in absence of necessary homework, discussions on many bills which includes budget have become superficial.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/conference-of-cpa-at-lucknow.html
28,18-1-20,Missing Mumbai blasts convict held in Kanpur,"In a major breakthrough, the Anti-Terrorists Squad (ATS) of Uttar Pradesh Police nabbed dreaded Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist and Mumbai serial blasts convict Dr Jalish Ansari who jumped his parole from Mumbai and was trying to flee to Nepal through Uttar Pradesh border.

Director General of Police OP Singh disclosed that the missing terrorist, who is serving life term in Ajmer jail in Rajasthan, was arrested from Faithfulganj area of Kanpur City on Friday afternoon.

He said that the terrorist, who was involved in the Mumbai serial blasts of 1993 along with other terror attacks, was going to his native Amardova village in Sant Kabir Nagar district of UP and then would have escaped to Nepal.

“The police recovered Rs 47,780 in cash, his Aadhaar card, a mobile phone and a pocket diary from the possession of the terrorist,” the DGP said.

Dr Ansari was released on parole for 21 days on December 28, 2019 and had to return to jail on January 17. But on Thursday, Ansari did not go to Agtipara police station in Mumbai to register his attendance between 1000 hours to 1200 hours and his relatives said that they did not know about his whereabouts.

29,18-1-20,CM: FPOs to be opened in all UP gram panchayats,"With the aim of doubling the income of farmers in the next three years, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the goal of his government was to open Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) in all gram panchayats so that farmers could get an easy market at their doorsteps.

“The FPOs will be opened in all blocks of the state in the first phase, nyay panchayats in the second phase and in all village panchayats in the third phase. So far 336 FPOs have been opened. Through them, there will be a big change in the agriculture sector,” Yogi said while addressing a conference of progressive farmers in the Lok Bhawan auditorium here on Friday.

The chief minister said that Uttar Pradesh had all the resources but due to the apathy of the previous governments, the farmers were in a pitiable condition.

“The farmers were committing suicide and were not ready to continue with farming. In two years, we have been able to bring in a lot of change,” he said.

“We waived crop loans of up to Rs 1 lakh of small and marginal farmers during the first cabinet meeting and gave relief to potato farmers through market intervention scheme. Paddy and wheat were procured in record quantity at minimum support price (MSP) and the money was transferred to farmers’ accounts within 72 hours. So far, Rs 11,594.18 crore has been sent to the accounts of about 1.83 crore farmers under the Kisan Mandhan Yojana,” he said.

The chief minister said that during the previous governments, the payment of sugarcane farmers was stopped. “The mills were getting closed and being sold. We paid a record Rs 82,000 crore and opened new mills. Today 121 sugar mills are running instead of 116 in the state. Old sugar mills are being modernised and their capacity expanded. There is clear instruction to the mill owners that as long as there is sugarcane in the farmer’s field, the mills should function. This is the reason why the mills kept running till mid-June in the last crushing season,” he said.

The chief minister said that to increase the income of farmers, the emphasis is on maximum production at minimum cost. “That is why the efficient modes of irrigation, drip and sprinkler, are being made mandatory with boring schemes given on grant. Agricultural investment is being provided on time. Through the Krishi Vigyan Kendras and agricultural universities, farmers are being informed about the latest methods of farming. The results of all this is in front of us, he said.

Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, who was the chief guest, called for a change in the system so that farm production in the country could get international branding.

“The Centre as well as the UP government have taken several steps to double the income of the farmers but if the farmers get international branding of their produce, they will be more benefited,” he said.

Birla said that while the UP government had taken several steps to benefit the farmers, the Centre had already made 2022 as the year to hit the target of doubling the farmers income.

“But as everyone knows that agriculture requires hard labour, technology is needed for minimising this labour and also to increase the yield as well as the farmers’ income,” he said.

Talking about water scarcity in Bundelkhand region, which has been raised by Lok Sabha members frequently, Birla said the Yogi Adityanath government was trying to solve the decade-old issue and several schemes had been launched there.

“The government has launched innovative schemes to address the farmers’ woes and in coming days we are expected to get good results,” he added.

Welcoming the guests, UP’s Agriculture Minister Surya Pratap Shahi lauded the chief minister’s commitment towards the interest of farmers.

Shahi said that it was a result of Yogi’s commitment that record procurement of paddy and wheat was made at minimum support prices (MSP) and record cane payment was also made. “For the two consecutive years, UP has remained at number one position in the entire country in terms of food production. The state’s agricultural growth rate is at a record rate of 11.5 per cent,” he added.

On the occasion, the Lok Sabha speaker and the chief minister laid the foundation stone of Krishi Vigyan Kendra of Amroha and five Kisan Kalyan Kendras of Hardoi and Barabanki.

On the occasion, acceptance letter of FPO was given to many progressive farmers.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm--fpos-to-be-opened-in--all-up-gram-panchayats.html
30,18-1-20,Forest dept launches drive to trace missing tigress,"The forest department has launched a drive to trace tigress that has sneaked into the Basadera jungle or in the adjoining Dainmari jungle in Galudih, bordering Bengal.

Divisional forest officer (DFO), Jamshedpur, Abhishek Kumar said as there was no information of the fresh killing from the stretch of jungle in Galudih.

"" We are keeping an eye in jungles. We are not getting news of any fresh killing from the Bengal also, the forest officials of which are in regular touch with us,"" said Kumar.

The forest department officials were also planning to install camers at Basadera. "" Panic gripped after the tigress had killed an ox near Dharagiri falls in Basadera jungle on Monday evening. We had planned to install camera trap at strategic points around the carcass. We had assumed that the tigress will return to the carcass for eating it. As a team of forest official moved into the spot where the kill was lying, it found the kill missing,"" said Kumar.

He pointed out either the tigress might have dragged her kill to some new spot, dense into the jungle or a section of villagers removed the carcass for obtaining its skin).

A tigress had sneaked into the jungle of Dainmari in Galudih in Ghatshila sub-division, about 60 kms away from here from Bengal about a week ago when an ox had gone missing and a cow was left with a wound inflicted by its nails. Forest department officials also found pug marks near a water body at the dense Dainmari jungle.

33,18-1-20,"CM meets Union Ministers, seeks execution of works in U’khand","Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat met the Union Communications, Electronics and Information Technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Union minister for Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Prakash Javadekar and the Union Minister for Rural Development Narendra Singh Tomar in the national capital on Friday.

Meeting Prasad, the CM requested approval for the State’s proposal for Bharat Net phase II. Rawat said that under Bharat-Net phase II, the ministry is to facilitate connectivity through optical fibre to each Gram Panchayat.

However, as the project couldn’t be started on time order was received from USOF to execute it under public private partnership mode. For this a Rs 2,700 crore proposal was sent to the Government PSU PGCIL.

The USOF again requested the state to submit the proposal on the basis of state-led model, after which the state sent a Rs 1,914 crore proposal. Rawat pointed at the importance of connectivity considering the geography and border areas of the state. Stating this, he requested Prasad to ensure approval to the state’s proposal and funds on priority basis. Referring to the India Enterprise Architecture pilot project being undertaken in state like Meghalaya and Punjab, Rawat requested that some departments in Uttarakhand like education, health or agriculture also be included in this. This would be an achievement for providing better governance in the state, he said.

Meeting the Union Jal Shaktri minister, Rawat sought amendment or relaxation in standards for mountain states in the water for every farm scheme under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana. Renovation, strengthening and expansion of canals under the surface minor irrigation scheme should also be granted approval.

He told Shekhawat that considering the higher cost of canal construction in mountainous areas, the current limit of Rs 2.50 lakh per hectare should be raised to Rs 3.50 lakh per hectare.

He also requested one sewerage treatment plant in Haridwar in view of the Kumbh Mela 2021. Shekhawat asked that a proposal be sent for this purpose.

Rawat said that considering the difficult geographical conditions and scattered population in the mountain State of Uttarakhand, the rural drinking water schemes cost more. Collecting five per cent community contribution is practically difficult and also affects work progress. He requested Shekhawat to consider discontinuing the five per cent community contribution condition.

The CM also met the Union minister for Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Prakash Javadekar and discussed 140 forest land affected 1153 kilometre road construction works under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana- I. He requested that the forest land transfer process be completed by March 2020. The two also discussed various forest and environment related issues pertaining to the state.

Meeting the Union Rural Development minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Rawat requested a special package under rural livelihood mission as granted to north eastern states.

The poverty ratio and problem of migration should also be used as basis for budget allocation for this, he said. Loans have been facilitated for about 16,422 groups to link them with livelihood.

The groups are being provided training but due to financial constraints it is not possible to provide livelihood related training to all the groups. Additional funds will also be needed for establishing nano-packaging units, packaging material, developing basic facilities at growth centres, designing, brand development, sale and market linkage for the products among other works.

The CM also requested further action in pending cases pertaining to PMGSY-I and tarring of 121 roads costing Rs 529.42 crore under stage II.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-meets-union-ministers--seeks-execution-of-works-in-u---khand.html

39,18-1-20,Marandi constitutes new working committee,"The Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) moved a step ahead in merger with BJP as the party headed by Babulal Marandi constituted new working committee leaving two other elected MLAs (Pradeep Yadav and Bandhu Tirkey) without any important posts.

Both Yadav and Tirkey found place in 151 member working committee, but they have been not assigned any important post such as vice presidents, principal general secretary or general secretaries. In the last dissolved working committee Pradeep Yadav the Poreyahat MLA was principal general secretary.

Sources said that by not assigning any important posts to Pradeep Yadav and Tirkey, the JVM leader Babulal Marandi has moved a step ahead in merger of party with BJP. Yadav, not being assigned any important posts indicates growing differences between him and party chief Babulal Marandi. Both Pradeep Yadav and Babulal Marandi had RSS background spreading RSS and BJP ideals in Santhal Pargana. In 2000 when the separate State was carved out of Bihar with Babulal Marandi becoming first chief minister, Yadav was in Marandi’s Cabinet. Yadav, who has been representing Poreyahat for around two decades left BJP in 2006 when Marandi formed his own party JVM (P).

Sources said that in JVM Marandi takes most of decisions in consultation with Yadav. However, this time severe differences have cropped out between them over merging JVM with BJP. Yadav is against the ideas of merging JVM with BJP and had asked Marandi to be with Grand Alliance supporting Hemant Soren government from outside.

Meanwhile, other JVM MLA Bandhu Tirkey has opposed the merger of JVM with BJP. Tirkey said, “JVM merger with BJP is big setback for party. We had contested the election against BJP and now becoming part of BJP is against the people’s mandate.”

Tirkey the MLA from Mandar said that by not assigning any important post to him and Pradeep Yadav, Babulal Marandi has strengthened such type of rumour that JVM is in talks with BJP.

Tirkey said, I will talk to Pradeep Yadav and will reveal future course of action soon.” Meanwhile, sources said that with the constitution of new working committee Marandi’s next strategy will be merger of JVM with BJP.

Sources said that it will be win-win situation for both BJP and Marandi, as after the Assembly election debacle, BJP has been looking for a tribal face in Jharkhand with an appeal in Santhal region. Sources said that for Marandi too it will be rehabilitation for him as despite all efforts his party managed to win only three seats.

The JVM (P) in the just concluded Assembly election won Dhanwar, Poraiyahat and Mandar seats, but in later two seats personnel charisma of candidate was more important than the party which they belong.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/marandi-constitutes-new-working-committee.html
40,18-1-20,"State Cong MLAs meet Sonia, Rahul","The newly elected Congress legislators from State on Friday called upon Congress president Sonia Gandhi at 10, Janpath the official residence of Gandhi family in New Delhi. Today’s meeting was the first formal meeting of Congress lawmakers from State.

The meeting which lasted for around 30 minutes was attended by senior Congress Rahul Gandhi, State Congress in-charge RPN Singh, State Congress president Rameshwar Oroan, Congress legislative party leader Alamgir Alam, two MPs Dhiraj Sahu and Geeta Koda apart from all 16 MLAs.

Purnima Neeraj Singh the Congress MLA from Jharia said, “Today’s meeting was just formal meeting as Congress Chief Sonia Gandhi had called on all MLAs after election results.” Singh said, “The Congress chief asked the elected MLAs to work for State and party.” Singh, the first timer MLA from Jharia won the seat defeating her sister-in-law Ragini Singh who was fielded by BJP.

Ragini is wife of former MLA Sanjeev Singh who is currently being tried for killing his political rival and cousin Niraj Singh. Purnima Singh is Niraj's widow.

Echoing the views of Singh, Naman Bixal Kongari the Congress MLA from Kolebira said, “The meeting with Congress chief was very fruitful as she gave us some ideas how to work for party and state.”

The 16 elected MLAs comprise 10 first timers stayed at 10 Janpath and also had photoshoot with their national president and Rahul Gandhi. The Congress chief after meeting elected MLAs had a separate meeting with Congress state president Rameshwar Oroan, Congress legislative party leader Alamgir Alam and State Congress in-charge RPN Singh and others.

Sources said that in the meeting the leaders discussed on probable names, who will be included in the Hemant Soren Cabinet. Sources said that as Congress is to get three more Cabinet berths, hectic lobbying is on for ministerial berths.

As per Congress sources, caste and regional balance will be given importance in making new Ministers. The Congress keeping an eye to year end Bihar Assembly election is going to give representation to backward and upper caste in Ministry.

As Congress from its quota had given representations to Muslim and tribals, MLAs from OBC and upper caste will be given preference. In such situation names of Banna Gupta, Amba Prasad, Mamta Devi, Deepika Pandey Singh, Purnima Neeraj Singh, Rajendra Singh and others are doing rounds.

A senior Congress leader requesting anonymity said, “The Congress high command has decided to make at least one minister from women. In such situation any of Amba Prasad, Mamta Devi, Deepika Pandey Singh, Purnima Neeraj Singh can be made a minister.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-cong-mlas-meet-sonia--rahul.html

Rumours about the cocktail party were doing the rounds on the internet and had also hogged the attention of media in the past one week.

Singh on Friday said that there were a few complaints about higher charge of diagnosis at the hospital. It has been proposed to revise the charges, he added.

“We also discussed about drug availability, defunct machines and need of equipment for cancer ward and the trauma centre,” Singh said.

57,18-1-20,Inefficient contractor given IFFCO 132-KV line work,"A 32-KV DC line work of the IFFCO was reportedly done by a contractor who allegedly has neither standard qualifications nor any experience in electrical works.

While the tender procedure was illegal, the Odisha Power Transmission Corporation Limited (OPTCL) and the Odisha Electricity Regulations Authority have remained silence, alleged the Odisha Electricity Board Workers Association.

The OPTCL called a tender for the Paradip IFFCO 132-KV DC line in 2018-19. The tender was awarded to Bhubaneswar-based Abhisek Contech Private India Ltd, which had no experience in pilling and foundation works in electrical pillars installation. Foundation work was not done as per rules. It was not done on proper location and soil test was not done. While the regions is very low in altitude and has salty and sandy soil, electrical foundation work is very important for installation of 132-KV lines.

The 1999 Super Cyclone had destroyed the electrical pillars of the PPT and the PPL, but the then Oswal Fertilizer and Chemical (Presently IFFCO) pillars were strong. So, the PPT and PPL had blacklisted two contractors for low-grade work with use of substandard materials.

As it lacked knowledge, the Abhisek Contech did the work with Cuttack- based Shree Engineering and Associate.

Sources also said the Shree Engineering has also lacked experience in pilling and foundation work. Thus, it took help of the Gupta Power and Infrastructure Ltd. However, the Gupta Engineering cancelled the agreement with Shree engineering later. So the guarantee certificate of Shree Engineering was valueless for the OPTCL.

The electrical works are of low grade and posing dangers for public.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/inefficient-contractor-given-iffco-132-kv-line-work.html

Jena stated the Constitution has clearly stated that no law can be enacted on the basis of religion. India has as special identity as a secular country.

“Now, there is an attempt to destroy that tradition and identity. Hope that your party (BJD), which has supported the CAA and NPR would take a stand to bury the soul of India,” he stated. The Constitution was prepared by Dr BR Ambedkar to build a India dreamt by Mahatma Gandhi.

How did you vow before the forces who are trying to destroy the constitution, he questioned. The CAA is not only meant to deprive a particular minority community of their rights but it also push the dalits, Adivasis and other underprivileged people in a awkward position , he said.

The BJP leader pointed out that the Act was brought by the Congress-led UPA government at the Centre. “Now what has happened that after coming to power in the state, the Congress after coming to the power in the state is protesting against the Act introduced by its own party-led government.

Kaushik alleged that it could be a conspiracy to give monetary benefits to the Congressmen lawyers, who will be filing such petitions and fighting the case, which has no validity.

The question arises, Kaushik says, one after another the state government has lost cases and recently in the House it has been accepted the in the name of paying legal fees, Congress leaders have been given crores of money. He termed the statement of the State Congress president Mohan Markam as unacceptable and unnecessary.

BJP leader said in the name of terrorism, Congress had always adopted double standard. At the Centre under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the POTA Law was brought but Congress after coming to power had annulled the law. There was increase in terrorist cases. In the name of terrorism, no politics should be done. It is a result of such policy that Mumbai attack happened after which the necessity for the NIA was felt.

75,18-1-20,The need for understanding religion,"Recently while listening to a debate on whether a particular protest was intentionally denigrating Hindu symbols and fueling communalism, one was surprised when a prominent and knowledgeable Hindu activist opined that Hitler and the Nazis had appropriated the Swastik symbol of Sanatan Dharma.

For those who don’t know, Hitler used the black straight-armed hakenkreuz (hooked cross) on the white circle and red background of the Nazi flag. He himself never referred to it as the Swastik but called it the hakenkreuz.

Some say that the roots and description of the Nazi symbol were distorted to prevent the world from tracing the roots of the Nazi ideology.

Whether right or wrong, this contention made one recall the crusades fought between followers of two prominent Abrahamic religions.

Though the general public thinks that the crusades were organised by Christian powers mainly to retake Jerusalem and the holy land, according to historians, religious concern was only one of the various reasons which led to and fuelled the crusades.

It is said that the Byzantine emperor wanted to regain lost territory and defeat a threatening rival state, the pope wanted to strengthen the papacy in Italy, merchants wanted to monopolise important trading centres under Muslim control at that time and earn money shipping crusaders to the Middle East while the knights wanted to defend their religion, follow the principles of chivalry and gain wealth in this life in addition to special favour in the next one.

It would seem that religion has been used for various other purposes apart from the positive effects and ultimate spiritual aim that one would consider it to be for.

Movements, battles and worse were projected to be guided by religious considerations whereas political, territorial, commercial and even petty egos guided such actions under the pretext or religious principles. Some state that religion is the cause of most problems and disturbances facing society.

However, one disagrees with this contention. It is not religion that causes problems as much as its misinterpretation and distortion for ulterior motives does. Our neighbour Pakistan could be considered an example of this condition because while it claims to be concerned about minorities in India, it not only persecutes minorities within its own borders but also turns a blind eye to what its ally China has been doing to the Uyghur Muslims.

There are various examples of how religious beliefs are actually exploited for purposes which the gods worshipped by followers of those religions would not really like. The god who is all merciful would not encourage mindless hatred and slaughter. The son of god who is full of compassion and love would not approve of duping and converting those following other faiths. The god who is bliss and consciousness would not encourage exploitation of religion for dubious gains.

So, should those who follow any religion actually try and understand what religion is really about? Swami Vivekananda had said that religion is the idea which is raising the brute into man, and man into god.

Reading a good commentary on the Bhagvad Geeta by a seer will dispel many doubts and provide explanations even for aspects generally not associated with ‘religion’.

Instead of rejecting religion as the cause of problems, it would be more sensible to actually know what it contains and teaches. It encourages ethics, empathy, emotional intelligence and all that is good apart from the main aim of religion- salvation.

This doesn’t mean that one has to be religious to be good, even an atheist can attain the highest aim as has been stated by seers too.

One feels that if more people actually knew what their religion is really about, many of the disagreements and problems would be easier to resolve.

There may be some controversial texts in some books but then any sensible person will know to observe what is good. If we were actually religious, many of the environmental, social, economical and other problems we face would not be as bad as they are.

However, the longer we remain ignorant to the good that religions contain, the more will people be exploited by those who have for long being exploiting religion for aims which are far from holy.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/the-need-for-understanding-religion.html

81,18-1-20,Arun Sood elected as Chandigarh BJP president,"Former mayor and senior councillor Arun Sood was on Friday declared as the new President of Chandigarh Bharatiya Janata Party.

Sood, who will serve the party city unit for next three years, was elected unanimously a day after filing his nomination for the top post.

Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal announced Sood’s name as the new President in Sector 33 party office here while stating that no other nomination was filed for the top post.

Sood replaced Sanjay Tandon, who is the longest serving Chandigarh BJP President. Tandon remained on the post for ten years since January 18, 2010.

48 years old Sood is an advocate by profession. He had joined RSS in 1987 and worked in ABVP from 1989 to 2000. In the past, he had served as State Secretary and State Vice President of ABVP Punjab, National Executive Member for several years, State General Secretary BJYM Punjab.He was appointed the State Secretary of the city BJP in 2007 and the State General Secretary in 2010. Sood was elected as councillor in December 2011 for the first time. He served as Chandigarh’s mayor in 2016 and was also re-elected as councillor in the same year in December.

While speaking after taking over the top post in the city BJP, Arun Sood said that his priority would be keeping the momentum of party’s victories maintained under the tenure of Sanjay Tandon.

Commenting on the news reports related to factionalism in Chandigarh BJP, Sood asked party workers to work unitedly, asserting that there is only one faction here which is Chandigarh BJP. The party is united, he added.He also thanked Tandon and local MP Kirron Kher after his election as party President.It is an open secret that the city BJP unit has been struggling due to factionalism with Sanjay Tandon and Kirron Kher heading two separate factions. Sood is considered close to Tandon and also, enjoys support of Kirron Kher. However, it remains to be seen how Sood brings together both factions of the party during his tenure.

Notably, during Lok Sabha polls held earlier this year, differences between the two camps were quite visible. As Tandon was also in the race to get party’s ticket, the Central leadership had to delay the announcement of the candidate’s name to prevent a possible rebellion in the party.

Tandon’s tenure as BJP city president has remained successful with two consecutive victories in Lok Sabha polls in 2014 and 2019 and victory in civic body polls held in the year 2016 but he failed to end infighting and factionalism in the party.

His first term was from January 18, 2010 till January 15, 2013. Tandon’s term was later extended to 2016 which was his second term as the President. His term was extended for the third time in 2016 in view of Municipal Corporation elections during that year.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/arun-sood-elected-as-chandigarh-bjp-president.html

The mayor said, “MCD has been doing an incredible job in sanitation, ban on the use of polythenes and other cleanliness work and that’s why we are quite optimistic about the good ranking of Dehradun among other cities of India.”

He further requested all the councillors to raise public awareness and facilitate at least 200 feedbacks in a day from their respective wards through their contacts till the last day of this month in order to improve the ranking of Dehradun. Also, each councillor was asked to give online feedback during the meeting to give them the better understanding of the procedure.

Municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey said, “The team of Swacch Survekshan is supposed to stay for one week in the city and we have no idea about the timing of their arrival or departure. The ranking of Dehradun in the last survey was not great but hopefully, it will be better this time. The important part of the survey is citizen's feedback. Cities like Tirupati, Agra, and Lucknow have more than one lakh feedbacks on Swacchata app while we have few thousands despite working so hard.

84,18-1-20,All-party meet on water in Punjab,"As the legislators, cutting across the party lines, expressed their serious concern over the worsening water situation in Punjab, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday said that he has already sent out the invites for the all-party meeting on January 23 to evolve a comprehensive strategy to tackle the critical water situation in light of the fast-depleting water resources in the State.

Capt Amarinder, speaking following detailed discussion on ‘The Punjab Water Resources (Management and Regulation) Bill 2020’, said that all matters related to the water issues in the State, including the Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) canal issue, poor quality of groundwater and pollution caused by industrial and domestic waste, would also be thoroughly discussed during the all-party meeting, in a bid to evolve a consensus to chalk out a detailed strategy to address these problems.The Bill, introduced by Irrigation Minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, was later passed by the House unanimously, thus paving way for the creation of Punjab Water Regulation and Development Authority to manage the critical water resource in the State.

Both the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) – Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) supported the Bill, expressing grave concern over the scarce water resources and the depleting groundwater table in the State.

During his intervention, in response to certain issues raised by AAP MLA and the Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema, the Chief Minister flayed the Opposition for their constant criticism of the State Government on the issue, while themselves failing to contribute in any way to tackling the problem.

Pointing out that he and his colleagues had already given up power subsidy for tubewells, Capt Amarinder challenged the Opposition leaders to show if any of them had heeded his appeal, yet, to do the same. The appeal, he said, was aimed at ensuring judicious use of groundwater and inculcating the habit of water saving.

Describing the depleting ground water table, and the growing pollution of river water, as serious issues, the Chief Minister reiterated his government’s commitment to resolving the problem, which was particularly acute in the districts of southern Punjab, such as Sri Muktsar Sahib, leading to heavy incidence of cancer.

Citing his visit to Israel to explore ways and means to tackle the problem of water scarcity, the Chief Minister said that the West Asian country was also facing an acute crisis and facing exhaustion of its water resources in the next 15 years.

He, however, said that Israel had a vast sea in its vicinity, from where they could cater to their country’s water requirement after desalinating the seawater. Unfortunately, Punjab did not have the option and could risk overexploitation of its water resources only if it was prepared to become a desert in the coming years.

The Chief Minister apprised the House that his Government had already signed an agreement with National Water Company of Israel M/s Mekorot for formulation a Water Conservation and Management Master Plan (WCMMP) for conservation and management of water resources in the state.

The Punjab Water Regulation and Development Authority, provided by the Bill, will consist of a chairman and two other members to be appointed by the Government. The Authority will be responsible for management and conversion of water resources of the state in a judicious, equitable and sustainable manner, and will be empowered to take all such measures as it deems necessary or expedient for this purpose.

The Authority will also be empowered to issue directions and guidelines for the conservation and management of the water resources, besides issuing tariff orders specifying the charges to be imposed by entities supplying water for drinking domestic, commercial or industrial use.

The Bill also proposes the constitution of an Advisory Committee on Water Resources, to be notified by the Government, consisting of experts and ex-officio members from various government departments, to advise the authority. The authority may also engage experts on its own.

The Authority shall have, and maintain, a separate fund, to be called the Punjab Water Regulation and Development Authority Fund, in which the grants or loans would be credited by the Punjab Government. The Bill also proposes to empower the Government to issue to the Authority general or specific directions in writing, in the matters of policy involving public interest, and the Authority shall be bound to follow and act upon such directions. Tariff fixation would be done by the Authority as per the policy prescribed by the Government.

Earlier, SAD MLA Harinder Pal Singh Chandumajra suggested to convene as special session on the water issue.Dubbing the polluting of rivers, AAP MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan urged the government t start acting against the industrial houses and units which are polluting Punjab’s water.

Meanwhile, Lok Insaaf party MLA Simarjit Singh Bains pointed out how the Centre, in a step motherly treatment to the state, left it out of the Atal Jal Yojna after announcing its name during the launch of the central scheme. “We should unanimously condemn this step motherly treatment to Punjab,” he demanded.

He also demanded to charge the water royalty from the neighbouring states of Rajasthan, Delhi for using Punjab water. As the Speaker Rana KP Singh refused to entertain his plea, he along with his brother MLA Balwinder Singh Bains staged a brief protest in the well ofg the House before staging a walk",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/all-party-meet-on-water-in-punjab.html

92,18-1-20,"Under attack, SAD to oppose NRC","Bharatiya Janta Party’s (BJP) decade-old ally, Shiromani Akali Dal, on Friday made it clear that the party would not hesitate in parting ways over the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in case of inconvenience to the people.

Though the party stayed away from supporting a Government resolution recommending the repealing of the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and amending documentation for the NRC, its senior leader and Majitha MLA Bikram Singh Majithia declared in the Vidhan Sabha that the SAD is “strongly” against the NRC “that forces needless hardships on the common people”.

“Where people have to stand in queues to prove their identity, SAD is totally against the NRC,” said Majithia while speaking on the resolution moved by the Parliamentary Affairs Minister Brahm Mohindra on the concluding day of the two-day special assembly session.

At the same time, Majithia pointed that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already clarified that the Central Government was “not contemplating the introduction of the NRC in the country”.

Majithia’s statement came after the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs lashed out at the Akali Dal and the BJP for their “vicious” and destructive attempt to polarize and “divide the country” through the “unconstitutional” CAA.

Even as the SAD MLAs and the lone BJP Legislator made efforts to defend the Centre’s decision to implement the CAA and NRC, the Congress and AAP members lashed out at the move, even going ahead to demand the banning of BJP’s ideological fountainhead “RSS” (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh).

All the speakers, both from the Congress and AAP, accused the SAD, especially the Badals, of double speak over the CAA — an issue which has led to nationwide violent protests.

“British brought divide and rule policy to rule on Indians, and now some leaders at the Centre who wanted to rule us, is doing it on RSS’s directive. “RSS should be banned…it was banned several times earlier also…it is RSS’ thinking…it is dividing us,” said Cabinet Minister Charanjit Singh Channi while speaking on the resolution.

Thanking the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh for taking the lead in raising his voice against the dangerous Act all over the country, Channi said that the CAA was BJP’s “vicious attempt” to introduce religion as basis of citizenship.

Terming CAA as a major threat to Nation's integrity, Channi said that through this Act, Modi regime had tried to show concern for people living in other countries while showing scant regard for their own people, who were now protesting against their oppressive policies.

AAP MLA from Dirba and Leader of Opposition in the House Harpal Singh Cheema described the CAA as the “RSS’ hidden agenda to terrorize the minorities and Dalits with the sole motive of polarizing the Country on religious lines”.

He said that the BJP was constantly making all-out efforts to tinker with the basic tenets of the Constitution for its vested interests.

At the same time, he castigated the BJP for diverting the attention of the people from the core issues of unemployment, poverty, illiteracy, economic disparities, regional imbalances by bringing the CAA.

He also demanded that the government should also bring a resolution on the floor of the House against the recurring fascist attacks orchestrated on the JNU students and students from other universities and colleges opposing the CAA, NCR and NPR.

Questioning the Centre’s intention behind bringing the Act, Finance Minister Manpreet Badal said that the CAA had been introduced to single out one particular religion and “this will perpetuate sectarian tendencies”.

“The resolution is an attempt to raise the voice of all those whom the Central Government is illegally trying to target on religious grounds,” he said.

Referring to the 1947 partition, Manpreet said that Punjab had not demanded the division even then and more than 10 lakh lives had been lost in that tragic period and Punjab had paid a very heavy price for that. India's ethos would be tarnished if the Act was not repealed, he warned.

“Why not include people from Sri lanka, Burma, Bhutan and why they are excluding Muslims…we want all should be included, be it Tamil Hindus from Sri Lanka, Rohingya’s from Burma, and others…But they are deliberately ignoring one section,” said Manpreet, underlining that the poorest of the poor section would be affected by the move.

Supporting the government resolution, AAP’s Sunam MLA Aman Arora said that the CAA was just an attempt to hide the failures of the Modi regime on all major fronts, be it the promise of providing and jobs, or economic prosperity. CAA was against the spirit of our Constitution, he said asking what was the need to bring such an Act.

Speaking in favour of the resolution against CAA, AAP MLA from Kotkapura Kultar Singh Sandhwan said that the Act was in violation of the basic structure of the Constitution and aimed at create a wedge between the peacefully living communities in India.

“We are against none…but, we are in favour of our Constitution,” he said while lashing out at the Akali Dal for never standing with the Sikhs but with the politics.

Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) MLA Simarjeet Singh Bains demanded from the Government to direct all the officials, on the lines of the Kerala Government, not to carry out any work related with the National Population Register (NPR).

Maintaining that the CAA’s announcement has affected him “personally”, Nabha MLA Kaka Randeep Singh described the Centre’s attempt to divide the nation on religious lines as atrocious and dangerous for India’s secular fabric.

The issues of employment and declining GDP were being masked by raising religious sentiments by the BJP to instill a sense of fear amongst minorities, he said while pointing that the BJP led Central Government first brought Godra, then Muzaffarnagar, then came Article 370, followed by triple talaq and now this. “Isn’t a particular community is being targeted here,” he asked.

Commending the Chief Minister for taking a bold initiative by bringing resolution against CAA, Congress’ Gidderbaha MLA Amarinder Singh Raja Warring termed it as a “draconian” Act, aimed at promoting hatred, oppression and communalism, as well as promoting sectarian politics.

He blamed the BJP for thrusting this Act upon the people, especially the minorities, who had been living peacefully in India since independence. The student violence that had erupted in JNU, Jamia Milia and other educational institutions across the country reflected the people’s mood against the BJP’s nefarious designs to destabilize the country for their ulterior motives.

LONE MUSLIM MLA TOO REGISTERS HER PROTEST

The only Muslim MLA in the 117-member House, Cabinet Minister Razia Sultana pointed that the Centre’s decision would impact the poorest and backward people who would not be able to procure and produce documentation to claim their Indian citizenship.

“The Constitution’s founders would have never thought that the cherished ideals enshrined by them would be trampled over in this manner one day.

In a democracy, both majority and minority communities are taken along together to ensure the nation's progress,” she said, adding that the BJP had persistently been trying to divide people on religious lines.

Detention centres had been set up across and there was fear amongst all minority communities which was worrisome, she said, terming it a “diversionary tactic” to shift people's attention from the key issues staring the nation.

“Modi fooled the people with his false claims of having respect for the Constitution,” she said, adding that it was satisfying to see people from all walks of life coming out on the streets to protest the “draconian” Act.

Castigating the Modi regime for playing with fire by polarizing people on religious lines, Razia Sultana said that the truth was that RSS and BJP have a fascist mindset and these parties have never accepted the national flag and Constitution.

BJP, SAD ON STICKY WICKET

The government resolution seeking repealing of CAA and amending NPR forms left the BJP and SAD members on sticky wicket as they failed to defend the Centre’s move.

BJP’s only present member, Abohar MLA Arun Narang, could not muster enough words to justify the CAA, NRC, and NPR and only assuring the House that “kissi ko iss se khatra nahi hai” (there is no danger to anyone).

SAD Legislature Party leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon maintained that the party was in favour of applying the CAA to members of the Muslim community also so that they also get the same benefits as provided to the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Christian and Parsi communities under the Act.

“The party wants the Congress not to oppose the relief given to the Sikh community, as from Afghanistan, but to focus only on securing relief to the Muslims also,” he said.

SAD’s Adampur MLA Pawan Kumar Tinu clarified that SAD president and Ferozepur MP Sukhbir Badal demanded the inclusion of Muslims in the Parliament. “Congress Government brought this resolution to divert attention from issues like agrarian crisis, power scam and unemployment in Punjab…it is a conspiracy,” he said.

“Muslims should also be included in CAA. Instead of resolution opposing the CAA, we should bring amendment of including Muslims,” he said.

Later, the SAD moved a resolution recommending to the Centre that CAA should be suitably amended to facilitate this relief to the Muslims, in addition to other communities, including the Sikhs, the Hindus, the Jains, the Budhhists, the Christians and Parsis, which was rejected by the Speaker Rana KP Singh.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/under-attack--sad-to-oppose-nrc.html

This time the government will at least know how much we contribute instead of questioning our role in the system.”

One of the protesting Anganwadi workers, Seema Negi said, “We refused to go for our duty in the pulse-polio campaign because the government has remained blind and deaf towards our demands.”

“Our protest is intensifying day by day. On Friday, Anganwadi workers from Sahaspur came to support us. We’ll not leave our struggle in the middle. The police are taking our Anganwadi women to the hospital by force but it is not going to change anything. If fast unto death fails to move the government, we will immolate ourselves and then even the police wouldn’t be able to do anything,” added Rekha Negi.

Earlier, on Thursday, hunger striker Manorama Nautiyal was taken to the hospital by police and Pinky Singh started her fast unto death strike in her place.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/anganwadi-workers-refuse-to-aid-in-polio-campaign.html

96,18-1-20,ST Bill to extend quota for another 10 years,"Punjab Vidhan Sabha on Friday ratified a bill to extend reservation to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha, and state legislatures for another 10 years.

Moving a resolution under Article 38 of the Constitution on the concluding day of the two-day of special session to ratify the Constitution (126th Amendment) Bill, 2019, extending reservation for SCs and STs in Lok Sabha and state assemblies by another 10 years, the Chief Minister pointed that the founding fathers of the Constitution, led by Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar, had provided a term of 10 years of reservation for SCs and STs.

He said that the reservation had been extended by the successive Union Governments since then.

Notably, the reservation for the SCs, and STs, given for the last 70 years in Lok Sabha and state assemblies, was due to end on January 25, 2020.

The Parliament, only recently, passed a Constitution Amendment Bill in this regard and it has to be ratified by at least 50 percent of the assemblies before it becomes a law.

There are 84 members belonging to the Scheduled Caste and 47 from the Scheduled Tribe communities in the Parliament. In assemblies, there are 614 SC members and 554 ST members.

Chief Minister said that despite improvement in the socio-economic status of these communities over the last 70 years aided by anti-discrimination policies and reservation in political representation and jobs, they still lag behind on several parameters.

“As a result, there is a strong case to extend the reservation to achieve the goal of development of the poor and downtrodden sections of the society,” he said.

“I am aware that there may be many other issues concerning development of SCs and my government is fully committed to them. But today, this resolution may be adopted unanimously without any second thought,” asserted Capt Amarinder.

He also underlined the need for all to collectively renew their commitment to the welfare and upliftment of the groups through proper education, training and representation in jobs.

Soon after, the resolution was passed by the Assembly “unanimously” without any debate though some of the members wanted to speak on the same.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-house-ratifies--sc-st-bill-to-extend-quota--for-another-10-years.html

The MCD has all the permissions and paperwork required to operate the plant in that area, he stressed.

According to Pandey, “We have submitted our application for the renewal of No Objection Certificate (NOC) to Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB). Unless UEPPCB rejects it, it will be viewed as deemed to be sanctioned and we will keep working.

The protest means nothing and it will lead nowhere. Besides, we have all the mandatory documents and authorisation.

Waste management plant cannot be shut down on the terms of the public. Only three authorities have the right to order its closure- the National Green Tribunal, High Court and Supreme Court.”

About the complaints of foul smell in the area and public health risk, the commissioner said that these allegations were baseless.

“There is no foul smell and public health risk on the site. Enzymes are sprayed six times a day to sterilise the place. The people staging the protest have their own personal issues regarding the waste management plant and I don’t want to comment on that,"" he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/can---t-shut-waste-management-plant-due-to-protest--says-municipal-commissioner.html

He said that soon after the political leadership changes, bureaucracy is reborn but with their knowledge, skills remaining intact.

On the occasion, the Chief Minister also talked about giving three prizes for the New Ideas of Change. He informed that a jury of Ex-Chief Secretaries will chose best Idea.

The Chief Minister said that every state has its own profile. It requires collective efforts to change the Profile of Madhya Pradesh. The present profile must be changed. Madhya Pradesh needs a new identity. He said that it is urgent to generate economic activities. The technology is changing every moment. Entire nation is changing.

The access to vast knowledge and information resources has increased today. He said that India has the largest aspirational population in the world. This is the population of the youth. He said that even aspirations are changing. The challenge is how to adopt and adapt the change.

Kamal Nath said that Madhya Pradesh has agriculture dependent economy. At present, the challenge is the excess of foodgrains and not shortage. He said that the real change would occur only when farmers wearing conventional costumes start wearing jeans and T-shirt by adopting modern farming.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/madhya-pradesh-is-a-diversity-rich-state--nath.html

109,18-1-20,CAT sets aside Punjab DGP’s appointment,"In a major setback to Capt Amarinder Singh-led Punjab Government, the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) on Friday set aside the appointment of senor IPS officer Dinkar Gupta as the state Director-General of Police (DGP).

He was virtually hand-picked by Capt Amarinder almost a year back after the retirement of his predecessor Suresh Arora from among the panel of three officers, sent by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) as per the new rules set by the Supreme Court.

The other two officers of the panel include two others 1987-batch IPS officers — MK Tiwari and VK Bhawra.

1987-batch officer Gupta lost the legal battle to his seniors 1985-batch Mohd Mustafa and 1986-batch Siddarth Chattopadhyaya in cop versus cop case. Both Mustafa and Chattopadhyaya are also the DGPs.

Appointed DGP on February 7, 2019, for at least two years fixed tenure, Gupta had superseded his five senior officers. Besides Mustafa and Chattopadhyaya, Gupta also superseded the 1984-batch IPS officer Samant Kumar Goel, 1985-batch Hardeep Singh Dhillon, and 1986-batch Jasminder Singh.

Unhappy, Mustafa and Chattopadhyaya challenged the appointment.

Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh was quick to respond to the verdict. Soon after the pronouncement of the judgment by the CAT Bench, the Chief Minister tweeted that Dinkar Gupta would continue to hold the post.

The State Government, by the evening, made clear its intent to challenge the orders before the Punjab and Haryana High Court.

“The Government has decided that it will challenge the CAT order quashing Dinkar Gupta’s appointment as the Director General of Police in the High Court,” a senior government official told The Pioneer.

Gupta would become the second officer virtually retained by the State even after the initial passing of adverse judicial orders. Retired IAS officer Suresh Kumar is currently continuing as the Chief Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister. His appointment too was quashed by a Single bench of the High Court.

But a Division Bench later stayed the operation of the order setting aside his appointment as the Chief Principal Secretary to Chief Minister.

Setting aside Gupta’s appointment as Punjab DGP, CAT has directed the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) and the Empanelment Committee to prepare a panel of three senior-most officers “strictly in accordance with” the Supreme Court judgment and by “not taking into account, any factors other than those mentioned by the Supreme Court” within four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of the judgment.

As per the Supreme Court directives, the state DGP “shall be selected by the State Government from amongst the three senior-most officers of the Department who have been empanelled for promotion to that rank by the Union Public Service Commission on the basis of their length of service, very good record and range of experience for heading the police force. And, once he has been selected for the job, he should have a minimum tenure of at least two years irrespective of his date of superannuation”.

CAT Bench of Justice L Narasimha Reddy, and Mohd Jamshed, in its order, observed that that “entire selection process and consequential appointment of Dinkar Gupta is contrary to the judgment of Supreme Court in Prakash Singh’s case”.

The Bench also observed, “It is clear that the selection process, which was galvanized, has been virtually ignored and defeated with impunity. A device procedure was evolved to choose the selection criteria in such a way that the desired candidates are selected. This exactly was the malady, which the Supreme Court wanted to eradicate.”

It maintained that the “procedure adopted the UPSC and the Empanelment Committee for preparation of panel for appointment to the post of DGP, Punjab, is patently opposed to, and is violative of the one stipulated by the Supreme Court, apart from being otherwise illegal and arbitrary”.

The Bench was added that the issue can be examined from another angle. “The easiest way for a State Government to ensure that an officer of its choice and who is pliable as DGP, would be to continuously post him in any specific activity, howsoever inconsequential it may be, and then to make an effort to accord primacy to such activity in the process of selection.”

“There cannot be a better instance of arbitrariness and favouritism, than this. The selection process would stand reduced to a mockery. Any aspiring officer would make endeavour in ensuring that he remains in the good books of administration and he is posted continuously in a particular activity,” the Bench added.

Notably, Gupta’s appointment as DGP came after the UPSC, on February 4, 2019, had prepared a three-member panel and recommended the names to the Punjab Government to appoint one of them as the next state police chief. Before that, a list of three IPS officers surfaced in which Gupta’s names was included along with that of Goel and Mustafa.

It was believed that the names of officers in the previous list were discussed during the UPSC meeting, which was attended by the then DGP Suresh Arora and the Chief Secretary Karan Avtar Singh, but the final list that was prepared included the names of all 1987-batch IPS officers.

A decorated officer, Gupta’s appointment at the top post has ruffled many feathers within the Police Department, with his senior Mustafa coming out in public to express his displeasure. Unhappy for being “ignored”, Mustafa has maintained that he would knock the door of the Apex Court to seek “justice”.

Mustafa, who was considered to be a strong contender for the DGP post, is the husband of Punjab Cabinet Minister Razia Sultana. Mustafa also enjoys close proximity with the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder.

Counsel for Mustafa, DS Patwalia, argued that the UPSC, the Department of Home Affairs, Punjab, and Empanelment Committee had completely deviated from the factors required for selection such as length of service, very good record and range of experience for heading the police force.

He argued that “even if it is to be presumed that the performance of the officers in the core policing activities is relevant, there was no basis for choosing only 5, out of 20”. It was pleaded that five areas were chosen only to push up Dinkar Gupta, who was otherwise far below.

The same ground was adopted by the counsel for Siddarth Chattopadhyaya.

The UPSC and Empanelment Committee contended that five core policing areas — intelligence, law and order, administration, investigation, and security, were taken into account, and that they are inconformity with the draft guidelines issued by the UPSC in 2009.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cat-sets-aside-punjab-dgp---s-appointment.html

113,18-1-20,"After Kerala, Punjab adopts resolution to challenge CAA in SC","Minutes after the Punjab Vidhan Sabha passed a resolution against the BJP-led Central Government’s Citizenship (Amendment) Act on Friday, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh declared that the border State will join Kerala in challenging the newly-amended law in the apex court.

Describing the controversial legislation as ‘inherently discriminatory’ and a negation of the very secular fabric on which the Constitution of India is based, the Punjab Assembly adopted, by voice vote, a hard-hitting resolution seeking immediate repeal of the unconstitutional Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA), which the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh compared with the ethnic and religious cleansing of Hitler’s Germany.

Clearly, no lessons had been learnt from history, said a visibly anguished Chief Minister during the discussion on the resolution, which also urged the Centre to put on hold the work on the National Population Register (NPR), till forms or documents associated with it are amended suitably, in order to allay apprehensions that it is a prelude to the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and designed to deprive a section of persons from citizenship of India and implement CAA.

“Like Kerala, the Government will approach the Supreme Court on the issue,” said Capt Amarinder while talking with the media after the conclusion of the two-day special Assembly session.

He said that the Centre would have to make the necessary amendments to CAA if it had to be implemented in Punjab and other States opposing the legislation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/after-kerala--punjab-adopts-resolution-to-challenge-caa-in-sc.html

115,18-1-20,Haryana Dy CM to inaugurate Bajgheda flyover today,"Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Duyshant Chautala will inaugurate the Bajgheda flyover at village Bajgheda on Saturday. This is likely to bring relief to the residents of Palam Vihar, New Palam Vihar, Ashok Vihar, Sectors 99-115 and several other nearby areas.

Earlier, city residents had the lone option of using the Daulatabad flyover and the manually managed Chauma railway crossing, both of which remain highly congested most of the time. An amount of about Rs 42 crore have been spent on the construction of this four-lane flyover. The Public Works Department (PWD) has constructed the flyover over the Bajghera railway crossing.

The foundation stone of this flyover was laid in July 2016. The road is crucial as it connects the old city with Delhi near Najafgarh and the Dwarka Expressway. With the population in the nearby sectors increasing, the flyover is expected to ease traffic movement in the area. The flyover is likely to bring relief to commuters travelling between Delhi-Gurugram, Palam Vihar and New Palam Vihar through the Bajghera railway crossing, which was blocked in December 2016 for the construction of the flyover and the underpass. The underpass has already been opened for the commuters.

“It is almost three years since the Bajghera crossing was closed. We travel 5km extra from New Palam Vihar through Daulatabad flyover to reach the main city. We are eagerly waiting for the flyover to open,” said a Palam Vihar resident.

“Traffic management during the construction period of the flyover had been a big challenge for us. During the rain we were alert to manage the traffic with full efforts,” said a senior traffic police official.

With the four-lane flyover likely to ensure smooth traffic flow, local commuters will find it easier to move from one side of the railway crossing to the other.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/haryana-dy-cm-to-inaugurate-bajgheda-flyover-today.html

Senior AAP leader and Delhi AAP convener Gopal Rai on Friday said after the nomination process ends on January 21, the AAP will move towards the final and decisive phase of the election campaign.

Kejriwal will launch the guarantee card on January 23 as part of third phase of election campaign, Rai said, adding a list of promises and work that will be undertaken in the next five years will be maintained in the guarantee card.

“We have decided to launch such card as the party is confident in its ability to fulfill the promises. The card will be distributed to the people in a door to door campaign which will also be launched on January 23 and will continue till February 2,” he said.

The AAP dispensation has doled out number of freebies that include free ride for women on DTC buses, free electricity up to 200 units consumption among others which is being widely appreciated by citizens of Delhi.

118,18-1-20,BJP's like wedding party without groom: AAP,"Soon after the saffron party released its first list of candidates for the upcoming Delhi elections but did not name its chief ministerial candidate, the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is a team without captain and like a wedding party without a groom.

Observing that the people of Delhi expected the BJP to decide a chief ministerial candidate to fight against Arvind Kejriwal-led Government, the city’s ruling party said it in Delhi, it has become clear that the saffron party has given a “walkover” to the AAP.

“Today the BJP came out with its list of candidates for the Delhi Assembly election. Everyone was expecting that against the honest face and candidature of Arvind Kejriwal ji, they will reveal who their candidate, who their CM face is going to be. “But even today the BJP stayed quiet and this makes it clear that in Delhi, the BJP is a team without captain, a wedding party without a groom. It has become clear that in Delhi, BJP has given a walkover to the AAP and Arvind Kejriwal,” said Rajya Sabha MP and AAP’s Delhi election incharge Sanjay Singh.

The BJP on Friday released its first list of 57 candidates for the February 8 polls to the 70-member Delhi Assembly, fielding sitting MLA Vijender Gupta and former mayors Ravinder Gupta and Yogender Chandolia.

The list — which was released by Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari — also included former AAP MLA Kapil Mishra and has 11 SC and four woman candidates.

The party, however, did not name its candidate against AAP leader and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal with Tiwari saying the candidate from New Delhi seat will be announced soon.

Singh said even before contesting the election, the BJP has deserted the field and run away. “They do not have a leader and there is lot of infighting among the party on who will be their CM face,” Singh said. “In the morning there is one statement, by evening there’s a different statement. This has been going on for quite some time now. In Delhi, the BJP is emerging as a leader-less, a vision-less party.

“And I believe that people of Delhi will give a huge win and mandate to an honest AAP Government under the leadership of Arvind Kejriwal,” said Singh.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-s-like-wedding-party-without-groom--aap.html

122,18-1-20,Modern dev model upset tribal-nature balance: CM,"Chief Minister Hemant Soren today said that the modern model of development has disturbed the balance of tribal and nature relations. Addressing a gathering on the inaugural ceremony of three-day international conference on ‘Tribal Philosophy’ here on Friday the CM said that the global hunger for resources has mostly damaged the tribal identity. The tribals from many countries in the world like Brazil, Australia, Malaysia, etc. have been largely separated from their nature-culture and these communities had to migrate, he said.

The CM, citing the example of Malaysia and Brazil, said that the people of the tribal communities in Malaysia used to spend their lives by catching and harvesting fish, which was a culture of their community, but they were exploited and oppressed.

He said that the tribal communities of Brazil, known as 'Gaurani', used to cultivate sugarcane there but they were also exploited and had to flee. He said that tribals have been forcefully separated from water, forest and land for mining of mineral-wealth in Jharkhand. The work of snatching the land of the tribal community has also been done.

The international seminar on 'Tribal philosophy' being organised for the first time in the world at Audrey house, Ranchi, was inaugurated today by Governor Draupadi Murmu and Chief Minister Hemant Soren. The three-day International seminar is being organised by Dr. Ramdayal Munda tribal welfare Research Institute and Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes, Minorities and Backward Classes Welfare Department.

The conference will include 12 international scholars associated with tribal philosophy and more than 100 scholars from across the country. There will also be participation of professors, researchers and students associated with tribal philosophy from the State universities.

The CM said that tribal philosophy is a vast subject. “Jharkhand is a tribal dominated state. A lot of research has been done continuously in the country and the State, but as far as tribal philosophy is concerned, it itself is a very large group. Understanding or researching on tribal philosophy is also a big challenge. The three-day international seminar on 'Tribal Philosophy' will prove to be a milestone for the overall development of the tribal community of the State,” he said.

Soren said that research works are going on in the whole world on the subject of tribal philosophy. “The manner in which these research works are going on has also been continuously discussed. About 37 crore tribals live in about 90 countries all over the world. These communities have 5 thousand cultures and contain 40 thousand languages which are spoken. About 5 per cent of the world's total population comprises of tribal communities.

Today it is a big irony that tribals own 15 per cent of the world's poverty. Why is this so? This is the subject of research,” he said.

The CM further said that the tribal community has always shown its tradition and culture. He said that till 1951 AD, about 30 to 35 per cent of the tribals used to live in the country, today the number of tribals has reduced to just 26 per cent. This is a very serious matter in itself, and research should be done in this field, he said. Soren said that today the whole world is worried about global warming and the situation has arisen due to change in nature.

“The role of the tribal community has been and will continue to be the most important in maintaining the natural balance. No one can do better than tribal society to protect the nature and save us against natural disasters like global warming. The natural beauty has its own identity in our country and State thus, we should not harm this natural beauty with brick, concrete and stone in the name of development,” he added.

Speaking on the occasion, Governor Draupadi Murmu said that there are 9 types of philosophies in India where the 'Tribal philosophy' is the best and greatest of these. “People from tribal communities worship nature. Till now subjects related to tribal communities have been limited till their external activities, their relationship with the outside world and their practices in their society. It is hoped that with such an event, Tribal philosophy will be successful in making its important place in the Indian branch of philosophy,” she said.

The Governor also said that the tribal community constitute a major part of the population of the country. Tribal communities have been an integral part of Indian civilization and culture since ancient times. She said that the art, culture, folk literature, tradition and customs of the tribes have always been rich. Tribal songs and dances are also very beautiful in their own way.

Reacting to Union Minister and BJP leader Smriti Irani blaming the AAP Government for the “delay” in hanging of the four convicts, Kejriwal said he feels “sad that politics is being done on such an issue”.

“I feel sad that politics is being done on such an issue. Shouldn’t we be working together to ensure that the guilty are hanged soonest? Shouldn’t we join hands to ensure a system so that such beasts get hanged within six months? Please don’t do politics on this. Lets together create a safe city for our women,” Kejriwal said in a tweet.

Earlier, Union Minister Smriti Irani blamed the AAP Government in Delhi over the “delay” in the hanging of the Nirbhaya case convicts. Addressing the media, the BJP leader also accused the AAP dispensation of depriving the victim’s mother of justice. “Why was the prisons department, which comes under AAP Government, sleeping after the dismissal of review petition in July 2018? Why did the Government give Rs 10,000 and a sewing kit to the juvenile rapist when he was released?” she posed.

Irani said Asha Devi, the mother of Nirbhaya has played great role in securing justice and we salute her sacrifice.

“As a woman worker, I am very much aggrieved due to the delaying tactics of AAP and want to tell all the citizens of the country that jail department is under the jurisdiction of Delhi Government,” she said, adding the Supreme Court had rejected the review petitions of the convicts in July, 2018 itself but the Jail administration and Kejriwal Government suppressed the case. Delhi Government’s Advocate Rahul Mehra also tried to postpone the execution by citing the procedural reasons in the court, she alleged.

“Why the advocate of AAP says that there may be delay in executing the rapists. The AAP also granted 10,000 rupees for his release for the person who was claimed to be cruelest among the rapists and confessed to have committed the crime,” she alleged.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/don---t-politicise-nirbhaya-case--cm-to-bjp.html

128,18-1-20,BJP fields Vats from Shakur Basti against Jain,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has fielded Dr Sc Vats from Shakur Basti assembly seat against Delhi Power and Health minister Satynder Jain. The BJP central leadership, according to well-placed sources, went absolutely by the independent surveys conducted by the party overlooking the claims of the state-level heavyweights.

Vats, a two term MLA from Shakur Basti on Congress ticket, was brought into the party during the 2015 Assembly polls by late Arun Jaitley and he had managed to hold onto his own in the last election giving a run for the money to AAP leader and Minister Satyender Jain, to whom he lost with a very close margin.

There were allegations at that time that Vats, a three-time Congress MLA, faced sabotage by a section of BJP leaders especially the faction led by former MLA Shyamlal Garg. An important party functionary, Vats had to face the wrath of the Congress leadership as he had crusaded against alleged corruption in the power privatisation process initiated by the Sheila Dikshit Government. As the head of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Delhi Assembly, Vats had piloted a scathing report on the lacunae in the privatisation process, much to the embarrassment of the Government especially then Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit.

According to sources, BJP central leadership survey had revealed that Vats, a former medical practitioner and a reputed educationist, is remembered in the area for the development of infrastructure during his three terms as MLA from building, hospitals, colleges to flyovers to district community centres.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-fields-vats-from-shakur-basti-against-jain.html
129,18-1-20,"Mizoram parties, civil society bodies hail Bru agreement","Political parties and civil society organisations of Mizoram on Friday welcomed the agreement that puts an end to the over two-decade-old Bru refugee crisis.

Thousands of Bru community people have been living in relief camps in Tripura since 1997. They had fled their homeland Mizoram to reach the neighbouring State because of ethnic clashes. By now, the number of these internally displaced people has risen to over 30,000.

Many Bru families have refused to return to Mizoram, citing

security concerns and inadequate rehabilitation package. There has also been a demand for a separate autonomous council for the community.

Following an agreement signed by representatives of the Brus, the central, Tripura and Mizoram Governments in New Delhi on Thursday, these tribal people will permanently settle in Tripura.

Political parties such as the ruling Mizo National Front (MNF), Congress and the BJP, and civil society organisations like the Yong Mizo Association (YMA) and student bodies expressed happiness over the pact.

“It is a matter of joy that a pact, which would finally resolve the Brus imbroglio, has been finally inked. We are highly indebted to Union Ministry of Home Affairs and the Mizoram government for their outstanding effort in signing the historic agreement,” YMA Central Committee general secretary Prof Lalnuntluanga said in a statement.

One good thing about the pact is names of the Bru people would now be permanently deleted from the state’s voter list, the YMA said.

Hailing the agreement as “historic”, the MNF expressed hope that the pact is materialised quickly.

In a statement, the Congress said it had made earnest efforts during its regime in the State to repatriate the Bru people or allow them to permanently settle in Tripura.

The party claimed that former Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla had proposed that those Bru people who are unwilling to return to Mizoram be allowed to live permanently in Tripura but it could not be materialised because of objections raised by the CPI(M)-led Left Front government.

The State BJP said neither the Congress nor the MNF could resolve the crisis for more than 20 years.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mizoram-parties--civil-society-bodies-hail-bru-agreement.html

131,18-1-20,Nagas very close to settlement of vexed political issue: Guv,"The talks to end the decades-old Naga insurgency have “successfully concluded” and Nagaland could be “very close” to a resolution of the conflict, Governor RN Ravi told the State Assembly on Friday, raising fresh hopes among people of return to normal life.

In his maiden address to the state Assembly after taking up the gubernatorial assignment in August 2019, Ravi said the Peoples Democratic Alliance (PDA) Government in Nagaland always considered a settlement to the Naga political issue its most important agenda.

“The negotiations which were going on for the past many years between the Government of India and the Naga political groups have been successfully concluded. It gives me great pleasure to share with you that we could be now very close to it,” Ravi, who was for long the Centre’s interlocuter for talks with insurgent groups, said.

To resolve the Naga political problem, a framework agreement was signed on August 3, 2015 between the NSCN-IM and the government in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. However, the details of the framework agreement was never made public.

“My government conveys its deepest appreciation to all the stakeholders for exhibiting utmost sincerity, foresightedness and a spirit of understanding in helping create a conducive atmosphere for conclusion of the talks in a positive manner,” Ravi said.

The governor thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for their “unwavering commitment, determination and constant guidance”, which he said, ensured the progress of talks in the most “purposeful and determined” manner leading to its successful conclusion.

Ravi did not spell out the terms for the resolution of the conflict, but warned,”If we fail this time, then we will be missing a golden opportunity.”

On behalf of the Nagaland government, Ravi also made an appeal to the Governments and people of the neighbouring states to extend cooperation so that the peace process, which has now reached a very “critical juncture”, concludes in a successful manner in the interest of “enduring peace and stability” in the entire region.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nagas-very-close-to-settlement-of-vexed-political-issue--guv.html
132,18-1-20,Yogi: Apathy of previous Govts forced farmers to commit suicide,"Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday said due to the “apathy” of previous Governments in the State, farmers were forced to commit suicide but the situation has changed for the better under the BJP rule.

Addressing a conference of progressive farmers here, Adityanath said the State Government was aiming to open Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) in all gram panchayats that will bring about a major change in the agriculture sector and help farmers in many ways.

“There was everything in the state earlier, but due to the apathy of the previous Governments, the farmers were in a pitiable condition. They were committing suicide and were thinking of whether to continue with farming or not. In two years, we were able to bring a lot of change,” he said.

Highligthing his Government’s achievements, Adityanath said, “We waived loans of up to Rs one lakh for small-marginal farmers in the first cabinet meeting and gave relief to potato farmers through market intervention scheme.”

“Paddy and wheat were procured in record quantity at minimum support price (MSP) and the money was sent to farmers’ account within 72 hours. So far, Rs 11,594.18 crore have been sent to the account of about 1.83 crore farmers,” he added.

Alleging that during the previous governments rule, the payment of sugarcane farmers was stopped, Adityanath said: “The sugar mills were getting closed and being sold. We paid a record Rs 82 thousand crore and opened new mills. Today 121 mills are running instead of 116 in the state.”

“Old mills are being modernised and their capacity is being expanded. There is a clear instruction to the mill owners that as long as there is sugarcane in the farmer’s field, the mills should function. This is the reason why the mills kept running till mid-June in the last crushing season,” he said.

For increasing the income of farmers, the CM said, emphasis is on maximum production at minimum cost.

“That is why the efficient modes of irrigation, drip and sprinkler, are being made mandatory with boring schemes given on grant,” he said. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla who was present as the chief guest, said in terms of population, the largest State of the country and the world, has immense potential in the agriculture sector.

“The Ganga basin here is most fertile. Abundant water supply, human resources and diversified climate further increases these possibilities.

The image and fate of the state can be transformed with all these things. The situation has changed under the able leadership of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath,” he said.

“For this phase of change to continue, instead of traditional farming, agricultural diversification will have to be encouraged. If the Government gets its products processed according to market demand, the entire world will be the market for agricultural products of UP,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/yogi--apathy-of-previous-govts-forced-farmers-to-commit-suicide.html
133,18-1-20,Nadda dares RaGa to speak 10 lines on CAA,"Casting doubts on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s understanding of Citizenship (Amendment) Act, BJP working president J P Nadda on Friday challenged him to speak 10 sentences on the law. Nadda also accused him of misleading the country on the legislation.

Nadda, who is next week expected to take over from Amit Shah the full-time charge of the party, said it is “unfortunate” for the country that some people “exhibit their wisdom” without understanding the issue so as to mislead the mass.

“The Congress is opposing the CAA. I dare Rahul Gandhi to speak 10 sentences on the law. He should tell us in two sentences what is his problem with the CAA... He is leading such a big party and has to decide himself how he has to do it, but he should not mislead the country,” the BJP working president said.

The amendments in the citizenship law are meant to give citizenship to members of minority communities - Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis, Buddhists, Jains- who fled Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan due to religious persecution and took refuge in India, he said.

Likes of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi had advocated giving citizenship to these persecuted minorities but the Congress does not have any leader now who could understand the issue, Nadda said.

Since coming to power for a second term, the Modi government has in six months resolved issues which had been pending for 70 years, he asserted, adding that opposition parties were left without any issue and had seized on the CAA to mislead the country.

“For the Congress and the Left, their vote bank comes before the country. For Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the country comes first and votes later,” he said.

Critics are claiming that crores of people will arrive and settle in India due to this law, but the fact is that it is for those who arrived here by December 31, 2014, he added.

Opposition parties believe in keeping problems unresolved so that they could do politics over it while the Modi government has addressed issues like Article 370, he said.

He claimed minorities were persecuted in Pakistan and Bangladesh and their population, he claimed, fell to three and seven per cent respectively there from 23 per cent in 1947.

According to a section of Pakistani media quoting census report , the total percentage of minorities in Pakistan including the erstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) was only about 14.50 per cent following the partition.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nadda-dares-raga-to-speak-10-lines-on-caa.html
134,18-1-20,"Cong slams NIA probe, wants re-investigation into Pulwama attack","The Congress on Friday demanded a fair probe within six months into the case involving Jammu & Kashmir DSP Davinder Singh, arrested with Hizbul terrorists in south Kashmir, as Rahul Gandhi alleged the case was handed over to the NIA to “silence” Singh. The party also sought a re-investigation into the February 2019 Pulwama terrorist attack and Singh’s role in it as he had been posted in the district as DSP at the time.

Questioning the Government’s “conspicuous silence”, it demanded the Prime Minister and the Home Minister to answer questions raised by people after Singh’s arrest last week. The grand old party alleged NIA’s role has been questionable in the probes against Swami Assemananda and Pragya Thakur. Congress demanded a fast track court to look into the entire activities and the DSP’s role.

The best way to “silence” Singh was to hand the investigation against him to NIA chief Y C Modi, under whose care the case will be “as good as dead”, Rahul alleged.

Calling the National Investigation Agency (NIA) chief “another Modi”, the Congress leader said he had investigated the 2002 Gujarat riots and the killing of former Gujarat home minister Haren Pandya in 2003.

“The best way to silence Terrorist DSP Davinder, is to hand the case to the NIA,” Rahul said on Twitter, adding, “In YK’s care, the case is as good as dead.” The former Congress chief put out the Twitter post using the hashtag “WhoWantsTerroristDavinderSilenced” and asked “why”.

Congress spokesperson Supriya Srinate said serious questions are being raised on national security. She said Singh was not “just any other officer” as three days before his arrest, he was entrusted with the security of foreign diplomats visiting Jammu and Kashmir and prior to that, he was DSP in Pulwama when the terror attack happened. She said Singh also faced three FIRs for extortion.

When Singh was arrested in Kulgam, he was accompanying Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists Naveed Baba and Altaf and a lawyer operating as an overground worker for terrorist groups. “Why is the government conspicuously silent. The conspicuous silence of the government raises so many questions. It is government’s moral responsibility to conduct a fair probe so that there are no doubts,” the Congress spokesperson said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cong-slams-nia-probe--wants-re-investigation-into-pulwama-attack.html

137,18-1-20,‘Honour to choreograph Prabhu Deva again’,"RAHUL SHETTY, who has choreographed for Street Dancer 3D, speaks with SHALINI SAKSENA about his journey as a dancer, what got him interested and the challenges this profession throws up

You choreographed for Street Dance 3D. How did it happen?

I have been associated with the ABCD franchisee since the beginning. I was a part of the cast in ABCD1 and choreographed Prabhu Deva sir, Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor in ABCD2. For Street Dancer 3D, I got a call from Remo D’Souza sir; he wanted me to head choreography for the film along with Kruti Mahesh. We choreographed all the songs which was super fun. It was an honour to choreograph Prabhu Deva sir once again. Got to create some crazy stuff for Varun Dhawan, Shraddha Kapoor and Norah Fatehi as well.

What got you interested in dancing?

When I was young, I used to watch TV and learn dance from songs performed by Prabhu Deva sir and Hrithik Roshan. I would get inspiration from their moves. I have been dancing since childhood. It began with a performance at a society gathering and was awarded first position. That got me excited and pushed me towards dancing. Then I started performing at school annual day functions and realised that I wanted to take up dance professionally. Back then, dancing was not considered as a good career choice so I pursued Engineering.

The best part was that it led me to choreography where one creates something great in a studio and then when the song releases the whole world starts following that step and it goes viral. That’s an amazing feeling.

How did your dancing career begin?

My dancing career started when I used to audition for brand commercials, dance reality shows and stage performances. I did a lot of TV ads as a child and performed in Bollywood songs with Ganesh Acharya, Bosco Caesar and Ahmed Khan. At age 6, I was already dancing and acting in the industry.

What was your parents’ reaction when you quit engineering?

I didn’t quit. I finished my qualification but alongside engineering I was also auditioning and performing. I didn’t want to upset my parents. I too wanted a degree in hand. My parents were therefore supportive. It was after my engineering that I asked them to give me a year so that I could explore dance as a career.

What were the challenges in choreographing Chammiya song?

Chammiya song is a fun number made by Gaurav and Rimi, which has an upbeat Bollywood desi touch. More than a challenge I was excited to choreograph it because it had Shakti Mohan who is a fabulous dancer and DJ Bravo whom I admired as a cricketer. The challenge was to shoot the song in less time and still give the best output with so many artists featuring in it.

What are the trends in dance today?

Dancing is a profession where trends keeps changing like we change our outfits every day and because of social media nowadays it changes so often.

Where do you get your inspiration from?

I get the inspiration from a lot of random people around me, be it the kid dancing on the road or a traffic cop handling the traffic. Everything in and around us has some movement. I try and pick inspiration from it add my twist to it so that it becomes unique.

Who are the best dancers in Bollywood today?

Tiger Shroff and Varun Dhawan are great dancers and inspire the youth today just like Prabhu Deva sir and Hrithik Roshan did when we were kids.

What are the points to keep in mind while choreographing?

I think there are no rules or the right way to create a choreography. When I choreograph, I move with the music and let my body and mind create what it feels at that moment. I try by myself so that the output is different. Otherwise there are chances that you might get influenced by the people you follow or the dance videos you watch often.

What is the biggest challenge for choreographers today?

Social media is a boon and a curse at the same time. For people who have been learning this craft from senior artists will do great in future because the foundation is strong. At the same time there are choreographers who are doing good and have emerged from YouTube and Instagram which may fade away with time. One should keep learning and work on one’s craft to be future ready.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---honour-to-choreograph-prabhu-deva-again----2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/---honour-to-choreograph-prabhu-deva-again---.html
138,18-1-20,Special court likely to give verdict today,"A special court is expected to pronounce its verdict here on Saturday on the massacre of 20 people in Behmai village in Kanpur Dehat district, allegedly by bandit Phoolan Devi nearly four decades ago.

“We have much hope that the trial court is likely to deliver its judgment in Behmai massacre today,” District Government counsel (criminal) Rajeev Porwal told PTI on Friday.

Porwal said that defense counsel Girish Narain Dubey has submitted certain rulings of the Allahabad High Court and the Supreme Court before the trial court with a request to take cognisance of those rulings while delivering its judgment against the alleged accused.

The court is now expected to give its verdict on the role of the four surviving accused — Posha, Bhikha, Vishwanath and Shyambabu.

While Posha is still in jail, Bhikha, Vishwanath and Shyambabu are out on bail.

Three other dacoits including Man Singh are still absconding.

The special court for hearing dacoity-related cases was expected to deliver the verdict in the 1981 Behmai massacre case on January 6, but it allowed the defence counsel to submit its written arguments by January 16, District Government counsel Raju Porwal said.

Defence counsel Dubey had appeared before the court on January 6, seeking more time to submit written arguments and was granted 10 more days, the Government counsel said.

“Bandit Queen” Phoolan Devi, who later turned to politics, along with her gang members were accused of killing the 20 people belonging to the Thakur community at Behmai village in Kanpur Dehat on February 14, 1981.

The non-descript Behmai village, that shot into prominence after the killings, is 170 km from state capital Lucknow and over 400 km from national capital New Delhi.

Phoolan Devi had stormed into Behmai in what was described as an attack to avenge her alleged rape there by two other bandits — Lala Ram and Sri Ram — both Thakurs, a dominant caste in the village.

Two years after the incident, she had surrendered to the Madhya Pradesh police in 1983 and went on to become a Lok Sabha MP from Mirzapur. She was shot dead outside her MP bungalow in New Delhi on July 25, 2001.

Initially, 35 people, including Phoolan Devi, were named as accused in the case. Eight of them were reportedly killed by police in separate encounters. Three others were reportedly absconding.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/special-court-likely-to-give-verdict-today.html
139,18-1-20,ISRO’s GSAT-30 satellite successfully launched by Ariane Rocket,"India’s communication satellite GSAT-30, aimed at providing high-quality television, telecommunications and broadcasting services, was successfully launched onboard Ariane 5 rocket from French Guiana early on Friday.

Blasting off from the Ariane Launch Complex in Kourou, a French territory located in northeastern coast of South America at 2:35 a.M IST, the European launch provider Arianespace’s Ariane 5 injected the “high power” spacecraft into the orbit in a flawless flight lasting about 38 minutes and 25 seconds.

“India’s communication satellite #GSAT30 was successfully launched into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit by #Ariane5 #VA251. Thanks for your support !!!” ISRO tweeted soon after deploying the satellite into the transfer orbit.

Confirming the successful launch, Arianespace CEO Stphane Isral too tweeted, “A strong start to 2020 as #Ariane5 successfully deploys its two satellite passengers EUTELSAT KONNECT and GSAT-30 into geostationary transfer orbit! I appreciate the trust from the two customers on this mission: @Eutelsat_SA and @ISRO #VA251 #MissiontoSuccess.”GSAT-30 is the first satellite launch for ISRO in 2020, during which the space agency has planned about 25 missions.

ISRO’s U R Rao Satellite Centre Director P Kunhikrishnan, who was present in Kourou, congratulated the ISRO community and Arianespace team on the successful launch.

Calling it an “excellent start” to 2020 for ISRO with the launch, he said, “The mission team at the master control facility have already acquired the satellite and they will immediately complete the post launch operations...”

ISRO’s Master Control Facility (MCF) at Hassan in Karnataka took over the command and control of GSAT-30 immediately after its separation from the launch vehicle and preliminary health checks of the satellite revealed its normal health, the space agency said in a statement later in the day.

In the days ahead, orbit-raising manoeuvres will be performed to place the satellite in Geostationary Orbit (36,000 km above the equator) by using its onboard propulsion system.

During the final stages of its orbit raising operations, the two solar arrays and the antenna reflectors of GSAT-30 will be deployed, ISRO said adding following this, the satellite will be put in its final orbital configuration.

The satellite will be operational after the successful completion of all in-orbit tests.

The 3,357-kg satellite, which was deployed from the lower passenger position of Ariane-5 launch vehicle (VA 251) into to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), is configured on ISRO’s enhanced I-3K Bus structure to provide communication services from geostationary orbit in C and Ku bands.

The satellite derives its heritage from ISRO’s earlier INSAT/GSAT satellite series, and is equipped with 12 C and 12 Ku band transponders.

GSAT-30 is to serve as replacement to the “ageing” INSAT-4A spacecraft services with enhanced coverage, ISRO has said. “GSAT-30 has a unique configuration of providing flexible frequency segments and flexible coverage. The satellite will provide communication services to Indian mainland and islands through Ku-band and wide coverage covering Gulf countries, a large number of Asian countries and Australia through C-band,” ISRO Chairman Dr K Sivan was quoted as saying in the ISRO release.

With a mission life of 15 years, GSAT-30 is an operational communication satellite for DTH, television uplink and VSAT services.

The Bengaluru-headquartered ISRO has said the communication payload of GSAT-30 is specifically designed and optimised to maximise the number of transponders on the spacecraft bus.

“GSAT-30 will provide DTH Television Services, connectivity to VSATs for ATM, stock-exchange, television uplinking and teleport services, Digital Satellite News Gathering (DSNG) and e-governance applications. The satellite will also be used for bulk data transfer for a host of emerging telecommunication applications,” Sivan said.

Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu is among the prominat personalities who have congratulated ISRO for the successful launch.

“Congratulations to ISRO for the successful launch of India’s latest telecommunication satellite #GSAT30 into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) from Kourou launch base, French Guiana. @isro,” the VP’s office tweeted.

For its initial flight of 2020, Arianespace orbited EUTELSAT KONNECT, a telecommunication satellite for the operator Eutelsat, along with GSAT-30, using an Ariane 5 launch vehicle from the Guiana Space Centre.

EUTELSAT KONNECT which was produced by Thales Alenia Space for Eutelsat was riding in the upper position of Ariane 5’s payload arrangement, and was released first in the flight sequence at 27 minutes following liftoff.

Acting on a tip-off that lady models were available for pleasure at as high cost as Rs 1 lakh per model for an outing, the police raided three-star Dragonfly Hotel at Andheri (east) on late on Thursday, arrested a 29-year-old woman behind the prostitutes’ racket and rescued three small-time actresses.

Of the rescued actresses, one is minor girl. But, all three of them are working in television and web serials. One of them has worked in Marathi television serial, while another has worked in ‘Savdhan India’ serial.

Identifying the mistress behind the sex racket as one Priya Sharma, the police said that she operated the alleged sex racket under the banner of her tours and travel firm M/s Vinayak Vacation and Holidays.

She came to the hotel with three actresses. At the hotel, our team arrested accused mistress and rescued three actresses, including a minor girl,” a senior police officer said.

Investigations have revealed that three young brokers from New Delhi — as Aavesh, Vinay and Kuldeep Jani — have been helping the accused mistress luring in young and attractive girls to the alleged sex racket. They have been named as absconding accused in the case.

The accused mistress Priya Sharma and three absconding accused have been booked under the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act and relevant sections of the IPC.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sex-racket-busted---3-tv-actresses-rescued-in-mumbai.html

146,18-1-20,"Don’t fall into TMC trap, apply for citizenship: BJP","Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh on Friday warned immigrants from Bangladesh against falling into the ‘trap’ of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee by not applying for citizenship and not providing the related documents for the same.

Addressing a crowd during an Abhinandan, Yata Ghosh said, “I must warn one and all, particularly those who have migrated from Bangladesh before 2014 to apply for citizenship by providing all the relevant information … this is an utmost requisite because Prime Minister Narendra Modi will wait for another 2-3 months after which the Government will take appropriate action.”

Accusing Banerjee for misleading the people by asking them not to abide by the Citizenship Amendment Act which is a central statue, Ghosh said “the Chief Minister is misleading the people by asking them to reject and boycott the law. Those who will fall in that trap, will do themselves great harm. They will not file the documents at their own peril because the Prime Minister will wait for another 2-3 months where after the Government will act.”

Like it happened during the protest against the GST “when people who refused to register had to do so afterwards by paying fine this time also CAA will be implemented at any cost,” he said.

He also iterated that Aadhar card or voters’ identity card were not the right documents to prove citizenship. “The new law is there to give you citizenship and not to snatch it from you. So those who have come before 2014 are required to report it to the Government through proper document and apply for citizenship.

Not doing so at the instigation of Mamata Banerjee will amount to invite trouble,” Ghosh said rejecting allegations brought by the Chief Minister and even the Left and the Congress that one has produce the birth certificates of their parents to prove their bonafide.

“This is all bunkum. You will not be required to produce the birth certificates of your parents… they are only spreading disinformation about this. You will only have to apply for citizenship with right documents so as to get citizenship,” he said.

Slamming the civil society members for taking out rallies against CAA Ghosh said “these so called members of the intelligentsia class are only half-educated people. Today they are descending on the streets against CAA but we want to ask them where they were when thousands of Hindus were massacred by fanatic Muslims in Bangladesh … where they were when our Hindu brothers and sisters had to flee that country leaving their home and hearth everything.”

Meanwhile, the Chief Minister has decided not to attend an all-party meeting called by Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar citing “preoccupations.”

The Governor had called the meeting to discuss two bills held up at the Raj Bhavan, officials said. The refusal of the Chief Minister to attend the meeting and calling by the Governor of an all-party meeting is seen as an extension of the ongoing face-off between Nabanna (State Secretariat) and Raj Bhavan.

The statement calling the meeting to discuss the two held up bills which had earlier been passed by the State Assembly said that the meeting was being called with regard to the pendency of ‘The West Bengal (Prevention of Lynching) Bill, 2019’ and ‘West Bengal State Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Bill, 2019’ “on account of there being no inputs from the state government and the state Legislative Assembly in spite of repeated efforts.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/don---t-fall-into-tmc-trap--apply-for-citizenship--bjp.html

It suggested avoiding close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness, such as cough, runny nose among others. The advisory asks travellers to China to follow some “public health measures at all times” like observing good personal hygiene, practice frequent hand-washing with soap and follow etiquettes like covering mouth when coughing or sneezing.

The clinical signs and symptoms are mainly fever with a few patients having difficulty in breathing. “The mode of transmission is unclear as of now. However, so far there is little evidence of significant human-to-human transmission. Although as per the World Health Organisation’s risk assessment, the risk for global spread has been stated as low,” the advisory read.

All travellers to China, in particular to Wuhan city, have been advised to monitor their health closely.

As a precaution, the Ministry has instructed screening of international travellers from China at designated airports namely, Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata through thermal scanners.

Slamming the State, BJP MP Shobha Karandlaje tweeted the “Kerala communist Govt have declared a war against Hindus of the state!”

Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran criticised those who were trying to give a communal colour to the Tourism department tweet on the Kerala delicacy — “Beef Ularthiyathu” and said in the southern state none links food with religion.

“Tender chunks of beef, slow-roasted with aromatic spices, coconut pieces, and curry leaves. A recipe for the most classic dish, Beef Ularthiyathu, the stuff of legends, from the land of spices, Kerala,” the tweet read along with a recipe link.

Some Twitter users had showed their displeasure as the tweet had appeared on January 15 on Makarsankranti day, a Hindu festival celebrated as Pongal, Bihu and Lohri in other parts of the country.

Surendran said those trying to communalise the matter were the ones who were creating a controversy by saying that pictures of pork dishes should also be uploaded by the department.

Various dishes made of pork are already on the website, he pointed out.

Shobha Karandlaje, BJP MP from Udupi, wrote “the state government is taking a ride on Hindu sentiments by glorifying Beef on #MakarSankranti day. Sick mindset of Commies of Kerala is out for display. Communism is a disease, shame on u @KeralaTourism!,” the BJP leader tweeted.

Another Twitter user wrote: “Are you out of your mind? on Pongal and Sankranti when we revere Cows, Oxen, and Cattle for their contribution to mankind’s easy existence

and culture... On one hand we have Gangireddula meLam in Telugu states, Jallikattu in TN, and Kambala races in Karnataka and you showcase this.”

However, it was not only brickbats alone for Kerala Tourism, as many came out in support for the “beef fry tweet”.

“One Porotta and beef fry - a match made in heaven” was the response of a Kerala twitter user who had also shared a picture of the dish.

Another twitter user shared an old video of BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Suresh Gopi talking about how he gained weight after consuming beef.

“Dear Bhakts, This is Malayalam actor Suresh Gopi... apparently he is also an MP of BJP (not elected by people, of course),” the tweet said.

Some pointed out that pork is also much desired dish of the Keralites.

158,18-1-20,Mumbai to be 24x7 city from Jan 26,"Come January 26, Mumbai will literally live up to its reputation of being ‘a city that never sleeps’, when the Maharashtra Government begins to implement on an experimental basis its much-discussed proposal of keeping keep all restaurants, malls, multiplexes and shopping plazas open for 24 hours.

Five years after he mooted for the first time his “Vibrant Mumbai Nightlife” proposal, then Yuv Sena leader and now Maharashtra’s Tourism and Environment Aditya Thackeray — at meeting of top Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and police held that he presided over on Thursday night — has given a go-ahead for the ‘24x7 Maximum city’ proposal.

As per the decision taken by the State Government, all restaurants, malls, multiplexes and shopping plazas falling within-gated gate-communities, non-residential zones with security, CCTVs and parking areas in the maximum city can remain open round-the-clock from January 26 onwards.

Thursday’s meeting, where the crucial decision was taken, was attended among others by Aditya, Municipal Commissioner Pravin Pardeshi and Sanjay Barve.

Currently, the restaurants and bars close down at 1.30 am. However, once Aditya’s proposal gets implemented, these establishments will remain through the night – provided these establishments are not in designated residential areas. The 1.30 am closure deadline for bars and restaurants has been in force since 1992-93.

It may be recalled on February 17, 2015, Aditya had met chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and submitted a formal letter requesting the latter to put in place the laws that make Mumbai a “live 24/7” city. His meeting with Fadnavis had come after the Sena-ruled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) adopted a resolution seeking “Vibrant Nightlife” for Mumbai and sent off a proposal to the Maharashtra government suggesting necessary amendments to relevant laws.

Known for pursuing his pet projects, Aditya had pushed the proposed once again in the run-up days to January 1, 2019. In a letter written on December 27,2018, Aditya had reminded then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis about a request he had made three years earlier to put in place the laws which make Mumbai a “live 24/7” city.

Aditya had requested Fadnavis to allow Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Pune and other cities “that wish to celebrate New Year” to remain open all night “for legal activities of entertainment and celebration, especially in non-residential areas”.

“I take this opportunity to drop a small reminder of the proposal of the BMC, first passed in 2013, then approved by the Commissioner and now legislated on by the state in 2017, to let non-residential areas in Mumbai and other cities to remain open 24/7. The proposal for Mumbai is awaiting your approval from the Home department for a few months now and is fool-proof”.

159,18-1-20,Vodafone Idea’s ability to compete in Indian market may weaken: Moody’s,"With the Supreme Court rejecting a review of its order that put Rs 1.47 lakh crore liability of past dues on telecom firms, Vodafone Idea’s ability to compete in the Indian market is likely to weaken and this will provide an opportunity for Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio to gain market share, Moody’s Investors Service said on Friday.

“The financial burden will likely further weaken Vodafone Idea’s ability to compete in the Indian market, potentially providing an opportunity for competitors Bharti and Jio to gain market share,” the US-based agency said.

Moody’s further added: “While a fresh blow, the judgment is no real surprise and Bharti had already made provisions to help offset the impact on its balance sheet. Nevertheless, the impact on its credit profile will likely be significant, with both debt and leverage set to rise.”

Meanwhile, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea are evaluating filing a curative petition before the apex court for relaxation on penalties and payment deadline. In a statement, Bharti Airtel, which faces a liability of nearly Rs 35,586 crore, said it was disappointed by the order and was now “evaluating filing a curative petition”. Vodafone Idea, which has to pay Rs 53,038 crore, said it was also “exploring further options, including filing of a curative petition”.

Moody’s places Yes Bank’s ratings under review

Moody’s Investors Service has placed Yes Bank’s long-term foreign currency issuer rating of B2 under review, with the direction uncertain, citing “slowness in raising new capital”.

“The placing of Yes Bank’s deposit rating of B2 under review reflects Moody’s expectation that the bank’s standalone viability is getting increasingly challenged by its slowness in raising new capital,” the US-based agency has said in a statement.

It further said the potential credit risk to the bank’s senior creditors is uncertain, because there are a number of diverse scenarios that could affect the rating in either positive or negative directions.

Yes Bank is in discussions with a number of investors to raise new equity capital, which would be credit positive if executed successfully, Moody’s said adding that “If the bank successfully recapitalises and repairs and cleans its balance sheet, its ratings could stabilise or face upward pressure”.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/vodafone-idea---s-ability-to-compete-in-indian-market-may-weaken--moody---s.html

161,18-1-20,IRDAI chief cautions insurers against predatory pricing,"Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) chairman SC Khuntia on Friday cautioned insurers against indulging in predatory pricing, saying it is not a sustainable model while citing examples of airline and telecom sectors. Highlighting that the insurance industry is different from other business, he said if an insurer fails, it has bearing on customers as well.

“I would like to give a word of caution here. Though your (insurance brokers) share is very high in group health insurance, the loss ratio in group health insurance is also very high. Probably, it is not very sustainable at present,” he said at an event organised by Insurance Brokers Association of India here.

“So the insurance companies, intermediaries and policyholders need to unite to create a sustainable atmosphere. In other industries if there is unfair competition, the industry suffers but the clientele don’t suffer. While this has happened in airlines and telecom industries but we cannot afford that kind of a situation in the insurance industry because insurance is an industry for protection,” he said.

“So if the industry suffers, then clientele also suffers. And as a regulator we would not like that to happen. One should not overcharge and also not undercharge,” he said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/irdai-chief-cautions-insurers-against-predatory-pricing.html
162,18-1-20,Global equities burst higher on trade deal,"Global equities rose Friday as investors, still buoyed by a landmark China-US trade deal, turned their focus to the earnings season and the global outlook, while also cheered by Chinese economic data.

In early afternoon European trade, London rose 1.0 per cent, Frankfurt jumped 0.7 per cent and Paris added 0.9 per cent, aided by news that China’s economy appears to be stabilising.

“Stock markets in Europe are higher this morning as the bullish move in Asia overnight has influenced traders in this part of the world,” said CMC Markets analyst David Madden.

“China released some broadly positive economic reports, which has boosted sentiment around the globe.”

All three main indexes on Wall Street ended at record highs Thursday, boosted by the Senate’s approval of a new North American free-trade deal, while Google parent Alphabet joined Apple and Microsoft to become a trillion-dollar firm for the first time.

The positive energy funnelled through to Asia, where Hong Kong gained 0.6 per cent, Tokyo ended 0.5 per cent higher, Shanghai rose 0.1 per cent and Sydney added 0.3 per cent. Apart from last week’s blip caused by the US assassination of Iran’s top general, markets have enjoyed a strong start to the new decade, building on the rally of late 2019.

The gains have been fanned by the “phase one” trade agreement as well as signs of improvement in worldwide economies, lower interest rates, government stimulus and easing Brexit concerns.

And with the prospect of a healthy batch of company reports, there are hopes for further advances.

“It’s very hard to be bearish here,” Linda Duessel, at Federated Investors Management, told Bloomberg TV. “We could have really good earnings surprises to the upside” as more profit reports roll in, she said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/global-equities-burst-higher-on-trade-deal.html

The new GDP data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) comes a day after China and the US signed a long-awaited phase one deal, marking a ceasefire in the 18-month trade war which saw the world’s two largest economies slap 25 per cent tariffs on about half a trillion-dollar worth of each other’s exports.

China’s economy grew by 6.1 per cent last year, its worst performance since 1990, but it remained above the psychologically important six per cent mark. The GDP growth remained well within the 6 to 6.5 target set by the government, the NBS said. However, significant from the Chinese government’s perspective, the GDP expanded to $14.38 trillion from last year’s $13.1 trillion.

In 2018, China’s economy sank to a 28-year low slowing down to 6.6 per cent year on year, lower than the 6.8-per cent growth registered in 2017 as it grappled with the continued slowdown amid the trade war with US and declining exports.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/china---s-economy-slumps-to-6-1--in-2019--lowest-in-29-yrs.html

Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, in a statement on Friday, said the company plans to create one million new jobs in India over the next five years. The new jobs — created both directly and indirectly — will be across industries, including IT, skill development, content creation, retail, logistics, and manufacturing.

These jobs are in addition to the seven lakh jobs Amazon’s investments have enabled over the last six years in the country.

The statement comes a day after Goyal said the US-based company was not doing a favour to the country by the investments, and questioned how the online retailing major could incur such “big” losses but for its predatory pricing.

Bezos, who is in India this week, had on Wednesday announced $1 billion (over Rs 7,000 crore) investment in the country to help bring small and medium businesses online and committed to exporting $10 billion worth of India-made goods by 2025.

“We’ve seen huge contributions from our employees, extraordinary creativity from the small businesses we’ve partnered with, and great enthusiasm from the customers who shop with us - and we’re excited about what lies ahead,” Bezos said in the statement on Friday.

""Davinder Singh has terrorist links but to get him released, the Government has handed over the investigation to NIA headed by YC Modi, who had bailed out Amit Shah in Gujarat,"" Digvijaya Singh said here.

""Davinder Singh has a mysterious role in the 2002 Parliament attack. Afzal Guru had also indicated in this regard. Singh is also suspected to have a role in the Pulwama attack.

""The Centre has brought the CAA just to divert the attention of the nation from the growing unrest over price rise, soaring inflation, growing unemployment and economic slump,"" he said.

Observing that there was no need to amend the Citizenship Act, Singh said earlier there was no problem in giving citizenship to anyone.

171,18-1-20,Saibaba birthplace row: Vikhe Patil warns of ‘legal fight’,"The row over the Maharashtra Government's decision to develop Pathri as a pilgrimage centre flared up on Friday, with BJP MP Sujay Vikhe-Patil asking why the claims that it was Saibaba's birthplace surfaced only after the new Government took over.

He also said the people of Shirdi, which houses a famous Saibaba temple, might launch a ‘legal fight’ over the issue.

Former Chief Minister Ashok Chavan, on the other hand, said creation of facilities for devotees at Pathri should not be opposed over the controversy over birthplace.

Shirdi in Ahmednagar district where Saibaba, a 19th century spiritual leader, lived, attracts lakhs of devotees every year.

The controversy began after Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray's announcement of a grant of Rs 100 crore for development of Pathri in Parbhani district, believed to be Saibaba's birthplace by a section of devotees.

NCP leader Durrani Abdullah Khan claimed on Thursday that there was enough evidence to prove that Saibaba was born at Pathri.

""While Shirdi is Saibaba's 'karmabhoomi' (place of work) Pathri is 'janmabhoomi' (birthplace) and both places have their own importance,"" he said.

Tourists from across the country and world visit Pathri but it lacks good infrastructure, he said.""People of Shirdi don't have issue with the funds, they just don't want Pathri to be called Saibaba's birthplace,"" he claimed.

Shirdi residents fear that if Pathri became famous, the flow of devotees to their town will dwindle, he alleged.

On Friday, BJP MP from Ahmednagar, Sujay Vikhe-Patil wondered why the issue of Saibaba's birthplace came to the fore suddenly after the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress Government replaced the BJP-led regime in the State.

""There was no dispute over Saibaba's birthplace. How it became an issue and new evidence (about Pathri being the birthplace) came up after the government changed?

172,18-1-20,Market ends flat; banks slide on NPA concerns after SC’s AGR ruling,"n Market gauges Sensex and Nifty gave up early gains to close on a flat note on Friday as investors moved to the sidelines amid concerns that the Supreme Court ruling on telecom AGR issue might further aggravate stressed assets problem in the banking sector.

At the closing bell, the BSE benchmark Sensex was up 12.81 points or 0.03 per cent at 41,945.37. The index also marked its new all-time high of 42,063.93 in intraday trading, before surrendering some of its gains.

The broader Nifty, however, settled 3.15 points or 0.025 per cent lower at 12,352.35. The NSE barometer too touched its life-time intraday peak of 12,385.45 in early deals before losing momentum.

During the week, the Sensex advanced 345.65 points or 0.83 per cent; while the Nifty rose 95.55 points or 0.77 per cent.

In a session marked by high volatility, gains in Reliance Industries offset losses in other heavyweights HDFC, ICICI Bank and TCS.

On the Sensex chart, Bharti Airtel was the top gainer, rallying 5.47 per cent, after experts said the Supreme Court’s rejection of a review of its order that put Rs 1.47 lakh crore liability of past dues on telcos, will weaken Vodafone Idea’s ability to compete in the Indian market; in turn, providing an opportunity for Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio to gain market share.

Shares of Vodafone Idea plunged 25.21 per cent.

Ahead of their quarterly earnings, Reliance Industries and HCL Tech advanced up to 2.79 per cent, while TCS fell 0.79 per cent.

Heavyweight HDFC dropped 1.23 per cent.

In percentage terms, IndusInd Bank, SBI, HDFC, ICICI Bank and L&T were among the top losers.

On the contrary, Bharti Airtel, Reliance, Sun Pharma, HCL Tech and Maruti Suzuki emerged as major gainers.

Sectorally, BSE bankex, metal, finance, capital goods and IT indices fell up to 0.78 per cent. While energy, telecom, healthcare, consumer durables, power and auto indices rose up to 1.79 per cent.

In the broader market, BSE midcap and smallcap indices rose up to 0.54 per cent.

“As anticipated, mid and small caps are outpacing the broader market... Main indices are impacted by Supreme Court verdict on AGR, having an effect on telecom and banking sectors which are already facing NPA problem. The pre-budget rally has been very solid on a month-on-month basis, market may consolidate in the short-term and take cues from the actual budget and on-going results,” Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services, said.

The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed review petitions filed by telecom companies against its October 24, 2019 order that asked for inclusion of non-telecom revenues for calculating statutory dues such as licence fee and spectrum usage charge.

Dues, which total to Rs 1.47 lakh crore for 15 telecom companies including Airtel and Vodafone Idea, as per the October order, have to be paid by January 23.

According to traders, domestic investors are awaiting directional cues from key corporate results for cues amid concerns over higher bank non-performing assets and a spike in retail inflation.

“Global markets witnessed a strong rally as easing trade tensions and promising economic data buoyed the sentiments. Indian markets too ended the week with strong gains especially in midcaps and small caps. Midcap and small caps have significantly outperformed the Nifty... We are seeing strong traction in the broader market with revived risk appetite among investors ahead of Budget,” Hemang Kapasi, portfolio manager (equity investment products) at Sanctum Wealth Management, said.

Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul ended higher. European markets also started on a positive note.

The oil-to-telecom conglomerate, led by richest Indian Mukesh Ambani, reported a net profit of Rs 11,640 crore, or Rs 18.4 per share, in October-December, up from Rs 10,251 crore, or Rs 17.3 a share, in the same period of the previous financial year, the company said in a statement.

This is the highest quarterly net profit earned by any private company, surpassing its own previous best of Rs 11,262 crore in the July-September 2019 period.

State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) holds the distinction of posting the highest ever quarterly profit by any Indian firm when it had reported a net profit of Rs 14,512.81 crore in January-March 2013.

However, consolidated revenue fell 1.4 per cent to Rs 1,68,858 crore in the third quarter of 2019-20.

While oil refining margins rose after six straight quarters of decline, the company opened 415 more retail stores and added 37.1 million subscribers to its Jio mobile phone service that helped increase the profitability of the venture. But the weakness in its traditional petrochemical businesses continued.

The operator of the world’s largest oil refining complex saw pre-tax earnings from the business rise 12 per cent to Rs 5,657 crore in the third quarter of the current fiscal year.

It earned $9.2 on turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel as compared to a gross refining margin (GRM) of $8.8 per barrel in the October-December 2018. The GRM was, however, lower than USD 9.4 per barrel earned in July-September 2019.

Reliance reported record pre-tax profit from its retail and telecom businesses. The two segments now account for nearly 40 per cent of its EBITDA, up from close to 25 per cent last financial year.

With its retail store strength rising to 11,316 from 10,901 at the end of the second quarter, the retail business posted a 58 per cent jump in pre-tax profit to Rs 2,389 crore and a 27 per cent rise in revenue at Rs 45,327 crore.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/reliance-reports-record-quarterly-net-profit-of-rs-11-640-crore-in-q3.html
174,18-1-20,Iran’s top leader strikes defiant tone amid month of turmoil,"Iran’s supreme leader lashed out at Western countries as he led Friday prayers in Tehran for the first time in eight years, dismissing “American clowns” who he said pretend to support the Iranian nation but want to stick their “poisoned dagger” into its back.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei used his rare appearance at the weekly prayers to deliver a fiery address in which he insisted Iran would not bow to US pressure after months of crushing sanctions and a series of recent crises — from the killing of a top Iranian general to the accidental shooting down of a Ukrainian passenger plane.

Khamenei said the mass funerals for General Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in a US airstrike earlier this month, show that the Iranian people support the Islamic Republic despite its recent trials.

He said the “cowardly” hit on Soleimani had taken out the most effective commander in the battle against the Islamic State group.

In response to Soleimani’s killing, Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles targeting US troops in Iraq, without causing serious injuries. Khamenei said the strike had dealt a “blow to America’s image” as a superpower. In the part of his sermon delivered in Arabic, he said the “real punishment” would be in forcing the US to withdraw from the Middle East.

After the missile strike, as Iran’s Revolutionary Guard braced for an American counterattack that never came, it mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian jetliner shortly after takeoff from Tehran’s international airport, killing all 176 passengers on board, mostly Iranians.

On his arrival in Myanmar, the first by a Chinese leader in 19 years, President Xi received a royal welcome with two fighter jets escorting his plane after it entered the country’s airspace. As his plane touched down in Nay Pyi Taw, children presented him flowers before he was whisked off to a greeting party, China’s state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Huge portraits of the Chinese President and banners celebrating the China-Myanmar friendship and

cooperation were put up along Xi’s route from the airport to downtown.

According to Xinhua, Xi told Myanmar leaders that he was convinced that his visit will “take the bilateral ties to a new level and into a new era”.

179,18-1-20,Rhythm is a dancer,"Indian contemporary choreographer Astad Deboo tells Saimi Sattar how his travels across the world have shaped his unique artform

He is busy on the phone as he sits at the Triveni Terrace Café in the heart of the capital. Dressed in a blue ripped jeans, a striped shirt with a black shawl casually draped across his shoulders, contemporary dancer AstadDeboo wears his hair in a buzz cut. The air that he exudes belies the years that he has clocked having been born in the same year as our country. During the conversation, his eyes light up often and his hands move in tandem with his words. His brain is agile. He meanders frequently from the question to expound a point but comes back to where he has begun having explained it by way of examples. The contemporary dance maestro has pushed boundaries in pursuance of his art where he continues to experiment.

You were born in the same year as India. How have you seen it change?

Yes, 1947. But when I came back to India to introduce a new dance form, there was a lot of resentment in government cultural institutions, Ministry of Culture and even from classical gurus. Not that people themselves weren’t receptive to my experimental workshops, they were afraid that their gurus would get upset. It was my determination and perseverance that kept me going and I am grateful to the media as they spoke about my work.

Still the peer criticism was all around. A very established dancer once said that even when you stage one show in a year, people talk about it but they don’t talk about the 30 to 40 shows we do in a year. But the reason was due to the kind of work they did and the dance form that they practiced. Though I have studied kathakand kathakali, I do not take an entire tukdafrom the Indian classical style in my work. I just use the technique. While often what they were doing was yet another interpretation of Krishna or Shiva.

In the beginning, the audience was limited to writers or musicians. Slowly, word got around. The best form of publicity is word-of-mouth. Everybody went happy while I stuck to my guns. In those early days, I spent six months here and six overseas.

Earlier I was a solo dancer and very energetic. But now I do slower movements and it is more difficult to be in sync with the music than when the movement is faster.

What kept you going despite the fact that the institutions and the established artistes were not accepting?

Those days, it was hard and frustrating to be accepted as a liberal artiste but I had the support and blessings of my parents. I could come back to a happy home and that was a big blessing. Even today, many boys find it hard to rationalise their choice as performers. My father, on the other hand, said, “I am sorry we do not have enough connections to help you out” Had it been an unhappy home, I would not have been able to handle the rejections which I faced constantly.

How do collaborations further your journey?

A collaboration needs to blend. There needs to be some amount of respect and understanding between the collaborating partners. We should be on the same plane. When you are working, you want the working environment to be stress free. Otherwise one is not able to create.When I collaborate with somebody, there is a sparkand I am able to do things which I have never tried before. Because you need someone to trigger that change or extend that boundary. I worked with BahauddinDagarwho is a great artist. We were discussing something and he said, “Your performance.” And I immediately pointed out, “It is not my show but ours. You are not accompanying me. We are working together to create something good.”

How difficult was it to perfect the Jose Limon technique and the way it seems to defy gravity? , How difficult was it to perfect, especially when you are using it in conjunction with Martha Graham technique?

I took these classes when I was already 24. When you are young, your body is supple. I imbibed only those things which my body could accept. So I cannot claim perfection in these dance forms. But yes, all that experience of how these school’s practitioners worked with their bodies and their breath control influenced me deeply. This was a whole new teaching process. I studied many dance forms and ended up using a lot of Balinese movements in my work.People also see the influence of Japanese butoh dance in my work. All this experience has enriched me as an individual.

Mukhabhinay is an important part of your dance technique and that is something which is clearly Indian in origin…

Mukhabhinay is something that is ingrained in me. Don’t forget that I learnt kathak and kathakalifor 16 years so it comes naturally. I use it a lot but not all the time.

You hitchhiked to the US. What made you do that? How have your travels contributed to your art?

I had studied Indian classical dance, beginning withkathak. And then my father put the brakes on my lessons. But he had let a boy, and that too a Parsione,take dancing lessons in the first place. Destiny called again when I watched an American dance company perform in the city. A new dimension opened up where dancers performed as a collective using a defined space. Nothing like that existed in India and my father didn’t have the means to invest in my passion.

But I was fired by a spirit of adventure and just set off. I left the country in 1969 on a cargo ship with goats, sheep and other workers who would get off at Dubai or Bahrain. Eventually the voyage ended at Khorramshahr in Iran. I hitchhiked across Europe but it was possible at that time because it was a part of the youth culture then. Nobody thought anything about travelling with strangers. I also travelled to Canada and Japan.

Monuments and places that I had just read about came alive during that time. I travelled the world and explored different cultures for seven and a half years instead. I just hitchhiked, studied, absorbed and learnt. I went to Australia and New Zealand on a cheap budget. These travels have ensured that I look at each day as a gift where I meet more people. I stayed in a youth hostel picking up tips to survive.

A friend’s daughter recently told me that she was so much in awe of my experience. But now many young people are doing it though in a much different form. It is more hiking rather than hitchhiking.

Is that why you connect to young people from varied backgrounds? You’ve also worked with hearing-impaired children and those from the Salaam Baalak Trust...

I worked with children of Salaam Baalak Trust and the drummers of Manipur. And here I can point out a difference. When travelling on shows, the Manipur dancers wait for me to take them out while the ones from the trust are survivors and they have the instinct to explore.

I have worked with the deaf after I came across a friend who was working with a deaf theatre company in Kolkata. I was not trained to work with them but learnt on the job. After a three-week workshop, it was possible to create an entire experience with them able to express themselves. I learnt so much from them like lip-reading and sign language. I use myself as a catalyst and then mentor and nurture them. They became confident and were role models.

Earlier the ones from the trust performed on Bollywood songs and were applauded. After working with me they got recognition as people came up to speak with them and applauded them. They were excited because there was a sense of achievement as they saw their photos in the newspapers as well. I am not doing this for my glorification but rather to demonstrate what can be done with hard work and perseverance.

What keeps you young? While dancers half your age follow the set patterns, you keep extending your boundaries?

(Guffaws)I still, by God’s grace can dance at my age and the response which one gets from the public is an incentive. And I personally feel that I still can so why should I stop? I keep pushing myself physically and creatively. I have been working for 14 years in Manipur. Earlier, it was with the martial artists and now it is with the drummers. The performance that is put up now is all very organic while keeping their tradition intact. I do feel tradition is very important and it gives you grounding. When you have a strong foundation, then you can grow and are open to absorbing and looking at things with an eye that is impartial. Lekinchahathonichahiye(But you should have the desire). Otherwise you are wasting your time and also that of the person who wants you to be a part of the project.

Your choice of venues have been eclectic to say the least, for instance, The Great Wall of China, amid artefacts in a museum and more...

People are used to watching a performance in a theatre. But when I select a space, it has to speak to me. For example, at Triveni I will have people sitting on the stage while the performance takes place on the steps. But some performances work better in an enclosed environment.

With the advent of digital, how do you see performing arts changing?

Overseas there is a lot of audio visual work happening in production. But I feel when you come to see a performance, you want to do just that.

How much of practice did it take to mould yourself like dough during Chewing Gum?

I am very impressed that you've done your homework. A lot of time people come to me and say. batayeaapkyakarrahenhain(What are you doing)?

It was a stretch fabric that I used. It was a small box and I sat inside it. The way children chew gum and take it out, that is the way it was performed. It was a short interlude. People still ask me if I do it.

Can artists afford to be political especially through their work?

Yes. The four quotes of Mahatma Gandhi that I have used for my present work reflect it. When I started, the protests against CAA had not picked up but now they are so much more relevant.

The first quote is, ""It is very easy to be a part of the crowd. It takes courage to stand alone.” And that is what citizens have done, the way they have rallied together.

The second one is, ""I have been very disappointed with educated people and how they have reacted.” While Mahatma Gandhi was talking about how educated people did not shun khadi,today it is a reference to people who are saying “I am pro CAA” which is disappointing. When I attended protest rallies or put up a status on Facebook, someone told me that “I wouldn’t be affected so I should not react.” But I am lookingat the larger picture. Earlier all of us lived, worked, spoke and stood up for each other. Why not, now?

180,18-1-20,It’s a wild wild world,"Wildlife photographer Vikram Potdar says that the places with civilisations look more or less similar but nature is always different in different parts of the world. By Team Viva

Share with us your insights on witnessing the wildlife across seven continents.

My insight in witnessing the world across seven continents is that if you visit any European city, you will find that the interiors of the city is similar to Helsinki or Berlin or Frankfurt, even Vienna, the inner city has cobblestone streets, Roman Gothic architecture and town halls. And if you go to the newly developed cities, you see glass facade, aluminum composite panel and contemporary styled buildings. But if you visit the flora and fauna, the forest and the countryside, those are unique. So I have found that the places with civilisations look more or less similar. But nature is always different in different parts of the world.

What has been your biggest takeaway from your journey around the world?

I have witnessed and observed habitat loss and melting of ice in polar regions. So the best way to preserve this natural wealth is to leave it alone. If we leave the nature as it is, it will certainly take its own course. That is the best way to preserve the wildlife.

How relevant do you find Sony BBC Earth’s show Seven Worlds, One Planet?

I have earlier highlighted the similarity in urban areas and uniqueness in forests and jungles. So the variety of nature is a binding thread in all the seven worlds, or rather, I would say, wildlife binds all the continents together. This show on Sony BBC Earth aptly named as Seven Worlds, One Planet does justice to the natural wealth, surroundings, flora and fauna around us.

How has climate change affected the natural world around each of the continent?

The climate change has affected natural world quite a lot over the last 40 years, almost 30 to 40 per cent of bird and mammal population is wiped out. It is further going down due to the constant pressure on the habitats and natural resources. So the climate change effects are at an alarming rate.

What drove you to the world of wildlife? Tell us about your very first experience as a wildlife photographer?

Since childhood, I was very much fond of nature. But I seldom took out time to pursue my hobby as I was busy with nature of living, jobs, marriage and settlement. So I never really cared about my passion and what I really wanted to do. I was engrossed in daily chores of life. It was in 2006 when I visited Nagarhole National Park in South India, where I witnessed wild animals — deers, elephants, Indian gaurs for the first time. That’s when I realised that this is my destiny. This is what I wanted to do. And thereby wildlife photography started actually.

Have you watched any shows on Sony BBC Earth? If given an opportunity, would you be interested in being a part of any locally produced show?

I don’t watch television much, but yes if opportunity is given, I would like to be a part of the show.

Can you share any memorable stories from any of the continents? Some anecdotes or incident you remember.

I went to Churchill in Northern Canada, Manitoba province to photograph polar bear mother and cup in the Dane. The temperature was minus 40 degree celsius. As I come from the tropical climate area, it was really difficult for me to stay in such a cold weather. But somehow, I managed by wearing six layers of heavy clothing and two layers of hand gloves. Even photography was quite a challenge there.

What do you think makes for a perfect wildlife shot?

Well, the taste of each photographer varies, but according to me, the best wildlife shot is the one which depicts the habitat. Over the years my signature style of photography has transformed into habitat sort, it means that the animal will be small in the frame. Suppose I’m shooting a tiger in the forest of Tadoba, then maybe 90 per cent of the frame will be the forest and 10 per cent will be tiger. So it will show the habitat of the Tiger. I don’t like shooting tight frames. and portraits of animals which shows nothing but the animal. I like to show the habitat, the animal and the trees of the surrounding. So the best ever wildlife photography image is one depicts habitat and has some story in it.

183,18-1-20,More than 300 items may see customs duty hike in Budget,"As a measure to boost domestic small and medium industry, the Government may consider a hike in customs duty on over 300 items like toys, furniture, footwear, coated paper, rubber items among other in the Union Budget.

Besides giving relief to the domestic industry and boosting employment, the move to keep imports down and help to raise revenue. Many of these are industries which are essentially concentrated in the small and medium sectors and employment intensive.

The Commerce and Industry Ministry in its budget recommendations has proposed rationalisation of basic customs on over 300 items across sectors including furniture, chemicals, rubber, coated paper and paper boards.

On footwear and related products, the Ministry has suggested increase in duty to 35 per cent from the current 25 per cent while for new pneumatic tyres of rubber, it has proposed to hike customs duty to 40 per cent from the current 10-15 per cent.

The import duty hike on footwear is a move to thwart the increase in imports of undervalued and cheap footwear. While the majority of imports are coming from ASEAN countries, with which India has a free trade agreement, it is suspected that China is re-routing large quantities of footwear through these countries.

The ministry has proposed to increase import duty on wooden furniture to 30 per cent from the current 20 per cent. For coated paper, paper boards and hand made papers, it has suggested doubling the duty to 20 per cent.

The Ministry has asked for the removal of import duty on waste paper and wood pulp, which is currently at 10 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively. The paper industry has expressed concerns about cheap imports and a surge in inbound shipments.

For wood, metal and plastic toys, the ministry has suggested increase in import duty to up to 100 per cent from the current 20 per cent.

184,18-1-20,‘Foreign investments must adhere to law of the land’,"A day after he scoffed at Amazon.Com founder Jeff Bezos’ offer to invest USD 1 billion in India, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Friday tried to do damage control saying the country welcomes all kinds of investments that follow the “letter and spirit” of the law.

Goyal clarified his remarks on Twitter as well as to reporters saying some people have misconstrued his remarks by suggesting that he had said something negative against Amazon.

“I was only saying that investment should come as per the rules and regulation,” he told reporters in Ahmedabad.

Big-ticket investments in the retail space should not hurt small traders who do not have “lakhs and crores” of rupees, Goyal said.

“We welcome all kinds of investment. However, the necessary legal process would follow if any investment is made outside the purview of law,” he said.

While Goyal had on Thursday raised questions about Amazon’s business practices saying the company had done no big favours to India by announcing a new USD 1 billion investment, his party’s foreign cell head Vijay Chauthaiwale tweeted barely-veiled criticism of Bezos-owned the Washington Post, which has been criticized by the BJP for its coverage of the Modi government’s increasingly right-wing policies.

Bezos who topped up his announcement of investing USD 1 billion to help bring small and medium business online, with an announcement of creating one million new jobs in India over the next five years.

With an association of small traders aligned with the BJP holding demonstrations against his visit and India plans, the world’s richest person visited a neighbourhood store in Mumbai, met Bollywood stars and captains of industry.

“Our country has some rules for e-commerce industry. We welcome all those investments which come as per these rules. However, it should not create unfair competition for the small traders of India. They do not get zero per cent loans. They do not have lakhs and crores of rupees. They do business with small capital,” said Goyal on Friday.

On Thursday, he had questioned why the e-commerce market place should make losses but for its predatory pricing.

“My statement should be seen in a perspective,” he said in Ahmedabad on Friday adding that all countries welcome foreign investment but it should be within the framework of the law.

“Our laws say that the interests of such small traders should not get hurt. Investment should be in the purview of set parameters. That is the view of me and the government,” he added.

If investments are not within the framework of law, then legal action would be initiated, he said.

The minister in a tweet also expressed similar views.

“We welcome all kinds of investments that follow the letter & spirit of the law. If some investment is outside the legal purview, appropriate action will be taken. Our government wants to ensure that unfair competition is not created for crores of small traders and retailers of the country,” Goyal said in a tweet.

Goyal has stated that e-commerce companies have to follow Indian rules in letter and spirit and not find loopholes to make a back-door entry into multi-brand retail segment.

India does not allow foreign investment beyond 49 per cent in multi-brand retailing and has not yet approved any application of overseas retailers.

“They (Amazon) may have put in a billion dollars but if they make a loss of a billion dollars every year, then jolly well will have to finance that billion-dollar. So, it is not as if they are doing a favour to India when they invest a billion dollars,” Goyal said at the Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi on Thursday.

The USD 1 billion investment by Amazon.Com to help bring small and medium businesses online is on the top of USD 5.5 billion funding it had previously announced.

The minister wondered why an e-commerce market place model, where a firm provides an IT platform for buyers and sellers, incurring huge losses adding that it needs to be looked upon.

“They are investing money over the last few years also in warehousing and certain other activities, which is welcome and good. But if they are bringing in money largely to finance losses and those losses in an e-commerce market place model,” Goyal said.

He has added that in a fair market place model in a turnover of USD 10 billion if a company is incurring a loss of billion dollars, it “certainly raises questions, where the loss came from”.

Goyal has said that how can a marketplace make such a big loss unless they are indulging in “predatory pricing or some unfair trade practices”.

185,18-1-20,Trump’s trial begins at start of election yr,"The US Senate opened the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump with quiet ceremony Thursday — senators standing at their desks to swear an oath of “impartial justice” as jurors, House prosecutors formally reciting the charges and Chief Justice John Roberts presiding.

The trial, only the third such undertaking in Amaerican history, is unfolding at the start of the election year, a time of deep political division in the nation. Four of the senators sitting in judgment on Trump are running for the Democratic Party’s nomination to challenge him in the fall.

“Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!” intoned the Senate’s sergeant at arms, calling the proceedings to order just past noon. Senators filled the chamber, an unusual sight in itself, sitting silently under strict rules that prohibit talking or cellphones, for a trial that will test not only Trump’s presidency but also the nation’s three branches of power and its system of checks and balances.

The Constitution mandates the chief justice serve as the presiding officer, and Roberts made the short trip across the street from the Supreme Court to the Capitol.

He has long insisted judges are not politicians and is expected to serve as a referee for the proceedings. Senators rose quickly when he appeared in his plain black robe.

“Will all senators now stand, and remain standing, and raise their right hand,” Roberts said. “Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, president of the United States, now pending, you will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws, so help you God?” The senators responded they would, and then they lined up to sign an oath book.

Trump faces two charges after the House voted to impeach him last month. One, that he abused his presidential power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, using military aid to the country as leverage. Trump is also charged with obstructing Congress’ ensuing probe.

The President insists he did nothing wrong, and he dismissed the trial anew on Thursday at the White House, “It’s totally partisan. It’s a hoax.”

Eventual acquittal is expected in the Republican-controlled Senate. However, new revelations are mounting about Trump’s actions toward Ukraine. The Government Accountability Office said Thursday that the White House violated federal law in withholding the security assistance to Ukraine, which shares a border with hostile Russia.

At the same time, an indicted associate of Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Lev Parnas, has turned over to prosecutors new documents linking the president to the shadow foreign policy being run by Giuliani.

The developments applied fresh pressure to senators to call more witnesses for the trial, a main source of contention that is still to be resolved. The White House has instructed officials not to comply with subpoenas from Congress requesting witnesses or other information. “What is the president hiding? What is he afraid of?’’ asked Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.

Russia’s FM slams ‘aggressive’ US policies

Moscow: Russia’s foreign policy chief on Friday blamed what he described as “aggressive” US policies for growing global tensions, noting Washington’s reluctance to extend a key nuclear arms pact. Sergey Lavrov, who serves as acting foreign minister in the wake of Wednesday’s resignation of the Russian Cabinet, said this week’s meeting of top U.S. and Russian diplomats on strategic stability didn’t achieve any immediate results, adding that “dialogue is continuing.” Russia-US relations have been at post-Cold War lows since Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea.

US warship sails through Taiwan Strait

Taipei: A US warship has sailed through the Taiwan Strait, mainland and Taipei officials said Friday, the first such passage since the island resoundingly re-elected its independence-leaning president. The warship was on a “routine mission” on Thursday, Taiwan’s defence ministry said, as it traversed the stretch of water that divides the self-ruling island from the authoritarian Chinese mainland.

187,18-1-20,Ukraine PM offers to resign after leaked recording,"Ukraine’s Prime Minister offered his resignation on Friday after audio was leaked of him questioning President Volodymyr Zelensky’s grasp of economics, in the first major political test for the inexperienced leader.

It was unclear whether Zelensky would accept Oleksiy Goncharuk’s offer, which came after a recording emerged of him reportedly saying the president had a “primitive understanding” of the economy.

Zelensky, a comedian with no previous political experience, came to power after a landslide election win last year and his “Servant of the People” party later won a strong majority in parliament.

He has been embroiled in the US impeachment process and faced tough talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but had so far managed to avoid any significant domestic political problems.

The audio recording was leaked on social media on Wednesday and reportedly came from an informal December meeting between ministers and senior officials from the National Bank.

According to local media reports, the participants discussed how to explain recent economic developments to Zelensky. “Zelensky has a very primitive understanding of economic processes, or rather a simple understanding,” Goncharuk reportedly said on the recording, adding that he himself was an economic “ignoramus”.

After initially denying reports he would step down, Goncharuk announced on his official Facebook page on Friday that he had offered to resign.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/ukraine-pm-offers-to-resign-after-leaked-recording.html
188,18-1-20,"Lights, camera, travel","Zareen Khan’s TV debut show, Jeep Bollywood Trails, is your chance at reliving Bollywood blockbusters through the locales they were shot at. By Chahak Mittal

Did you feel like going on a trekking trip to Manali after watching Yeh Jawaani Hai Diwani? Or going on a family vacation to Kolkata after watching Piku? Or perhaps taking a trip to Leh Ladakh and visit the famous Pangong Lake after watching 3 Idiots? Bollywood films have also been about their exotic shooting locations as much as they have been about their actors and dreamy plots. Remember the Swarovski Kristallwelten in Wattens, Austria, in Chal Mere Bhai where Salman Khan and Karishma Kapoor take a short detour? Also, Indian tourists flocking to Switzerland after watching the 1995 blockbuster DDLJ (Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge) is yet another example of how people have associated their aspirations with film locales. However, ever heard of the background stories of what went into the making of the film at such spots?

Actor Zareen Khan, who is set to make her small screen debut, will bring all such locations under one roof and meet the Bollywood directors of the films that have been shot there in AXN’s Jeep Bollywood Trails. Hosting the show, she will travel across the length and breadth of India in a Jeep revisiting the exact locations where films like 3 Idiots, Jab We Met, Dhadak and more were shot.

“I am so excited for the show to go on air since its my TV debut and I have been a passionate traveller. I am going to relive the iconic locations featured in blockbuster films. It would be a delight for the audience to see how film directors think of a certain location and make them part of their stories. It’s exciting for me to weave together these stories for the audience. What more could I have asked for?” she says and laughs.

Discussing more about the show has to offer, she tells us that the series begins with her driving to Ladakh to revisit the Chail Palace, the Druk School and Pangong Lake, where 3 Idiots was extensively shot. It features a discussion between her and director Rajkumar Hirani who talks about his early life and his love for mountains which inspired him to pick Ladakh as one of the locations for the film.

She adds, “From eating their favourite to going to their favourite spots in that city, the directors explore a lot more than just the film background in the show. And we are doing it all on wheels, while driving. I drive all over the country and when you are doing that, you get an even better experience of the location you’re in.”

The other locations and directors covered in the series are Manali for Jab We Met featuring Imtiaz Ali, Shimla for Bang Bang featuring Siddharth Anand, Varanasi for Raanjhanaa featuring Anand L Rai and Udaipur for Dhadak featuring Shashank Khaitan.

In a way, the show also aims at reviving the essence of a particular film through the location it was shot at. However, since old time classics have been a huge mirror to tourists making their way to such locations, shouldn’t they have been included too? These are all recent contemporary films. Zareen agrees. She says, “Of course, but this is what the makers of the show decided as of now. But I am also sure that once it clicks with the audience, they are going to look into the past. Maybe when we get into the second season of the show, then they might choose some classics. Currently, we are aiming at showcasing how these Bollywood directors have taken inspiration from the rich history, culture, people and natural landscapes to make all these destinations worth a visit. These films have in a way given a special identity to these places as well.”

Travelling with a crew comes with its own challenges. On one hand, where Ladakh is about adventure and thrill, Udaipur, on the other, is more about history, heritage and culture. So how challenging it was to get accustomed to different places, varying in temperatures as well as ethnicity? Zareen says, “I think challenges double up for people when they are not frequent travellers. And if somebody who hasn’t explored much was made a part of this show, s/he would have faced a lot of difficulty. But I have been an avid traveller and I am very well aware how different places have different joys to offer. And I just cherish that rather than looking it as a challenge.”

However, there was one time when it all seemed too difficult for Zareen. She shares an anecdote, “When you are travelling to different places, there are so many things happening on the go. I remember that in Ladakh, it was a very challenging drive. We hadn’t realised that while driving up the hill pass, we’ll have to be really prepared for it. None of us were, neither with clothes nor with the vehicles. Of course, Jeep was head on but other cars weren’t. The more they went up, the more they started slipping back since the roads were on a slope and there was snow. Even though you have known that it’s a difficult terrain, driving and experiencing it yourself makes you believe it. It was very difficult. We were freezing and almost exhausted while driving up the slopes for three hours. But then, finally, the moment we reached the Pangong Lake, we forgot all about it. It was worth all the hassle! And I think that’s the beauty of travelling.”

189,18-1-20,Klinsmann back to hurt Bayern,"Jurgen Klinsmann is planning a party if Hertha Berlin beat his former employers Bayern Munich on Sunday despite doubts about the validity of his coaching licence, as the Bundesliga resumes this weekend after a four-week break.

Since taking charge in November, the 55-year-old former Germany and US national team coach has pulled Hertha up from the relegation places to mid-table with 10 points from a possible 12 going into their clash with third-placed Bayern at Berlin’s Olympic Stadium.

However Klinsmann, who led both the US and Germany at World Cup finals, has been left red-faced after it emerged his coaching licence, held since 2000, may no longer be valid and the relevant paperwork is at the family home in California.

“It’s just been a bit of a chance for the media to let off a bit of steam,” Klinsmann told Sky as questions over his licence became a hot topic in the German media.

“No one has ever approached me about a licence in 20 years — whether as coach of Germany, the USA or Bayern. Now they have looked into it and it’s expired.” The matter remains unresolved but Klinsmann insists he has sent the necessary paperwork to the German FA and that there is” no problem at all”.

He has a point to prove against Bayern, who sacked him in 2009 after just nine months and 43 games in charge.

Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski has recovered from recent groin surgery and will look to pick up where he left off after scoring 19 goals in the first 17 games.

The defending champions trail leaders RB Leipzig by four points and are without wingers Kingsley Coman (knee) and Serge Gnabry, who injured his Achilles tendon during a training camp in Qatar.

Bayern suffered a shock 2-0 defeat when they last travelled to Hertha in September 2018 and Klinsmann said a repeat result would spark a party in the capital.

“We have nothing to lose,” he said. “Let’s take a point — brilliant! Let’s take three, then we’ll have a party.

“We’ll go in there with the confidence of four games without defeat.” One to watch: Erling Braut Haaland

Borussia Dortmund made the league's standout signing during the winter break when they paid Red Bull Salzburg 20 million euros ($22m) for the 19-year-old Norway striker.

Haaland attracted attention last September when, aged 19 years and 58 days, he became the third youngest player to score a Champions League hat-trick in a 6-2 victory over Genk, finishing with eight goals in six group games.

“I don’t think we’ve had that kind of striker since Robert Lewandowski,” Dortmund captain Marco Reus told Sky.

Head coach Lucien Favre has not said when Haaland will make his debut. Fourth-placed Dortmund hope a deluge of goals by their latest signing will help close the seven-point deficit to RB Leipzig, starting with a win at Augsburg on Saturday.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/klinsmann-back-to-hurt-bayern.html
190,18-1-20,‘No rustiness as Dhoni looks in complete control’,"Former India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni has stunned Jharkhand coach Rajiv Kumar with his fluent batting even as the stumper started training for the first time since Indias loss in the semifinal of the 2019 World Cup against New Zealand in July last year.

Speaking to IANS, Kumar said that he was expecting a little rustiness from the batsman, but the balls seemed to be hitting the middle of the bat. The coach went on to add that the Chennai Super Kings skipper’s preparations have begun for the 2020 edition of the Indian Premier League.

“I will be honest... I thought there will be a bit of rustiness as Dhoni has not trained for quite some time. The last time we had spoken, he had said that he would start in January and here you go. He is a man of his words and it came as no surprise that he was out there training with the guys just like any other regular Jharkhand player. But what surprised me most was how he middled almost every ball, be it in the pacer’s net or the spinner’s net. He even took throwdowns just like a player going through the batting drills does.

“I haven’t had any talks with him with regards to the national team and him donning the India jersey again. But, his preparations for the next edition of the IPL has begun and while the senior team will be busy playing the Ranji Trophy game from Sunday, Dhoni will continue training till the time he is in Ranchi,” the coach pointed.

Asked if Dhoni did anything specific in the two day that he has trained so far, Kumar said the former skipper spent a lot of time talking to the bowlers.

“He is such a professional and has been going on spending time with the youngsters, especially the bowlers. He is discussing the line and length that they should target and the ways to fox the opposition batsmen. He has been as vocal as can be expected from a senior player like Dhoni,” Kumar said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---no-rustiness-as-dhoni-looks-in-complete-control---.html

Prajnesh, ranked 122nd in the world and seeded 17th in the qualifiers, lost 6-7 (2) 2-6 to Gulbis in his final round qualifying match.

Prajnesh had earlier defeated local wildcard Harry Bourchier and Germany’s Yannick Hanfmann.

It was a close first set which went into tie-break, where Prajnesh faltered to hand early advantage to his opponent.

In the second set, Gulbis broke Prajnesh in the first and third games to race to a 3-0 lead.

From there on, the Indian found it tough as Gulbis held his serve to close out the contest that lasted for one hour and 20 minutes.

With Prajnesh’s ouster, India’s campaign in the singles ended in the qualifiers.

193,18-1-20,De Villiers flags desire to play ODI cricket,"Days after expressing his desire to play for South Africa in the T20 World Cup, former Proteas batsman AB de Villiers has now revealed his wish to represent the country in ODI cricket.

de Villiers reaffirmed his desire to return to 50-overs cricket while speaking to commentator Adam Gilchrist during Melbourne Heat’s loss to the Adelaide Strikers in the ongoing edition of the Big Bash League (BBL).

“I would love to play, that was never the problem,” de Villiers, who had hung up his Proteas shirt in May 2018, was quoted as saying by Fox Sports.

“I always wanted to play for South Africa, it’s a great honour to play international cricket,” he added.

The 35-year-old believes the appointment of Graeme Smith and Mark Boucher to key roles in Cricket South Africa will help him return to the two shorter formats for his country.

“I’ve been chatting with Mark Boucher, Smithy and some of the guys involved so hopefully it all works out,” he said.

“We’ve had a few good discussions about the possible way forward. I’m going to have to score some runs obviously.

“Watching some of the Test matches over December I was definitely thinking it would be really nice to be out there, but things have changed in my life ... I don’t want to play 11 months of the year any more, it’s too much.

“ODIs I wouldn't take completely out of the equation, but for Test matches it’s pretty much done,” said the 114-Tests veteran.

de Villiers had tried to come out of retirement ahead of the 2019 World Cup, making himself available for selection.

194,18-1-20,Harry replaces Young as captain,"Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has confirmed Harry Maguire as Manchester United’s new captain less than six months after his ?80 million ($104 million) move from Leicester.

Maguire will take over as skipper from Ashley Young, who is expected to complete his move to Inter Milan on Friday.

The England international, 26, has led the side in games when Young has been absent and was an obvious choice for the role having played in every Premier League match this season. “Harry has been wearing the captain's armband and he will keep wearing it,” said Solskjaer, whose side take on runaway leaders Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday. “He’s come in and been a leader in the group. I have not been surprised but I’ve been impressed by his leadership skills.”

“He is part of a group that we’ve had that have been leading this young group,” added Solskjaer.

“Ashley has been of course, Marcus (Rashford) is a young lad but he has been involved, David (de Gea) and Harry, so Harry will keep on wearing the armband now.”

Young, who moved to Old Trafford in 2011, will link up at the San Siro with former United teammates Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez.

“Ashley has been a good servant for the club, he’s been captain, he’s won trophies, the league, various cups,” said Solskjaer.

“But we’ve got players coming through and when Ashley's head and mindset was, 'I want to try this’, why not do it now?”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/harry-replaces-young-as-captain.html
195,18-1-20,Hafeez to retire after Twenty20 WC,"Recalled Pakistan allrounder Mohammad Hafeez Friday said he will retire from international cricket after the Twenty20 World Cup later this year, vowing to end his career on a positive note.

The 38-year-old was Thursday recalled to Pakistan’s Twenty20 series against Bangladesh starting in Lahore from January 24.

Hafeez has been one of Pakistan’s key players — in all three formats, as a top order batsman and a handy off-spinner— since making his debut during an England tour in 2003.

But his career was dogged by questions over the legality of his bowling action, reported on three occasions during international matches. He was also banned from bowling for 12 months in 2015.

Hafeez, dubbed the “professor” for his knowledge of the game, said he enjoyed playing for Pakistan.

“It has been a privilege,” he told media.

“I want to play the Twenty20 World Cup and then exit from Pakistan’s international team.”

Hafeez retired from Tests in December 2018 after playing 55 Tests. He was more successful in limited over formats, scoring 6,614 runs and took 139 wickets in 218 one-day internationals.

His last ODI was during the World Cup (50 overs) in England last year, and he has not been selected for that format since then.

His tally in 89 Twenty20 internationals stands at 54 wickets and 1,908 runs.

“I have played 17 years for Pakistan and tried my level best. At times I missed my bowling,” said Hafeez, who also captained Pakistan in 29 Twenty20 internationals, winning 17 and losing 11 with one ending in a tie.

The Twenty20 World Cup will be held in Australia in October-November this year.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/hafeez-to-retire-after-twenty20-wc.html
196,18-1-20,The strangers’ secrets,"Actor Chris Hemsworth says that through his role in Bad Times at the El Royale, he wanted to highlight toxic masculinity in the world. Hence, there was something sexist about the character addicted to power and control. By Team Viva

Set in the year 1969, Bad Times at the El Royale, revolves around the seven strangers and their seven secrets in search of their own identity or either running away from something. Each living in their own universe ends up to El Royale hotel near the California-Nevada border that carries a dark past. A series of events unfold at the hotel, the strangers become acquaintances by sharing their shady secrets. What happens next is robbery, surveillance, death, revenge, defiance, and survival.

Chris Hemsworth views on his experience of working in this neo-noir thriller:

How did you land up with this role?

I have known Drew Goddard from The Cabin in the Woods Days. We worked together years ago. One day when I contacted him, this film was in process. As I got to know about it, I immediately rang him and said, ‘why you haven’t offered this film to me?’ I then read the script and right away said yes, lets go and never looked back. This was an opportunity for me to work with him again.

How was your experience working in the Bad Times at the El Royale?

Before signing up for this film, I had a detailed look at the script. The idea of a neo-noir thriller film with such a storyline made me readily agree for a role. The whole shooting sequence went like bliss and was enjoyable due to the immense hard work put in by the entire team. The script is one of the best things I have ever read, the cast was incredible. I heard great things about the script and saw amazing work by the cast. Everybody was in an integral place in this puzzle. Even if one person did not drop the ball or did not show up, it seemed as if there was something missing on the sets. I am very happy that everyone just put in so much for their roles. It is one of the most collaborated and enjoyable film set I have ever been on.

Tell us about your character and its challenges.

I felt everything very different from what I have done before. Surprisingly, the role was easy may be due to such an amazing script. It signalled that you can’t go anywhere else but on this terrain you got to roll the dice and take that kind of risk. Yes, it was very satisfying. Billy Lee, my character is a coke leader who is manipulative, and charismatic, which is kind of essential for the script. There had to be a sense of humour but also true set of manipulation and sociopath kind of guy. He might look like he is giving answers and trying to help but it is actually just an opportunity for him to feel responsible. I just wanted to highlight this kind of toxic masculinity in the world. Hence, there was something sexist about the guy addicted to power and control.

What time is the film set in?

The film is set in a hotel, where seven strangers have seven secrets, all searching for something, maybe an answer or object, trying to find who they are and what is their place in the world. But at the same time, they all collide which pretty much ends as a chaotic situation at the El Royale. The film is a beautiful shot with amazing soundtrack.

197,18-1-20,‘Well with my soul’,"Singer Gloria Gaynor says that she always leaves the stage hoping that the audience has had as good a time as she did

American singer Gloria Gaynor sees the hand of god in every aspect of her life, particularly when it comes to the tune that may be the most famous disco song every created.

She recalls when she first was presented with I Will Survive, it was intended to be the B-side of another song, meaning it wasn’t the one that was promoted to be a hit. She clearly remembers calling it a stupid decision, and lobbied for I Will Survive to get top billing, which won over the songwriters of the now classic song. “I’ve always believed that god told them, ‘Look, sit down, write a song, hold onto it, I’m going to send you somebody,”’ she said. “Another divine appointment... it was meant to be the core of my purpose,” she added.

Gaynor won her first and only Grammy for I Will Survive in 1980. Now, 40 years later, she has a chance to add two more trophies to her collection, thanks to her first gospel album Testimony, which is nominated for best roots gospel album, and Talking About Jesus, which is up for best gospel performance. She’s giddy to get back in the Grammy mix.

“I’m waiting to see the fashions, of course, everybody all dressed and looking wonderful and feeling good and happy and all of that,” she said of the January 26 ceremony, “and hoping, of course, that I win at least one Grammy. It will be awesome if I could win them both.”

Gaynor shared recently about her nominations, persevering in the music industry despite health challenges and her divine connection to her most famous song.

What made you want to do a gospel album?

I just wanted to share the love and the knowledge of Christ through my music. I felt that that was what I was called to do.

This album comprises of new material, some which you co-wrote; even the song Amazing Grace is a new tune. What made you decide to go that route?

Well, I feel I’ve always been a bit innovative. I mean, if somebody writes a song that I want to sing and they’ve put something in it with bad grammar, I can’t sing it. I just have to fix it. I just do it. And I wasn’t trying to fix Amazing Grace except that I was trying to make it fit into my life. And the more it is about my story than the original, the better it is. That’s why we went that way with it.

What has it been like to not only have the Grammy nominations but also have this type of success?

Well, I did an album some time ago and felt that I kind of ran out ahead of god. And, when you do that, you find yourself out there by yourself. So it didn’t do well at all. And then when this album happened, it was successful and was quickly received by people. They were writing to me that they not only enjoyed the music, but that the songs were ministering to them ... this was my purpose to do through the music. So I felt like I was right this time. This is God’s timing and I’m on point.

What has I Will Survive meant to you over the years?

At first it was something that I was singing for other people. And then as time went on, different things happened to me and it became my mantra as well. And through the death of my mother, my siblings, through my divorce, I mean, when I did my divorce, I did a marathon version .... So the song has really meant a lot to me as well as to other people. I fully understand because I’ve experienced what the song can do for you.

This song has endured for so long, but have you ever been frustrated that this was your biggest song?

At first I thought that this is a double-edged sword. People think I’m not able to sing anything else except I Will Survive. They don’t want to hear anything else ... I’m not sick of the song, but I wish they would recognise that I could do something else, that I’ve recorded so many other great songs. And then when I came to the understanding that it was the core of my purpose, I kind of settled in and was okay with it. As the song says, It is well with my soul.

You’ve faced a lot physically, with several back surgeries. How are you doing today?

I’ve had five back surgeries and each one has stopped me for a minute. ... The last one threatened to stop me for good. ... With a lot of prayer and faith, we found a doctor in California who did this wonderful surgery, two surgeries on me, two totaling 18 hours and put 12 rods in my back. And now I’m pain free. ... I’m still performing. I do better on stage and in everyday life. That is why I give credit to god and the audience because the love that comes from them really sustains me during that period of time when I’m on stage. And it’s just a wonderful time for me. I always leave the stage hoping that the audience has had as good a time as I did.

Could you see yourself making more dance music?

Well, the only dance music I’m planning is music on which you can dance like David danced, dance unto the Lord.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---well-with-my-soul----2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/---well-with-my-soul---.html

New Zealand A started off with an 82-run opening stand between Jakob Bhula (50) and Jack Boyle (42) but Khaleel (4/43 in 9.1 overs) and Mohammed Siraj (2/33 in 8 overs) caused the bulk of the damage.

199,18-1-20,India hunt Kangaroos in Rajkot,"Kuldeep Yadav bowled a game-changing 38th over to complement a KL Rahul blinder as India levelled the series with a comfortable 36-run victory over Australia in second ODI here on Friday.

Put into bat, India put up a much-improved batting performance with Rahul's blistering 52-ball-80 taking India to 340 for six after Shikhar Dhawan (96 off 90 balls) and skipper Virat Kohli (78 off 76 balls) laid the foundation.

Australia were in the game till Steven Smith (98) carried the battle back to the enemy camp but Kuldeep's ninth over turned out to be a game-changer as he first dismissed wicketkeeper Alex Carey and then had a delivery that bounced extra to have Smith played on. The visitors were all-out for 304 in 49.1 overs.

Kuldeep's final figures of 2 for 65 may not be mind-blowing but did just enough damage to see that the third ODI in Bengaluru doesn't lose context.

Mohammed Shami (3/77 in 10 overs) and Navdeep Saini (2/62 in 10 overs) then bowled some exquisite toe-crushers to put an end to the contest. Jasprit Bumrah (1/32 in 9.1 overs) was economical as ever and his contribution cannot be overlooked.

However on a placid track, Smith, a proverbial thorn in India's flesh was again proving to be dangerous along with Marnus Labuschagne (44) as they added 96 in quick time.

Ravindra Jadeja (2/58 in 10 overs) steady spell and got rid of Labuschagne in nick of time to upset Smith's rhythm after he had hit nine fours and a six off 102 balls.

However this match also brings to fore Rahul's emergence as proper keeper-batsman option for white-ball cricket as his extra runs coming in at No 5, proving to be valuable in the end.

Not to forget his reasonably decent keeping effecting a stumping and also took two catches. More importantly, his keeping down the leg-side was far better than Rishabh Pant, who is currently recovering from concussion.

Earlier, it was Dhawan, who missed a well-deserved ton by a whisker but laid a solid platform for the aggressive duo of skipper Kohli and Rahul to ensure a commanding total.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-hunt-kangaroos-in-rajkot.html
200,18-1-20,"Stokes, Pope punish SA","Ben Stokes and Ollie Pope made centuries to hammer a South Africa team already hit by a ban for its top bowler as England took control on a potentially decisive day of the test series on Friday.

Stokes made 120, Pope 135 not out for his maiden test century, and England surged to 499-9 declared on the second day of the third test in Port Elizabeth.

South Africa couldn't safely see out 18 overs at the end and lost Pieter Malan (18) and Zubayr Hamaza (10) to be 60-2 in reply. Spinner Dom Bess took both wickets.

England was on top throughout a one-sided day and South Africa was relieved when rain finally allowed it to get off the field in the early evening. Bess constantly troubled the batsmen and fast bowler Mark Wood was clocking speeds of 90 mph (145 kph) at the other end.

With star allrounder Stokes leading the charge once again, England built a commanding position in the match and had possibly carved out a key moment in the series, which is level at 1-1 but leaning heavily in the tourists' favor with one more test to come.

Stokes and Pope took their careful 76-run partnership overnight to an unbroken and flourishing stand of 187 by lunch. They put on a mammoth 203 for the fifth wicket by the time Stokes hit a square drive to be caught by Dean Elgar after lunch and give Dane Paterson a first test wicket on his debut for South Africa.

On a day when the start of play was delayed by nearly an hour, also because of rain, the overall outlook for South Africa was particularly gloomy.

Stokes, voted the world player of the year this week, played cautiously at the end of the first day to consolidate England's promising position but broke free on the second morning and was in complete attack mode.

He lashed 12 fours and two sixes in all as he charged to a ninth test century. Three of those hundreds have come in the last five months and Stokes continued to punish South Africa on this tour.

He blitzed 72 off 47 balls, took a record-equaling five catches in an innings, and collected the match-winning wickets in England's series-tying victory in the second test in Cape Town.

Stokes also had strong support from Pope in Port Elizabeth, and Pope went on to a big century after Stokes' exit.

Sam Curran added 44 down the order in a half-century stand with Pope, and tailender Wood (42) and Pope added 73 for the ninth wicket as South Africa fell apart.

They launched a barrage of boundaries, with No. 10 Wood hitting five sixes. Pope finished with 18 fours and a six.

England's 499-9 declared was the fourth highest total ever in a test at St. George's and the second best by a visiting team. Only Australia in 1950 has made a bigger statement at the ground by a touring team.

England, 224-4 overnight, added 111 runs in first session, another 91 after lunch, and was rampant by scoring those 73 runs for the last wicket in just over eight overs before the declaration.

Rabada, who was South Africa's best bowler on the first day, took no wickets on the second and looked as if his morale was shot. Left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj had to lead the struggling and dispirited home attack with 5-180.

On a miserable day for him, Rabada had Wood out caught just before the end of England's innings but was pulled up for a no-ball.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/stokes--pope-punish-sa.html
201,18-1-20,KS Bharat named cover for Pant,"Andhra Pradesh wicketkeeper-batsman K S Bharat was on Friday called in as back-up for Rishabh Pant, who was ruled out of India’s second ODI against Australia due to a concussion.

The 26-year-old Bharat is uncapped and has an experience of 74 first-class matches with 4143 runs. He has a strike rate of over 100 in T20s.

“The All-India Senior Selection Committee has named K S Bharat as the back-up wicket-keeper for the 2nd ODI in Rajkot against Australia” BCCI Secretary Jay Shah said in a statement.

“With Sanju Samson and Ishan Kishan being a part of the India A side in New Zealand, the selection committee decided to name K S Bharat as back-up wicket-keeper,” he added.

The call was taken after Pant flew to Bengaluru to undergo his rehabilitation in the National Cricket Academy.

The wicket-keeper batsman was hit on the helmet while batting in the first ODI in Mumbai and was ruled out of the game in Rajkot on Friday.

“His recovery is being monitored and a call on his availability for the final ODI in Bengaluru will be taken accordingly,” the BCCI said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ks-bharat-named-cover-for-pant.html
202,18-1-20,Rabada banned for final test over Root celeb,"South Africa fast bowler Kagiso Rabada has been banned from the series-deciding final cricket Test against England.

Rabada was given a one-Test ban after breaching the International Cricket Council code of conduct for his celebration after getting England captain Joe Root out on the first day of the ongoing third test in Port Elizabeth.

Rabada ran through and celebrated - fists pumping and screaming - close to Root after bowling him.

He was found guilty of ""using language, actions or gestures"" which could provoke an aggressive response from the batsman. The 24-year-old Rabada was given one demerit point for the offense but it's his fourth demerit in the last two years, which results in a one-match ban.

Rabada was charged with the offense in Port Elizabeth by match referee Andy Pycroft. He pleaded guilty and accepted the punishment.

It’s a major boost for England's hopes of winning the four-test series and a major blow for South Africa’s.

203,18-1-20,Title most imp goal for Salah,"Mohamed Salah says Liverpool’s focus is solely on ending a 30-year wait to win the Premier League title, rather than doing so by going the whole season unbeaten.

Klopp’s men have dropped just two points in 21 games to set a new record for Europe’s top five leagues of 61 points from a possible 63 to start the campaign.

That has propelled the European champions into a 14-point lead over title holders Manchester City with a game in hand, but Salah insists the Reds are still taking their title challenge one game at a time ahead of Manchester United’s visit to Anfield on Sunday.

“We don’t think about being unbeaten until the end of the season. If we do that, it would be great, but at the end of the day we just want to win the Premier League. That's the most important thing,” Salah told Premier League Productions.

“Unbeaten or not, it’s not necessary - we want to win the Premier League.”

Liverpool could move a massive 30 points clear of United with victory on Sunday, but the Red Devils are the only side to take points off them this season after a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford in October.

Salah missed that match through injury and is keen to make up for lost time in the clash between English football's two most successful sides.

“We need to win, we need to carry on in our way - the way we’ve been doing since the beginning of the season and since last year,” added the Egyptian.

“Of course we know it’s big for the fans, for the city and for us. But at the end of the day, we play the game to win.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/title-most-imp-goal-for-salah.html

The unseeded Indo-Ukrainian pair pipped the second seed Chinese team 6-4 6-4 in one hour 21 minutes.

Playing her first tournament after giving birth to son Izhaan, the 33-year-old Sania has begun well in the Olympic year as she warmed up for the Australian Open in style.

It is Sania's 42nd WTA doubles title and first since Brisbane International trophy in 2007 with American partner Bethanie Mattek-Sands.

Sania did not compete on the WTA circuit in the entire 2018 and 2019 seasons to start a family with Pakistani cricketer husband Shoaib Malik.

Sania and Nadiia began by breaking the Chinese players in the very first game of the match but only to drop serve in the next.

The two pairs played close games towards the end and at 4-4, 40-all, Sania and Nadiia got the crucial break, earning the opportunity to serve out the set.

There was no twist in 10th game with Sania and Nadiia comfortably pocketing the first set.

The second set could not have started better for them as they broke the Chinese rivals to take early lead and consolidated the break with an easy hold.

The game of the Chinese was falling apart as they dropped serve again in the third but broke back immediately to repair some damage.

Sania and Nadiia were now feeling the heat at 0-30 in the sixth game but Peng and Zhang let them hold serve for a 4-2 lead. The Chinese though kept fighting and made it 4-4 with another break in the eighth game.

The Indo-Ukraine team raised its game when it mattered as it broke Peng and Zhang for one final time in the ninth and served out the match in the next game.

207,18-1-20,Indira Jaising urges Nirbhaya's mother to follow Sonia Gandhi's example,"Senior advocate Indira Jaising has urged Nirbhaya's mother to ""follow the example"" of Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, suggesting that she pardons the four men sentenced to death for raping her daughter in 2012.

The four convicts are scheduled to be hanged at 6 am on February 1 in the gangrape and murder case.

Jaising, in a tweet on Friday, said while she fully identifies with the pain of Nirbhaya's mother, she urges her ""to follow the example of Sonia Gandhi who forgave Nalini and said she didn't not (did not) want the death penalty for her"".

""We are with you but against death penalty,"" she said.

Nalini Sriharan was sentenced to death in former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi's assassination case. Her death penalty was commuted to life term after the intervention of his wife Sonia Gandhi, who urged for clemency on account of the fact that Nalini had a young daughter who was born in jail.

On Friday, a Delhi court issued fresh death warrants for February 1 against the four convicts -- Vinay Sharma (26), Mukesh Kumar (32), Akshay Kumar Singh (31) and Pawan (25) -- in the Nirbhaya case.

Earlier in the day, President Ram Nath Kovind had rejected the mercy petition of Mukesh.

The other three condemned convicts have not yet availed of the constitutional remedy of filing mercy petitions.

The Supreme Court had on January 14 dismissed the curative petitions of Vinay and Mukesh against their conviction and capital punishment. The other two convicts have not yet filed curative petitions in the apex court.

Nirbhaya, a 23-year-old paramedic student, was gangraped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012, in a moving bus in south Delhi by six persons, including the four death row convicts, before she was thrown out on the road.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/indira-jaising-urges-nirbhaya-s-mother-to-follow-sonia-gandhi-s-example-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/indira-jaising-urges-nirbhaya-s-mother-to-follow-sonia-gandhi-s-example.html

Giving examples of nightlife in London and Indore city of Madhya Pradesh, Thackeray said Mumbai, too, should not lag behind in providing similar facilities to people at night as the metropolis functions 24x7.

Talking to reporters here, he also said that associating nightlife with alcohol consumption alone was wrong.

""Mumbai functions 24x7. If online shopping is open 24 hours, then why should shops and establishments be kept shut at night. It is not compulsory for the shops and malls to be open at night. It is up to them if they wish to remain open. No norms have been changed,"" he said.

The 29-year-old Yuva Sena chief, who has been batting for all-night-open eateries and other establishments in the city since 2013, said the government would not tinker with the Excise norms.

""We are not tinkering with the Excise norms,"" he said.

Thackeray said London's night time economy is worth five billion pounds.

209,18-1-20,Nirbhaya case: SC to hear on Jan 20 convict's plea against HC order rejecting his juvenility claim,"The Supreme Court will hear on January 20 a plea of a death row convict in the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case against a Delhi High Court order dismissing his claim of being a juvenile at the time of commission of the offence.

A bench of Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bushan and A S Bopanna will hear the plea of Pawan Kumar Gupta.

Gupta moved the apex court on Friday challenging the high court's order dismissing his claim of being a juvenile in December 2012.

Besides, the convict has sought a direction restraining the authorities from executing the death penalty, which has been scheduled for February 1.

He has challenged the high court's December 19 order by which it also deprecated the conduct of his advocate for filing forged documents and not appearing in the court.

A Delhi court on Friday issued fresh death warrants for February 1 against the four convicts -- Vinay Sharma (26), Mukesh Kumar (32), Akshay Kumar Singh (31) and Pawan (25) -- in the case.

Earlier in the day, President Ram Nath Kovind rejected the mercy petition of Mukesh. The other three condemned convicts have not yet availed of the constitutional remedy of filing the mercy petitions.

The apex court had on January 14 dismissed the curative petitions of Vinay and Mukesh against their conviction and capital punishment.

The two other convicts -- Akshay and Pawan -- have not yet filed curative petitions in the top court.

In his appeal filed through advocate A P Singh, Pawan has claimed that he was a juvenile at the time of the commission of offence on December 16, 2012.

While dismissing his plea, the high court had noted that Pawan had earlier raised the juvenility claim in his review petition against the death penalty awarded to him in the case before the apex court which had dismissed his plea on July 9 last year.

In his plea before the high court, he had claimed that as per his school certificate his date of birth was October 8, 1996.

Pawan had earlier moved a trial court with a plea claiming to be juvenile at the time of the offence and it was dismissed on December 21 last year.

A 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was gangraped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012 in a moving bus in south Delhi by six persons before she was thrown out on the road.

She died on December 29, 2012 at a hospital in Singapore.

One of the six accused in the case, Ram Singh, allegedly committed suicide in the Tihar Jail here.

A juvenile, who was among the accused, was convicted by a juvenile justice board and was released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term.

Vinesh won by technical superiority against Khrystyna Bereza (10-0) and Lannuan Luo (15-5) before getting the better of Qianyu Pang (4-2).

If the win against Ukrainian Bereza was about spectacular double leg attacks, the quarterfinal win over the Luo was much tougher than the what the score-line suggested.

Luo was a strong opponent, who led 5-2 at the end of first period but Vinesh turned it around with smart point-scoring moves from nowhere in the second period.

Twice she threw Luo with moves from between the legs when the Chinese was holding her from the back.

With two wrestlers, having immense upper-body strength, jostling for upper hand from standing position was a sight to watch.

Fighting a measured bout against Pang, Vinesh was in control in the semi-final, With two take downs in each period she led 4-0 and conceded points only towards the end of the fight.

Vinesh will now fight for her first gold of the season with Ecuador’s Luisa Elizabeth Valverde Melemdres.

The 18-year-old Anshu carried her sparkling form from the trials at her maiden international tournament at the senior level but could not replicate it in the gold medal bout, losing to Nigeria’s Odunayo Adekuoroye.

The 18-year-old was very dominant till the final, beating American Jenna Rose Burkert, Grace Bullen of Norway, 2019 world champion from Canada Linda Morais en route the final.

Also in medal contention is Nirmala Devi, who will fight for 50kg Bronze after losing her semi-final to Sarah Ann Hildebrandt.

Nirmala was aggressive throughout, going for leg attacks, but the American stayed solid in her defence, reminding the tactics that Vinesh had employed against her at the 2019 World Championship in Nur Sultan.

Nirmala has another American in her way as she will lock horns with Victoria Lacey Anthony.

Sania and Kichenok sailed past the Slovenian-Czech pair of Tamara Zidansek and Marie Bouzkova 7-6 (3) 6-2 in the semifinal contest that lasted one hour and 24 minutes.

The fifth-seeded Indo-Ukrainian combination will lock horns with second seeds Shuai Peng and Shuai Zhang of China. The Chinese pair got a walkover after Belgium’s Kirsten Flipkens and Alison Van Uytvanck conceded the other semifinal match because of injury.

While Sania and Kichenok had to fight hard in the opening set, the second set was a cakewalk for the combination.

The first set was a tough contest between the two pairs, bringing the tie-breaker into the equation after it was level at 6-6.

In the tie-breaker, Sania and Kichenok upped their game by a few notches to outsmart their opponents and take the lead.

The second set was a no contest as Saina and Kichenok broke their opponents thrice -- in the second, sixth and eighth game — to easily pocket the set and a place in the summit clash.

Saina and Kichenok got 11 break chances out of which they converted four, while their opponents utilised two out of the five break chances that came their way.

The 33-year-old Sania is returning to WTA circuit after two years. During her time away from the game, she battled injury breakdowns before taking a formal break in April 2018 to give birth to her son Izhaan. She is married to Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik.

213,18-1-20,India launch Olympic bid with pro opener,"Manpreet led side host the Netherlands in FIH pro league game today

The Olympics-bound Indian men’s hockey team will kick-start its preparations for the quadrennial showpiece when it debuts in the FIH Pro League against world No.3 the Netherlands here on Saturday.

After having missed the first edition of the event, India will take on the 2019 Pro League and European Bronze medal winners, the Netherlands, in two matches in their opening tie at the Kalinga Stadium here. The second match will be played on Sunday.

With all the top teams of the world in fray, the home-and-away Pro League will be ideal preparation for world No 5 India ahead of the Summer Games later this year.

After the Dutch side, India will host world champions Belgium on February 8 and 9 followed by two more home fixtures against Australia on February 22 and 23.

The Indian team will then leave for the away games in Germany (April 25 and 26) and Great Britain (May 2 and 3).

India will return to play on home soil on May 23 and 24 against New Zealand before travelling to Argentina to play on June 5 and 6.

The Manpreet Singh-led side will play the last leg of the Pro League round-robin matches in Spain on June 13 and 14.

India’s head coach Graham Reid will be aware of the challenges that await his team in the Pro League opener.

Having served as a former assistant coach to the Dutch, Reid knows exactly what to expect from Netherlands in the double header.

The matches will also provide India a chance to avenge their heart-breaking 1-2 loss in the quarterfinal of the 2018 World Cup.

A look at the previous 10 meetings between the two teams reveals that there is little to choose between them.

The Netherlands have won five of those meetings, with India victorious on four occasions and one match ending in a draw.

Reid too insisted that they are looking at the Pro League outings as a platform for Olympic preparation.

“It will be important to start strong and sharp in the Pro League with our first three encounters against the top three teams in the world,” Reid has said.

“We will be focussing on getting our structures right and honing our set plays as preparation for our Olympic campaign.”

The Indians would also benefitted by their familiarity with the Kalinga Stadium turf, having trained and played numerous matches here.

It is the same venue where the eight-time Olympic champions qualified for the 2020 Games after thrashing Russia 11-3 on aggregate in the two-leg FIH Qualifiers in November last year.

“The matches against India are a very important opener. Playing against India at their home ground is challenging no doubt but it is also very exciting because we love playing in Bhubaneswar,” Max Caldas said.

“The players and combinations we wanted to test were experimented during the previous edition of Pro League. This edition we will have our most competitive team as this will be the stepping-stone for us to be the best at Tokyo,” he said.

India will field a full-strength team which will witness the return of midfielders Chinglensana Singh and Sumit, who were out with injuries.

Chinglensana was on the sidelines with an ankle fracture since the National Championship last year, while Sumit suffered a wrist injury in June during the FIH Men’s Series Final.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-launch-olympic-bid-with-pro-opener-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-launch-olympic-bid-with-pro-opener.html

215,18-1-20,"Rahul likely to comeback for Tests, Hardik may come back for ODIs, if fit","KL Rahul's stupendous white ball form makes him a firm favourite to get his place back in the red ball team even as selectors fret on all-rounder Hardik Pandya's fitness before picking ODI and Test squads for the New Zealand tour here on Sunday.

Rahul has been India's most consistent player in T20 and ODIs but he lost his place in the Test squad after tour of Australia.

But as skipper Virat Kohli said that it's difficult to leave a player like Rahul from any squad, he has better chance than fit-again Prithvi Shaw or Subman Gill who was reserve Test opener during home series last season.

The other change in Test squad could be fast-rising Navdeep Saini going as an extra pacer rather than Kuldeep Yadav as the third spinner since only one among Ravichandran Ashwin or Ravindra Jadeja will make the playing XI.

Similarly, Indian team management is eagerly waiting for Hardik to become ""bowling fit"" for white ball matches post back surgery and will be automatic choice for ODIs if fit.

He had failed the mandatory ""bowling workload test"" after which his personal trainer S Rajnikanth advised him to pull out of India A's shadow tour.

In case, Hardik can't make it, selectors might either look at hitting prowess of Suryakumar Yadav since the ODIs in the Kiwiland will be an extension of T20s in World Cup year.

There is also a possibility that Ajinkya Rahane will be considered due to his better technique compared to Kedar Jadhav who is slowly falling off in pecking order.

""Kedar is certainly not going to play 2023 World Cup and doesn't even bowl now. Since he is not in T20, no point in carrying him to New Zealand. Possibly Surya or Rahane should be tried,"" a BCCI source privy to selection matters told PTI.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rahul-likely-to-comeback-for-tests--hardik-may-come-back-for-odis--if-fit-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/rahul-likely-to-comeback-for-tests--hardik-may-come-back-for-odis--if-fit.html

The Indian left-hander had lost the final qualifying round to Latvia's Ernests Gulbis in straight sets but was fortunate to make the main draw as one of the direct entrants withdrew from the tournament.

It will be Prajnesh's fifth straight appearance in the main draw of a Grand Slam.

Last year also, the Chennai player had come through the qualifiers in Melbourne but made the cut at Wimbledon, French Open and the US Open owing to better ranking.

A good draw has put Prajnesh against Japanese Tatsuma Ito, ranked 22 places below the Indian at 144. This will be the first meeting of the duo.

The 30-year-old Indian now not only has the opportunity to win his maiden Grand Slam main draw match but also to set up a showdown with Serbian great Djokovic.

Prajnesh said he is not looking beyond the first round.

""I am very happy I got the Lucky Loser spot and I am only thinking about my first round now. I will try to make the most of it. Ito is a very good player. He was in top-100 and is experienced. I will need to play well to beat him,"" Prajnesh told PTI.

At the 2019 US Open, Sumit Nagal ran into legendary Roger Federer and caused a few ripples by a taking a set off the Swiss.

The hard-working Prajnesh lost his top-100 rank towards the end of 2019 season as he suffered a few reversals, probably because of falling health of his father, who passed after losing a battle with cancer.

217,18-1-20,Kerala did a disastrous thing by electing Rahul Gandhi: Historian Ramachandra Guha,"A ""fifth-generation dynast"" Rahul Gandhi has no chance in Indian politics against a ""hard-working and self-made"" Narendra Modi, and Kerala did a disastrous thing by electing the the Congress leader to Parliament, historian Ramachandra Guha said here on Friday.

Guha said the reduction of the Congress from a ""great party"" during the freedom movement to a ""pathetic family firm"" now is one of the reasons for the ascendency of Hindutva and jingoism in India.

""I have nothing against Rahul Gandhi personally. He is a decent fellow, very well-mannered. But young India does not want a fifth-generation dynast. If you Malyalis make the mistake of re-electing Rahul Gandhi in 2024 too, you are merely handing over an advantage to Narendra Modi,"" said Guha on the second day of the ongoing Kerala Literature Festival (KLF) during his talk, ""Patriotism Vs Jingoism"".

Addressing the crowd, full of Keralites, he said, ""Kerala, you have done many wonderful things for India, but one of the disastrous thing you did was to elect Rahul Gandhi to Parliament.""

Gandhi, who in 2019 general elections lost from his family bastion of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh, had won from the Wayanad seat in Kerala.

""Narendra Modi's great advantage is that he is not Rahul Gandhi. He is self-made. He has run a state for 15 years, he has an administrative experience, he is incredibly hard working and he never takes holidays in Europe. Believe me I am saying all this in all seriousness,"" he said.

But, even if Rahul Gandhi was ""much more intelligent, more hard-working, never took a holiday in Europe, as a fifth generation dynast he still will be at a disadvantage against a self-made person"", the 61-year-old author said.

He took on Congress president Sonia Gandhi too who, he said, reminded him of the ""late Mughal dynasty"" and how aloof they were of the state of their kingdom.

""India is becoming more democratic and less feudal, and the Gandhis just don't realise this. You (Sonia) are in Delhi, your kingdom is shrinking more and more but still your chamchas (sycophants) are telling you that you are still the badshah,"" he said.

Further, he quoted his teacher and noted Indian sociologist Andre Beteille to describe the story of Nehru-Gandhi family as a classic ""reversal of the famous Biblical injunction"": the sins of the father will be visited upon seven successive generations.

""In the Nehru's case, it is the sins of the seven successive generations have been re-visited upon Nehru... Look at the national debate today. Why is Nehru evoked everytime? Why does Modi always say Nehru ne Kashmir mein yeh kiya, China mein yeh kiya, Triple Talaq mein yeh kiye ... Because Rahul Gandhi is there.

""Now if Rahul Gandhi disappears, Modi has to talk about his own policies and why they failed,"" he said.

According to Guha, ""Hypocrisy of the Indian Left -- the fact that they loved other nations more than India"", ""rise of aggressive nationalism worldwide"" and ""the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in neighbouring countries"" are some other reasons behind the evident leap of Hindutva in India in the recent times.

Historian William Dalrymple, novelists like Benyamin, Namita Gokhale, Chetan Bhagat and journalists Karan Thapar and Rajdeep Sardesai are among the many other writers who will be attending the four-day festival.

Voice and SMS facilities were restored for all local prepaid mobile phones across the Union territory.

Rohit Kansal, the principal secretary to the administration of Jammu and Kashmir said the order will come into effect from Saturday.

In order to consider giving mobile Internet connectivity on such SIM cards, the telecom service providers will have to verify the credentials of the subscribers, he said.

Internet service providers have been asked to provide fixed line Internet connectivity in all the 10 districts of Jammu region and two districts, Kupwara and Bandipora, in North Kashmir.

Telecom services were shut in the entire Jammu and Kashmir on August 5 when the Centre abrogated special status to the erstwhile state and also bifurcated it into two Union Territories.

219,18-1-20,Opp-ruled States object to NPR format,"States’ concerns unwarranted, one can skip some of questions: Centre

The Centre on Friday clarified to the States opposing the National Population Register (NPR) exercise that their concerns about the nature of questions in the NPR format was unwarranted, saying it was not mandatory to answer some newly-introduced questions. No official from the West Bengal Government attended the meeting, an official said.

Congress-ruled Rajasthan and some other Opposition-ruled States raised these concerns at a day-long conference convened by the Union Home Ministry to discuss the modalities to be adopted during the House listing phase of the Census 2021 and the NPR to be carried out from April 1 to September 30.

Rajasthan Chief Secretary DB Gupta said he and the representatives of a few other States raised objections to a few questions to be asked by enumerators to people during the NPR exercise. “We said certain questions in NPR are impractical, like questions related to the birthplace of parents. There are many people in the country who even don’t know what was their birthplace. I don’t know what is the purpose of such questions and we demanded in the meeting to remove such questions,” Gupta told reporters after the meeting.

He said the Central Government officials told them that answers to all such questions are not mandatory but voluntary and no one is going to force anyone to reply any question. “They said such questions were asked earlier also and this time they have just linked with an individual’s place of birth with his or her parent’s place of birth. But they said answer to this question is not mandatory,” he said.

During the meeting, presentations were given on the objectives of the census and the NPR exercises and their benefits. Also, presentation was given on the use of mobile app, which will be used in the census for the first time in its history. The conference was inaugurated by Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai and attended by Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla, chief secretaries and census directors of many States.

In his inaugural address, Rai put the emphasis on the need for conducting Census 2021 and the role of the States in doing the same. He said the data collected in the census will help the country in framing policies for the welfare of the people.

The Union Home Secretary remarked on the vastness of this exercise and involvement of the State functionaries. He said the objective of NPR is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country. The database would contain demographic as well as biometric particulars.

The NPR is a register of usual residents of the country. It is being prepared at the local (village/sub-town), subdistrict, district, State and national levels under provisions of the Citizenship Act, 1955 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. The rules have a provision for fine of up to Rs 1,000 on those violating it.

The data for NPR was last collected in 2010 along with the house listing phase of the Census 2011. Updating of this data was done during 2015 by conducting door to door survey. While updating the register in 2015, the Government has asked details like Aadhaar and their mobile number.

This time, the information related to their driving licence and voter ID card may also be gathered, the officials said, adding that PAN card details will not be collected as part of this exercise. For the purposes of the NPR, a usual resident is defined as a person who has resided in a local area for the past six months or more, or a person who intends to reside in that area for the next six months. Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India Vivek Joshi made a brief presentation on the Strategy for Census 2021.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/opp-ruled-states-object-to-npr-format-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/opp-ruled-states-object-to-npr-format.html
220,18-1-20,"After Kerala, Punjab adopts resolution, to challenge CAA in SC","Minutes after the Punjab Vidhan Sabha passed a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, on Friday, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh declared that the border State will join Kerala in challenging the newly-amended law in the Supreme Court.

Describing the legislation as “inherently discriminatory” and a negation of the very secular fabric on which the Constitution of India is based, the Punjab Assembly adopted, by voice vote, a hard-hitting resolution seeking immediate repeal of the CAA, which the Chief Minister compared with the ethnic and religious cleansing of Hitler’s Germany.

Clearly, no lessons had been learnt from history, said a visibly anguished Chief Minister during the discussion on the resolution, which also urged the Centre to put on hold the work on the National Population Register (NPR) till forms or documents associated with it are amended suitably, in order to allay apprehensions that it is a prelude to the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and designed to deprive a section of persons from citizenship of India.

“Like Kerala, the (Punjab) Government will approach the Supreme Court on the issue,” said Amarinder while talking with the media after the conclusion of the two-day special Assembly session.

He said that the Centre would have to make the necessary amendments to CAA if it had to be implemented in Punjab and other States opposing the legislation.

“We have sent a draft to the Centre to make changes in the CAA to make it acceptable to everyone,” the CM said.

“Census is being carried out now…It will be done like earlier. Every citizen will be counted whether he is Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Christian or anybody,” said the Chief Minister.

Capt Amarinder, in response to a question, made it clear that the Census in Punjab would be conducted on the old parameters and the new factors added by the Centre for the purpose of the NPR would not be included.

Only a day before The Pioneer had reported, in these columns, that the Congress-led Punjab Government is considering to move the Supreme Court, on the lines of the Kerela Government, to challenge the validity of the controversial Act.

Notably, the Chief Minister has already issued directions to the office of the Advocate-General to see how the State can challenge the Act in the apex court. Available information suggests that the State is considering to move the Supreme Court against the CAA and NRC on the similar grounds as Kerala under Article 131 of the Constitution.

Notably, the Kerala Government has, on January 14, moved the Supreme Court challenging the contentious CAA under Article 131 of the Constitution which empowers the Apex Court to hear disputes between the Government of India and one or more States.

The petition stated that the CAA violates Right to Equality under Article 14 of the Constitution of India, Right to Life under Article 21 and Freedom to Practice Religion under Article 25. It argued that CAA is discriminatory because it covers only a class of minorities from a class of countries sharing borders with India and to which and from there have been trans-border migration.

The CAA, which has evoked countrywide protests, seeks to provide citizenship to illegal migrants from Buddhist, Hindu, Sikhs, Jain, Parsi and Christian faiths, who have come to India from the neighbouring countries of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, on or before December 31, 2014.

The resolution, which termed CAA as divisive and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, was introduced in the House by Cabinet Minister Brahm Mohindra, and witnessed extensive three-hour long discussion before being put to vote by Speaker Rana KP Singh.

Terming the divisive Act as a tragedy that he was unfortunate to witness in his lifetime, the Chief Minister lamented that “what happened in Germany under Hitler in 1930 is happening in India now.”

“Germans did not speak then, and they regretted it, but we have to speak now, so that we don’t regret later,” he asserted, urging the Opposition, particularly the Akalis, to read Adolf Hitler’s ‘Mein Kampf’ to understand the dangers of CAA. He said he would get the book translated in Punjabi and distributed so that all could read and grasp the historical mistakes that Hitler made.

“What is happening in India is not good for the country,” said Capt Amarinder, adding that people could see and understand, and were protesting spontaneously, without any instigation.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/after-kerala--punjab-adopts-resolution--to-challenge-caa-in-sc.html
221,18-1-20,India to get S-400 by 2025 as Russia begins production,"India will get all the five units of S-400 long-range surface-to-air missile systems from Russia by 2025 and its production has started, Russian envoy Roman Babushkin said here on Friday.

The deal inked in 2018 is worth over Rs 40,000 crore and the weapon systems will significantly boost India’s capabilities to defend its airspace.

His assertion comes against the backdrop of the US warning time and again India of sanctions if it goes ahead with the deal. Incidentally, India last year paid the first tranche of 800 million dollars to Russia for the weapon systems. China has already inducted more than six units of S-400 system called ‘Triumf.’

Meanwhile, Babushkin, who is Deputy Chief of Mission here, also said a contract will shortly be finalised for joint production of Kamov light weight multi-role military helicopters for India.

At a joint Press conference with Russian Ambassador Nikolai Kudashev, he also said India will receive the first batch of 5,000 Kalashnikov rifles this year which will be produced in India under a joint venture. The Ordnance Factory located in Amethi, Uttar Pradesh (UP), will manufacture these AK-203 rifles for the Armed forces, Central paramilitary and State police organisations.

The total deal is worth over Rs 7,000 crore and a Major General of the Indian Army is heading the factory.

Babushkin said Russia and India have “successfully found solutions” to the payment issues and the focus this year will be to implement mega deals in the defence sector.

As regards the S-400 deal, he said, “The supply of five S-400 air defence systems will be completed by 2025. Their production has already started.” India had inked a deal with Russia in 2018 notwithstanding warning fro m the US about sanctions.

Asserting that the S-400 air defence missile systems are among best in the world, he said they will significantly bolster India’s air defence mechanism.

The ‘Triumf’ interceptor-based missile system can destroy incoming hostile aircraft, missiles and even drones at ranges of up to 400 km. S-400 is known as Russia’s most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile defence system.

The US had imposed sanctions on Russia under the stringent Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). The law also provides for punitive action against countries purchasing defence hardware from Russia.

On the long-pending joint-venture for production of Kamov military helicopters, he said a deal on it will be inked shortly. In October 2016, India and Russia finalised a broad agreement for the joint venture between Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) and two Russian defence majors for production of Kamov helicopters.

India is procuring 200 Kamov Ka-226T helicopters to replace its ageing Cheetah and Chetak helicopters light utility helicopters. While 60 helicopters will be bought off the shelf from Russia, the remaining helicopters will be manufactured by the HAL.

Russia is a time-tested and long-standing strategic partner of India and Babushkin said “this year, we will put special focus on implementation of decisions taken at Vladivistok.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin last September held annual summit talks there during which they decided to further ramp up defence and strategic cooperation besides resolving to expedite pending projects.

The senior diplomat said India and Russia were also looking forward to an early implementation of the intergovernmental agreement for joint production of military hardware.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-to-get-s-400--by-2025-as-russia--begins-production-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/india-to-get-s-400--by-2025-as-russia--begins-production.html

According to the pact, the NDFB under the leadership of its “president” B Saoraigwra will abjure violence and join in peace talks with the Government.

Active members of the NDFB, including Saoraigwra, were brought back from Myanmar on January 11.

Top leaders, including Saoraigwra, its “general secretary”, “commander-in-chief” and “finance secretary” were part of the group, an official said. The group carried 25 weapons, more than 50 magazines, more than 900 assorted ammunition and communication equipment with them. Four family members also accompanied the group.

Saoraigwra’s group was active in Myanmar and is only active Bodo insurgent group operating in Assam seeking a separate Bodo state.

They had formed a joint platform namely United National Liberation Front of Western South East Asia along with NSCN-K and ULFA faction headed by Paresh Baruah.

The demand for a separate state for the Bodos has been in going on in Assam for about five decades with several Bodo overground and militant groups raising it, leading agitations, protests and violence that resulted in many deaths.

Agreements were signed in 1993 and 2003 to resolve the vexed issue. A Bodo Territorial Council under Sixth Schedule of the Constitution was created in 2003 to meet political, developmental and identity-related aspirations of the Bodos.

However, the demand for Bodoland state continued despite opposition by non-Bodo groups in the state. Another official said if a final settlement to the Bodo issue is found while keeping intact the territorial integrity of Assam, it will go a long way in improving the law-and- order situation and bring prosperity and progress to the state.

223,18-1-20,Imported onions tear Govt up,"Centre wants to sell it off to Dhaka, Lanka, Maldives at cost price

Onion is turning out to be a tear-jerker for the Modi Government.

First it was the scarcity of onions that gave headache to the Government. Now, it’s the other way round. The Government is grappling to find a way to dispose of huge quantity of onions it imported from Turkey, Egypt and Iran.

The States have refused to accept the imported onions because they don’t excite the domestic taste buds. A drop in the price of the desi variant has also posed a challenge to imported onions.

The Modi Government has now approached Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka to sell these onions at “no profit no loss” basis. The Government has made a similar request to Bangladesh.

According to Department of Consumer Affairs, over 20,000 tonnes imported onions are available in the stock. In the retail market, onion is being sold between Rs 40 and Rs 60 a kg.

Officials of the Department of Consumer Affairs said talks are being held with Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldives to sell the commodity. Indian missions have been directed to persuade these countries to buy onions from India as arrival of desi onions has increased. India is the main supplier of onions to these countries.

According to officials, a business delegation of Bangladesh is in India and the Government has asked acting Bangladesh High Commissioner Rokebul Haque to buy the imported onions. India had earlier imposed ban on onion export to Bangladesh to ease rising prices of the domestic onions at domestic markets.

Similarly, officials said the Government will have to pay more if they fail to lift the consignment within 15 days of its arrival. Most of the onion is in the containers at Mumbai port.

As per the Department of Consumer Affairs data, Maharashtra, Assam, Haryana, Karnataka and Odisha have withdrawn their demand of 10,000 metric tonnes (MT), 3,000 MT, 3,480 MT, 250 MT and 100 MT f imported onion, respectively. The Centre has contracted 42,000 tonne onion to check prices in the retail market. Of them, a shipment of 5,500 tonne was cancelled before it set on sail in the absence of demand.

Earlier, Union Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has stated that the Government is worried about its disposal because it is a perishable commodity. “Tomorrow, someone should not go to court and say imported onions were rotting,” Paswan has added.

According to onion traders, there are no takers for the imported onion in the market. “The taste of imported onions is different from the homegrown ones. The consumers are not buying it,” said a trader of Azadpur mandi.

With onion prices shooting over Rs 100-150/kg in November-December, the Central Government had decided to import 1.2 lakh MT of onions.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/imported-onions-tear-govt-up-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/imported-onions-tear-govt-up.html
224,18-1-20,This desi gel can take a bite out of frostbite,"Mountaineers, soldiers posted in extreme regions, winter sports enthusiasts, and those visiting/living in snow-bound area at high-altitudes like Siachen or Ladkah have now an on-site treatment available for frostbites — a medical condition involving damage to skin and tissues due to extreme cold.

Scientists from the Institute of Nano Science and Technology (INST) in Mohali, an autonomous institution under the Department of Science & Technology (DST), Defence Institute of High Altitude Research (DIAR), DRDO and Panjab University have developed a cold-stable spray gel “Nano-Spray Gel” that could be administered on-site for the immediate treatment of frostbite injuries. If frostbite is not treated promptly, it can lead to gangrene and amputation of the affected limbs.

The innovation of Nano-Spray Gel, which is a combination of NSAID (painkiller and anti-inflammatory) and clotbuster drugs (thrombolytic) for rapid relief and effective management of frostbite injury, has been published in the peer reviewed journal “American Chemical Society Biomaterials Science & Engineering”.

Frostbite can occur when the skin is exposed to a temperature of 0°C (32°F) or lower. It can be difficult to get treated quickly in remote, snowbound areas. This is also a serious medical problem for the armed forces operating in snow-bound areas at high altitudes like Siachen, Ladhak and so on, said lead author Kalpesh Vaghasiya from INST.

He said that the spray gel has been prepared using heparin, an anticoagulant that improves blood flow by reducing clotting and aiding in blood vessel repair. The researchers packaged heparin into liposomes — lipid carriers, thus helping deliver the anticoagulant deep inside the skin.

Then they embedded the heparin-loaded liposomes in a sprayable hydrogel that also contained ibuprofen (a painkiller and anti-inflammatory drug) and propylene glycol, which helped keep the spray from freezing at very low temperatures.

The researchers tested the spray gel on rats with frostbite, and found that the treatment completely healed the injuries within 14 days. In comparison, untreated injuries were only about 40 per cent healed, while wounds treated with an antibiotic cream were about 80 per cent healed.

The spray reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines at the wound site and in the blood circulation, which likely accelerated healing, the study ‘Heparin-Encapsulated Metered-Dose Topical “Nano-Spray Gel” Liposomal Formulation Ensures Rapid On-Site Management of Frostbite Injury by Inflammatory Cytokines Scavenging’ said.

Frostbite causes fluids in the skin and underlying tissues to freeze and crystallize, resulting in inflammation, decreased blood flow, and cell death. Extremities are the most affected areas because they are farther away from the body’s core and already have reduced blood flow, said the researchers.

Conventional treatments include immersing the body part in warm water, applying topical antibiotic creams or administering vasodilators, and anti-inflammatory drugs, but many of these are unavailable in isolated snowy areas, like mountaintops. Others, such as topical medications, could end up freezing themselves. The new gel can be of great help under such conditions, as per the researchers.

Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue 2020 in New Delhi, Rawat, in a clear reference to Pakistan, sought diplomatic isolation and blacklisting by anti-terror watchdog FATF of countries sponsoring terrorism.

The Chief of Defence Staff also said girls and boys as young as 10 and 12 years were being radicalised in Kashmir.

Condemning Rawat's statements, the Pakistan Foreign Office said, ""These remarks are reflective of the extremist mindset and bankrupt thinking that have evidently also permeated the state institutions of India.""

The FO said Rawat's remarks on FATF were further proof of India's repeated attempts to politicise FATF's technical proceedings.

""Pakistan has consistently sensitised the world community about India's malicious campaign in this regard. We expect that the FATF members would reject these Indian machinations,"" the FO said.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pakistan-condemns-cds-rawat-s-remarks-on-fighting-terror-and-de-radicalisation-camps-in-kashmir-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/pakistan-condemns-cds-rawat-s-remarks-on-fighting-terror-and-de-radicalisation-camps-in-kashmir.html

228,18-1-20,Those opposing Bharat Ratna to Savarkar should spend time in Andaman jail: Raut,"Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Saturday said those opposing Bharat Ratna award for Hindutva ideologue V D Savarkar should be made to spend two days in the Andaman Cellular Jail, the erstwhile colonial prison, where the freedom fighter had been lodged during his incarceration.

Raut's statement can potentially put his party, which shares power in Maharashtra with ideologically different Congress and NCP, in a spot.

The Congress is against offering the highest civilian honour to Savarkar, who is hailed in high esteem by the right wing parties.

""Savarkar's opponents should spend two days in the (erstwhile) Andaman Cellular Jail to understand the hardships he was put through by the British,"" Raut said.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had kicked up a row in December, 2019, when he refused to apologise for his ""rape in India"" remark, saying ""My name is Rahul Gandhi, not Rahul Savarkar"".

Reacting to Raut's comments, Maharashtra minister and Yuva Sena president Aaditya Thackeray said there was no need to dwell rpt dwell on the past.

Aaditya said he was not aware in which capacity Raut made the statement.

""The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) speaks of the aspirations of people. Many people are feeling bad that there is no conflict between Congress and Shiv Sena.

""Despite having different ideologies, the two parties have come together in the interest of the country and the state. Democracy means different ideologies can work together in the interest of the country,"" he told reporters.

The 29-year-old Yuva Sena chief further said he respects all stalwarts of the freedom movement.

""All are 'Ratnas' (jewels). It is in the BJP's hands to award Bharat Ratna since it is ruling at the Centre.

229,18-1-20,"Cong, DMK bury the hatchet; decide to fix issues internally","After days of wrangling over seat allocation in local polls, the Congress and DMK on Saturday buried the hatchet and decided to address issues internally and avoid going public.

Taking the initiative to break the ice, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K S Alagiri along with his senior party colleagues called on DMK chief M K Stalin at party headquarters 'Anna Arivalayam' here.

After the meeting, Alagiri said: ""In the case of difference of opinion, it has been decided that the TNCC and DMK presidents will resolve it and other leaders from both the parties need not air their views.""

Reiterating his stand that there were no issues or differences between the two parties, Alagiri said both the parties had always been united and would continue to be so.

He downplayed DMK leader Duraimurugan's remark that Congress had no vote bank, saying the leader had expressed his view and there was no problem about it.

Alagiri exuded confidence that his party's alliance with the DMK would continue even beyond the 2022 Assembly polls.

Following the deliberations with the Congress team,Stalin urged leaders of both parties to desist from airing their views in public to end haggling and avoid its recurrence.

The DMK chief, recalling the origin of the recent differences, said Algiri had issued a statement that Congress was allocated lesser number of president and vice-president seats (in indirect polls) to head district panchayats and panchayat unions.

Pinning the blame on Alagiri, Stalin said something like seat sharing should have been resolved through talks, but it became public following the Congress statement and it led to an undesirable exchange of views from both the sides.

Asserting that continuation of verbal duel would provide fodder to political rivals and a ""section of the media,"" he said he wanted to end it and asked leaders of both parties not to go public over alliance and related matters like seat sharing.

After saying earlier this week that only time would tell whether ties with the Congress would go back to normalcy, DMK on Wednesday had upped the ante, saying if the national party wants to quit the alliance, it can do so.

Duraimurugan, when asked about Congress's charge that DMK violated coalition dharma and that the grand old party might leave the alliance, had said ""if they want to quit, let them do so. How are we concerned, what is the loss for us?.""

The DMK treasurer had said the party was not worried about Congress leaving the alliance and he was not concerned.

Asked if it would not impact the votes in favour of DMK, he had said his party will not be affected and that Congress does not have a vote bank to dent his party's prospects.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cong--dmk-bury-the-hatchet--decide-to-fix-issues-internally-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/cong--dmk-bury-the-hatchet--decide-to-fix-issues-internally.html

231,18-1-20,Is Raut's Savarkar comment Sena's official stand? Chavan,"Maharashtra PWD minister and senior Congress leader Ashok Chavan on Saturday sought to know whether Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut's statement that those opposing the Bharat Ratna for V D Savarkar must spend two days in Andaman's infamous Cellular Jail, was the official stand of the Sena.

Speaking to reporters earlier in the day, Raut had said ""Savarkar's opponents should spend two days in the (erstwhile) Andaman Cellular Jail to understand the hardships he was put through by the British"".

Within hours of the statement, the Congress hit back with its state spokesperson Sachin Sawant tweeting ""Savarkar was different before 1911. The Congress is against his post- 1923 ideology.""

Speaking to reporters amid the row, Chavan said it needed to ascertained if Raut's statement was the official line of the Shiv Sena.

""(Sena leader) Aaditya Thackeray has already reacted to Raut's remarks stating he was not aware in which capacity Raut had made the remarks that those who oppose Bharat Ratna to Savarkar be sent to Andaman jail,"" Chavan told reporters.

The former chief minister said the Congress stand on the issue is known, ""but it is not known whether Raut's comments were Shiv Sena's stand"".

""Somebody's personal comments cannot be the stand of the government. There is no need to give a reaction to somebody's personal comments,"" Chavan added.

He said Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government, formed by Sena, NCP and Congress, works on a common minimum programme and all parties would continue to stick to it.

Queried on the nightlife policy espoused by state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, Chavan said it was a ""test case"", adding that Mumbai was an international city with global potential.

Thackeray on Saturday said shops, malls and eateries in non-residential areas of Mumbai will have the option of remaining open 24x7 from January 26, although it will not be made compulsory.

""This is a test case. Mumbai is an international city of global potential. We need to get more tourists and improve trade and commerce. This will be implemented on an experimental basis.

""If no new issues come up and the policy of shops, establishments and malls being open 24/7 is implemented well, there is no harm in continuing with it. Lets see the response. If things work out, it is good,"" Chavan said.

Asked about Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar's opposition to the proposed Mumbai-Pune hyperloop project, Chavan said the state could do without experiments.

""We do not want experiments. Maharashtra does not have money to carry out experiments. We don't need a bullet train either. Our priority should be to efficiently run local trains,"" Chavan said.

Meanwhile, Chavan himself pulled down an illegal banner put up by a Congress worker in his home town Nanded.

The banner with Chavan's photograph was put up in violation of the orders of the local civic body.

""I will not allow illegal banners to come up in the city. Due to such illegal banners, the city's landscape is defaced,"" the former MP said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/is-raut-s-savarkar-comment-sena-s-official-stand--chavan-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/is-raut-s-savarkar-comment-sena-s-official-stand--chavan.html
232,18-1-20,Nirbhaya rapists get 10 more days to live,"Fresh death warrant issued for Feb 1 as President rejects mercy plea

After President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday rejected the mercy petition of Nirbhaya’s death-row convict Mukesh Kumar, a Delhi court issued fresh death warrants against all the four rapists-killers for hanging on February 1. Earlier the death warrant was issued for January 22.

In a fresh development, that may further delay the execution of the four convicts, another death-row convict Pawan Kumar moved the Supreme Court on Friday challenging the Delhi High Court’s order dismissing his claim of being a juvenile at the time of the offence in December 2012.

The President rejected Mukesh’s mercy plea after the Union Home Ministry forwarded the petition to his office late on Thursday night. On Friday, the Ministry forwarded the President decision to the Delhi Government and Tihar Jail, where the four men have been lodged.

Soon after the rejection of the mercy plea by the President, the Tihar jail authorities, via Public Prosecutor Irfan Ahmed, sought issuance of fresh death warrants against the four convicts Mukesh, Vinay Sharma, Pawan Gupta and Akshay Thakur.

Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) of Patiala House courts Satish Kumar Arora was hearing a plea by one of the four death-row convicts in the case. “This case presents a scenario when convicts were given the opportunity to file mercy, but only one availed the opportunity. There might be delay tactics. For how long will this go on? Had death warrant not been issued, the convicts would not have initiated using their legal remedies,” the court said.

Distraught over the hanging of his 23-year-old daughter’s rapists-murderers being further delayed due to the legalities, her father hoped that the convicts will not escape the gallows. His comments came after the President rejected the mercy plea of Mukesh.

“We are happy that the chances of them getting hanged have increased. We are assured that as soon as they file mercy pleas they will be rejected,” he said, adding that the news of the execution not happening on January 22 had disheartened them but Friday’s developments have ignited their hope.

Incidentally, Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal’s office had sent Mukesh’s mercy petition to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Thursday, a day after the Delhi Government recommended its rejection.

“The MHA has forwarded the mercy petition of Mukesh to the President. The Ministry has reiterated the recommendation of the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi for its rejection,” a Home Ministry official said on Friday morning.

Meanwhile, denying the Delhi Government’s role in delaying the hanging of the Nirbhaya case convicts, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said the victim’s mother is being “misguided” and accused BJP leader and I&B Minister Prakash Javadekar of politicising the matter.

Kejriwal, who is the AAP’s national convener, told reporters that whatever responsibilities the Delhi Government had, it had finished them within a few hours.

“We sent the mercy petition within hours, so the Delhi Government has no role in delaying the hanging of the convicts,” he said.

Six people — Mukesh, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Kumar Singh, Pawan Gupta, Ram Singh and a juvenile — were named as accused in the brutal gangrape and murder of Nirbhaya. The trial of the five adult men began in a special fast-track court in March 2013 while the juvenile was tried by juvenile justice board, and is now free.

The prime accused, Ram Singh, committed suicide by hanging himself in Tihar jail days after the trial began. The juvenile, who was said to be the most brutal of the attackers, was put in a correctional home for three years. He was released in 2015 and sent to an undisclosed location amid concerns over a threat to his life.

The juvenile, when released, was 20 years old. Mukesh, Vinay, Akshay and Pawan were convicted and sentenced to death in September 2013.

Meanwhile, Sandeep Goyal, Director General, Delhi Prisons, denied charges made by Vinay’s lawyer that he had tried to end his life.

“Vinay was slightly unwell and he was attended by prison doctors and his health condition is normal. However, he sometimes refuses to have meal and jail wardens keep a watch on him. All four the convicts are under round the clock watch in the executions cell,” said Goyal.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nirbhaya-rapists-get-10-more-days-to-live-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/nirbhaya-rapists-get-10-more-days-to-live.html
233,18-1-20,Karan to play Neel in Zee TV’s next,"There’s just a handful of people in life that any of us would give a hand and leg for — it could be anyone from a dearly cherished childhood friend to your spouse to a close sibling but for most of us in India, it is our family. Zee TV’s next primetime offering Qurbaan Hua is an intense drama about two passionate and young individuals, caught in a crossfire of destiny. They’re on a mission of their own, driven by the love and pride of their family. Despite being two completely different people hailing from starkly different backgrounds and cultures, Neel and Chahat are about to sacrifice the single-most important and intimate relationship of life and tie the knot with each other, without a trace of love that forms the foundation of any marriage. While he is burning with the fire of revenge for his sister’s death, she is single-mindedly determined to clear her abbu’s name as she’s convinced he’s had no role to play in the death of Neel’s sister. The question, then, is — what lengths will they go to for the love and pride of their family?

Karan Jotwani, who was last seen in Zee TV’s Aap Ke Aa Jane Se, has been roped in to play the role of Neel. Neel is an emotional young man, particularly close to his sister. He is one of the most eligible bachelors and someone everyone just instinctively loves.

Talking about his character, Jotwani revealed: “I chose the show not only because of its unique, evocative story but also because my character is strong and challenging. In fact, the show is based on an extremely basic human insight of going the extra mile for the love and pride of one’s family and loved ones. So, I am excited to be a part of the show.”",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/karan-to-play-neel-in-zee-tv---s-next-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/karan-to-play-neel-in-zee-tv---s-next.html

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday announced candidates for 57 Assembly seats for the February 8 Delhi polls picking 11 SC and four women candidates.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari, joined by senior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar, announced the list finalised at party’s Central Election Committee (CEC) meeting on Thursday night.

It seems that the BJP, which swept the 2017 civic polls in Delhi, is betting big on its municipal leaders to shore up the party’s fortune for in the Assembly polls. Therefore, the BJP gave poll tickets to nearly 20 municipal leaders, including four former mayors, as many ex-deputy mayors and a host of sitting and former councillors.

Former Delhi Minister Kapil Mishra has been fielded from Model Town. Karwal Nagar seat, from where Mishra had won on AAP ticket, has gone to old war horse and four-term MLA Mohan Singh Bisht.

JD(U)’s Shilendra Kumar filed nomination from Burari which the latter has demanded from the BJP. JD(U) has staked claim for Badarpur seat too but the BJP has fielded seasoned politician Ram Singh Bidhuri who had won this seat thrice.

The BJP central command is mulling over to field a strong candidate against Kejriwal.

Names of member of Parliament (MP) from New Delhi Lok Sabha seat Meenakshi Lekhi and former AAP leader Kumar Vishwas are doing rounds, a BJP insider said.

“New Delhi has different demography. People residing in New Delhi are the tax payers, many are business oriented people and some are serving in Central Government, Kejriwal’s policies on free water electricity will not work for New Delhi voters,” said a BJP insider pitching name of Lekhi and Vishwas against Kejriwal.

“Indeed, if one can see, these tax payers are totally against distributing free water/electricity and the party high command believe that Lekhi and Vishwas may woe the voters, Lekhi has worked in her constituency also,” said a source.

Senior BJP leader Vijender Gupta also got ticket from Rohini while former mayors Ravinder Gupta and Yogender Chandolia also got tickets from Matiya Mahal and Karol Bagh respectively.

BJP leader Jagdish Pradhan will contest from Mustafabad, Naresh Gaur from Babarpur, Kaushal Mishra from Seelampur, OP Sharma from Vishwas Nagar, Anil Bajpai from Gandhi Nagar and Jitender Mahajan will contest election from Rohtash Nagar.

While AAP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodai has filed nomination from Patparganj, BJP leader Ravi Negi will contest against Sisodia.

Former deputy mayors and a senior leader in the BJP -led South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) are among the four women.

Greater Kailash candidate Shikha Rai is the former Leader of the House of the SDMC and an ex-chairperson of its Standing Committee.

Rekha Gupta, a former councillor and former Delhi BJP general secretary, will contest from Shalimar Bagh in northwest Delhi.

Lata Sodhi, who has been fielded from Ballimaran, is a former councillor. Sodhi’s father-in-law Motilal Sodhi also represented the seat as an MLA.

Kiran Vaid, who will be in the fray from the Trilokpuri seat, is a sitting councillor and has also served as a deputy mayor of East Delhi. She had unsuccessfully contested the 2015 Assembly polls.

All the three municipal corporations -- North, South and East -- in Delhi are controlled by the BJP. Its second list is expected by Saturday while the ruling AAP has announced all its 70 candidates. The Congress is yet to declare its list of candidates.

Housemate Shehnaz Gill was happy to meet her father Santok Gill, who entered the house with tips for his daughter. Gill senior also shared his views in an exclusive chat with timesofIndia.com. He opened up on various aspects including Shehnaz's equations with Sidharth Shukla and Paras Chhabra, and also on the time host Salman Khan rebuked her.

On Shehnaz possibly developing feelings for Sidharth, Santok said: ""I don't have any problems if Shehnaz has feelings for Sidharth and plans to continue her bond even outside the house. If she wants to take forward her relationship with him once they are out of the show, I will be fine. I don't think they are the first Jodi to have a 10-year-age difference.

""Even Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan have age difference, but their marriage is going steady. Also, in Punjab you will find many couples who have a minimum age gap of 10 years. I don't think it is an issue.""

He added: ""I told her not to get carried away. If she has feelings for Sidharth it fine and not to cross the line. I also like watching Sidnaz together, but I don't like that she is losing her focus from the game. I have told her if she likes Sidharth and has feelings for him it is fine and once she is out, we will see how things go. People in Punjab like watching Sidnaz together, they are not liking her jodi with Paras. They don't want her to keep any feelings for Paras. They want to see Shehnaz with Sidharth.""

Santok Gill is clearly not pleased with Paras. ""I would have bashed Paras, but my daughter did not let me do it. Main uski waat laga deta,"" he said.

Finally, he had a word of thanks for Salman Khan. ""If Salman sir got angry on her (Shehnaz), it was the need of the hour. It will work in her benefit because he has also realised that she is losing her focus from the game and is only bothered about Sidharth Shukla. Now, that Salman sir has told her she won't repeat that behaviour,"" timesofIndia.com quoted Santok as saying.

When she was asked about their marriage in 2020, Akanksha said, ""Maybe. Let's see. I'm not sure. I'm just waiting for him to come out (of the 'Bigg Boss' house). There are a lot of things that I need to clear. If I go inside the house and talk to him about these things, he is not going to give me an exact answer as he will still be in the game. So, I'm just waiting. Let's see where it takes us. I'm prepared for everything.""

""There are a few things which he has done that have really upset me about. He has lied about a few things. I know it is a part of his game but I didn't like it. I take a lot of pride in myself and I am a very strong person, so if anybody is calling me weak or someone who keeps crying, I'll not be able to take it,"" she added.

In a recent episode, Mahira's mother was seen entering the ""Bigg Boss"" house as a guest. She had asked Paras not to kiss her daughter that he often does. ""The way she said it was very cute and I don't find anything wrong in it. I don't know why people are taking it in a wrong way,"" Akanksha said.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-bigg-boss-13---paras-had-plans-of-marrying-gf-in-2020-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/-bigg-boss-13---paras-had-plans-of-marrying-gf-in-2020.html

241,18-1-20,"Ken Starr, celebrity lawyer Dershowitz join Trump defense team","Ken Starr, who was at the center of Bill Clinton's impeachment in the 1990s, and America's biggest celebrity lawyer Alan Dershowitz were announced Friday to be joining President Donald Trump's Senate impeachment defense.

The administration has yet to unveil the full team but confirmed that White House counsel Pat Cipollone will be lead lawyer, backed by Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow.

""President Trump has done nothing wrong and is confident that this team will defend him, the voters, and our democracy from this baseless, illegitimate impeachment,"" the White House said in a statement Friday evening.

But where Cipollone is ultra-discreet, and rarely speaks on the record, Dershowitz and Starr will bring the legal world's equivalent of rock stardom when the trial begins on Tuesday.

US media reports said Starr, the special prosecutor in the 1998 Clinton impeachment saga, was joining the Trump legal team. He is a hero to many on the right, even if Clinton ultimately was acquitted in the Senate.

Among the first to react -- with expletive-laden astonishment -- was Monica Lewinsky, whose affair with Clinton was the subject of Starr's investigation.

""This is definitely an 'are you fucking kidding me?' kinda day,"" she tweeted. No less controversial is the choice of Dershowitz, whose past clients include disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, as well as film director Roman Polanski and former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson, both embroiled in notorious rape cases.

Dershowitz himself has been accused of being a witness and participant in Epstein's sex crimes -- allegations he strenuously denies.

Dershowitz's most famous case was the successful defense of former NFL star O.J. Simpson, whose televised 1995 murder trial riveted the nation.

In the Senate, Dershowitz, who teaches at Harvard University, says he'll be pursuing loftier matters.

In a post on Twitter Friday, Dershowitz said he would ""present oral arguments at the Senate trial to address the constitutional arguments against impeachment and removal.""

Lead lawyer Cipollone is the author of the Republican president's uncompromising strategy to stonewall the Democrats' impeachment investigation, calling it ""partisan and unconstitutional.""

Another high-powered player will be Sekulow, a stalwart in the White House pushback against a two-year probe by special counsel Robert Mueller into Trump's controversial dealings with Russia.

A Supreme Court veteran and a big name on the right-wing evangelical Christian scene, he won't be dazzled by the bright lights of Washington's ultimate fight.

Rounding off the roster will be Robert Ray, another figure from the investigations into Clinton that rocked Washington in the 1990s, US media reported.

Trump has been impeached by the House of Representatives on accusations that he abused his office to try and force Ukraine into digging up dirt on leading Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

He was also impeached for allegedly obstructing Congress.

But the White House enters the Senate trial with a massive advantage: Trump's Republicans have 53 of the 100 seats and the party is in lockstep.

The majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, echoes Trump's claim that the impeachment is a political hit job.

As a man who has been fighting legal battles for decades -- including rape allegations, multiple real estate disputes, and bankruptcy -- Trump is no stranger to colorful lawyers.

His former longtime attorney Michael Cohen is serving a three-year sentence and has turned on his old boss. Before going behind bars for a variety of crimes last year, Cohen called Trump a ""con man"" and a ""cheat."" Where Cohen left off, an even bigger firebrand, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, stepped in to serve as attorney and roving political fixer.

Giuliani's relentless attempts to prove conspiracy theories around Biden's family activities in Ukraine are interwoven with the whole impeachment case against Trump. Although Giuliani is not a government employee, he has traveled to Ukraine to lead the search for dirt on Biden.

And the outspoken former federal prosecutor who was in charge of New York on 9/11, has pushed to be allowed in on the Senate impeachment trial team. A wary White House has shut the door.

Friday evening, House Democrats released documents showing Lev Parnas, who served as Giuliani's envoy to Ukrainian officials, had been in extensive contact with an aide to Representative Devin Nunes, the highest-ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee.

The WhatsApp messages, which run from February to May of last year, indicate that Nunes's office was aware of the alleged efforts to try and force Ukraine into investigating Biden.

Parnas made headlines Thursday when, hours before Trump's impeachment trial opened, he broke ranks to charge that the president ""knew exactly what was going on"" regarding his and business partner Igor Fruman's efforts to influence Ukrainian authorities.

Trump denied knowing Parnas. ""I don't believe I've ever spoken to him,"" he told reporters.

But Parnas told MSNBC that Trump was lying. ""We're not friends,"" the Ukrainain-born businessman said. ""But he knew exactly who we were.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ken-starr--celebrity-lawyer-dershowitz-join-trump-defense-team-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/ken-starr--celebrity-lawyer-dershowitz-join-trump-defense-team.html

""The so-called 'Supreme Leader' of Iran, who has not been so Supreme lately, had some nasty things to say about the United States and Europe,"" Trump tweeted of Khamenei's comments earlier Friday in Tehran.

According to Trump, Khamenei's blistering speech, in which he attacked the ""vicious"" United States and described Britain, France and Germany as ""America's lackey's,"" was a mistake.

243,18-1-20,Boeing finds 'minor' new 737 MAX software glitch,"Boeing said Friday it discovered a new flaw in the software on the grounded 737 MAX aircraft, but hopes to resolve the matter shortly so that it does not further delay the plane's expected return to service.

""We are making necessary updates and working with the FAA on submission of this change and keeping our customers and suppliers informed,"" the company said a statement, referring to the US Federal Aviation Administration.

""Our highest priority is ensuring the 737 MAX is safe and meets all regulatory requirements before it returns to service."" The statement did not elaborate on the nature of the problem.

According to a person with knowledge of the matter, the glitch causes other onboard software to malfunction during startup.

Boeing uncovered the new problem during a ""technical review"" last week, the person said, calling the problem ""minor"" and adding that it should not delay the plane's return to service.

Boeing and the FAA are currently reviewing fixes to the aircraft's MCAS anti-stall flight system, which was implicated in the crashes of Lion Air and Ethiopian Air flights that together left 346 people dead.

The MAX has been grounded worldwide since March 13, 2019.

Before the planes can return to service, civil aviation authorities must also determine what training MAX pilots will require and schedule a test flight.

The MAX's troubles have cost Boeing more than USD 9 billion and the bill threatens to keep rising, while one major supplier was forced to lay off 2,800 workers.

Dennis Muilenburg, who was named chief executive in 2015, was fired in late December at the end of last month and his successor, longtime board member David Calhoun, took over at the start of this week.

Calhoun, who told staff the company must strengthen its culture, focus on ""integrity"" and be ""transparent,"" is due to visit the assembly plants next week in Washington State and should hold his first news conference by telephone on Wednesday, company officials say.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/boeing-finds--minor--new-737-max-software-glitch-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/boeing-finds--minor--new-737-max-software-glitch.html
244,18-1-20,Rainstorms douse bushfires across eastern Australia,"Rain and thunderstorms doused long-burning bushfires across much of eastern Australia Saturday, but they also brought a new threat of flooding in some areas.

Major bushfires continued to rage in regions of the south and southeast of the country that have so far missed out on the rain, including in wildlife-rich forests on Kangaroo Island off the southern coast.

The fire service in New South Wales (NSW) state, the country's most populous and the hardest hit by the crisis, said 75 fires continued to burn Saturday, down from well over 100 a few days earlier.

""Rain continues to fall across a number of fire grounds,"" the state's rural fire service said, adding that ""benign conditions"" of rain and cooler temperatures were helping efforts to contain the remaining blazes.

To the north, Queensland state was hit by severe storms overnight, causing some flash flooding and road closures though no deaths or injuries were reported. Both states have suffered from one of the longest droughts in modern Australian history and some areas saw more rain Friday and Saturday than had fallen in more than a decade.

Fires continued to burn out of control in southern New South Wales and neighbouring Victoria state, but forecasters expected significant rainfall in those areas Sunday and Monday, raising hopes that some of those blazes could be brought under control as well.

The unprecedented fires, fuelled by climate change and a years-long drought, have claimed 28 lives over the past five months.

They have scorched massive tracts of forest and bushland in eastern and southern Australia, decimated livestock on already barren farms and destroyed more than 2,000 homes.

On Kangaroo Island, known as Australia's ""Galapagos"" for the large number of unique animals and other wildlife endemic to the area, fires continued to rage in a big national park.

The flames have already taken a heavy toll on the island's population of koalas, birds and other endemic marsupial species.

Authorities have warned the crisis could worsen again with Australia only halfway through its summer.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rainstorms-douse-bushfires-across-eastern-australia-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/rainstorms-douse-bushfires-across-eastern-australia.html
245,18-1-20,Pak SC to entertain Musharraf's plea only after he surrenders to the law: Report,"Pakistan's Supreme Court has returned the petition of self-exiled former dictator Pervez Musharraf against his conviction and sentencing by a special tribunal with objection that he is not allowed to appeal without surrendering to the law, according to a media report.

On Thursday, 74-year-old retired general, now based in Dubai, approached the court to challenge the ruling of the special tribunal that had handed him death sentence on charges of high treason.

Barrister Salman Safdar, the counsel for Musharraf, submitted the 90-page petition in the top court. In the petition, the former president urged the Supreme Court to declare the special court ruling null and void.

The registrar office of the top court on Friday returned the appeal with the observation that it was settled principle of law that the convict should first surrender before filing appeal, The Express Tribune reported.

The court gave one month time to remove the objection which meant that Musharraf should surrender within one month otherwise he would lose the right to file appeal, the report said.

The three-member court in its judgment on December 17 found him guilty and handed down the death penalty after six years of hearing the high-profile treason case against him. He was punished despite not appearing to record his statement.

Musharraf who has been living in Dubai since March 2016 stated in his petition that the former president's absence from the special court was not intentional as he was unable to appear due to health issue.

He said that the special court had accepted his pleas of ailment but convicted the former president in absentia.

The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government led by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had filed the treason case against the former army chief in 2013 over the imposition of an extra-constitutional emergency in November 2007, which led to the confinement of a number of superior court judges in their houses and sacking of over 100 judges.

It is the first time in Pakistan's history that a former army chief was tried and sentenced under Article 6 of the Constitution.

Separately, the Lahore High Court declared that the formation of the special court was ""unconstitutional"" and that the treason case against the former president was not prepared in accordance with the law. It let some experts to believe that its verdict had become null and void.

Others, however, assert that the judgment would stay as it was according to the law, though the court's formation was declared as against the law.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pak-sc-to-entertain-musharraf-s-plea-only-after-he-surrenders-to-the-law--report-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/pak-sc-to-entertain-musharraf-s-plea-only-after-he-surrenders-to-the-law--report.html

247,18-1-20,Downing Street giant clock display to count down Brexit on January 31,"The UK government has confirmed the official plans to mark Brexit Day on January 31, which will include a giant clock count down the significant moment as part of a light display at 10 Downing Street.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will address the nation just before the UK officially leaves the European Union (EU) at 11 pm (local time).

Ahead of that address, he will chair a special Cabinet meeting in the north of England as a message of unity for all parts of the United Kingdom, including Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.

""January 31 is a significant moment in our history as the United Kingdom leaves the EU and regains its independence. The government intends to use this as a moment to heal divisions, re-unite communities and look forward to the country that we want to build over the next decade,"" Downing Street said in a statement on Saturday.

""No 10 (Downing Street) is set to mark the hour itself with a light display in Downing Street, including a clock counting down to 11pm projected on to the black bricks of Downing Street. Buildings around Whitehall will also be lit up. In response to public calls, the Union Jack will be flown on all of the flag poles in Parliament Square,” the statement notes.

A commemorative Brexit coin will also come into circulation on the very day, with Johnson expected to be one of the first to receive the new coin, which reads: ""Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations"".

The confirmation of the government's plans for Brexit Day comes amid ongoing Brexiteer demands for the Big Ben to be resurrected for a day to mark the moment of Britain's exit from the 28-member economic bloc.

The iconic London clock tower is undergoing a massive refurbishment programme and the government had claimed the cost for it to be brought into temporary service for a day would be around GBP 500,000.

After Johnson made a seemingly light-hearted call for the public to try and raise the funds, an online crowdfunding drive has attracted over GBP 200,000 with the help of staunch pro-Brexit campaigners.

But it has emerged that the House of Commons Commission, in charge of the Big Ben housed within the Elizabeth Tower of the UK's Houses of Parliament complex had no way of accepting the public donations.

The row over the issue continues to rage on, with the announcement from Downing Street of the official plans an attempt to overcome that controversy.

Nigel Farage, a prominent Brexiteer and leader of the Brexit Party, had revealed earlier this week that his Leave Means Leave campaign group had secured permission to host a celebration at Parliament Square in London to mark Britain's exit from the EU on January 31.

The group is planning a GBP 100,000 party on Brexit Day and had questioned the government's muted preparations for what they say is a historic moment for the country.

The EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill, made up of the Brexit deal struck by Johnson in Brussels last November, is set to become law in time for the January 31 deadline as the legislation makes progress through the different stages of parliamentary process.

It was comfortably passed by the House of Commons earlier this year, given the Conservative Party's 80-seat majority secured by Johnson in the December 2019 General Election.

Britain's exit at the end of the month comes after it missed the initial March 29, 2019 Brexit deadline due to parliamentary deadlock over the issue since the UK voted in favour of an EU exit in a referendum in June 2016.

It has since resulted in two General Elections in an attempt to find the necessary parliamentary numbers to put an exit plan into action.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/downing-street-giant-clock-display-to-count-down-brexit-on-january-31-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/downing-street-giant-clock-display-to-count-down-brexit-on-january-31.html

249,18-1-20,Musk aims to send 10 lakh people to Mars by 2050,"SpaceX CEO Elon Musk aims to send 10 lakh people to Mars by 2050 and in a series of tweets, has revealed how is he going to achieve the daunting task of colonising the Red Planet and make humans beings 'multiplanetary'.

Throwing more details about his Starship programme, Musk said the rocket would carry many megatons of cargo per year to the Red Planet to prepare Mars for a human presence by mid-century.

""Megatons per year to orbit are needed for life to become multiplanetary,"" he tweeted.

""Starship design goal is 3 flights/day avg rate, so over 1,000 flights/year at over 100 tonnes/flight, so every 10 ships yield 1 megaton per year to orbit,"" Musk explained to his 30.7 million followers.

The orbital Starship prototype, designed ""SN1"" is currently under construction at SpaceX's Texas facility.

""Building 100 Starships/year gets to 1,000 in 10 years or 100 megatons/year or maybe around 100k people per Earth-Mars orbital sync,"" the SpaceX CEO further explained.

That translates to a schedule of once every two years when Earth and Mars are closest to one another.

SpaceX's goal, according to Musk, is to finally send 10 lakh people to Mars by 2050.

In September last year, SpaceX requested NASA to provide it with potential landing sites on the Red Planet.

SpaceX is building the Starship (formerly known as the BFR), a fully reusable vehicle designed to take humans and supplies to Mars.

Musk earlier floated the idea that making Mars warmer would be crucial for making it habitable for humans and one way of doing it would be launching thermonuclear weapons in order to create tiny ""suns"" over the regions.

The idea is to convert any frozen carbon dioxide into gas, thereby engineering a greenhouse gas.

Musk has already estimated the cost of having a self-sustaining civilization on the Red Planet which is ""between $100 billion and $10 trillion"".

He arrived at the figure after estimating the approximate future cost of sending a minimum payload to Mars ""to nearest order of magnitude"", at $100,000 per tonne. So if building a self-sustaining city on Mars requires a million tonnes of cargo, the cost would be around $100 billion, Musk calculated.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/musk-aims-to-send-10-lakh-people-to-mars-by-2050-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/musk-aims-to-send-10-lakh-people-to-mars-by-2050.html

Huawei, along with its sub-brand Honor, has launched a number of 5G smartphones in 2019, including Mate 30 5G series, Mate 20 X 5G, Mate X 5G, Nova 6 5G, Honor V30 series, among others, news portal GizmoChina reported on Friday.

Recently, the company announced that it has shipped 6.9 million units of 5G smartphones as of December 2019, in addition to offering end-to-end 5G solutions.

Additionally, Chinese local research agencies suggested that 20 per cent of all mid range smartphones will support 5G, thanks to the expansion of the network in the country.

An estimated 5 million 5G capable smartphones were sold in December 2019 alone. It is expected that more than 20 per cent of the smartphones under $290 will be 5G-enabled this year.

By 2021, the same statistics are expected to be applicable across the globe.

Xiaomi co-founder Lei Jun recently announced the company is planning to pump $7 billion in 5G, AI and IoT over the next five years.

Earlier, Lei had also revealed that the company is planning to release more than 10 5G phones this year.

US-based investment banking and financial service company Goldman Sachs has also forecasted a hefty 200 million 5G smartphone shipments globally this year.

The new predicted value is about 20 times more than the sales figure of 2019.

According to the estimates, there will be about 1 million new 5G base stations in China this year. This is higher than the original 600,000 prediction by Goldman Sachs.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/--150-5g-phones-to-be-launched-by-the-end-of-2020--2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/--150-5g-phones-to-be-launched-by-the-end-of-2020-.html
251,18-1-20,Smith blames loss of three quick wickets for defeat,"Australia batsman Steve Smith rued the loss of three quick wickets in the middle overs, including his own, that proved decisive in his team's 36-run loss to India in the second ODI here.

India posted a fighting 340 for six on a flat track with opener Shikhar Dhawan top-scoring with 90-ball 96 and then bowled out the visitors for 304 to level the three-match series 1-1.

""The area where we lost it was losing the three wickets in between 30 and 40 overs and not having someone there that could start to launch,"" Smith said after the game on Friday.

""If we had someone that had been out there for a while, perhaps things may have been different but that was probably where we lost it,"" he added.

Australia lost three quick wickets between the 30 and 40 overs. Marnus Labuschagne was dismissed in the 31st over and Chinaman Kuldeep Yadav accounted for both Alex Carrey and Smith in the 38th over which turned out to be a game changer.

""I thought Marnus played really well in his first outing, first bat in ODI cricket. We were going at a reasonable rate at around six an over for a while. We playing good cricket shots. I thought we timed the run (rate) reasonably well but just losing those three wickets in that 30 to 40 overs but (was) a big dent in the run chase,"" said Smith.

According to Smith, the key to India's victory was their partnerships in the middle.

""I think it's just our normal one-day game plan, with the ball it's trying to take wickets and stem the run rate that way, obviously they had some pretty good partnerships, Virat (Kohli), Shikhar (Dhawan) and KL Rahul played really well at the back end. They were able to form some partnerships through the middle,"" he said.

On a personal note, Smith said it was good to be among the runs but he would have preferred if he could take his team over the line.

""It was nice to score a few runs, I would've liked to have batted a bit longer and been there in the happy hour but unfortunately, tried to cut one that stopped in the wicket a little bit and dragged it on. It was a pretty bad time. We had lost Kez (Alex Carey) in the same over.""

Indian pacers used short-balls against Smith and the prolific Australian batsman said he had to think about how to play.

""I got a few away but I probably didn't feel great the first 20 balls I was at the crease, and then I started to find a bit of rhythm and feel a bit better. Hopefully some-time in the middle helped and I can make some more runs in Bengaluru.""

India opener Rohit Sharma hurt his hand while fielding and there is no clarity on whether he will be available for the final ODI.

Asked whether the absence of India vice-captain would be an advantage, Smith said, ""He's a world-class player and if he's no good – we wish him all the best, hope he's all right – but if not, that does leave a hole for them, because he's phenomenal at the top of the order. His record speaks for itself.""

With the series level 1-1, the decider will be played at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru and Smith expects it to be a high-scoring affair.

""It's a nice batting wicket. It feels like the ball goes further in the air, it sort of travels, you see lots of sixes generally there. It's quite a fast outfield and it's usually a nice-paced wicket. I can see perhaps another high-scoring game,"" he said.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/smith-blames-loss-of-three-quick-wickets-for-defeat-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/smith-blames-loss-of-three-quick-wickets-for-defeat.html
252,18-1-20,Great to be compared with someone like Dravid: Rahul,"Gradually learning to fit into multiple roles as per team's requirement, KL Rahul has drawn comparisons with the legendary Rahul Dravid and the young batsman says it's an honour.

Like Rahul Dravid, he has played in the middle-order and has kept wickets too.

A traditional opener, Rahul came in at number five in Rajkot and blazed his way to 52-ball 80 to propel India to competitive 340 for six on a flat track at the SCA Stadium here. He then kept wickets as regular wicket-keeper Rishabh Pant was concussed.

Rahul had also kept wickets in the lung-opener at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai and did a decent job in both the games.

""It's great to be compared with someone like him. I had this comparison for a long time when growing up and playing as well. The names – he's Rahul Dravid and I'm Rahul – so the comparisons always been there and he's someone I have spent a lot of time with talking about cricket, talking about batting and he's coming from the same state as well (Karnataka)"".

He said Dravid is open to speak to him on anything about cricket.

""I have the opportunity to go to him or give him a call and talk to him about batting or anything about cricket. So he's been more than welcome,"" Rahul signed off.

Dravid had kept wickets in the 2003 World Cup in South Africa.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/great-to-be-compared-with-someone-like-dravid--rahul-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/great-to-be-compared-with-someone-like-dravid--rahul.html
253,18-1-20,"Series at stake, India and Australia ready for showdown","A coveted series-victory will be at stake when a resilient India face a feisty Australia in the third and deciding ODI here on Sunday, promising a fitting finale between the two leading teams in world cricket.

The series was very much expected to go down to the wire but with the way the Australians hammered the hosts in the series opener, it seemed the tourists would run away with their second straight series win in India.

However, India showed commendable character in Rajkot to level the series, proving that the panic buttons were pressed prematurely following the 10-wicket loss in Mumbai.

More importantly, India got their batting combination right for the second ODI, a fair comment considering the way K L Rahul seized the opportunity in his new batting position – number five.

With Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan opening, team's best batsman and skipper Virat Kohli returned to his usual number three spot while Shreyas Iyer was back at number four. The same order is likely to be followed on Sunday.

Rohit, who is due for a big score in the series, hurt his shoulder while fielding on Friday but Kohli is confident that the star opener will be available for the series decider at the Chinnaswamy stadium.

Dhawan was also hit in the rib cage off a Pat Cummins ball, forcing him out of action when Australia batted.

""Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma are progressing well. Their recovery is being closely monitored and a call on their participation in the final ODI will be taken before the match,"" BCCI said in a statement.

Manish Pandey played in place of injured Rishabh Pant and it remains to be seen if the southpaw is fit for the game.

The biggest plus for India from Rajkot was Rahul's power-packed knock at number five, creating a new set of possibilities that might help in improving the team balance.

Specialist opener Rahul made the difference in India's innings by batting at a 150-plus strike rate in an unfamiliar position, having batted at three in the previous game.

In fact, Kohli went to the extent of saying that it was the best he saw from Rahul at the international level. India are looking to add much needed firepower in the middle-order and Rahul could provide that.

In Pant's absence, he also did well behind the wicket, effecting Aaron Finch's stumping besides taking two catches.

Before the series, the talk was about 'who would open alongside Rohit?'

Will it be Rahul or the fit-again Shikhar Dhawan? With Dhawan scoring big in both the games and Rahul showing his versatility, both have proved their immense value in the playing eleven.

Kohli was criticised for tinkering with the batting order in Mumbai, especially on pushing himself down to four to accommodate Rahul but he always knew what he was doing.

""We live in the days of social media and a panic button being pressed too early. It's very important to figure out the best team you can put on the park and when you see how KL was batting today, it's very difficult to leave someone like that out,"" Kohli said after the 36-run win.

No significant change is expected even in the bowling composition with team preferring three pacers and two spinners.

Kuldeep Yadav, who did not have the best of times in 2019, reaffirmed his value by bowling a match-winning over in which he removed Alex Carey and Steve Smith.

The other wrist spinner in the squad, Yuzvendra Chahal, may finally get to play alongside Kuldeep with the Chinnaswamy Stadium being his home ground in the IPL.

Another positive for India was Jasprit Bumrah producing a tidy spell, his most impressive since his comeback from injury. He stifled the opposition as wickets came from the other end.

Mohammad Shami, who was a tad expensive early on in Rajkot, bowled well towards the end alongside Navdeep Saini.

Australia too are unlikely to make wholesale changes in their line-up following the defeat. They were very much in the run chase until Kuldeep got rid of star batsman Smith. The visitors had a great chance of wrapping up the series but were unable to win the crucial moments.

The in-form Marnus Labuschagne was impressive in his first ODI innings but got out at the wrong time.

Mitchell Starc would be itching to bounce back, having conceded 78 runs in 10 overs. His new ball partner Pat Cummins was hard to score off once again while leggie Adam Zampa got the prized wicket of Kohli for the fifth time in ODIs.

However, left-arm spinner Ashton Agar has not been that effective and needs to up his game in the all-important series decider.

Squads:

India: Virat Kohli (captain), Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, K L Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Kedar Jadhav, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Navdeep Saini, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur and Mohammed Shami.

Australia: Aaron Finch (Captain), Alex Carey (Wicket-keeper), Patrick Cummins, Sean Abbott, Ashton Agar, Peter Handscomb, Josh Hazlewood, Marnus Labuschange, Kane Richardson, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Ashton Turner, David Warner and Adam Zampa.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/series-at-stake--india-and-australia-ready-for-showdown-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/series-at-stake--india-and-australia-ready-for-showdown.html
254,18-1-20,"Rohit & Dhawan recovering well, final call on Sunday","Team India will take a call on injured openers Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan before the final ODI in Bengaluru on Sunday itself. While Dhawan didn't come out to field due to a blow on his rib cage while batting, Rohit walked off in the 43rd over of the Australia innings after a shoulder injury.

The team management is keeping a close eye on the duo and will take a call on their availability before the series decider at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.

The BCCI said: ""Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma are progressing well. Their recovery is being closely monitored and a call on their participation in the final ODI will be taken tomorrow before the match.""

Speaking after the game, skipper Virat Kohli gave an update on Rohit's shoulder and said: ""I asked Rohit briefly just now. It's that left shoulder which has popped out a few times. There's no tear, so hopefully he should be back for the next game.""

As for Dhawan, BCCI had issued a statement on Friday itself after the India innings wherein Dhawan hit a 90-ball 96. ""Shikhar Dhawan got hit on the rib-cage on his right side. He will not be taking the field today,"" BCCI said.

While Dhawan and Kohli both hit fifties, it was K.L. Rahul who stole the show with his blitz at the end of the India innings. Speaking after the game, Rahul said that watching videos of the likes of Steve Smith, AB de Villiers and Kane Williamson helped him.

""I just spoke a lot more to middle-order batsmen. I watched a lot of videos, I spoke a lot to Virat (Kohli), watched a lot of videos of AB or Steve Smith for the matter on how they build their innings,"" Rahul said at the post-match press conference on Friday after India defeated Australia by 36 runs.

""Kane Williamson, who I have tried to go back and watch some of his videos to see how they build their innings, and how they play in certain situations.

""Only thing I have tried is how to be better in certain situations. And reading of the game has got a lot better now that I have played in different positions,"" he added.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rohit---dhawan-recovering-well--final-call-on-sunday-2020-01-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/rohit---dhawan-recovering-well--final-call-on-sunday.html
