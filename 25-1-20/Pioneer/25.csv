0,25-1-20,Reprieve for Pak,"With the US and EU now backing its counter-terrorism compliances at FATF, it may get out of the grey list

In the end, India has to evolve its own dynamic regarding Pakistan and its sponsored terror instead of focussing solely on isolating it diplomatically and amassing international opinion on its side. For the fluidity of geopolitics means that each nation would work out its tactical advantage in an evolving context and might not prioritise India’s concerns. And global politics is but transactional and revolving stakes mean shifting alliances. To that extent, even India’s wins are dictated by its economic potential. So it comes as no surprise that at a meeting of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) — the global watchdog that tracks terror-funding States and can disqualify them from aid by World Bank and global institutions — members expressed satisfaction over Pakistan’s corrective compliances and counter-terrorism efforts. India’s was the lone voice of protest. What is of significance is that Pakistan has been able to convince the US, EU, Australia and even Japan about its efforts to curb terrorism. The change in position seems drastic considering last October, the FATF had found Pakistan wanting in most criteria — it had cleared only six of the 27 parameters — and pushed it dangerously closer to the dark grey and black lists. Now the chances of Pakistan “exiting” the grey list are brighter. This indeed would be a blow to India’s diplomatic lobbying and efforts. The support of China, its all-weather friend and FATF president, Turkey and Malaysia, with which Pakistan aspires to claim leadership of a neo-Islamic world, was but expected. But the US, while endorsing India’s position on Kashmir at the UN, is too invested in stitching up a deal with the Taliban in the final stages before it exits Afghanistan. So it needs Pakistan now. That explains the clean chit in Beijing and even the acknowledgement of Pakistan’s “great efforts” at course correction. The US may also have yielded ground at FATF because freezing aid to Pakistan could aggravate economic instability in the region with a cascading impact on politics. Pakistan has been driving home its arguments on this count with its Minister for Economic Affairs Hammad Azhar lobbying in Beijing over the past few days. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has been appealing to US President Donald Trump in Davos to help the country get off the “grey list.” China, of course, has been the accelerator, certifying Pakistan’s “political will and active efforts.” Not only this, it has been arguing for a renegotiation of the FATF brief itself, saying the grouping had no business to blacklist nations but should help them counter-terrorist funding and networks. India must realise that the shades of the FATF list mean nothing in terms of threat levels ever since the definition of blacklist was diluted as a “call for action” and the grey list was downgraded to “other monitored jurisdictions.”

If indeed Pakistan gets out of the grey list, it can avail international funding and clamber out of a choked economy. The conduits to Kashmir could be red hot again, not that they had stopped completely. And though we would want to believe that the Pakistani economy is stuttering, the fact is Moody’s upgraded its status from negative to stable, the Arab benefactors have sent grants with even Russia meaning to invest in north-south gas pipelines. Global penalties won’t impact Pakistan’s proxy war with India; the Government-military configuration will always keep that on the boil, prioritising it as a strategic interest. Even while staying on the FATF watch, there has been no cessation of terrorist infiltration into Kashmir. A listing won’t change that ground reality. Besides, as Khan’s sustained efforts to raise Kashmir at international fora show, the abrogation of Article 370 has completely taken down the pillar of Pakistan’s domestic and international policy. It certainly wouldn’t want to let go of the anti-India pitch as its bargaining worth. India has to be prepared for every such manoeuvre. At the same time, it has to ensure that there is no change in the international opinion of “Kashmir is a bilateral issue” argument, the pin-pricking offers of mediation by Trump notwithstanding. For this, the Government needs to demonstrate that it is not at war with the Valley and restore civil rights. This would go a long way in assuaging domestic critics in the US and EU, both of which are being pushed uncomfortably on human rights in Kashmir, and may have compulsions to humour the activist lobby as well. India, too, could make some move to demonstrate its seriousness about bilateral talks and seem to practise what it preaches. Our hardening stance would mean that the world will have a relaxed attitude towards our neighbour. In reality, the deterrence for Pakistan has to be our own measured call.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/reprieve-for-pak-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/reprieve-for-pak.html
1,25-1-20,Intern charred to death in medical institute hostel,"A female MBBS pass out from Bihar was charred to death in the hostel room of a private medical institute in Bareilly late Thursday night.

Another medical intern sharing room with her was also injured while trying to rescue her and had to be hospitalised.

Later, the medical institute authorities said that the incident was caused due to a spark in the room heater that sparked a fire.

A case was registered and the body was sent for autopsy. Police are investigating the case.

As per reports, Dr Sukriti Sharma of Patna was an intern at SRMS Institute of Medical Sciences in Bhojipura area of Bareilly. After noticing smoke billowing out of a hostel room, the hostel authorities called the fire brigade.

However, by the time the fire-fighters doused the flame, the entire building was badly burnt and the charred remains of the doctor were found in room number 302.

While Dr Sharma died in the incident, her room mate Ritika suffered serious burns while rescuing her.

While the family of the deceased was intimated about the tragedy, what caused the fire and the death of Dr Sharma is yet to be ascertained. Preliminary investigation suggested that a spark in the room heater triggered the fire.

Speaking to reporters, SRMS Institute of Medical Sciences’ principal Dr SB Gupta said, “There was a room heater in hostel room of Sukirti which might have caused the fire. When smoke was spotted from the room, college authorities were informed, who in turn informed fire brigade and police. But by the time the fire was doused, the doctor had died.”

Soon after the incident, senior police officials including SP (Rural) Dr Sansar Singh reached the spot and a forensic team was pressed into service for investigation.

Meanwhile in Bhadohi, an 18 year-old newly-wed woman was kept hostage and raped for five days by a neighbour, identified as Vishal Saroj. Saroj had come to the house of the woman’s in-laws’ five days ago and taken her away on the pretext that the mother of the newly-wed was ill. Only on Wednesday, when the in-laws went to enquire about the health of the victim’s mother that they realised that the woman had not reached her home. Later, they informed the police after which she was rescued from a room situated in an agricultural field owned by Saroj on Thursday.

A case was registered, the accused was arrested and the woman was sent for medical examination.

Meanwhile in Jaunpur, three unidentified persons were booked for threatening a foreign couple in Barsathi area on Thursday.

SP of Jaunpur, Ashok Kumar, said that Timothy and his wife Dugga had come from Germany and were on way to Rishikesh from Varanasi in a car on January 16. As they reached Saraivikram railway crossing in Suhklalganj, three unidentified persons bullied them. Upon resistance, the miscreants beat up Timothy and when the car driver tried to speed away, they broke the window pane of the car with bricks.

The SP said that the couple somehow managed to escape and complained to Madiyahun police station after which a case was registered.

The police are identifying the bullies and claimed that they would be arrested soon.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/intern-charred-to-death-in-medical-institute-hostel.html
2,25-1-20,Akhilesh lashes out at Ganga Yatra “Waste of tax payers’ money”,"Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav lashed out at the Ganga Yatra organised by Uttar Pradesh government, terming it as an “extravaganza” aimed at diverting public attention from pressing issues like economic slowdown, unemployment and resentment among masses against Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

“What is the rationale of Ganga Yatra? It’s nothing but waste of tax payers’ money to serve the narrow political agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party,” Akhilesh said while addressing party workers on the occasion of the birth anniversary of former Bihar CM Karpoori Thakur in Lucknow on Friday.

The SP chief said that the Ganga river could never be cleaned unless its tributaries were cleaned.

“Under the Centre’s Namami Gange Project, several thousand crore rupees have been spent so far but the results are yet to be visible to the masses. The project remains a drama being staged for furthering the narrow political agenda of the BJP,” he alleged.

Akhilesh also targeted senior BJP leaders over the new citizenship law issue.

“The language used by BJP leaders has touched a new low during public discourse. Right from Union Home minister Amit Shah to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath are vying to speak in intemperate language to provoke the people. One leader said “danke ki chot”, the chief minister is talking of taking revenge from anti- CAA protesters while others have warned that anti-CAA protesters will be buried alive,” Akhilesh said.

The SP chief said that the decline in language and idiom of public discourse was indeed a matter of deep concern.

Reiterating his demand for a caste-based census, Akhilesh said, “Even after three decades of implementation of Mandal Commission for the reservation to Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in government jobs and educational institutions, the deprived sections are yet to get their due in power structure.”

“Caste-based census for enumerating the actual share of the OBCs in India is the lasting solution for communalism in Indian politics. This census will settle the share of each caste in power structure and will be a lasting solution of communalism,” he opined.

Akhilesh also asked party cadre to hit the ground for 2022 UP Assembly elections. He said that the party could be strengthened only with focused attention at polling booths to ensure the return of Samajwadi Party to power in 2022.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/akhilesh-lashes-out-at-ganga-yatra----waste-of-tax-payers----money---.html
3,25-1-20,"BSP, Cong flay move to introduce CAA in LU syllabus","



|

Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress flayed the government’s move to introduce Citizen (Amendment) Act in college syllabus to highlight its positive aspects.

Besides other law courses run by state-run universities, the course on the new citizen law is likely to be introduced in political science department of Lucknow University.

BSP chief Mayawati was the first who expressed her displeasure over the planned introduction of the ‘positives’ of the CAA in university curriculum and tweeted on Friday, “The CAA debate etc. is fine, but despite proceedings in the court, the inclusion of this controversial and divisive citizenship law by Lucknow University in the syllabus is completely wrong and inappropriate. The BSP strongly opposes this and will certainly take it back when it comes to power in UP.”

Taking on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party regimes at the Centre and in UP, Congress leader in Legislative Council, Deepak Singh, charged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, besides other BJP CMs, were saffronising educational institutions at the behest of Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh.

“After appointing RSS functionaries as vice-chancellor or on other key posts of universities, the BJP is introducing courses either to divide the society on communal lines or to distort historical facts,” Singh asserted.

The Congress leader said that his party would definitely oppose the introduction of the CAA in the syllabus.

As per reports, Lucknow University authorities plan to hold a debate on the new citizenship law in February. Following the debate by the political science department, a proposal will be sent for the inclusion of positive aspects of the CAA in syllabus.

Head of LU political science department Shashi Shukla tried to clarify the issue.

Speaking to a news agency, she reasoned that the move was needed to clarify the CAA.

“There is a proposal for a paper under the subject’s contemporary issue in Indian politics and including the CAA in it is under consideration. We will include it in the syllabus and put it on the board as a proposal. If passed, it will be sent to the academic council and once cleared, it will be taught in classes,” she said.

The BJP government has drawn flak from citizens across India against the CAA that fast-tracks citizenship for non-Muslim immigrants from neighbouring Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

While the government claimed that the law was necessary to provide relief to thousands of people fleeing religious persecution in those countries, opponents contended that the law purposely left out Muslims and did not provide relief to those fleeing similar persecution in neighbouring Sri Lanka and Myanmar.

In recent past, there have been violent protests against the CAA in several cities of UP and prohibitory orders were put in place for days to quell protests in December.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bsp--cong-flay-move-to-introduce-caa-in-lu-syllabus.html
4,25-1-20,"Over 30 campsites developed, executed in MP","Over 30 campsites were developed and executed in different districts of Madhya Pradesh. Tourist from all over the country are coming for camping in Madhya Pradesh to feel the nature and enjoy the “Adventure activities” such as jungle Morning/Night trek, Mountain climbing, tractor ride, water sports activities and many more apart from these “adventure activities”. Tourists are very much enjoying Camping, Team Games, Live Music, Music with Bonfire, Dance, Open Sumo Ride, Archery, Kabaddi, Tree Plantation, Tug of War, Cleanliness Drive and many more.

Madhya Pradesh—the heart of Incredible India— is also known for its cultural and heritage destinations across the country and now Madhya Pradesh Tourism Board is transforming it into an adventure hub. With the concept to promote a camping culture across the State, the tourism board is continuously working to attract adventure investors, operators, and of course, the tourists.

The MP Tourism Board started in 2018 and tackled the new realm of adventure in the State. They strived to focus on some of the unique camping and adventure arrangements in the State to make this mission a success.

Under this project, 40 campsites will be created this year. Along with it, around 200 local people have been employed and over this period of time, more than 4,000 tourists booked these camping and adventure activities across Madhya Pradesh.

With a lot of rigorous planning as well as execution, the tourism board has increased the adventure manifolds in Madhya Pradesh.

Mostly focusing on the youth and families, it has been pretty successful by bringing them closer to nature through unique camping sites and activities like waterfall treks, wildlife safari, jungle walks, and many more. Apart from these, 12 new excursion routes were created along the National Highway for organising biking and cycling tours. There have also been several successful events organised like Adventure Next, Omkareshwar Festival, Cycling Tours, etc.

These not only attracted locals and Indian tourists but also fascinated the foreigners.

Managing Director of Madhya Pradesh Tourism Board, Faiz Ahmed Kidwai told, “Currently we have set up 30 Adventure Campsites in MP and we are planning to set-up around 100 adventure campsites, so that everyone can come and experience the great outdoors of MP which has for so long being hidden from the eyes of the adventure lovers. As Madhya Pradesh has received the best adventure State award for two consecutive years from Ministry of tourism”

Tourist visited the campsite says, “I think Madhya Pradesh has a lot of potential for tourism due to its admirable scenic beauty. Along with it, the state has come a long way through the adventure activities. I am happy that this entire mission has spread awareness about getting close to nature and it has been thriving and loved by all visiting here. It is a great achievement that Madhya Pradesh is now not only getting its tourism due to its heritage and cultural importance but because of the adventurous and thrilling options too.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/over-30-campsites-developed--executed-in-mp.html

6,25-1-20,‘Iqbal Maidan’ continues to play home to voices of dissent on CAA and NRC,"The historical Iqbal Maidan in Madhya Pradesh’s Capital continues to play home to voices of dissent on CAA and NRC for over a month now.

Starting from December 10, different civil society groups are persisting with the protests at Iqbal Maidan, in the heart of cramped Old city. To sharpen their protest further the co-ordination committee leading the protest has decided to observe weeklong event as part of 'NRC-CAA Virodh Pratishodh Saptah'. The events started from Jan 23 (birthday of Subhash Chandra Bose) and would culminate on Gandhi Janyanti on Jan 30.

On January 30, the coordination committee is planning a massive protest event at Iqbal Maidan.

Prominent among those who have confirmed their participation include Aishe Ghosh, the JNU Student Union president who has become the face of dissent in New Delhi especially after the violent attack on students and faculty members at the Jawaharlal Nehru University recently. Senior journalist and a staunch CAA-NRC critic Arfa Khanum too has promised to attend the protest on Jan 30, said Sikandar Iqbal one of the young media co-ordinators at Iqbal Maidan.

Besides, the organisers are in touch with Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar, actor and host Sushant Singh, film actor Zeeshan Ayyub and others for being part of the event.

We are persisting with daily events like blood donation, poetic convention, sessions with lawyers, eminent social workers and others, Sikandar claimed.

On the presence of donation box at the protest site, Sikandar claimed that monetary help from the public is helping them manage the expenses incurred on the protest site.

Pointing towards a group of Muslim women engrossed in panel discussion on NRC-CAA and NPR at the site, one of the organisers, Seema Kurup, head of MP Democratic Rights Front said, “These household women are from Gandhinagar and are being informed about details of these contentious legislations.” A youth group is also taking care of social media

8,25-1-20,Citizen Mukherjee,"The former President renews hope for democracy by encouraging civil society protesters

Citizen Pranab Mukherjee has as usual listened to the voice of his conscience and restored faith in our democratic renewal as a nation. So on a day that India slipped 10 ranks in the 2019 Democracy Index to the 51st position, its lowest since 2006, the former President came out strongly in favour of peaceful protests across the country, emphasising that they would keep the institution alive and well. Stressing that the present wave of civil society campaigns would deepen the nation’s democratic roots, Mukherjee took a veiled dig at the Government and said that Indian democracy had been tested time and again but had come through regardless. Coming from Mukherjee, who has been feted as a Bharat Ratna by the Modi regime and who was even invited by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to address its session, it shows his public morality would not be beholden to political trade-offs. Of course, even as President, he didn’t mince words, decrying cow vigilantism, lynchings and curbs on free speech. The significance of his nomenclature as “Citizen Mukherjee” was not lost on anyone, particularly at a time when the BJP Governments at the Centre and in Uttar Pradesh (UP) had been facing flak for their autocratic ways in executing power. Though he did not make an all-out statement in favour of the anti-CAA protests, his comments were seen as an indirect validation of the protesters — especially the students who have borne the brunt of the establishment’s wrath — and a much-needed salve on the bruised spirit of the nation.

Meanwhile, the protests against the Act, that is largely seen as divisive, discriminatory and unconstitutional, continue unabated and have acquired a momentum of their own, forcing politicians to follow them for a change. The social spectrum widens every day. Right from Bollywood actors like Deepika Padukone and former Lieutenant Governor of Delhi Najeeb Jung to students’ organisations, lawyers, doctors, academicians, housewives, the Mayor of Maharashtra’s Malegaon Municipal Corporation, Dalits and the Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, a representative cross-section has joined the cause. By lending weight to a people’s movement, Mukherjee has encouraged us into demanding answers. All things considered, these protests now show that the arrogance of the Government of the day has boomeranged on itself and powers that be don’t quite know how to handle such spontaneous combustion.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/citizen-mukherjee-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/citizen-mukherjee.html
9,25-1-20,Build a knowledge society,"The FM will have to juggle between inclusivity and resource augmentation. Hopefully, one day, we would deliver on allocating six per cent of the GDP to education, first made in 1968

Each year, as soon as the ceremonial halwa is served in the North Block and Finance Ministry officials are locked in, the entire nation starts asking a question which is embossed on the home page of the Press Information Bureau’s (PIB) website — what’s in it for me? Clicking the youth icon on the portal leads to a dialogue box which identifies five new initiatives under the hashtag #BudgetForNewIndia. These include the New Education Policy (NEP), National Research Foundation (NRF), the ‘Study in India’ programme, Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) and National Sports Education Board (NSEB) under the Khelo India scheme. The fact that each of these proposals can radically transform the education sector makes the forthcoming Union Budget a particularly interesting one. And, for the same reason, there is anxiety too. Moreover, some of the trends in the previous Budget outlays have added to apprehensions. Between 2017-18 and 2019-20, the share of IITs declined from Rs 8,337 crore to Rs 6,223 crore. The University Grants Commission (UGC), IIMs (Indian Institutes of Management) and the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) have registered funds cuts too. Should we be worried?

Let us begin by acknowledging that the mechanism through which the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) arrived at some of these schemes was elaborate, inclusive and certainly not hurried. Before the release of the NEP draft, the MHRD initiated a nationwide multi-strata debate around 20 themes each for school and higher education. Moreover, the document is refreshingly candid, forthright and does not shy away from asking provocative questions. For example, in the context of State universities, it admits to problems such as excessive politicisation and deteriorating research standards. Further, a number of recurring features across the NEP draft, themes for policy consultation and the NITI Aayog’s Strategy for New India (SNI) suggest clear thinking on the part of the Government. Training schools for teachers, recruitment and retention of faculty with research aptitude, industry linkage and so on are common to all three documents.

Similarly, there is an admission that State spending, both by the Central and State Governments, must be significantly enhanced. The NEP draft proposes an incremental increase in public spending on education at the rate of one per cent per year till it reaches 20 per cent of the total expenditure. But, in a country where educational infrastructure is yet to stabilise with respect to its demographic size and diversity, challenges are multi-pronged. Increasing the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education to 35 per cent by 2022-23; establishing new institutes; augmenting existing infrastructure and making Indian universities globally competitive are some of the major concerns. It is perhaps for these reasons that the Government is mulling public-private partnership in higher education and loan-based credit for expansion of facilities. The establishment of a Higher Education Financing Agency (HEFA), a joint venture between the MHRD and Canara Bank, is a step in this direction. The HEFA intends to leverage funds from the market and extend low interest loans to universities for R&D.

However, repayment of loans, even if stretched over a decade and offered interest-free, could prove an uphill task for most universities. If initiatives such as ‘Study in India’ were to succeed and India were to transform into a knowledge economy, one would expect a substantial rise in revenue generation through tuition fee. However, this will entail generous endowments for creation of world-class infrastructure and a gestation period of some years for return on investment. But according to the MHRD’s own documents, it is not fair to expect that higher education institutions will meet operational costs through student fee alone. Global trends suggest that robust infrastructure develops in countries with healthy state support. Moreover, in these countries, state support is matched by an equally generous grant from non-state stakeholders. These include corporate philanthropists and alumni. But these are either knowledge economies like Australia and South Africa or societies like the UK, the USA and Germany that take immense pride in the international stature of their educational institutions.

It should be registered with a certain degree of alarm that even though individual philanthropy is on the rise, the overall figures do not appear very encouraging for India. According to Bain and Co’s India Philanthropy Report, 2019, contributions of Rs 10 crore and above, which constitute nearly 55 per cent of the entire volume of individual philanthropy, have registered a decline of four per cent since 2014. This is both surprising and sad as the number of Ultra-High Net Worth Individuals (UHNWIs) has grown by 12 per cent over the same period. Further, the fact that Azim Premji alone accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the aforementioned 55 per cent, goes to show that the idea of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is yet to take roots in India’s corporate culture. Similarly, alumni support is too variegated to be factored in as a stable component in financial overhaul. While top professional institutions like the IITs and IIMs manage to raise huge funds through their alumni, the same may not be true of NITs and other management institutes, let alone universities specialising in humanities and social sciences. The sincerest of efforts at alumni outreach at India’s top-ranked colleges yield at most an annual alumni meet and an abysmal donation through membership subscription. Even with proactive placement cells and the best of faculty, strictly in market terms, a student with a degree in literature cannot be scaled at par with one with a degree from IIT. Understandably, their ability to pay back to the institution is considerably lower than that of an average IITian. But the picture isn’t entirely bleak. Government-aided business incubators, established at degree colleges and universities across India, have been moderately successful. If properly nourished, successful business models can provide the host institution with both direct revenue and potential alumni-philanthropists. But at the initial stages this, too, shall entail generous risk-free endowments.

At a time when we speak of unburdening our students and allowing them the freedom to explore a career of their aptitude, it is not advisable to link every academic activity with industrial output. To quote Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, universities are not supposed to function like assembly line manufacturing units. While we need capital to run a country, cultural capital is equally important for the well-being of a society. Promotion of science and industry might take the centrestage but endeavours to preserve our history, culture, modern Indian languages and classical languages shouldn’t lag too far behind. Global trends suggest that while departments of Indology are getting progressively replaced by South Asian Studies, China is strengthening its soft power by financing departments of Chinese studies. It is now up to the Indian universities to open centres of excellence where classical cultures of the country may be taught and translated. Unless UHNWIs come forward and fund a project similar to Narayan Murthy’s Harvard-based Murty Classical Library, the onus of endowments would be on the Government.

As per reports compiled by NASSCOM and PurpleLeap, both of which are cited in the MHRD document, only 25 per cent of India’s engineering graduates are employable. Even interventional training fails to brighten their prospects. Opening more technical institutions without emphasis on quality would only create a national backlog of technocrats with a sense of entitlement and huge education loans to pay forward. As is promised in the NEP draft and SNI, serious efforts must be made to improve teaching standards in India. This alone will solve many of the problems that afflict the education sector as only inspired teachers can churn out a globally-competitive workforce. Teachers should be encouraged and empowered to undertake research and writings. At the same time, NRF should not end as another bureaucratic superstructure with every power to stall projects and no resource to leverage.

Undoubtedly, the Finance Minister will tread a tightrope, juggling between inclusivity and resource augmentation. Hopefully, some day, we would deliver on our national commitment of devoting six per cent of the GDP to education, first envisaged in 1968.

10,25-1-20,India needs Palkhivala now,"The legal luminary didn’t hesitate to call a spade a spade and point out to the most authoritarian ruler the folly of tinkering with the Constitution

January marked the birth centenary of Nani A Palkhivala, the most respected legal luminary the country has ever had the privilege to call its own. This is a time when India — divided vertically over contentious issues like the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) — misses the guidance and scholarly presence of a person like Palkhivala, who was considered the last word on the Constitution of India. He never hesitated in calling a spade a spade and pointing out to the most authoritarian ruler of our times the folly of tinkering with the Constitution.

One can only look back at Palkhivala with awe and adoration for the bravery with which he opposed the move of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to tamper with the Constitution by bringing in the most unwanted Amendment of our times, the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976. With most Members of Parliament (MPs) belonging to the Opposition, in jail, under the dreaded Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA), there was none to raise a voice against the then Prime Minister, whose only interest was to save her job. She had appointed a committee of “yes men” under Swaran Singh, the then Minister for External Affairs, to bring in revolutionary changes in the Constitution and ensure the Gandhi clan’s hold over the Government and the Congress party.

The Swaran Singh Committee’s remedy or antidote to counter the “onslaught” by the Opposition was to incorporate the terms “secular” and “socialist” and add “integrity” to the word “unity” in the Preamble of the Constitution. In a scathing article in the July 4, 1976 issue of The Illustrated Weekly of India (now defunct), Palkhivala warned: “Our Constitution has an extraordinarily forceful and meaningful Preamble which reflects the pledge contained in the Objective Resolution of 1946 to guarantee basic human rights; we, the people of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a Sovereign Democratic Republic and to secure to all its citizens: Justice, social, economic and political; liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship; equality of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity of the nation; in our Constituent Assembly this twenty-sixth day of November 1949, do hereby adopt, enact and give to ourselves this Constitution.”

The Swaran Singh Committee wanted that in place of the expression, “Sovereign Democratic Republic” we should substitute the words “Sovereign Democratic Secular Socialist Republic”, and that the word “integrity” should be inserted after “unity.”

Palkhivala opined that this proposal was “singularly ill-conceived.” He cited four reasons why such a change should not be made in the Constitution of the country. “What follows or is annexed to the Preamble is the Constitution. The Preamble is a part of the Constitution Statute, but it is not a part of the Constitution. Article 368 deals only with an amendment of ‘this Constitution’ but not of the Constitution Statute. Therefore the Preamble cannot be amended under Article 368. Moreover, the Preamble, from its very nature and content, is incapable of being amended. It refers to the most momentous event in India’s history and sets out, as a matter of historical fact, what the people of India resolved in 1949 to do for their unfolding future. No Parliament can amend or alter the historical past,” said Palkhivala in the article, which was published during the peak days of Emergency.

He also said that the insertion of the word “socialist” would, instead of clarifying the basic structure of the Constitution, merely make it dangerously ambiguous. Palkhivala, a brilliant legal mind, deciphered the meaninglessness of the term Socialist Democracy, which he likened to “boiling ice” because it was precisely this democracy that the dragon of socialism was about to devour. The legal wizard was of the view that the words “secular” and “integrity” could add nothing to the content of the Preamble.

“Anyone, who has a sense of rhythm and style, would know that the beauty of the Preamble, which is distinguished by economy of words, would be marred by the insertion of the three words, all of which are unnecessary and one of which is misleadingly equivocal,” he stated.

The greatest lawyer of our times signed off the article with the words: “We, the people of India, made our choice in 1949. Twenty-seven years later, we are invited to make the other choice.” Well, Palkhivala, might be having a hearty laugh every time we read the Preamble of the Constitution today. While we assert that “in our constituent Assembly this twenty-sixth day of November 1949, do hereby adopt, enact and give to ourselves this Constitution”, the terms “Socialist”, “Secular” and “Integrity” were incorporated only in November 1976.

11,25-1-20,2019 forest report a mixed bag,"While the mandarins at the policy-making level have much to rejoice as the report vindicates the hard work put in by foresters in States, the new parameters are food for thought for foresters and planners alike

The Forest Survey of India (FSI) had recently released its biennial State of Forest Report, 2019 and civil society is busy in analysing it. The FSI’s reports are eagerly awaited by the Centre as they apprise the Union Government of the impact of its policies and an increase in forest and tree cover is a huge political gain. However, more often than not, the political masters are unwilling to acknowledge adverse impacts. Thankfully, the current assessment has shown an increase of 5,188 sq km of forest and tree cover (3,976 sq km of forest and 1,212 sq km of tree cover outside recorded forests). The total forest and tree cover in the country is 80.7 million ha (Mha) which corresponds to 24.56 per cent of the country’s geographic area. The carbon stock is assessed at 7,124.6 million tonnes, an increase of 42.6 million tonnes compared to the 2017 assessment. For accuracy, the growing stock assessment was done with higher sampling intensity and uniformly-spread sample plots.

For the first time since 1985, this year’s FSI report has provided enhanced information by adding more parameters. As around 32 Mha of forests are intimately linked to the livelihood of people living in 170,000 forest fringe villages, the FSI had calculated the dependency of people in each State for fuel wood, fodder, bamboo and small timber. The report gives State-wise details of removal of these items and per capita consumption. This is pertinent information for assessing the contribution of forests to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and also for infusion of financial and technical resources for the management of forests, as a big chunk are not in a good shape. The ground-level information on changes in biodiversity and hydrology is key to combatting climate change and in this year’s report the biodiversity and wetlands in 16 forest types have been assessed, which will assist foresters in planning management strategies.

The report provides details of five Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) for each State, which reflects the contribution of this segment in the livelihood of rural and tribal belts. Most of the NTFP-producing trees and shrubs are under threat of overexploitation and poor regeneration. The planners, forest, tribal and rural development ministries must have a look at these statistics and plan their regeneration and efficient management accordingly.

The study also highlights forests occurring in different slopes, which are an indicator of the stability of the forest ecosystem. The report also reveals the threat of invasive species due to anthropological and climatic reasons, in each State.

It is well-known that around 28 per cent of the recorded forests (76.74 Mha) are without trees and comprise snow-covered mountains, glaciers, desert and inaccessible treeless rocky areas above the tree line. These areas are critical for our ecological and economical lifeline and are a continuous source of water for our rivers, agriculture and forest biodiversity. They must be integrated within the overall forest ecosystems though they may not technically qualify as forests. If we add this 21 Mha to the 80 Mha forest and tree cover, then the ecological life-sustaining system comes to around 101 Mha. Planners, therefore, need to spend at least a certain per cent of our GDP on this land’s stability.

The 71.22 Mha of forest cover includes around 20 Mha of the tree/forests having areas over more than one ha outside recorded forest areas. The areas less than one ha (around 9.5 mha) outside recorded forests are clubbed separately, which brings us to the figure of 80.7 Mha of total tree and forest cover and thus 24.56 per cent of the land mass.

The report, however, gives a dismal picture of forests in tribal districts, showing a decrease of forest cover to the tune of 741 sq km. The livelihood of tribals is dependent on forests and adequate steps must be taken for the productive management of land vested under the Forest Rights Act. Either the areas have been cleared of tree growth due to encroachments or the land use has changed in these forests. Another area of concern is that a large chunk of forests (30 Mha) are in the open category.

The report also gives a scary picture of the growing stock which shows extremely poor count of mature trees. Yet another worrying feature is that 36 per cent of the forests area is fire-prone. The North-east, central India and Himalayan forests are losing rich bio-diversity due to forest fires, which must be curbed.

While the mandarins at the policy-making level have much to rejoice as the report vindicates the hard work put in by foresters in States, the new parameters in the report are food for thought for foresters and planners alike to use the information for fine-tuning forest governance.

The report highlights that all is not well scientifically with our forest ecosystems and needs infusion of policy, institutional and technological inputs with a pragmatic forward-looking approach to forest management. The State Governments must see the tables for their areas and draw strategies for sustainable management of the forests. Unless this is done, the euphoria of increase in forest cover will be over in a few years.

The FSI had done a commendable job and the way this organisation’s responsibilities are increasing, it needs substantial enhancement in manpower and technology so that it meets its ever-increasing mandate — like the recent Supreme Court order on survey of illegal occupation of forest land. It is time its functioning is reviewed and the post of DG FSI and its regional centres need to be upgraded to attract and retain highly qualified professionals.

The organisation should be upgraded to the level of an attached office under the Ministry so that it can give executive directions required for better coordination with States in the implementation of the policies laid down by the Ministry. We owe this to our forests.

12,25-1-20,CM Yogi lays stone of 18 Atal residential schools,"Laying the foundation of 18 Atal Awasiya Vidyalayas (Atal residential schools) for the children of daily wagers on UP Diwas, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that by providing education and skill to underprivileged children, the government aimed at grooming good citizens and ensuring that government schemes reached the last man in society.

The schools are being opened in 18 divisions of UP.

Emphasising that it was a day of great pride for the state, Yogi said that it provided a chance to assess the journey of UP in the last seventy years.

The chief minister was speaking at a function held for the third UP Diwas celebrations at Awadh Shilp Gram on Friday.

On the occasion, Governor Anandiben Patel and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also felicitated sports persons and industrialists from UP for making a mark for the state on the national and global stage.

“Industrialists who have been felicitated have invested in Uttar Pradesh and thus changed the perception of the state and also generated employment for the youth. At the same time, the state government is committed towards sports persons and plans to give Rs 6 crore to Olympic gold medalists, Rs 4 crore to silver medalists and Rs 2 crore to bronze medalists,” Yogi said.

Explaining the concept of Atal Awasiya Vidyalala, the chief minister said, “These schools will be run on the lines of Navodaya Vidyalayas and wards of registered labourers would be provided free education, fooding and lodging. Good students will be encouraged for academics while those good at sports will be specifically trained and others will be made self-dependent through skill development,” Yogi said.

The chief minister said that these schools would also reach out to orphans and other underprivileged children and they would be looked after by the state government.

“When UP was notified as a state in 1950, no one would have imagined that it would be the largest base of Indian democracy and give the country the maximum number of prime ministers,” the chief minister said.

“The Ganga traverses the maximum distance across UP and Prayagraj has the confluence of Ganga and Yamuna. UP is also the birthplace of Lord Ram, Lord Krishna, Lord Buddha and Tirthankaras,” Yogi said.

Referring to the success of Kumbh Mela last year, the chief minister said that no less than 24 crore people — more than the population of the state — visited the mega event.

“During the three-day UP Diwas celebrations, cultural artistes, artisans of traditional crafts and those contributing to Swachhata Mission will be felicitated,” Yogi said.

In her address, Governor Anandiben Patel said that people would remember the glorious past of UP — the land of Rama, Krishna and Buddha — during the UP Diwas celebrations.

Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma said that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had set a record of sorts by organising Ayodhya Deepotsav, Krishna Janmotsav and through various expressways.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-yogi-lays-stone-of-18-atal-residential-schools.html

15,25-1-20,‘Nath Govt targeting BJP leaders on pretext of anit-mafia campaign’,"Accusing Kamal Nath Government of targeting BJP leaders on the pretext of anti-mafia drive in the State, BJP protested across the State on Friday while the Congress hit back saying the action would now be resumed in towns.

Former Chief Minister and vice president of the State unit of BJP, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, alleged that to mislead people from real issues, the Kamal Nath Government in Madhya Pradesh is coming up with new agendas.

It has come up with innovative idea of fighting against mafia. To deal with the adulteration, a new action plan ‘Shuddh Ke Liye Yuddh’ was brought. But it was limited only upto taking money from the shopkeepers after collecting samples of eatables and edibles.

He was addressing a gathering here on Friday, while demonstrating against the State Government at the district Collector office.

“I want to ask from Chief Minister Kamal Nath, as who is mafia in the State and what action has been taken against them. Provide list of such persons,” he asked.

Chouhan alleged that the State Government was targeting the BJP leaders and workers in the name of taking action against mafia and the encroachment.

Meanwhile, senior BJP leaders protested at district headquarters alleging partisan and mala fide action on the pretext of anti-mafia drive in Madhya Pradesh. After the protests, senior leaders and party workers courted arrest in districts.

Party State president, Rakesh Singh, ex-Speaker of Lok Sabha, Sumitra Mahajan, and others, courted arrest in Indore.

Earlier, addressing the party workers, Singh said they had heard about different kinds of terrors but never did they know about State-sponsored intimidation as witnessed in Madhya Pradesh. Kamal Nath Government has spelt administrative terror on the pretext of anti-mafia drive but the BJP leaders and workers won’t feel intimidated, affirmed the BJP state president.

Former Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan on the occasion said she hasn’t seen such political vendetta in her life. Commoners and BJP workers are being harassed on the pretext of anti-mafia action, alleged Mahajan.

BJP on Thursday had threatened to prepare own list of mafias saying the list would be handed to CM Kamal Nath for action.

Meanwhile, Congress has also chalked out a strategy to counter BJP campaign and ministers are being instructed to hold press briefings in districts to clear the air on anti-mafia drive.

Public Relations minister PC Sharma talking to media persons in Bhopal alleged that 11 types of mafia activities have flourished in 15 years BJP rule in the state. These are – land mafia, extortion, liquor, drug, adulteration, chit fund, land grab, blackmail, mining, transport and co-operative sector mafia.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---nath-govt-targeting-bjp-leaders-on-pretext-of-anit-mafia-campaign---.html

17,25-1-20,‘Political horse trading never happens in Australia',"Freethought Party of India (FPI) president Dr Bijayananda Kar said India has to learn a lot from Australia as far as its political system is concerned.

Kar, who had been to Australia for over a month, came back to India on January 15. On Tuesday (January 21st) Dr Kar gave a talk on the theme of “Socio-Political Life in Australia and India: A Comparative Picture”. Madam Swapna Bijayini, co-founder of AMOFOI, presided.

Dr Kar in the presence of other guests, namely, former MLA Sarat Chandra Mishra, Madhusudan Yadav from BSP, former Engineer Sanak Kumar Mohanty and FPI general secretary B Ramchandra CST Voltaire released the AMOFOI – FPI calendar for the year 2020.

While speaking on the topic, Dr Kar mentioned that Australia, which is more than twice the size of India is a much advanced country. Its population is 2.5 crore whereas the population of India is 138 crore. Freethinkers, that is, who don’t belong to any religious group constitute more than 30 percent of the total population of Australia. In case of India we don’t have such a figure, Dr Kar added.

Both India and Australia are federal polities having the British model of Parliamentary democracy. But in case of India, there is always the nuisance of political horse-trading (Buying of MLAs or MPs) . In case of Australia no member of the legislature is there for sale. Thus ethically, Australia is much ahead of India, told Kar.

In Australia unlike the case in India which is very much caste-ridden, young men and women marry on their own, marry out of love, not under the duress of their parents. The traffic rules and road conditions are far better than that of India. Roads are wide and they cut at right angles. Vehicles ply on the road without causing any noise pollution,

he said.

Dr Kar took questions and answered them and opined that India must learn a lot from Australia for the good of its citizens.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---political-horse-trading-never-happens-in-australia-.html

19,25-1-20,"This R-Day, think more of duties than of rights","On the eve of the 71st Republic Day, the national memory is painted with abrogation of Article 370, the CAA stir, the phobia and uncertainties over NPR and NRC, conundrum and unrest in premier educational hubs like JNU and Jamia Milia Islamia. Amid all these moves in the dance of democracy, most of it has been about the concerns over the rights of one or other community or group. But the devil’s advocate would argue about adhering to the ‘duties regime’ more than ‘rights regime’.

This point needs to be scored with respect to the individual rights and community interest and the fundamental duties we have, as the citizens of this great nation. The concept of duties is not alien to India. The ‘idea of India’ through the ages had laid greater emphasis on duties rather than on the rights of citizens. Even so the framers of the Indian constitution did not think it necessary to incorporate the fundamental duties specifically in the constitution.

The fundamental duties were introduced later, through the 42nd Amendment Act 1976, on the recommendations of the Swaran Singh Committee to review the working of the Indian Constitution during the period of national emergency. Such moral duties have been an intrinsic part of the Indian ethos over the ages and have been embodied as the fundamental duties of the citizens under Article 51A of the constitution. It enlists eleven fundamental duties, which are by and large non-justiciable. But our Supreme Court by innovative interpretation, have made certain duties partly justiciable.

Even before the Fundamental Duties were incorporated in our constitution the Supreme Court had observed that the concept of duties is implicit in our constitution. In Chandra Bhavan Boarding and lodging, Bangalore v. State of Mysore (1969) 3 SCC 84, Justice Hegde, while holding that the freedom of trade does not mean freedom to exploit, observed that, “It is a fallacy to think that under our constitution there are only rights and no duties. .....The provisions of Part IV enable the legislatures and the Government to impose various duties on the citizens. The provisions therein are deliberately made elastic because the duties to be imposed on the citizens depend on the extent to which the directive principles are implemented.” Besides, in MC Mehta v. Union of India (1988) 1 SCC 471, Justice Venkataramiah, held that, there was a duty cast upon the Government to issue directions consistently with article 51-A.

In Mohan Kumar Singhania v. Union of India (1992), Justice Ratnavel Pandian held that the fundamental duties serve as an external aid to statute interpretation.

According to the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution, ‘Consultation Paper on the effectuation of fundamental duties’, “When the working of part IV-A of the constitution, consisting of the sole article 51-A, which enumerates eleven fundamental duties, is taken up for review, certain fundamental questions are bound to arise. The most crucial of which is whether the said article has served its intended purpose and if not, where have the people who worked the provision defaulted in the discharge of their democratic duties of citizenship? There can be no two opinions about the need for the retention of the article in the constitution and equally there can be no dispute on the fact that article has remained merely a provision on paper.”

However, the biggest obstacle has been a very poor public awareness about duties. The Justice Verma Committee has pointed out that more than 99 percent of the Indian citizens do not even know about the existence of the article or provision in the constitution.

The concept of ‘duties’ is universal. Article 29(1) of ‘The Universal Declaration of Human Rights’, 1948, (UDHR) declares that, ‘‘everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible’’. At present there are more than 35 nations that have constitutions which contain specific provisions on fundamental duties. These include Japan, Greece, Cyprus, Sri Lanka etc. Even so, there exist significant differences among such countries on the notion of ‘citizenship duties’ depending largely upon the constitutional philosophy of the concerned State.

Chapter II of the 1982 Chinese Constitution makes it amply clear that performance of the duties is a precondition for the enjoyment of the rights. Article 33(3) of the Chinese Constitution reads, “Every citizen enjoys the rights and at the same time must perform the duties prescribed by the constitution and the law”. It enjoins the citizens with an interesting set of duties such as to maintain state secrets, to protect public property, to respect social ethics, to pay taxes, to receive education, to practice family planning and to protect the motherland.

In constitutions of Greece and Cyprus, duty has been cast upon the citizen to exercise his/her right to franchise, founded on the doctrine of compulsory voting. According to this system, a failure to exercise the right to vote is an offence punishable by law. Under Article 31 of the constitution of Cyprus, “every citizen has subject to the provisions of this constitution and any electoral law, the right to vote in any election held under this constitution or any such law”. In 1979, the Cyprus parliament, in exercise of its power under article 31 amended the electoral law, making the failure to vote a punishable offence.

The discharge of duties towards the nation and society should be precursor to enjoyment of rights, this is not a moral rhetoric but essential to take national development on upsurge. Development economics shall never preclude diligent discharge of duties and a justiciable regime of fundamental duties. On this Republic Day, let us begin to take this aspect of the constitution with the seriousness it deserves.

46,25-1-20,JJP seeks explanation from MLA who criticised Dushyant,"Almost a month after senior Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) leader and MLA from Narnaund Ram Kumar Gautam took on senior party leader and Haryana Deputy CM Dushyant Chautala for keeping 11 portfolios in the BJP-JJP coalition Government, the JJP on Thursday sought an explanation from the veteran politician.

JJP has given Gautam 15 days to explain his remarks against Dushyant Talking to The Pioneer, JJP State President Nishan Singh said that the party on Wednesday sought an explanation from Gautam and asked him to submit his reply within 15 days for passing “negative comments” regarding the party leadership. He has been asked to reply over his statements that has damaged the party.

When contacted, Gautam said. “I have received a letter from the party at my residence. I was not present when the letter was received. I was informed by staff about the questions asked by the party in the letter. I will study the letter and send the reply to the party soon.” Downplaying any rift at this juncture, Gautam said,” I was involved in making the party and also working hard to make it strong. We are united.”

Gautam, who was in the race for becoming a minister after the JJP formed an alliance with the BJP had earlier said that after becoming the Deputy Chief Minister, Dushyant took 11 departments under his control and forgot the other party leaders.

Upset with the denial of a Cabinet berth in the BJP-JJP coalition government, Gautam had stated, “He (Dushyant) is keeping all the portfolios including industry, excise and taxation, PWD (B&R), revenue and food and supply. There is no limit to their greed. What can we do? He did not share power with anybody else. He made me MLA, but we have made him the Deputy Chief Minister.”

Gautam had also said that he had no regrets about resigning from the post of party vice-president of the party. “JJP is not a national party. I was made all India vice president in the party even though the party has influence in a limited pocket in Haryana. I am among those who follow the ideals,” he said, adding “JJP is a party made by me and my efforts. I nurtured nurtured the party with my sweat and blood. My self-esteem has been hurt, so I will not go to meet Dushyant.""

Initially, the party had preferred to keep the issue under the wraps with Dushyant repeatedly stating that Gautam was a senior elder and will be persuaded.

Meanwhile, video clips showing Gautam being critical of Dushyant Chautala kept emerging in the social media. “The party can’t allow such utterances for long. It sends a negative image about the patry,” a senior JJP leader said.

With these sentiments, the JJP has now sought clarification from the veteran politician asking him to explain why did he express “negative and baseless views” through the media.

The party leadership claim that most of Gautam’s statements critical to the leadership are baseless and are not in the interest of the party. “His recent statements are not in the favour of the party,” said a JJP leader privy to the matter. However, the JJP has not hinted at taking stern action against Gautam immediately. “The party will take next action only after receiving his reply,” said sources in the JJP.

Last month, Gautam, who had defeated former state Finance Minister Captain Abhimanyu, had announced his resignation from the post of JJP’s national vice president.

Besides Dushyant, the only minister from the JJP quota in the Manohar Lal Khattar Cabinet at present is Anoop Dhanak, a two-time MLA, who is looking after a low profile ministry Archaeology and Museums (independent charge) and Labour and Employment (attached with the deputy CM) as Minister of State. Gautam has been a habitual party hopper in his career. He became an MLA from BJP in 2005, but in 2010 contested the polls on a Congress ticket. He lost the election. Then he also got disillusioned with Congress.

He contested the 2014 assembly polls as an independent and lost. In 2019, he fought on a JJP ticket and only two months later, has shown his rebellious streak.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jjp-seeks-explanation-from-mla-who-criticised-dushyant.html

?Ajay Singh put forth the view of the state government that it has decided to incentivise the establishment of rice based bio ethanol production units, which would produce bioethanol from the surplus rice procured by the state.

To attract private investment into this sector, he sought the help of the Centre on two key issues. One is , to encourage the sales of bio ethanol produced, the rate of sale should be attractive.

Union Petroleum Minister has also been requested to decide the rate of rice based bio ethanol at par with that of sugar/sugar syrup based ethanol.

Secondly, as per the guidelines of National Bio fuel Policy 2018, the rice based bio ethanol production units have to seek permission every year from Agriculture Ministry. This provision is practically not viable and needs to be done away with.

Vice Chairman NITI Aayog has positively responded to the issues discussed and has assured that an interdepartmental meeting would be called at the earliest to resolve the issues.

Ajay Singh has also handed over a copy of the letter signed by Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel regarding the establishment of rice based bioethanol production units in Chhattisgarh.

Under the same collaboration, the Health Department has launched India Hypertension Control Initiative (IHCI) in five districts of the State — Bathinda, Hoshiarpur, Gurdaspur, Pathankot, and Mansa.

“The basic objective of the project is early identification of cases of hypertension, put them on treatment, continuation of treatment to achieve and maintain control of hypertension so as to reduce the early mortality due to hypertension,” the state Health and Family Welfare Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu on Friday.

He said that 80,000 cases of hypertension had been enlisted till December 2019 under the screening programme. Under IHCI, doctors, staff nurses, ANMs, ASHAs were trained to screen patients for hypertension and initiate treatment at the earliest.

Sidhu said that this programme is based upon the Central Government’s project launched in five states – Punjab, Kerala, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana. Punjab was the first state to launch the project as a part of National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS).

The Minister said that after successful implementation of the earlier screening programme for two years, now Punjab Government has decided to scale up the project to the whole State. A workshop to this effect was held at the state level where the district health administrators including Civil Surgeons, District Nodal Officers and Medical Specialists were sensitised towards the project by WHO and state health representatives with inputs from ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) and Vital Strategies Organisation.

It has been emphasised that the procurement of drugs is streamlined and the availability of drugs ensured at all levels in the Government hospitals and Health and Wellness Centres so that patients are not required to travel long distances to procure medicine, he said adding that the training for the staff in the new districts will start in February and completed by end of March 2020.

50,25-1-20,Doctors & medical staff now get DBT benefits: Singhdeo,"“If patients pressure goes beyond capability of government-run hospitals then certainly patients could be diverted to private hospitals but in a controlled fashion”

Chhattisgarh health department is soon going to launch DBT scheme for government hospital employees.

Under the scheme hospital staff starting from doctors to lab technician will receive money for rendering certain fixed services.

Talking to The Pioneer state health minister TS Singhdeo confirmed that the scheme will be launched in first week of February.

He explained that there are certain health procedures that are insured even in government hospital.

“That fund is currently divided into several parts and is deposited in Chief Minister relief fund, district Jeevandeep Samitis and certain others. We have come up with a plan to provide this fund to doctors and hospital staff for achieving a certain benchmark,” the health minister said while adding the nuances of this DBT scheme is in its last leg and will be finalized soon.

The minister hoped that this will act as a motivating factor for doctors and hospital staff to perform well.

According to the minister, scraping insurance model of treatment has provided financial flexibility to the department for launching such scheme for the department's employees.

Notably, recently Chhattisgarh government had abandoned the insurance-based health care and adopted trust-based system. Under this model the state government has currently identified 116 ailments which will be now treated in government hospitals only and if anyone decides to go to private hospitals instead, then they will have to pay from their own pockets.

Replying to query about shortage of doctors and medical infrastructure to deal with large number of patients that will be directed to government hospitals, the Minister said that if pressure goes beyond capability of government-run hospitals then certainly patients could be diverted to private hospitals but in a controlled fashion.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/doctors---medical-staff-now-get-dbt-benefits--singhdeo.html

58,25-1-20,"Mahapatra, a pioneer of new-wave Odia cinema","One of the prime tasks of a responsible filmmaker, i.e., most trenchant analysis of contemporary societal dilemmas, was nearly mastered by Manmohan Mahapatra, arguably one of the pioneers of purposive new-wave cinema. Not he, but his meticulously crafted characters loom large in all his films. Not the characters’ traits, qualifications, social class, showmanship or reputation, but their mere existence is the ground which dominates the films. Surrealistic touch of Mahapatra is evident unfailingly in all his movies. That desire to draw a line outside the boundary, which stands contrary to conventional films based on factious utopian themes, characterizes his genius. To quote the great storyteller Conan Doyle, ‘it’s quite elementary.’

(Mahapatra passed away on January 13. He was 69) Is life not all about experimenting? Is life not about breaking the formulae? Blame it on as bland a factor as monotony or as creative a facet called rebelliousness. Mahapatra sticks to his guns with a conviction which is honest i.e., he must not get allured into the commercial gimmicks, will not project events which have none or least common denomination and which is not reflective of a perception framed by his own self.

Most of his films are based on a thin story line, comprising a series of moments, which have a cumulative effect on the onlooker, where the characters, the situations, the minor story elements all ensemble in to an experience. He deliberately underplays the dramatic point of the film, in fact the de-emphasis of drama happens to be an integral part of his cinema. His films rarely use close up. It is mostly with mid shots along with elliptical cutting that he creates an ambience which has a distinct style.

Born on 10th November 1951 in Khordha, Odisha, he joined the Film and Television Institute of India, Poona. After completing his studies in FII, he made his first feature film, “Seeta Raati” in 1976, which could not be completed till 1980, due to financial problems. This film won the ‘Rajat Kamal’ in the National Film Awards in 1982; it also happens to be the first Odia film to be selected for the prestigious ‘Indian Panorama’ section of the International Film Festival of India, New Delhi.

It may be mentioned those who keep a wee bit track of Odia cinema and its ‘humanist appeal’, simply cannot ignore the contribution of Mahapatra, the lone fighter of Odia cinema, close to the aspirations of film lovers in Odisha. Mahapatra, who began his creative odyssey with path-breaking film, Seeta Raati (1982) has continued to make films, despite heavy sods and odds, and has made thirteen feature films in a span just two decades. If his Seeta Raati shows his imagination and innovatives ideas, other films such as Neeraba Jhada (1984), Klanta Aparanha (1985), Majhi Pahacha (1987), Nisidhaa Swapna (1988), Trisandhya (1988), Kichi Smruti Kichi Anubhuti (1989), Andha Diganta (1990), Agni Veena (1991), Vinna Samay (1993) and Muhurta (2002) have surely proved his agility and aesthetic sensibilities, shifted through various social plots, its conflicts, mainly based on agrarian milieu.

His films made in authentic agrarian ambience far supercede his films made on urban themes. He, like his batchmates Girish Kasaravalli, Balu Mahendra and Ketan Mehta, has never faltered in his mission linked to his moral temperament and social concern affecting our multi-layered society. His recent film ‘Bhija MatiraSwarga’ is yet another attempt to look into the changing times and new perspectives of life bothering our new generation.

In several films Manmohan’s opening shots seek to establish the apparent peace and concord of the village. The much idealized picture of the village as a place of beauty and serenity, of harmony with one’s neighbours and with the land itself, is suggested very clearly in the opening shots of, for example, Sita Rati, Nirab Jhada and Klanta Aparanha. Indeed, so effective is Manmohan’s creation of the visual image that the village becomes palpably real – even smells and the warmth of the breeze seem to be perceptible. The lush greenery, the ponds, the winding paths, the cattle silently grazing and the dogs sleeping, the clucking of hens and the old men sitting gossiping in the forecourt of the ancient temple all help to create an atmosphere that would substantiate the idealised picture of ruralbeauty.

Rightly, he has been conferred with the Jayadev Award, the highest State honour in films for one’s contribution to Odia cinema. The Utkal University of Culture conferred on him an honorary doctorate degree in 2017. Mahapatra passed away on January 13. He was 69.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mahapatra--a-pioneer-of-new-wave-odia-cinema.html

Senior BJP leader Durga Johri said, “This pro CAA, NRC and NPR rally is Daltonganj based. It is not divisional based. Some people are having this confusion that this pro-rally is any divisional one where will come people supporting CAA, NRC and NPR from Palamu division’s 3 districts Latehar, Garhwa and Palamu. It is a rally in support of these three nationwide programmes of only of the people of Palamu district.”

On being asked if two BJP MPs VD Ram Palamu and Sunil Singh Chatra ( Palamu’s Panki vidhan sabha constituency is a major part of Chatra Lok Sabha constituency) will also be taking part in this rally Johri said “ We expect them to be in this rally.”

73,25-1-20,10 shops found gutted in Daltonganj,"Town police found 10 shops belonging to the minority community burning on Friday night around 1.30 AM. Fire brigade was immediately called, which extinguished the blaze. Sources said by 2 am these 10 shops were all ashes.

The victims, all vendors, who used to earn their living by sale purchase of veggies, fruits, bangles, combs, lipsticks, powder etc had a word of appreciation for the cops and official of the ToP (Temporary

Out Post) which helped them in this post mid winter night fire by all means.

The victims said had the town police and ToP not acted fast and fire brigade not done the work in time the fire could have engulfed more shops in that row which are located on the Station Road Daltonganj little over one kilometer away from the Town police station.

There are two theories with regard to this fire. The police version is that there was winter fire with which people were warming themselves up and who left for their homes leaving this fire uncared and this may have caused this tragedy of ten shops in ashes now.

The victims’ contention is that this fire was manmade. It was no accidental fire, nor caused by any electric failure. It was done in a planned way to economically ruin them. Petrol or thinner could have been used to raze these shops to the ground said the victims.

The victims further contended that all the shops were burning simultaneously when in outbreak of fire for other reasons fire spread fast too but here all 10 shops were in flames at one point of time which clearly indicated highly inflammable thing like petrol or thinner was used in this crime.

The victims claimed police had recovered a filled match stick box too from the left side of the arson site.

A wooden cart 8 or 9 feet away from these shops too was found gutted about which the victims said it was a malicious arson.

SP Palamu Ajay Linda said, “Police have taken up this incident in all gravity and investigation is on. Let police complete its investigation then only we can say about the nature and cause of the fire.” DC Palamu Shantanu Kumar Agrahari said, “I have rushed in Additional Collector and Sub Divisional Magistrate to take stock of the situation there and also to submit a damage assessment report in regard to these ten shops.”

SDPO Sadar Sandip Kumar Gupta too held parleys with the victims and took details of their version. Gupta said our first priority is to provide the victims their legitimate relief in such a situation.

81,25-1-20,RMC to re-paint zebra crossings,"In a bid to curb traffic rule violations Zebra crossing across the Capital City will be repainted in the city. Ranchi Municipal Corporation ahead of republic day plans to highlight the road marks, stop lines and zebra crossing.

“With the present scenario of zebra crossing many people claim that they skip the signals due to faint lines. Apart from this zebra crossing are also painted close to footpaths or even over it. Proper re-painting is required that would ensure the pedestrians their way,” said traffic SP Ajit Peter Dung Dung.

A week ago the traffic police wrote to the civic body requesting it to undertake the exercise in view of regular complaints from Ranchities. More than 100 places in city need fresh paint and proper stop signs. Many localities complain of long traffic jams due to improper traffic signals. The sync of signals and timing is also problematic for commuters. The improper visibility of traffic related signboards, iron grilles on road dividers have made it difficult for the people.

“We have estimated that re-painting of zebra crossing will start soon. In two-three days. Also for traffic lights automated signals are starting soon in the city,” said Assistant Municipal Commissioner Jyoti Kumar Singh.

“The inconvenience caused by traffic signals and other markings need to be worked upon. Since the new Motor Vehicles Act, a minor violation costs heavy fines; Ranchi Municipal Corporation must ensure that their job is done well. Faded zebra crossing confuses most of the commuters which in-turn coughs up ones wallet. Zebra crossing are somewhere imprinted between dividers and even on footpaths. Seems unworthy of even marking them,” said Piyush Sharma, a resident of Lalpur.

Most of the places have zebra crossing marks on the both sides of cemented road dividers. Such places need new imprints.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rmc-to-re-paint-zebra-crossings.html

He said that there have been complaints from various residents that water collected from taps at their house have bad odour.

Though, the Tata Steel entity claims and findings by Yugantar Bharati water testing lab found the water from the supply point to be as per WHO norms.

84,25-1-20,"Safari, winter tourism, historical trails to enhance tourism in State","Tourism and culture are said to be the socio-economical backbone of Uttarakhand. Successive state Governments have attempted to capitalise on these aspects to improve the condition of the State and its people with mixed results.

The state’s Tourism, Culture, Irrigation, Indo-Nepal Relations minister Satpal Maharaj has some big ideas, which if implemented effectively could bring about drastic changes in the State.

In an exclusive interaction with Paritosh Kimothi of The Pioneer, he talked about his ideas from facilitating proper winter tourism in the State and the Char Dham Devsthanam management board to setting up a unique safari experience with wild animals from Africa too not only to boost the State’s economy through tourism but also to further enhance the experience of both tourists and locals who visit these destinations in different parts of the state.

Referring to his idea for a safari he said, “We have conceptualised a safari wherein wild animals including lion, zebra, giraffe and the rhinocerous among others from Africa will be kept in an open enclosure. The visitors in limited numbers will visit the enclosure in a protected vehicle while the animals will roam around freely. This will be a unique experience.

I visited South Africa and studied the various aspects related to this. I also visited Rewa in Madhya Pradesh famous for its white tigers. Can you imagine what having just one white tiger in a safari experience could do here?

Such a facility would not only enhance the experience of visitors while educating them about wildlife but would also boost the state’s tourism and economy considerably. We are working on this concept. We cannot establish the safari in a forest area but there is no problem if we set it up outside the forest area.”

Elaborating on his plans for the State, Maharaj said that he wants to develop Uttarakhand as a destination for winter tourism.

“Look at winter tourism destinations in France, Germany, Switzerland and other such nations. These are places which have scant populace during the summer but bustle with lakhs of visitors during the winters as people throng to ski and enjoy winter tourism. We have such locations in Uttarakhand too but need to develop facilities and the system in order to facilitate proper winter tourism. We are thinking of developing Gorson ahead of Auli so that in case there is dearth of snow in Auli, tourists can always visit Gorson where the snow is guaranteed.

We will start training youngsters in skiing at Auli. There is considerable scope in winter tourism. Take for example a destination like Hemkund Sahib which closes during the winter. However, with a ropeway to this destination, we can enable visitors to view and enjoy the unique beauty of this pristine Himalayan location during the winter too.”

The Minister further states that work is underway on developing various trails for tourists based on the historical, cultural and religious heritage of the State. Many are unaware of the significant religious and historical associations which many places in the State have.

“We will be developing the Mahabharat trail, Adi Shankaracharya trail, Buddha circuit, Modi trail and Navgrah circuit. When it comes to the Mahabharat trail, the history and culture of Uttarakhand has such ancient roots that the Pandavas had come here and one of the remnants of their visit is the practice is polyandry still existing in the Jaunsar region. To atone for the sin of fratricide, they had come to seek pardon from Lord Shiva in Uttarakhand and it is then that he took the form of a bull which disappeared into the ground- his various body parts emerging in different places like Kedarnath, Tungnath and Pashupatinath (in Nepal) among others- where major shrines of lord Shiva are now visited by multitudes. Uttarakhand has other links too with the Mahabharat era.

Adi Shankaracharya had also visited Uttarakhand, established some important shrines, revived the Badrinath shrine after retrieving the idol of the lord from the Taptkund there before he himself merged with the infinite.

When it comes to Buddha, Kalsi in Dehradun district is one of the 14 places in the country where the edicts of Ashoka were placed. Apart form Ashoka’s edicts in Kalsi, we also have Govishan in Kashipur where ancient roots important from the view point of Buddhism and archaeology will interest many.

Another interesting trail we are planning is the Vivekanand trail. When Vivekananda was trekking and very thirsty while at Karbala in Almora, he sought water from a man who expressed his inability to give him water due to religious factors.

However, when Vivekanand asked him for help in whichever way possible, the man cut a cucumber and placed it in front of him. The cucumber sustained Vivekanand. It was after this trip that he went to Chicago where he delivered his world famous address in the world parliament of religions. Coming to Almora after that, he addressed a gathering and spoke about the unique natural and spiritual beauty of Uttarakhand.

We will provide information about what Vivekanand said about Uttarakhand to visitors, which will be an enriching experience. Further, we will also develop a trail based on the places visited by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he featured in the episode of Man versus Wild with Bear Grylls.

A mobile phone application will provide information to visitors who will be able to visit the same sites in authorised vehicles. In addition to these, we have already established the Bhagwati circuit and are also planning to develop a Navgrah circuit linking shrines associated with the astrologically important nine planets.”

In the past, the Culture department had organised a programme involving 1,500 traditional dhol players. This time, the department is planning something bigger.

Maharaj said, “This time we will aim for a world record with a performance by 3,000 dhol players and felicitate them. After establishing the record, we will present a copy of the world record to each of the drummers to honour their role in establishing the record.”

On being asked about some people still protesting against the Char Dham Devsthanam Management Board he said, “The protest is akin to the protests against CAA. People are objecting to it without understanding it. In the last Char Dham season we had 37 lakh pilgrims visiting the state. We need to have proper facilities and management for the pilgrims too. We have ensured that traditional rights of the stakeholders and the ancient customs will not be affected. Our focus is on improving the system to enable better facilities and management.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/safari--winter-tourism--historical-trails-to-enhance-tourism-in-state.html
85,25-1-20,U’khand to organise Intl convention on Green energy,"Enthused by the positive public response on alternative forms of energy, Uttarakhand government would organise an international convention on green energy. On Friday, the senior officials of the power department met the Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat at state secretariat and discussed the plan of the convention in detail.

The secretary, Power, Radhika Jha said that the convention is proposed in the month of June this year. She said that 250 delegates belonging to the power sector are expected to take part in the convention. In the convention subject experts, entrepreneurs, State Government institutions and all other stake holders would be brought under one roof for deliberation.

In the convention a roadmap for the state for the conception, development, construction and operation of renewable energy would be prepared.

She added that in the convention would be organised under the aegis of Uttarakhand government by the UJVN limited, Uttarakhand Power Corporation Limited (UPCL), Power Transmission Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (PITCUL) and Uttarakhand Renewable Energy Development Agency (UREDA).

It is pertinent to mention here that the Uttarakhand started second phase of the rooftop solar energy scheme recently.

Under the scheme, one can establish up to 10 KV plants which would cost Rs five Lakhs. The actual cost would drop to Rs 3.60 Lakh after subsidy.

Selling the electricity thus generated through the grid will develop another source of income. At present, the state is producing 268 MW of electricity through solar power while new allotment has also been made for production of 200 MW solar power.

The focus of government on the solar power projects could be understood from the fact that the state has started producing more than 200 MW of solar energy in last one and half years. Similarly the state government is focussing on power production from pine needles.

The department claims that grounding of projects amounting to Rs 800 Crore investments has been done so far.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/u---khand-to-organise-intl-convention-on-green-energy.html

The authorities are claiming that the 1680 Crore project would get completed in the year 2023. In Udham Singh Nagar private sector Adani Gas limited is working on the project.

This company was provided the task in the year 2016 however the work of the company is very slow.

Under the project, natural cooking gas would be supplied to domestic customers in pipes.

Due to its many inherent advantages like good combustion and low pricing, PNG is called fuel of future.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/residents-to-receive-piped-natural-gas-in-home.html
87,25-1-20,Uttarakhand Raksha Morcha merged into UKD,"In a new attempt to form a viable third force in politically bipolar political state, the Raksha Morcha (URM) announced its merger with Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (UKD) on Friday.

Formal announcement of the merger was made by the URM leader and former IAS officer Surendra Singh Pangti in presence of top leadership of UKD. Speaking on the occasion, Pangti said that only a regional party can ensure development of the State.

He said that in last 19 years BJP and Congress have taken turns to loot the state and the time is opportune for the UKD to provide alternative to these parties.

Senior leader of URM, P C Thapliyal said that the UKD should be strengthened and all the non BJP non Congress forces are needed to be brought under one platform.

Appreciating the URM leadership for taking the decision of merger, UKD leader, Kashi Singh Airi said that inclusion of leaders of Pangti and Thapliyal would strengthen UKD.

He claimed that people are waiting to teach both BJP and Congress lesson for ignoring development of the state and said that given the huge public support it is receiving, UKD would form government in the next assembly elections.

President of the UKD, Diwakar Bhatt said that the party is ready to provide third alternative to the people of the state.

It is worth mentioning here that URM was formed by leaders like former MP, Lieutenant General (Retd) T P S Rawat, Dr V K Bahuguna and others in the year 2012.

The party however was rejected vehemently in successive elections by the people of the state.

In last few years most of the leaders of the party have either left it or have joined mainstream political parties.Meanwhile, the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president Pritam Singh has termed the decision of URM to merge it with UKD as insignificant.

He said that URM is a defunct party and UKD has lost its relevance and support of the people.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/uttarakhand-raksha-morcha-merged-into-ukd.html
88,25-1-20,JVM(P) withdraws support from Govt,"Crating ripples in politics of Jharkhand former Chief Minister and Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) Chief,

Babulal Marandi on Friday announced to withdraw party’s unconditional support from Chief Minister, Hemant Soren led coalition Government in the State.

On December 24, the party had written a letter to the State Assembly Speaker to extend unconditional support to Soren Government when Soren met Marandi before meeting with Governor Draupadi Murmu to put forward his claim to form Government in the State.

Meanwhile, showing gratitude to Marandi for extending his unconditional support to his Government till now Chief Minister Hemat Soren said that he is thankful of Marandi. The CM also said that the Government is doing its own work and Marandi jee is doing on his own work to set his political standard.

Addressing a Press meet at the Party headquarter, JVM General Secretary, Saroj Singh said that the party had extended its unconditional support to Hemant Soren UPA Government in which Indian National Congress (INC) is also an alliance partner.

Singh said that the party withdrew its support because INC is trying to break JVM MLAs to include in the party according to the print and electronic media reports.

“In such a condition the party reconsiders on its decision to extend its unconditional support to the Government and has decided to withdraw its support from the Government,” said the party General Secretary.

There is speculation since last two weeks JVM will merge with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and it seems that the party has taken the decision in this direction.

At the same time the party also removed Poraiyahaat MLA, Pradip Yadav from the post of Leader of Legislative Party. JVM won three seats in recently concluded the State Assembly Elections. Other than Poraiyahaat, JVM Supremo Marandi won from

Dhanwar and Bandhu Tirkey won from Mandar.

On January 5 the party held its working committee meeting to review the elections results, during the meeting it was decided that the working committee was dissolved.

On January 21 the party expelled Tirkey by alleging that he was involved anti-party activity in the recently concluded the State Assembly elections. Yadav and Tirkey were opposing merger with BJP. Both the leaders met INC leader Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. After meeting with senior Congress leader while talking with media persons Yadav said that it is too early to say anything that he will join Congress or not.

“First of all I hold meeting with my supporters

to discuss the future strategy,” he added.

Reacting on his expulsion Yadav said it can be decided during the meeting of Legislature Party. Till now Legislature Party meeting has not been held and it is Yadav’s prerogative to who will be Legislature Party Leader, other than him no one can expelled any person from the party, he added.

Both the leaders were openly opposing merger with BJP. Tirkey had said on December 19 that if the party would merge with then it will be very unfortunate and he will not left the party he will stay with the party. Now it has become almost clear that JVM will merge with BJP.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jvm-p--withdraws-support-from-govt.html
89,25-1-20,Labour Minister resents Arun Sahoo’s move,"A day after Higher Education Minister Arun Sahoo’s announcement to abolish the practice of inducting local MLAs and politicians as presidents of the college governing bodies, dissent over the proposal was expressed by Labour Minister Sushant Singh on Friday.

“I am not clear about the Higher Education Minister’s statement, but there should be politicians in the governing bodies of all degree colleges,” said Singh.

“A politician may not necessarily be the president, but he should be in the managing committee at least as a member to supervise the developmental activities of the concerned college.”

“Currently, as presidents of governing bodies of colleges, we (politicians) find it hard to attend all the meetings due to time constraints. So, an academician should ideally be the president to chair the meetings, but politicians should have a place in the body,” added Singh.

Singh further said, “We will look into the new guidelines of the Higher Education Department and work out a plan to include local MLAs in the managing committees.”

Notably, Sahoo in a programme convened by Odisha Parents’ Association on Thursday had announced that no politician or local MLA for that matter would be allowed in the governing bodies of degree colleges.

The series of good works must go on. Therefore, at present I extend cooperation in redressing the grievances of pensioners.”

Joshi says that Kamal Nath is the first Chief Minister, who gave concrete shape to the Chief Minister’s Employees Health Insurance Scheme by considering the health and medicine of the retired servants of the state in its entirety. Treatment is most needed in old age. At first glance this scheme looks simple and easily implementable. Every point of the scheme is effective.

Joshi says, “It has been learned that the Chief Minister’s Employees Health Insurance Scheme is likely to begin from April 2020. Therefore all serving and retired servants should be given the option of joining the scheme by March 25, 2020 so that their share amount can be deducted on time.” He also believes that, “retired government servants settled outside Madhya Pradesh in Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh etc. should also be included in this scheme.”

Shankarlal Soni retired from the Municipal Council in the year 2015. He runs a Sunday school and teaches poor children. He is very sensitive to the environment and distributes saplings and flower pots free of cost while giving environmental education to those interested.

This scheme is a welcome step of the government.” Shankar Sharan Khare, who retired from the post of RI (Revenue) in the year 2018 said that “after very long time the government has taken note of old people from the health point of view. For this the thinking of the Chief Minister is laudable.”

Sisodia also challenged him to visit the newly constructed 'School of Excellence' in Patparganj Assembly constituency. His reaction came in response to Shah's allegation that the Delhi Government has not constructed any schools in Delhi.

Reacting to the comment of Shah in which he said his phone battery died trying to find free Wi-Fi service of the AAP Government, Siodia said he is worried about it because if India's Home Minister's phone battery runs out of charge the nation will come to a standstill. ""The Delhi Government has a system to provide free electricity up to 200 units, I request him to keep his phone charged always because he won't be able to use the free Wi-Fi on a dead phone,"" he said,

""We have already launched more than 1,000 hotspots and the AAP Government will install 11,000 Wi-Fi hotspots across Delhi. If the Home Minister accompanies me to any major market area, I will show him Wi-Fi spots"" he said.

Sisodia also challenged him to showcase even a single government school of comparable standards that has been constructed in any of the BJP ruled states.

The Government has already installed more than 2,00,000 cameras and the process is on to install the remaining, he said.

The AAP leader also accused the sven BJP MPs of doing nothing after being elected in 2014 and again in 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

102,25-1-20,Safety & security among top concerns,"As Delhi Assembly election just two weeks away and rival parties leaving no stone unturned to reach out to the people, candidates fielded by political parties for Delhi Cantt Assembly seat, are facing identity crisis. What is even more interesting is that people in this particular segment connected themselves more with the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and not with the Delhi Cantt. According to Election Commission of India (ECI), Delhi Cantt has 1,32,233 voters.

Mushrooming of slums, security of their wards and beautification of local markets are a few demands of the locals in this part of the national Capital. Their grouse stems from the fact their MLA Surrender Commando did nothing. The Pioneer visited in Delhi Cantt area and spoke to various people about the candidates of three parties.

Surprisingly, most of the people were not aware about the area MLA, while Cantt, which is itself a board, is known for its green, clean and well maintained roads in Delhi's heart aligning with few areas of west and south and central Delhi. However, a few colonies fall under the Cantt where Government employee are totally against emerging slums in their backyards.

""Slums in Government colonies cause various security threats. First — small children in slum are prone to drug, we have seen several time and reported few incidents to the council and authorities... but so far no changes have been seen,"" said a Defence Ministry official, ""I personally addressed this issue to the sitting AAP's MLA Surender Commando as this was much about with the future of children, but politicians allow and use slum dwellers as their vote bank and hardly visit slums in posh area.""

""There were various issues pertaining to colonies in Delhi Cantt while the NDMC has its own limitation while dealing with cantt area, I visited council's office however came back with no development,"" said Nidhi, a senior employee with External Affairs.

Gopinath Bazar, a busy market in Delhi Cantt where people come from all parts of the city to buy camouflage fabrics. However, less organized market has caught the attention of visitors and residents and make them feel, a need for an active MLA. ""Beautification of Gopianath and Sadar should be done,"" said a Manju, a frequent visitor and a local resident.

AAP has fielded Virender Singh Kadian, a retired Air Force officer while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has fielded a Purvanchali candidate Manish Singh who is very close to Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari and Congress has fielded Sandeep Tanwar. Cantt residents feel that the presence of Surender Commando was not visible in Cantt as he was non approachable and Rs this has given BJP a window to wrest this seat. Residents feel that the parties have gone for the candidates who are outsiders and less aware about Cantt's functioning.

Interestingly, Kadian who is outsider but a retired service officer may able to gain votes as being able to connect with the Cantt residents while Sigh from BJP is completely an outsider and Congress candidate Sandeep Tanwar who lives in Naraina is also a new candidate for the Cantt people.

Delhi Cantt was established in 1914. Previously it was known as Cantt Authority however in 1938. Boundary wall, creation of public toilets , beautification of parks, Constructions of PORTA cabin, development of Yashwant market and civil sewerage maintenance are few works in which MLA's active participation involved through the council.

BJP's member Karan singh Tanwar won the seat twice in the year 2008 and 2003 while soon after the Anna movement, AAP leader defeated him twice in 2013 and 2015.

In 2015, former AAP leader Surender Commando won the seat with 40133 votes while Tanwar managed 28,935 votes , in 2013, AAP won with 26,124 defeating BJP with 25,769 votes.

In 2008, Congress and BJP were in fight for the seat when BJP's Tanwer won the seat with 23,696 votes defeated Congress leader Ashok Ahuja with 16,435 votes, in 2003 , Tanwar won with 21,638 votes and congress candidate Kiran Chaudhry got 17,872 votes only.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/safety---security-among-top-concerns.html

105,25-1-20,BJP blames Congress for inciting Lohardaga violence,"The State BJP on Friday targeted Congress and other Opposition parties for instigating violence in Lohardaga where Pro CAA demonstrators were attacked by unruly mob on Thursday.

BJP national general secretary, Arun Singh who was in State Capital for the constitution of state working committee said, “There is complete lawlessness in State. While on one hand anti CAA demonstrators are free to take out procession in any part of State, Pro CAA protestors are targeted.”

He said, “Prior to Lohardaga incident such incidents had occurred in Giridih district too where a peaceful procession being taken by local residents supporting CAA was targeted by unruly mob. We have information that stones and inflammable materials were thrown on Pro CAA demonstrators from Congress Bhawan in Lohardaga.”

The BJP national general secretary said that attack was pre-planned as stones, inflammable materials, bottles and other materials were stored at terrace of the houses on the route from where procession was to pass.

Meanwhile after Thursday’s incident, curfew has been imposed in Lohardaga. Section 144, which prohibits assembly of more than four people in an area, has been imposed in Lohardaga. Schools and colleges have been closed for two days following Thursday violence.

The BJP leader claimed that Congress and Left parties are trying to create confusion in the name of CAA, which is only to give citizenship to minorities who have fled to India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan as there is threat on their religious identity.

The Congress and Left parties on the other hand are trying to create confusion among the minds of minorities that their citizenship is on threat due to CAA.

The BJP leader on the other hand said that State BJP new working committee will be constituted soon. He said, “As the BJP national president has been nominated. In Jharkhand also a new state president will be nominated. After the nomination of state president the new team of State BJP will be constituted.” Singh said that the constitution of new state BJP unit will start from January 25.

The State BJP senior leaders in this connection held a meeting, which was attended by former Chief Minister Raghubar Das, State BJP organisational secretary Dhrampal Singh and others.

Jharkhand is one of the States, which is going to get new BJP president.

Present BJP president Laxman Gilua after humiliating defeat of party in just concluded Assembly election has tendered his resignation, but the BJP central leadership is yet to accept his resignation.

Sources said Central leadership this time is going to make a president who apart from having mass appeal too is vocal with good oratorical skills.

Sources said that among the non-tribal leaders the names of Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth, Anant Ojha, Sunil Singh, Deepak Prakash and others are doing the rounds. Seth and Anant Ojha, apart from having long experience in party, have good oratory skills. Sunil Singh has good rapport in BJP’s Delhi Durbar as he is close to many BJP leaders.

Deepak Prakash is also considered as strong contender for BJP president post as he is close to Nadda, sources said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-blames-congress-for-inciting-lohardaga-violence.html

107,25-1-20,One-Way System trial elicits mixed response,"The Dehradun police conducted the second trial of the one-way system on various city roads on Friday to check its feasibility on a working day. However, the experience of the traffic plan trial was not the same for all people in the city.

According to Ramdhir Singh, a daily wage worker, ""I was supposed to reach my work site by 11 am, and for last one hour, I am just trying to figure out from where I will get the bus for ISBT. Some are telling me to go to that side of the road, some are telling me to go to another route. I am confused and even if I get the bus now, I will just get paid for half day. Why do authorities not think about the poor and illiterate people? If I would have been aware of the plan I would have made some arrangement to travel to the work site.”

College student Upasana Chauhan said, “The roads looked chaotic when I was going to college in the morning but it seemed better later in the day. Of course, the routes for vehicles have been changed which makes you travel at least one kilometre extra but there is no traffic jam on my route so I am happy about it. Travelling a few extra miles is better for me than to be stuck in traffic.”

“The traffic was smooth for me when I started driving from my home in Rajpur Road but it became chaotic near Tehsil and MKP Chowk. The commuters in two-wheelers are still managing somehow to get through the jam but it’s hard to get through traffic by car. I don’t think that there are proper arrangements by police to handle such a big crowd. I mean, of course they are managing vehicles on every route but it is too time consuming. The plan might work for few routes but collectively everywhere, I doubt it,” said Abhishek Thapa

“It is an important step taken by the police. Many people are talking about inconvenience they are facing due to the trial but I am sure that once the plan is executed fully, people will get used to it. Every new thing seems difficult initially but we ultimately get the hang of it. I, too, have to ride at least twice the distance I usually travel but I did not get stuck in the traffic which I appreciate,” said Dinesh Naithani, an ex-army man.

It is pertinent to mention here that one trial has already been done on Sunday but according to deputy inspector general and Dehradun Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Arun Mohan Joshi Therefore, trial of traffic plan on a busy day will help police to understand the issues and challenges in intersections and other routes which will assist in enhancing the plan. It has also been cleared by SSP that the traffic plan is not a short term planning for the ongoing work of the smart city project. According to him the traffic plan was planned after proper study and hard work of the department so it will be implemented as a long term plan to make the traffic system more efficient but only after successful trials and positive results.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/one-way-system-trial-elicits-mixed-response-one-way-system-trial-elicits-mixed-response.html

They also said that she is not appropriate for her position in the Government.According to Anganwadi worker Dilma, “Rekha Arya does not even know about our working hours, what would she know about our protest? She is really not meant for her position in the department. The State Women Empowerment and Child Development department has even won an award due to our work in this field but she does not even know about our work. We are peacefully protesting here for now almost two months.

We have not contacted or called any political party to support us. How is our protest politically oriented? We are not promoting or opposing any party, we are fighting for our rights. It is very disheartening to hear such statements about us.”Another protester Sarojini Anthwal said, “We submit our data and reports regularly to our respective supervisors but they will still ask for the reports which are six months or sometimes six years old even late in the night.

They have clerks, computers and all the conveniences to store data but they expect Anganwadi workers to give them old data. It is because they always lose their data and when their seniors ask for any report, they trouble us.”She further added, “They have asked us to rent a kitchen with a room to run Anganwadi centre but they don’t ever pay on time. They don’t pay for ration to feed children and neither do they pay travel expenses. We have to do so many things at our expense but we hardly get paid fully for it. If the Government thinks our demand too high, they could offer something from their side too but there is no initiation from them. At least they could talk to us but no, they don’t care for the struggle of women in their state.”Dilma said that if no action is taken by the Government soon, she will be the first to commit self-immolation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/minister---s-statement-disappointing--anganwadi-workers.html

The committee comprises Gujarat MP Jaswant Singh Bhabhor, Jharkhand MP Sameer Oraon, Maharashtra MP Bharti Pawar, Chhattisgarh MP Gomti Sai, West Bengal MP John Barla, former Jharkhand Minister Neelkanth Singh Munda. BJP’s Scheduled Tribe Morcha State president Ram Kumar Pahan said, “The six-member committee formed by BJP national president JP Nadda was to visit Chaibasa site to investigate the case, but the team was stopped from reaching the site which indicates that government doesn’t want to clear the truth.” He also said that Central Government is keeping an eye on this incident and the culprits will not be left under any circumstances.

Representatives of the US Consulate, top officials of the Crime Investigation Department (CID) of Jharkhand Police and members of Delhi-based NGO Shakti Vahini launched the campaign in Ranchi on Friday. US Consulate’s Political/Economic Officer Sonia Laul said, “We are committed to intensifying our efforts to end human trafficking through a year-round, multilateral approach that supports the coordination of anti-trafficking efforts through meaningful engagement with local Governments, law enforcement agencies, judiciary, civil society, private sector and trafficking survivors.”

The project goal is to empower youth to lead prevention campaigns. Besides Ranchi, the workshop was launched in Patna and Guwahati earlier. The three workshops will allow stakeholders in each state to learn about the model and discuss best practices, keeping in mind local issues and the socio-cultural scenario.

Following the workshops, participants will continue to network and share developments, as well as lead two pilot projects in each of the three states. Six months after the workshops, participants will convene for an international conclave at the American Center Kolkata to share impact stories of the pilot projects and discuss ways to continue to strengthen collaboration.

A Supreme Court lawyer, Ravi Kant, who also happens to be a founder member of Shakti Vahini, said that human trafficking has grown in magnitude in Jharkhand and the years of efforts have not been able to curtail the problem entirely. “Awareness is the key to curbing the menace of human trafficking. We will be visiting different villages and spread awareness among children in the age bracket of 14 to 18 years in a bid to ensure that the children know about the crime and how it is perpetrated through agents in Jharkhand,” he said.

The President of United States of America, Donald Trump has proclaimed January as ‘National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month’. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the passage of the US Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and adoption of the United Nations’ protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children.

123,25-1-20,Rajasthan Govt working to bring legislation on ‘right to health’: Guv,"Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra on Friday said the Government is working to bring a legislation on “right to health” to provide healthcare facilities to people of the State.

Delivering his address on the first day of the Budget session, which was later boycotted by the opposition BJP and RLP MLAs, Mishra said the state government has launched ‘Nirogi Rajasthan’ campaign on December 18 last year and was making constant efforts to provide healthcare facilities to the people.

He said the Government was working on “right to health” legislation to make it mandatory to provide healthcare facilities to the people.

Mishra said the State Government has so far allocated a budget of Rs 47.80 crore as agriculture grant to farmers in six districts - Jalore, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner, Pali and Jodhpur - where locust attack has damaged crops.

He said the Government took prompt action and got the ‘girdawari’ (assessment report) prepared in the affected areas.

The Governor said Rajasthan became the first State in the country to make the arrangement of FIR registration at SP offices in case the FIR is not registered at police stations.

Due to this historic decision, the number of FIRs will increase, he said.

“It is the duty of the Government which works for public welfare to ensure that everyone is heard and gets justice,” he said.

Rajasthan was the first state to pass a bill to curb incidents of honour killing and second state where a bill against mob lynching was passed, he said.

It was expected that the government of India will cooperate in implementing them.

Mishra said Rajasthan is the first state to bring an ordinance to exempt MSMEs for three years from getting approval and clearances to start operations. Certificates to 2,811 business units have been provided under this till December 31, 2019, he said.

The governor highlighted other achievements of the Government during his speech, which was interrupted by the leader of opposition Gulabchand Kataria.

As soon as the Governor began the address, Kataria raised objection over the manner in which the session was hurriedly called and said the rules and procedures were not followed.

“A prior notice has to be issued before the session is called but this was not followed. The notice has to be issued 21 days prior to the beginning of the session. The session has been called hurriedly and in emergency,” he said.

Kataria said a bill to extend reservation to SC and ST in Lok Sabha and State Assemblies for another 10 years has to be ratified by January 25 but the Government was careless about it earlier. The session was hurriedly called when the last date of ratification was near, he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/rajasthan-govt-working-to-bring-legislation-on----right-to-health-----guv.html

125,25-1-20,"Normal life not hit, bandh evokes lukewarm response","The Maharashtra bandh, called by the Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) to oppose the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) failed to evoke desired response on Friday, even as the protesters vandalised buses and indulged in violence at some places across the state.

In all, VBA and 35 other organisations had come together to organise the bandh. In the run up to and during the course of the bandh, the police had detained an estimated 3000 Dalit activists and others belonging to the organisations supporting the bandh as a precautionary measure.

The detained activists were, however, let off later in the night. VBA’s founder president Prakash Ambedkar claimed that the bandh was a success.”We have not forced anyone to join the bandh. Nor have workers indulged in violence. By and large, the bandh was a total success,” Ambedkar said, while talking to media persons in the evening.There was some impact of bandh in places like Mumbai, Thane, Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi, Akola, Jalgaon, Baramati, Jalna, Nandurbar, Nashik Hingoli and Pune.

Shops and business establishments remained in most of these places. There were however, no reports of major disruptions from other parts of the state. Notwithstanding the claims to the contrary by Ambedkar, the VBA activists forced the shop keepers to shut down the shops in places like Chembur, Wadala, Mulund, Airoli, Ghatkopar, Govandi, Trombay and Kurla. However, normal life remained unaffected.

The protesters indulged in stone pelting and vandalised a BEST at Chembur in north-central Mumbai.

The driver, identified as Vilas B. Dabhade (53), was injured in the incident. He was admitted to the Shatabdi Hospital at Govandi. However, the passengers in the bus escaped unhurt.

There were reports of sporadic incidents of violence from some parts of the state. The incidents included creating blockades along the

roads and hurling of stones at buses.

In Mumbai, Thane and most other places across the state, normal life remained unaffected. The suburban trains – the life lines of Mumbai and surrounding satellite townships – ran normally, while the road traffic was also not hit by the bandh. In his interaction with the media, Amedhkar said: “Since the people are getting to know more and more about the dangers posed by the CAA, NRC and NPR, we received fairly good response for the bandh.

The CAA and NRC will not affected just Muslims, they will also affected a sizeable section of the Hindus across the country.

The people will find it difficult to prove their citizenship, because of lack of documents with them”.

Ambedkar said that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman would present a deficit budget in February. “In the normal course, the Government was to have raised a revenue of Rs 24 lakh crore during the financial year 2019-20. But, the revenue collection may not even Rs 9 lakh crore,” Ambedkar said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/normal-life-not-hit--bandh-evokes-lukewarm-response.html
126,25-1-20,Arbitrary or excessive tax a social injustice: CJI,"Ahead of the Budget Session, Chief Justice of India SA Bobde on Friday said while tax evasion is a social injustice to the fellow citizens, arbitrary or excessive tax is also a social injustice by a Government.

Referring to ancient laws in India around taxation, the Chief Justice said tax should be collected from people like honey bee draws nectar from flowers without harming it.

Speaking at the 79th foundation day celebrations of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Bobde emphasised on the use of next generation technology artificial intelligence to expedite the process with caution that it should not replace the human discretion required for delivering justice.

“I am firmly of the view based on experience of systems that have used artificial intelligence that it is only the repetitive area or decision making that is rates of taxation etc or something which is invariably the same which is in a sense mechanical that must be covered by artificial intelligence. I do not believe that artificial intelligence should ever be allowed to substitute the human discretion which is necessary for a just decision making,” he said.

The CJI’s suggestion comes against the backdrop of the people’s expectations of further income tax relaxations being one of the Budget sops of the Modi Government, economic slowdown, high inflation and a weakening rupee..

The CJI also made a case for speedy resolution of tax disputes saying it will act as an incentive for tax payers and free the funds locked in litigation.

The Chief Justice said tax judiciary plays a very important role in resource mobilisation of the country and expressed concern over pendency of cases.

“A just and speedy dispute resolution is perceived as a tax incentive by the taxpayer. To the tax collector, an efficient tax judiciary assures that demands arising out of legitimate assessment are not strangled in delayed litigation,” Bobde said.

The pendency of appeal cases related to indirect taxes in the Supreme Court, High Court and CESTAT has reduced 61 per cent to 1.05 lakh in almost two years.

According to official data, total pendency of appeals at the Supreme Court, High Court and CESTAT (Customs Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal) as on June 30, 2017, was 2,73,591, whereas the same significantly came down to 1,05,756 as on March 31, 2019, a reduction of 61 per cent.

With regard to direct taxes, as many as 3.41 lakh cases were pending before commissioner (appeals), while 92,205 cases were pending before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) as on March 31, 2019.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/arbitrary-or-excessive-tax-a-social-injustice--cji.html

Azad, addressing a rally in this north Bihar town, called upon the people to carry on “sustained and peaceful protests”, urging them to draw inspiration from the agitation by women at Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh.

“I want to tell people across the country that they are not alone in their fight. The Bhim Army is by their side,” he said.

The Bhim Army chief accused the Narendra Modi-led Government of “striking at the country’s unity and integrity” by introducing the CAA which “discriminates against citizens on the basis of religion”.

He said NPR is seen as a precursor to (nationwide) NRC, which could be “used to disenfranchise people”.

“The Government has been peddling lies stating that the Act is a benign one, aimed at giving citizenship and not taking it away, and misleading the nation by claiming that it is not linked with NRC.

All these measures will harm the common citizens,” Azad said.

The Ambedkarite also paid tributes to socialist leader Karpoori Thakur on his birth anniversary on Friday.

Sharing an image of a commemorative stamp issued in the memory of the former Bihar chief minister, he tweeted, “Attended a rally at Muzaffarpur (Bihar) on the birth anniversary of Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur, the warrior of social justice.”

“Karpoori Thakur had said that if the rights of the people are trampled upon, they will challenge the privileges enjoyed by the Parliament.

130,25-1-20,Increase in B’deshi migrants’ outflow post CAA: BSF,"The BSF said on Friday that there has been an increase in the outflow of illegal Bangladeshi migrants to their home country over the past one month, following the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

A top official of the paramilitary force said there has been a spike in the number of illegal settlers apprehended since last month.

The outflow has been highest through the borders in the North 24 Parganas district, BSF Inspector General (South Bengal Frontier) Y B Khurania said. “There has been some increase in outflow of illegal Bangladeshi migrants to the bordering country in last one month. In January alone, we had apprehended 268 illegal Bangladeshi migrants, most of who were trying to sneak into the neighbouring country,” Khurania told reporters.

Those leaving were mostly engaged as masons, maids and housekeepers in the country, another Border Security Force (BSF) official said.

“The highest outflow is via North 24 Parganas district. They (migrants) were mostly based in Bengaluru and north India. Some were involved in paltry jobs such as masons, maids, housekeepers and sweepers,” he said.

In 2019, the BSF had apprehended 2,194 Bangladeshis, most of them caught while trying to illegally sneak into India. But since December last year, things have changed, the official said. West Bengal shares about 2,216.7-km border with Bangladesh, a large part of which is unfenced.

According to BSF sources, troopers were not stopping the immigrants from crossing over to their home country, except in cases when they were found to be smuggling goods.

“Only when they are concealing any contraband or trying to smuggle something to Bangladesh, we are apprehending them. Otherwise, we are taking a note of their particulars and details and letting them go back,” one of the sources said.

According to the BSF, one of the biggest achievements of the South Bengal Frontier in 2019 has been putting a check on cross-border cattle smuggling.

“In 2018, the number of cattle seized was around 39,995 and in 2019 it had come down to 31,210. This year so far the figure is just 1,301,” he said.

The CAA seeks to provide Indian citizenship to Hindus, Jains, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Parsis who moved to India on or before December 31, 2014, having fled religious persecution in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Speaking to reporters here, Ambedkar asked Pawar to make public the “documents” he has in his possession.

“Pawar has written to the government is what I have read in newspapers. My only request to the Government is it should assure the (police) officials who are involved that it won’t take action against them even if they were wrong,” Ambedkar said.

The officer said the slain terrorist was wanted inconnection with the abduction and killing of two civilians and threatening special police officers (SPOs) and non-local labourers to leave the Valley.

A close associate of JeM self-styled chief commander Qari Yasir of Pakistan, who was killed in an encounter with security forces in Kupwara district in July 2013, Abu Saifullah was trapped along with his local associate during a search and cordon operation at Zaintrag village in the Awantipora area of Pulwama on Tuesday morning, he said.

The operation, which was launched on a specific information, turned into a gunfight when the hiding terrorists opened fire on the joint search parties of police, 50 Rashtriya Rifles and 185 Battalion of the CRPF, the officer said.

The heavy firing by the terrorists resulted in grievous bullet injuries to Sepoy Rahul Ranswal of the Rashtriya Rifles and SPO Shahbaz Ahmad of local police, who were evacuated to the Army’s 92 Base Hospital in Srinagar but both succumbed to injuries there, he said.

He will hold wide ranging talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Ram Nath Kovind and will be the chief guest at the Republic Day parade.

The two countries are likely to ink 15 pacts in the fields of social security, cyber security, health and medicine besides bio-energy.

The focus of the Brazilian visit will be to re-energise the ties between two countries in a number of key sectors, Secretary (East) in the External Affairs Ministry Vijay Thakur Singh said.

“The visit of President Bolsonaro is an extremely important visit. It will be an opportunity to re-energise our strategic partnership and take it forward in a focused manner,” she had said at a press conference on Thursday.

Bolsonaro is accompanied by eight ministers, four members of the Brazilian Parliament, senior officials and a large business delegation.

It will be the third time that a Brazilian President will be the chief guest at the Republic Day.

The last time there was a Brazilian president as chief guest was in 2004 and before that in 1996. The last Presidential visit from Brazil was by President Michel Temer in October 2016 on the sidelines of the eighth BRICS Summit in Goa. Modi visited Brazil in November to attend the XI BRICS Summit.

Moreover, Modi met Bolsonaro on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Osaka in June last year during which issues of bilateral importance were discussed.

Brazilian envoy Andre Aranha Correa do Lago to India had earlier said over 15 agreements will be signed during the Brazilian president’s visit, including one on the investment protection and facilitation treaty.

Bolsonaro, a former army captain, won a landslide victory in Brazil’s presidential election in October 2018 and took the reins of the country in January last year.

Bolsonaro will hold talks with Modi and President Kovind separately on Saturday. Thakur said there would be discussions on cooperation in key sectors such as defence, energy, trade and agriculture. Giving importance to trade, Bolsonaro will address a group of Indian and Brazilian business leaders at the India-Brazil Business Forum here on January 27, officials said.

“We have ongoing Defence cooperation as well as space cooperation and we are

looking at how to strengthen these,” she said.

India-Brazil ties have seen an upward trend in the last few years. The volume of bilateral trade was USD 8.2 billion in 2018-19. This included USD 3.8 billion worth of Indian exports to Brazil and USD 4.4 million as imports by India. Indian investments in Brazil were around USD 6 billion and Brazilian investments in India are estimated at USD 1 billion in 2018.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/india--brazil-aim-to-further-strengthen-ties.html

He said Valley based journalists have had to stand in queues at the ‘Media Facilitation Centre’ - set up by the administration in Srinagar - and rely on a dozen computers with internet access to file their stories and communicate with their editors.

“As Internet shutdown in Kashmir for the last nearly six months has virtually stopped free flow of information, journalists continue to face severe restrictions in all processes of news gathering, verification and dissemination leaving behind a troubled silence that bodes ill for freedom of expression and media freedom,” Tarigami said in a statement.

“Internet facilities remain inadequate for hundreds of journalists and district reporters who can’t make it to the centre every day,” he added.

This has virtually made them dependent on the state, and submission to government-regulated conditions makes a mockery of freedom of the press, the CPI(M) leader said.

“There were no reports on the effects of the communication shutdown on everyday lives of people, arrests, crippling of healthcare and other emergency services. What was not covered in the local press said a lot about the curtailment of the freedom of the press”, he said.The Constitution provides the right of freedom, given in Article 19 with the view of guaranteeing individual rights that were considered vital by the framers of the Constitution, he said.

“As we are going to celebrate 70th Republic Day in two days time, it is imperative on democratic forces including, intelligentsia and the civil society at large, to put their heads together, discuss the situation intensively and highlight the sufferings of people of J&K and make this BJP Government accountable,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/internet-gag-has-created-information-black-hole-in-kashmir--tarigami.html

Kajal Agarwal, a witness, stated in her testimony how the conspiracy unfolded and how fake resignation letter, leave and license agreement and ID card were created in Sheena’s name, the agency said.

Of the 253 witnesses, 60 have deposed, the agency said, adding that several key witnesses including Rahul, Indrani’s then husband Peter Mukerjea’s son from earlier marriage, were yet to be examined.

If released on bail, Indrani would abscond, or try to influence the witnesses, it said.

According to the CBI, Indrani was opposed to Rahul and Sheena’s relationship. On the day Sheena was killed, Rahul had seen Indrani and her driver waiting with Indrani’s car when he dropped Sheena in Bandra.

Sheena told Rahul that she will stay with Indrani for the night and it was the last time he saw her, the agency said in its reply. In her bail plea, Indrani claimed that “there was no evidence in the form of messages, conversations or e-mails or any communication” to show that she had hatched a conspiracy to abduct or kill Sheena.

Sheena (24) was allegedly strangled in a car by her mother Indrani, Indrani’s former husband Sanjeev Khanna and driver Shyamvar Rai in April 2012. Her body was burnt in a forest in neighbouring Raigad district.

Former media baron Peter Mukerjea was later arrested for allegedly being part of the conspiracy.

According to investigators, Indrani’s opposition to Sheena’s relationship with Rahul was a possible motive behind the murder apart from financial disputes.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cbi-opposes-indrani---s-bail-plea.html

verdict delivered in 2010 which ""is in violation of the guidelines"" passed by the apex court in a 2009 judgment which was later re-affirmed in a 2018 verdict.

""The contradiction is that while the Supreme Court in 2009 put the onus of assessment of damages and recovery from the accused on high courts of every state, whereas the Allahabad High Court had issued guidelines in 2010 judgement that let the state government to undertake these processes to recover damages, which has serious implications,"" it said.

""The judicial oversight/judicial security is a sort of safety mechanism against arbitrary action. This means that there is every chance that the ruling party in the state could go after its political opponents or others oppose to it to settle scores,"" the plea said.

It has also sought a direction to the Uttar Pradesh government to follow the procedure as per the 2009 and 2018 guidelines of the apex court while claiming damages to recover the losses caused to public property during such protests.

The plea has sought setting up of an independent judicial inquiry to probe into the incidents which happened during the protests against the CAA-NRC in Uttar Pradesh, as has been done by the Karnataka High Court.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/plea-in-sc-against-punitive-damages.html

144,25-1-20,Fadnavis rejects charge,"As the BJP found itself the dock over the alleged tapping of phones of NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut and others ordered by its government, its senior leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday denied the charge, saying that it was not Maharashtra’s culture of his party to tap the phones of its political opponents and his party was prepared to face any kind of inquiry.

A day after Maharashtra Home Ministry directed the Cyber cell of the State police to look into allegations of the phone tapping ordered by the previous BJP-headed saffron alliance Government ahead of the recent State Assembly polls, Senior Congress leader and State PWD Minister Ashok Chavan rooted for a comprehensive high-level inquiry into all aspects of the alleged phone tapping scam.

Talking to media persons here, State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said: “Ahead of the recent State Assembly polls, the previous BJP-led Government had ordered tapping the phones of senior NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena leaders to snoop into who they were talking to.

The allegation is also that the BJP-led Government had – using the Government funds -- sent a team of officials to Israel to buy spyware which the BJP used it to tap and used the conversations on mobile phones of our leaders for political purposes. We have started investigations into the alleged phone-tapping”.

The ordering of an inquiry into the alleged tapping of phones of Pawar, Uddhav, Raut and others comes in the wake of a sensational allegation made last week by senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh that the Maharashtra Government officials were involved in phone surveillance and that some state government officials had visited Israel and held talks with the Israeli firm NSO. NSO creates Pegasus, a spyware which WhatsApp recently revealed had been used extensively to extract private phone conversation data.

“Is the @Officeof UT going to give details in public that who was behind the snooping and tapping in Maharashtra. Who were the officers of Maharashtra who went to Israel to talk to NSO, the brain behind malware Pegasus,” Singh had tweeted.

Reacting to the inquiry instituted by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government into the alleged phone tapping ordered allegedly by the previous government led by him, Fadnavis said: “It is not Maharashtra’s culture to tap the phones of political opponents. (Referring to Digvijay Singh) the entire country knows about the person who has complained about the phone tapping.

The State Government is free to order an inquiry into the alleged phone by any agency. People of Maharashtra know the truth. At that time, Shiv Sena’s man was the Minister of State for Home”.

“My only request to this government is that it should conduct the inquiry into the alleged phone tapping forthwith and place the report before the people. If the government wants to send to someone Israel to conduct an inquiry, it can do so,” Fadnavis said.

Meanwhile, talking about the inquiry ordered by the State government into the alleged tapping indulged in by the previous Devendra Fadnavis government, Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut said: “ I had known earlier that the phones of some leaders were being tapped. I have friends in the BJP also who would sympathise with me. They would caution me to be careful while talking on phone since my conversations were being snooped. They had also told me that the government had brought a spyware from Israel”.

“I had told my BJP friends: Let them snoop on my conversations. I am a follower of late Bal Thackeray. I have never spoken to people in a hidden manner... It is good that the MVA government has ordered an inquiry into the alleged phone tapping,” Raut said.

In a statement issued to the media, Congress leader and senior minister in the MVA government Ashok Chavan said: “The allegation that the previous BJP-led government had ordered the tapping of the phones of senior Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena leaders is a serious issue. I have no doubt at all that the BJP can stoop to any level for the sake of power. Hence the chief minister should order a high-level inquiry into the alleged phone tapping”.

“Capturing total and unbridled power has been the only agenda of the BJP. For holding onto power, the BJP can trample upon morality, rules, precedents and traditions. This is not the case with just Maharashtra. We get to see these things in other states as well. Hence, we can ill-afford to ignore the allegations of phone tapping of our leaders ordered by the BJP-led government in its tenure. There is a need for a comprehensive inquiry and that too at a high-level,” Chavan said.

In related development, NCP minister Jitendra Awhad said: “ I had earlier said that the BJP was indulging in phone tapping and snooping. I had said that the BJP had brought the spy malware from Israel. Phone snooping is more serious thing than tapping. I stand vindicated for the allegations I had made in this regard earlier. I had known that some government officials had gone to Israel. Beyond that I did not know much.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/fadnavis-rejects-charge.html
145,25-1-20,DMK seeks urgent hearing on plea for disqualification of 11 AIADMK MLAs,"DMK moved the Supreme Court on Friday seeking urgent hearing of its plea for disqualification of 11 AIADMK MLAs, including Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam, who voted against Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami in a confidence motion in 2017.

A Bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde said it will consider listing the matter for urgent hearing.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for DMK, sought urgent listing of the plea and referred to the recent apex court verdict in the Manipur minister case in which the Speaker has been directed to decide on disqualification of Manipur Forest Minister Th Shyamkumar in four weeks.

The apex court had on Tuesday said Parliament should “rethink” whether the Speaker of a House should continue to have powers to disqualify lawmakers as such a functionary “belongs to a particular political party”.

During the last hearing in the AIADMK MLAs’ disqualification case however, it wondered as to why courts should venture into the question of disqualification of MLAs for defection when the Constitution has conferred this power to the Assembly speaker. The Madras High Court had in April 2018 dismissed DMK’s plea seeking to disqualify the MLAs.

The High Court had rejected the petition citing pendency of a plea in the apex court on the powers of a court to issue directions to the Speaker of a state Assembly.

The petitioner had sought disqualification of Panneerselvam and ten others for having voted against the K Palaniswami Government last year when they were in the rebel camp.

The petitioner had contended in the High Court that by voting against the trust motion, these MLAs had violated the whip issued by ruling party and hence attracted disqualification under the anti-defection law.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/dmk-seeks-urgent-hearing-on-plea-for-disqualification-of-11-aiadmk-mlas.html
146,25-1-20,SC to hear in open court plea of Fadnavis seeking review of verdict asking him to face trial,"The Supreme Court has agreed to hear in open court former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis’ plea seeking review of its verdict which said the BJP leader will have to face trial for allegedly failing to furnish details of two pending criminal cases in his 2014 poll affidavit.

“Application seeking oral hearing of review petitions in open court is/are allowed. List review petitions before the court,” a Bench of Justices Arun Mishra, Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose said in its Thursday’s order.

On Oct 1 2019, the apex court had set aside the Bombay High Court order which had given a clean chit to Fadnavis and had held that he did not deserve to be tried for the alleged offences under the Representation of People’s (RP) Act.

The apex court’s verdict had come on an appeal by one Satish Ukey, who had challenged the high court’s order.

On July 23, 2019, the top court, while reserving the verdict, had said that the alleged “omission” by Fadnavis of not disclosing information about two criminal cases in his election affidavit may be decided in the trial.

The apex court had said that it was concerned with a limited issue whether prima facie Section 125A of the RP Act is attracted or not. The provision deals with the penalty for “filing false affidavit” and says that if a candidate or his proposer fails to furnish or gives false or conceals any information in his nomination paper on issues like pending criminal cases then the person may be awarded six months jail term or fine or both.

Ukey had contended that the chief minister filed a false affidavit by not disclosing two criminal matters and yet the trial court and the high court held that there no prima facie case was made out for prosecution of the Chief Minister.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sc-to-hear-in-open-court-plea-of-fadnavis-seeking-review-of-verdict-asking-him-to-face-trial.html

The top court had earlier stayed the Rajasthan High Court’s order cancelling the notifications reorganising certain ‘gram panchayats’ and ‘panchayat samitis’ in the State after November 15-16, 2019.

157,25-1-20,"India can end up with five per cent real GDP growth this Fiscal, says Debroy","India can end up with a real GDP growth of five per cent this financial year excluding the inflation rate, Bibek Debroy, the chairman of PM’s Economic Advisory Council said on Friday.

In the present scenario achieving a nine per cent GDP growth will be difficult, he said at the Tata Steel Kolkata Literary Meet here.

“The aspirational growth rate could be between 6.5 per cent to 7 per cent. At this stage it will be difficult to attain nine per cent GDP growth,” he said.

“This year the growth rate will end at five per cent and this is real and not nominal... Next year, the GDP growth rate could be anything between 6 to 6.5 per cent,” he said.

Recently IMF had pegged India’s GDP growth at 4.8 per cent for 2019-20, much less than its October projection of 6.1 per cent.

Debroy said that Indian economy at present is growing in an environment which is somewhat protectionist and has declining exports.

“The period during which the country grew at high GDP growth rates like nine per cent, the exports-to-GDP ratio was 20 per cent. But now with developed countries resorting to protectionism and after the collapse of the WTO, contribution of exports to GDP in a large way does not seem possible”, he said.

Debroy said “With India being strong in services and not manufacturing, the country will have to give some to get some. It is a quid pro quo situation particularly in a regional trade bloc kind of arrangement”.

On taxation regime, he said that the country is moving towards stable direct tax regime without any exemption.

“Goods and Services Tax (GST) is still work in progress. GST was supposed to be revenue neutral. But the government has lost revenue post-GST implementation, which is not tenable,” Debroy said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/india-can-end-up-with-five-per-cent-real-gdp-growth-this-fiscal--says-debroy.html
158,25-1-20,ISIS planning attack on Delhi on R-Day,"Pakistan's notorious spy agency Inter Services Intelligence is seeking to orchestrate attacks during the Republic Day celebrations in Delhi and the National Capital Region, intelligence agencies have alerted.

According to inputs with the intelligence agencies here, some overground workers of the terror groups might have infiltrated in the national capital. The OGWs are suspected to be linked to the Pakistani terror group Al Badr. ISI has tasked Hizbul Mujahideen commander Riyaz Naikoo to revive the Al Badr outfit through some spectacular hit around the Republic Day here.

Naikoo has also been tasked to recruit and train the cadres of Al Badr for the hits. Naikoo in turn has tasked his second-in-command Hammad who has taken up the responsibility of reorganising the Al Badr which has been dormant for the last few years.

After being trained by the Hizbul Mujahideen, the recruits of Al Badr will use the logistics network of the former for executing the planned attacks. But Al Badr will own responsibility for the hits, according to the inputs.

The move comes amid heightened vigil along the Line of Control in J&K post-abrogation Article 370 and reorganization of the erstwhile State of J&K into two U Ts-J&K and Ladakh.Following this, ISI backed terror groups are facing existential crisis and through such attacks they are aiming to register their presence as well as seek to portray Kashmir as a flashpoint, an Intelligence official said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/isis-planning-attack-on-delhi-on--r-day.html

160,25-1-20,Puducherry Min blames Guv for notice of AFT mill closure,"The verbal sparring between the Puducherry government and Lt Governor Kiran Bedi continued with Labour Minister M Kandasamy on Friday alleging that the recent announcement over proposed closure of the government run AFT Mill on April 30 was done under pressure from her.

In a releasehere, the minister declared as ""illegal and inoperative"" the notice issued on January 21 by the Anglo French Textile mill Managing Director that it would be closed.

He alleged that the AFT Managing Director had issued the closure notice ""under pressure and directions of the Lt Governor"". Kandasamy said neither the cabinet nor the Chief Minister had issued any instructions to close the mill.Hence the notice was 'ultra vires and has no sanction of the rules governing the working of the mill"", he said.

The Minister said the cabinet had taken a decision some time back that AFT should continue to function in the workers' interests and those opting for Voluntary Retirement Scheme should be permitted to take it if they chose to do so.

But no step should be taken at any stage to close the undertaking of the territorial administration, Kandasamy said. He said the decision to close AFT was taken without the knowledge of the Ministry, the Chief Minister or the Minister concerned and violated the rules relating to the administration of the mill issued in 1986.

The Minister said the differences of opinion between the cabinet and the Lt Governor on the matter had been referred to the Home Ministry for clarification. ""Until the MinistryRs s decision is known, nothing should be done to close the mill. The closure notice issued by the official was illegal and inoperative"", Kandasamy said.

On Thursday, Chief Minister V Narayanasamy, who has been at loggerheads with Bedi on various issues, accused her of intimidating and pressuring officers of the century-old mill and giving directions to them to close it.

However, Bedi, in an official release, had said the Labour Department would hold an enquiry into the future of the mill and enlist the views of its management, workmen and others, including the bankers.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/puducherry-min-blames-guv-for-notice-of-aft-mill-closure.html

For this rally to maintain a lot will depend on the actual outcome of Budget & final Q3 earnings trajectory, market is turning a bit cautious before the big event.”

Recovery in global markets after the World Health Organisation designated coronavirus infection an emergency for China, but not yet for the rest of the world, also buoyed benchmarks.

Hemang Kapasi, portfolio manager (equity investment products) at Sanctum Wealth Management said, “Market is wholeheartedly rewarding the stocks with stellar earnings growth.

Brent crude oil futures rose 0.15 per cent to USD 62.13 per barrel.

Rupee falls by 7 paise

The rupee depreciated by 7 paise to close at 71.33 against the US dollar on Friday due to dollar demand from importers amid a correction in crude oil prices following outbreak of coronavirus in China. Gains in the US dollar against the world currencies also weighed on the rupee sentiment.

At the Interbank foreign exchange market, the domestic currency opened weak at 71.34 against the previous close of 71.26. The unit recovered to a high of 71.22 later after a rally in domestic stocks, but it erased gains due to dollar demand from importers. The Indian currency finally settled at 71.33, registering a loss of 7 paise over the previous close.

“USD/INR has been trading in a very border range for 71.00 - 71.50 this entire week. Lower oil prices has offset month-end dollar demand which has kept USDINR in tight range. Going forward, next week FOMC meeting and India’s union budget will keep rupee on an edge. Also a major development on China coronavirus can be a spoilsport. Overall for next week, USD/INR is expected to trade in a range which crucial supports placed at 71.05 and 71.60 can act as a major resistances,” Rahul Gupta, head of research (currency), Emkay Global Financial Services said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/sensex--nifty-advance-for-2nd-day-on-pre-budget-rally-in-banking-stocks.html

165,25-1-20,"Ahead of budget, Das underlines need for more structural reforms to revive growth","With just a week left for the budget, Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on Friday called for structural reforms and more fiscal measures to revive consumption demand and the overall growth, saying monetary policy has its own limitations to achieve these objectives.

The Narendra Modi government in its second term will present the first full budget next Saturday, at a time when the advance estimate of GDP has projected nominal growth plunging to a 48-year-low of 7.5 per cent and real growth hitting an 11-year low of 5 per cent or thereabout.

“Monetary policy has its own limits. Structural reforms and fiscal measures may have to be continued and further activated to provide a durable push to demand and boost growth,” Das told the students of St Stephen’s College, Delhi, his alma mater. The statement has to be seen in the context of growth hitting a six-year low of 4.5 percent in the September quarter.

It can be noted that successive GDP prints have been hurtling down quarter after quarter since the second term of the Modi government. Falling consumer price inflation has given the legroom to the central bank to cut interest rates by a whopping 135 bps to a nine-year low of 5.15 per cent in four successive rate reductions between February and October 2019.

Even a historic corporate tax cut to a low 25 per cent last August did not revive the animal spirit of the economy as amidst falling demand companies are holding back investment into capacity addition as most of them are under-utilising their installed capacity.

Das also listed out some of the priority areas where structural reforms are necessary and if carried out in earnest can act as potential growth drivers and through backward and forward linkages can give significant push to growth.

He called for prioritising food processing industries, tourism, e-commerce and startups and also making the domestic economy a part of the global value chain.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/ahead-of-budget--das-underlines-need-for-more-structural-reforms-to-revive-growth.html

On Friday, the Democrats will press their final day of arguments before skeptical Republican senators, focusing on the second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress’ investigation.

As the audience of Senate jurors sat through another long day, and night, the prosecutors outlined how they said Trump abused power for his own personal political benefit ahead of the 2020 election, even as the nation’s top FBI and national security officials were publicly warning off the theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 election.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/---bogus----ukraine-theory-led-to-trump---s-abuse--dems-tell-trial.html
167,25-1-20,Thousands turn up for ‘million’ Iraq rally against US troops,"Thousands rallied in Baghdad on Friday to demand that American troops leave the country, though their numbers fell short of the “million-man” march called for by an influential Shiite cleric.

The rally came amid heightened anti-US sentiment after a US drone strike earlier this month killed a top Iranian general in the Iraqi capital.

Since mid-morning, large crowds gathered on the Muslim day of prayers as loudspeakers blasted “No, no America!” at a central square in Baghdad. A child held up a poster reading, “Death to America. Death to Israel.” But by the afternoon the rally had failed to reach the critical numbers called for by radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Apparently seeking to show control, al-Sadr’s supporters did not engage in altercations with security forces or target the separate, anti-government protests in neighboring Tahrir Square, a possibility feared by activists in the lead-up to Friday’s march.

Officials and experts said the rally was the cleric’s attempt to capitalise on brewing anti-American feeling and show he had the upper-hand on the Iraqi street as negotiations among political elites over who should be the next prime minister stumble on. In his weekly Friday sermon, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq’s most revered Shiite cleric, called on political parties stop stalling and move the talks forward.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/thousands-turn-up-for----million----iraq-rally-against-us-troops.html

Between 15 and 19 January, more than 38,000 people fled violence in the rebel-held west of Aleppo province, which neighbours the main opposition bastion of Idlib, the UN humanitarian affairs office (OCHA) said.

OCHA spokesman David Swanson said the displaced were heading north into territory controlled by Turkish-backed rebel forces or west into jihadist-dominated Idlib province.

Britain-based war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, says some of the deadliest strikes of recent days have been carried out by government ally Russia.

But Moscow has denied launching any combat operations in the region since a ceasefire it agreed with rebel supporter Ankara went into effect earlier this month.

The Observatory said Russian bombardment targeted the west of Aleppo province on Friday without causing any casualties.

The latest wave of displacement compounds a dire humanitarian situation in the rebel-held northwest where more than 358,000 civilians had already been displaced by the intensified bombardment launched in December.

172,25-1-20,Hawker of life,"Artist Biplab Sarkar’s exhibition I wonder revolves around his observations of street vendors which inspired him to balance his work and chaos in everyday interactions. By Team Viva

It’s very evident that your art has been inspired by everyday things and especially the life of hawkers. What inspired you to paint them?

Life does not hand out benefits evenly and there are people who are less fortunate. My case was similar. My family’s financial conditions were not good and completing my education became a challenge for us. Though I managed to complete it through my savings, my mind was always in a chaos due to financial hardships which always bothered me and prevented me from being at peace. During my graduation in History Honours, I also worked as a part-time drawing teacher in a school. I had to take a break for two to three months from my job to prepare for my final year exams. Post exams, the school refused to re-hire me. Working, for me, was essential as I did not have a strong financial background. I wanted to pursue Fine Arts so I appeared for an exam and was selected at Shantiniketan. I travelled for three hours every day from Kolkata. Later, I moved to Delhi for Masters in Fine Arts from Delhi College of Arts. But I faced a lot of difficulties as the curriculum, culture and way of teaching was very different from that of Shantiniketan. This held me back from focussing on my studies.

Often I observed roadside hawkers who, despite their troubled lives, have managed the chaos and continued with their work. This spirit inspired me. Their mantra of balancing work and life drew me towards them. I started talking to them and understanding their state of mind. I began to sketch them.

Is there a particular thing about hawkers that you want to highlight through your art?

Yes, of course. All these hawkers selling their wares on the streets have many domestic problems and yet they manage to remain calm. When I began talking to them, I realised that the common notion about hawkers is that they are extremely poor and hence, we purchase something from them so that we can help them. However, this is not true for everyone. One might be surprised to know that these people make around Rs 35-40,000 per month. While returning from work, I observed that they took reserved rickshaws, while I travelled by a bus. All these details excited me and drew me towards understanding their mindset. I started observing their gestures and manners through which they executed their work irrespective of all that surrounded them. With no financial or political burden, they are content and happy. I have highlighted the same in my art.

How do you explore the relationship between body and object in an urban setting through your work?

The hawkers sell their objects as salesman, as there is a significant difference in the price of objects in stores and what they sell. There are quite a few mediums of making objects , one of them being plastic. For me, both object and figure are important, but I have highlighted both separately in my work. I have used pen and ink to outline the objects. This describes the relationship between body and object while distinguishing them from each other.

Since you communicated with hawkers for your art, can you share some of the anecdotes or stories that you came across?

I have spoken to a few hawkers, out of which two of them were elderly and have been working for almost 20-25 years. One of them told me the story of his two sons who are working in the government sector. Their daily schedule bored them so they came to street to sell objects to break the monotony of their lives. Another hawker told me about an incident 20 odd years back which I remember only faintly. He saw someone place a bomb inside a dustbin near India Gate. During those days, there wasn’t any security in that area. The hawker I spoke to was the first person to notify the police of this incident. So, yes, one comes across many such stories while talking to these hawkers as they are the eyes and ears in a busy working street even as we don’t pay attention.

You were honoured with the ‘Emerging Artist of the Year’ award in 2018. How do you think such awards help artists get the recognition they deserve?

Glenfiddich’s Artists in Residence programme is a great platform for emerging Indian artists as it provides inspiration and guidance to grow one’s artistic vision. Being selected as the Glenfiddich ‘Emerging Artist of the Year’ and to represent the country on a global platform gave a tremendous boost to my confidence. The jury that judges the works includes leading artists, gallery owners, art critics and art collectors During the three-month residency at the Glenfiddich distillery, I got the opportunity to engage with artists from different countries and cultures, which opened an all new world for me. We were closely mentored by the Global Curator of the programme, Andy Fairgrieve.

How have you showcased the difference between hawkers in Scotland and India in your work?

There is a huge difference in their work styles in terms of discipline. In Scotland, the workers in the distillery organise themselves according to time. Each process is timed including the breaks, whereas in India the hawkers work according to their state of mind, mood and availability of objects. Sometimes a hawker is replaced by another family member or friend, depending on their availability during the day. They even work shift wise where one family member takes after the other in the latter part of the day. They take breaks according to their mood and situations surrounding them. Hence, discipline is the major difference I spotted during my time in Scotland.

What is your take on Glenfiddich’s Artists in Residence Programme?

It is a great platform for emerging Indian artists as it provides the inspiration and guidance to grow one’s artistic vision. The experience was nothing short of life-changing. It helped me to learn and explore the culture from Scotland and draw inspiration from it to curate my work. Additionally, the showcasing of one’s work at this level opens up a plethora of opportunities for an artist which, otherwise, could have been a major challenge for someone coming from a background like me. The jury involved in the judgment process is of international standards, which lifts one’s confidence to a higher level and being recognised by them is nothing less than a lifetime achievement.

173,25-1-20,"Raids on Lalit hotels group, promoter led to Rs 1,000-cr black foreign assets: CBDT","The Income Tax Department’s searches on the Bharat Hotels Group that runs a chain of luxury units under the Lalit Hotels brand has led to the detection of “undisclosed” foreign assets of over Rs 1,000 crore and huge black money that the business house has “stashed” abroad, the CBDT said on Friday.

While the policy-making body of the department did not take any names in the statement, official sources confirmed it to be the Bharat Hotels Group that functions under its Chief Managing Director (CMD) Jyotsna Suri.

The department had launched raids at 13 premises of the group, Suri, and others on January 19 in and around Delhi.

“The investigation has successfully lifted the veil leading to detection of undisclosed foreign assets of more than Rs 1,000 crore, apart from domestic tax evasion of more than Rs 35 crore, which may lead to consequences under the Black Money Act, 2015, as also, action under the I-T Act, respectively,” the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said.

“Foreign assets include investment in a hotel in the UK, immovable properties in the UK and the UAE and deposits with foreign banks,” it said.

The CBDT said the group is a “leading member of the hospitality industry, running a hotel abroad and a chain of luxury hotels under a prominent brand name situated at various locations in India”.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/raids-on-lalit-hotels-group--promoter-led-to-rs-1-000-cr-black-foreign-assets--cbdt.html
174,25-1-20,Growth slowdown in India temporary: IMF chief,"IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva on Friday said growth slowdown in India appears to be temporary and that she expects the momentum to improve going ahead.

The world appears a better place in January 2020 compared to what it was when IMF announced its World Economic Outlook in October 2019, she said at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2020 here.

She said the factors driving this positive momentum include receding trade tension after the US-China first phase trade deal and synchronised tax cuts, among others.

She, however, said 3.3 per cent is not a fantastic growth rate for the world economy.

“It is still sluggish growth. We want fiscal policies to be more aggressive and we want structural reforms and more dynamism,” the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said.

On Monday, the fund lowered growth estimate for the world economy to 2.9 per cent for 2019, citing “negative surprises” in few emerging market economies, especially India.

The IMF also revised downwards its forecast for India to 4.8 per cent for 2019-20.

Regarding emerging markets, Georgieva on Friday said they are also moving forward.

“We had a downgrade in one large market India but we believe that’s temporary. We expect momentum to improve further going ahead. There are also some bright spots like Indonesia and Vietnam,” she noted.

According to Georgieva, a number of African countries are doing very well, but some other nations like Mexico are not.

On risks ahead for the global economy, the IMF chief listed factors like weakness in long-term productivity growth and low inflation.

“We are living in a more risk-prone world. It is only January and there have been events that are sparking risks for the global economy,” she added.

Releasing an update to its World Economic Outlook (WEO) on Monday, the IMF had said global growth, estimated at 2.9 per cent in 2019, is projected to increase to 3.3 per cent in 2020 and inch up further to 3.4 per cent in 2021.

Compared to the October WEO forecast, the estimate for 2019 and the projection for 2020 represent 0.1 percentage point reductions for each year while that for 2021 is 0.2 percentage point lower.

“A more subdued growth forecast for India... Accounts for the lion’s share of the downward revisions,” it had said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/growth-slowdown-in-india-temporary--imf-chief-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/growth-slowdown-in-india-temporary--imf-chief.html
175,25-1-20,"Petrol, diesel prices see big cuts on Saturday","Fuel prices were dropped further on Saturday after international crude oil rates fell sharply following the outbreak of Coronavirus in China.

The price of petrol was cut by 27 paise and that of diesel by diesel by 30 paise a litre across all major cities on Saturday.

The petrol now costs Rs 74.16 a litre in Delhi, Rs 79.76 a litre in Mumbai, Rs 76.77 a litre in Kolkata and Rs 77.03 a litre in Chennai after the price cut.

Similarly, diesel costs Rs 67.31 a litre in Delhi, Rs 70.56 a litre in Mumbai, Rs 69.67 per litre in Kolkata and Rs 71.11 a litre in Chennai, according to the Indian Oil Corporation website.

Brent crude was trading at $60.56 per barrel on Saturday morning, down by 2.43 per cent from the previous close of $62.07 per barrel on fears of slump in demand follwing the outbreak of deadly Coronavirus in China.

The retail prices of fuel are dependent on the international crude prices and the rupee-US dollar exchange rate as India imports almost 80 per cent of its crude requirements.

Domestic petrol and diesel prices are reviewed by oil marketing companies on a daily basis. Price revisions are implemented at the fuel stations with effect from 6 a.m.

176,25-1-20,S Korea confirms second case,"South Korea on Friday confirmed its second case of the SARS-like virus that has killed at least 25 in China, as concerns mount about a wider outbreak.

Several nations including the US have stepped up checks on airport passengers to detect the coronavirus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

The virus has caused alarm in China and abroad because of its genetic similarities to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.

On Friday, Seoul’s health ministry said a South Korean man in his 50s started experiencing symptoms while working in Wuhan on Jan 10.

He was tested upon returning to the country earlier this week, and was confirmed to be South Korea’s second case of the virus on Thursday, the ministry added.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/s-korea-confirms-second-case.html
177,25-1-20,"China shuts down 13 cities, toll hits 26","Battling the fast spreading coronavirus, China on Friday said that it is building a 1,000-bed hospital for patients infected with the deadly virus that has claimed 26 lives so far with confirmed cases rising sharply to over 880, prompting authorities to shut down 13 cities during the country’s most important holiday.

Dampening the celebrations of the Lunar New Year, China, in an unprecedented move, has shut down transportation in at least 13 cities — Wuhan and 12 of its neighbours — in central China’s Hubei province to contain the coronavirus.

According to the National Health Commission, 26 people have died so far with over 880 confirmed cases being treated mostly in Hubei province. Twenty nine provinces have reported the cases.

China’s biggest city Shanghai raised the emergency response of public health safety to level 1, the highest, following Beijing, and Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Guangdong provinces as more cases were reported.

Beijing so far reported 34 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, official media reported.

The Chinese disease prevention authority on Friday released pictures and information of the first Wuhan Coronavirus that Chinese experts had discovered.

The Wuhan local government is rushing to build a 1,000-bedded hospital in the outskirts of Wuhan to treat coronavirus patients.

Dozens of excavators were feverishly working at the site where the hospital will be built on the 25000 sq metres just about 10 days’ time. It will be put into use by February 3, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Workers are being paid 1,200 yuan ($173) per day, three times their usual wage, to accelerate the construction.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Thursday stopped short of declaring the virus a global public health emergency, despite China’s climbing death toll. The virus has spread to Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and the United States as of Thursday.

179,25-1-20,Trump should be removed: Lead impeachment manager,"Lead House impeachment manager Adam Schiff called dramatically for the Senate to remove President Donald Trump from office Thursday, saying the US leader cannot be trusted to put the country’s interests ahead of his own.

“The American people deserve a president they can count on, to put their interest first,” said Schiff.

His impassioned words capped a long day in which Democrats detailed Trump’s illicit scheme to pressure Ukraine to help his 2020 reelection campaign.

“You know, you can’t trust this president to do what is right for this country. You can trust he will do what’s right for Donald Trump,” Schiff added.

“He’ll do it now. He’s done it before. He’ll do it for the next several months. He’ll do it in the election if he’s allowed to. This is why, if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed.” “Because right matters. And truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.”

As the 100 senators sat as jurors and millions of Americans watched on television, House impeachment managers mustered scores of videos, internal documents and extensive witness testimony to lay out a strong case that the US leader abused his powers.

Schiff’s prosecution team detailed how Trump flagrantly undertook last year to force Kiev to help him tarnish his possible 2020 reelection rival, former vice president Joe Biden.

“President Trump used the powers of his office to solicit a foreign nation to interfere in our elections for his own personal benefit,” House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler told the chamber.

“Since President George Washington took office in 1789, no president has abused his power in this way,” Nadler said.

“The president has repeatedly, flagrantly, violated his oath... The president’s conduct is wrong. It is illegal. And it is dangerous.”

180,25-1-20,‘Novelty inspires me’,"Actor Ayushmann Khurrana says that issues, which were so far the preserve of arthouse cinema, are now a part of the mainstream leitmotif and finding resonance in the audience

Known for portraying ordinary men, often flawed and insecure, with almost no one character being similar to the other, actor Ayushmann Khurrana says novelty of any kind inspires him.

“Novelty inspires me, any kind, any shape or form. It could be the first attempt in Hindi cinema. Even that inspires me. Any person living a mundane life, having a 9-5 job, and still motivated to live, that inspires me, because as an artist you have a very vibrant life. You live a different character each day,” he said.

Khurrana, whose next film Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan based on homosexuality is slated to hit the theatres on February 21, said he has prepared for each of his vastly diverse roles by being with the milieu and also banked on his exposure to Hindi theatre and convent education.

“The idea is to be one with the milieu, get grasp of the colloquial jargons and twangs, and India is a country where every 10 kilometres, the dialect changes. I am glad that I have done Hindi theatre and public speaking, though I received convent education. So that made me quite a linguist. That exposure was quite early in life,” he said.

From essaying the role a sperm donor in his debut film Vicky Donor, to depicting a man with erectile dysfunction in Shubh Mangal Saavdhan, or a blind pianist in Andhadhun, Khurrana has been hailed as having “cornered the market when it comes to playing flawed, insecure men with confidence issues.”

His films generally set in small towns in middle class environs have time and again dealt with taboo subjects and are sprinkled with liberal doses of wit, humour and comic situations.

“By default, these characters are set in small towns. That’s where the conflict is there. In urban centres, like Delhi, Mumbai or Kolkata, they are receptive to taboo subjects. So where is the conflict then? In the middle class society, we’re like the flag bearers of morality. That’s where the humour emanates, when you are stuck in that conventional dogma. And even though the situation is funny, for the male lead or the main lead, it is tragic,” he said.

As for his forthcoming film, Khurrana says he knows many who are a part of LGBTQ (lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgenders and queers) community. “And it’s a journey. I am learning every minute,” he said.

The 35-year-old actor gave credit to the audience for receiving well his films themed on progressive subjects. “The choices I am making are going down well with the audience. People are also evolving and receiving well these subjects which are progressive. Earlier, these used to be for arthouse cinema. But now these have become mainstream too, wherein there is a great collaboration of content and commerce. It is evoking good responses,” he added.

Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan would be another case study, the actor said and called it the first film dealing with homosexuality in the realm of the commercial Hindi cinema.

“In parallel or arthouse cinema, we have seen films dealing with homosexuality. But those were the films catering to the converted. The audience watching these films are within the LGBTQ community already. We want to reach out to people, who are averse to homosexuality. This is the first Hindi mainstream commercial film in India based on the subject. We hope it will at least usher in the conversation and have a discussion on the LGBTQ,” Khurrana said.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---novelty-inspires-me----2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/---novelty-inspires-me---.html
181,25-1-20,It is Sindhu’s duty to adapt with crammed calender: Gopi,"Chief national coach Pullela Gopichand admitted to crammed BWF itinerary causing a problem but at the same time believes that onus is on a player of PV Sindhu’s calibre to adapt to the calender instead of complaining about it.

Apart from the World Championships Gold, Sindhu failed to win any other tournament last year.

“I think the crammed schedule is a problem for the top players, but also to be fair, I think the whole world it’s been an issue. As a top player, it’s her (Sindhu) duty to adapt without complaining,” Gopichand said.

“So I think, yes, Sindhu is working on some of those mistakes, and hopefully we’ll be able to sort it out.”

Gopichand exuded confidence that Sindhu will be able to turn it around in time ahead of the Olympics and will be able to win a medal at Tokyo, despite her dip in form.

“I do believe that she has a bright chance. And having said that, I think whether it’s the Tai Tzu Ying or Carolina Marin, whether it’s the Japanese or the Thai girls, I think there is definitely good amount of competition. But I am saying who’s done well in the past, and I do believe that with some good preparation, she will do well.”

While Sindhu is assured of a ticket to Tokyo, time is running out for Saina Nehwal and Kidambi Srikanth to make the cut but Gopichand said the Indian duo can still qualify with some good performances in a couple of tournaments.

London Olympics Bronze medallist Saina and Srikanth suffered opening round losses at the Thailand Masters and are currently placed at the 22nd and 26th spots respectively in the Race To Tokyo BWF Olympic Qualification ranking.

Each country is allowed two singles quota provided their ranking is inside top-16 within the cut-off date of April 28.

“I think it’s about seven tournaments going into the the Olympic qualifications, I think they will need to perform really well to qualify for the Olympics,” Gopichand said.

“And they are at the moment of borderline, one or two good performances can clearly put them in a good space to qualify for the Olympics.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/it-is-sindhu---s-duty-to-adapt-with-crammed-calender--gopi.html
182,25-1-20,Indian TT teams disappoint in Olympic qualifier,"Indian men and women failed to deliver when it mattered most, losing to Slovenia and Romania respectively in the pre-quarterfinals of the Olympic qualifying team event to significantly reduce their chances qualifying for the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo.

While the 17th seeded women played their hearts before losing to fifth seeds Romania 2-3, the men disappointed with their 1-3 defeat against Slovenia.

The fifth seeded men’s team comprising G Sathiyan (world rank 30) and veteran Sharath Kamal (WR 33) was expected to get the better of 11th seeded Slovenia.

After winning the opening doubles, Sathiyan, Harmeet Desai and Sharath came a cropper in the singles, severely denting the chances of team qualification at the Olympics.

A quarterfinal finish would have guaranteed an Olympic berth but now, both the men and women’s squad have to win the plate division to qualify. All losers in the round of 16 will take part in the knock-out plate event.

The Indian women’s team played really well to take Romania to the distance before running out of steam.

After Ayhika Mukhejee and Sutirtha Mukherjee lost the opening doubles, India number one and 61st ranked Manika Batra levelled the tie with a fine win over world number 19 Bernadette Szocs.

However, Romania regained the lead in the match after Elizabeta Samara steamrolled Ayhika 10-12, 11-5, 2-11, 7-11.

The Indian women looked down and out before Sutirtha, ranked 157, gave a new lease of life to her team with a fighting win over Szocs, an opponent ranked more than 100 places higher than her.

In probably her biggest win till date, Sutirtha edged Szocs 8-11, 11-7, 11-9, 3-11, 11-4. The match was levelled at 2-2.

183,25-1-20,Recalled Malik leads Pak win,"Recalled Shoaib Malik smashed a solid half-century to anchor Pakistan’s five-wicket win over Bangladesh in first Twenty20I on Friday.

Malik’s 45-ball 58 not out for his eighth Twenty20 fifty as Pakistan overhauled a modest 142-run target in 19.3 over to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.

Bangladesh had managed 141-5 in their 20 overs with openers Mohammad Naim scoring 41-ball 43 and Tamim Iqbal hit 34-ball 39 as Pakistan’s three-man pace attack kept them in check on a flat Gadaffi stadium pitch.

The win further consolidated Pakistan’s chances of hanging on to their world number one ranking in the shortest format. If they lose any of the remaining matches — on today and on Monday, also in Lahore, Australia will replace them at the top.

Malik, playing his first match since February last year, was in sublime form as he hit five boundaries and added 46 for the third wicket with debutant Ahsan Ali who made 32-ball 36 with four boundaries.

Malik, fourth leading run-getter in Twenty20 internationals with 2321 in a record 112 matches, credited bowlers for the win.

“Congratulations to the whole Pakistan for this win and for hosting another match,” said Malik.

“It wasn’t an easy pitch and our bowlers restricted them to a gettable total.

“It’s tough to be in and out of the team but I have been playing leagues and domestic cricket and that helped me stage a comeback in this match.

“I am happy to help achieve this win in a chase.”

Earlier, Bangladesh, who won the toss and opted to bat, were off to a good start as Iqbal and Naim put on 70 for the opening wicket.

Iqbal was run out in the 11th over while Naim holed out off spinner Shadab Khan in the 15th.

During a rain-hit final group A league encounter reduced to 23-overs per-side, India scored 115 for no loss in 23 overs with openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (57 not out off 72 balls) and Divyansh Saxena (52 no off 62 balls) hitting half-centuries.

New Zealand needed 193 as per DLS method calculations but managed only 147 in 21 overs as India emerged group toppers with six points.

Left-arm orthodox Ankolekar, who played through pain with a fractured finger on his right hand, had figures of 3 for 28 in five overs with some accurate wicket-to-wicket bowling. This was after New Zealand No 3 Fergus Lellman hit him for two sixes off his first two deliveries.

Bishnoi, a Rs 2 crore buy for Kings XI Punjab, is fast turning out to be the biggest star in the junior line-up with his variation and control. He bowled googlies, sliders and top-spinners to end with 4 for 30 from five overs as vice-captain Dhruv Jurel was fantastic behind the stumps with some neat glovework.

India will now meet Australia in the Super League quarters at Potchfestroom on January 28.

Put into bat, both Yashasvi and Divyansh were watchful but didn’t wait to punish the loose deliveries. Yashasvi, who will be playing for Rajasthan Royals in the 2020 IPL, again held anchor hitting four boundaries and two sixes.

His opening partner Divyansh was a bit more aggressive as he hit six boundaries in his half-century. Just when they had completed a century stand, the heavens opened up to play spoilsport.

The home team relied on opener George Worker’s 135 and Cole McConchie’s brisk 56 to post 295 for seven in the stipulated 50 overs after being sent into bat at the Hagley Oval.

In reply, the visiting team was stopped at 266 for nine.

Opting to bowl after winning the toss, India A tasted early success when Mohammed Siraj dismissed Rachin Ravindra for a nought.

Left-arm spinner Axar Patel accounted for Glenn Phillips as New Zealand A found the going tough in the middle.

Ishan Porel picked up a couple of wickets by the time the innings entered the middle overs, leaving the visitors struggling at 96 for four in the 22nd over. Krunal Pandya made it worse by removing Mark Chapman.

At 109 for five in the 25th over, the hosts badly needed someone to steady the ship, and Worker, Jimmy Neesham (33) and McConchie came to their rescue. During his 144-ball knock, Worker smashed six sixes and 12 boundaries. McConchie then scored some quick runs, hitting eights fours in his 54-ball knock.

India A’s reply was not good as they lost their in-form opener Prithvi Shaw (2) in the first over.

Leading the team in the absence of Shubman Gill, Mayank Agarwal made 37 off 42 balls, while Ishan Kishan scored 44 off 55 deliveries.

Agarkar confirmed that he has applied for the national selector’s position.

Agarkar, who is a former chairman of Mumbai senior selection committee, is in contention for the chairman’s post as the new constitution doesn’t have provisions for zonal system.

It can also be confirmed that former India medium pacer and junior chairman of selectors Venkatesh Prasad has once again applied for senior selector’s post although he has only around one and half years of his cumulative term left. With BCCI setting January 24 as the deadline for sending applications, the 42-year-old Agarkar is certainly the most high-profile name with 26 Tests, 191 ODIs and 3 T20 Internationals, picking 349 wickets across formats.

“Ajit entering the fray is an interesting development. He is someone who would have put in a lot of thought before applying.

The experienced middle-order batsman said that the hosts were probably 10-15 runs short on a batting beauty at Eden Park, but failed with extras and lack of pressure on the Indian middle order.

“It is hard to tell at Eden Park. In the last three overs India bowled well and we didn’t get a big over. We still did get 100 in the last 10 overs to put pressure on them but it’s always hard to gauge,” Taylor said. “We bowled well but sometimes have to give credit to how batsmen are. In T20s you have to learn quick and we have to adapt. Our bowlers will have to look at them and at the same time their batsmen are a class line-up all the way through.

“The way we attack them in the next game will be crucial. How we attack them and how we do that on Sunday.”

The batsman appreciated the base set earlier but said the middle order didn’t generate enough momentum in the last few overs.

“A lot of times when you play at Eden Park wind is a factor and you are able to attack from both ends. It was hard to know what a good total is. They won with an over to spare so we were definitely 10-15 runs short.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/we-didn---t-put-enough-pressure-on-indian-batsmen--taylor.html
188,25-1-20,Sound of the soul,"The saxophone resonates like the human voice which makes it unique, feels Russian saxophonist Nadezhda Lichikova. By Team Viva

What or who were your early influencers?

I can still recall the day when in my childhood I heard the magic sounds of saxophone. It was a performance by Charlie Parker. He was a highly influential jazz soloist and the leading figure in the development of bebop, a form of jazz characterised by fast tempos, virtuosic technique and advanced harmonies. His tunes prompted me to learn saxophone and take it up as a career. He was one of the most important figures in the development of jazz and in particular bop, a dance on pop music. I wanted to master the music instrument exactly like Parker.

What has been your creative process as a saxophone player?

I started my career at the age of 15 with a brass band in my hometown. It was a friendly group of enthusiasts. Later, when I learned the basics and music at Nizhny Novgorod College, studied improvisation courses in Moscow with advanced musicians, I got to know that it is very important to find a great teacher, who can inspire you. Inspiration is one of the most important gifts a teacher can provide to his/herstudents. S/he is a role model, an influence that goes far beyond academic achievement.

How do you see the relationship between sound, space and performance?

I have been exploring how sound or music can be made more dynamic in certain spaces not only because of different acoustics but also because of the social or cultural aspects of a space. I feel it is important to work closely with a sound engineer. Good sound from the stage has many technical parameters that are always adjusted before the show. The musician should be comfortable to hear himself and the playback, only then s/he will be able to bring his/her music perfectly to the listeners. However, this largely depends on the sound engineer.

How is playing a saxophone solo different from playing it in a group?

Music is of great importance to me as an expression of my thoughts and feelings. When I play solo, it is a monologue of my soul and when playing with friends it turns into a dialogue or communication.

Do you think the charm of the instrument is still intact? How has it changed over time?

The sound of the saxophone fascinates everyone as it is so similar to the human voice and this is what makes it unique. Typically, pop music is associated with instruments such as guitar, bass, drums and keyboard. However, the saxophone definitely has its place in the pop scene. Today, saxophone has become an important part of almost every genre of popular music — jazz, funk, blues, rock and pop. Music can move us in ways no other medium can, and without the aid of any complex words. Instrumental music can appeal across traditional boundaries of gender, country, race, religion, language, in a way that lyrics simply cannot. And with the sheer variety of instruments, styles, arrangements, tempos, audio effects and sound generators available to the modern musician, there’s no end to the aural possibilities. I believe that saxophone is here to stay.

What are your main artistic challenges?

Every artist has his or her own struggles. I try to do the best of my powers to bring joy, happiness and love in the hearts of my listeners. I just want that my music should connect the listeners with me.

With the current rap culture ruling the global music scene, do you think classical music is losing its charm?

I think classical music is living its next revival. The rhythm of life is accelerated with a variety of sounds around us. I feel classical music is an absolute expression of the serenity. Every music is a roller coaster of emotions. The harmony or a melody in a symphony can make you happy or sad depending on the mood of the piece. This is one of the biggest reasons why classical music is immortal. Not only there are a lot of pieces in this genre but the interpretation of every single one is different for different musicians. It would be wrong to say that classical music is losing its charm.

189,25-1-20,‘A new experience’,"Taylor Swift shakes Sundance Film Festival by revealing some of her secrets with her documentary, Miss Americana

The normally private Taylor Swift premiered an intimate documentary at the Sundance Film Festival in which the pop star discloses a past eating disorder, chronicles her inner battle over speaking forthrightly about politics and says her victorious 2017 sexual assault court case was a dramatic turning point in her life.

Miss Americana, a Netflix documentary directed by Lana Wilson, was one the most feverishly awaited films in this year’s Sundance programme, and the premiere at the Eccles Center in Park City on the festival’s opening day was a predictably frenzied scene. Outside the theatre, dozens of Swift fans sang in unison.

The film, which will release on January 31 on Netflix, plays like a coming-of-age drama for a performer who — despite finding mega-fame as a teenager — took some time to truly find her voice. In the film, she says she always strove to be “a good girl” and needed approving “pats on the head” for any sense of gratification. But Miss Americana captures an evolution in Swift. “It’s time to take the masking tape off my mouth, like, forever,” she says in the documentary.

Swift entered the theatre after the lights went down to watch the film and appeared afterward on stage in a brief Q&A with Wilson. While Swift said she was a big fan of films and documentaries, this was a new experience for her. After a standing ovation, Swift turned to Wilson and said, “So I’ve never done this before. What do we do?”

One of the film’s most dramatic scenes shows Swift, eager to speak out against the 2018 Senate campaign of Tennessee Republican Marsha Blackburn, meeting with her family to discuss it. Her father warns against it, citing the potential economic impact. Her publicist later advises President Donald Trump might come after her. Indeed, when Swift posted on Instagram against Blackburn and urged young voters to register, Trump said he liked Swift’s music about 25 per cent less — a response Swift mocks in the film.

On the Eccles stage, Swift said she grew more political after after she countersued, and won, against a Denver radio DJ whom she said groped her during a meet-and-greet before a concert.

“It was a really horrible experience to have,” Swift said. “I had all the privilege in the world, financial support and the ability to pay for a brilliant lawyer. I won that trial but without all that, I don’t know what would have happened. It taught me so much.”

Swift also talks in the film about coming to terms with body image issues that grew out of scanning the countless images that are shot of her, and the comments posted on social media. Swift says she would sometimes go into “a hate spiral” and starve herself after seeing photos that she felt she looked overweight in.

Miss Americana includes plenty of intimate scenes of Swift at home or at work. She drinks white wine with ice cubes and didn’t try a burrito until a few years ago, we learn. But a continuous thread through the documentary is of Swift, who last month turned 30, crafting music. In scenes by the piano or in the studio, Wilson captures Swift writing lyrics and honing melodies with a relentless passion.

Swift said she was most nervous about sharing her writing process with Wilson. But the filmmaker earned her trust. “For so much of my life in the public eye when I get sad or upset or humiliated or angry or go through a really horrible time, I feel like people lean in with, like, this hunger. And you never did that to me,” Swift told Wilson. “That was what made me feel OK about feeling sadness, humiliation and anger around you.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---a-new-experience----2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/---a-new-experience---.html
190,25-1-20,When opposites meet,"Actors Emma Thompson and Olga Kurylenko say that working with Rowan Atkinson didn't make them insecure about comedy but rather enhanced their performance. By Team Viva

What attracted you to the role?

Emma Thompson: I was absolutely thrilled to play this part as it was perfect to make an impact. It’s so well written. It’s like an ideal cameo. I consider myself extremely fortunate.

What would you like to say about the plot of the film?

Emma: The premise now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble. A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all Britain’s agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty – a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon. It’s the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and embattled figure, already suffering a complete meltdown of political unpopularity. My intelligence advisers inform me that as every single active spy has been compromised. Now, I have to bring someone out of retirement. And that means bumbling Johnny English himself, now employed as a schoolmaster in some posh establishment, but giving off-the-record lessons in how to be an undercover operative: some nice gags here, as English offers a School of Rock-type academy of spying.

What do you think Johnny is more comfortable with — analogue or digital?

Emma: Being presented with a device that does everything doesn’t really seem to be a good idea for Johnny. He is used to the 007 (James Bond’s) era and its upsetting for him. He is just terribly disappointed with technology.

How would you explain Rowan’s approach to physical comedy?

Emma: Rowan is very precise about everything which is why his physical comedy is so remarkable. It’s not extemporised. He prefers following even the minutest detail. He is obsessive about it and that’s what makes him special.

Introduce your character and tell us how exciting it was to be a part of it?

Olga Kurylenko: Ophelia is a mysterious character because she comes off as a very glamorous girl hanging around and having a holiday on a yacht. Johnny has no idea what he is dealing with. Later, we realise that she is actually a spy just like him but a Russian one. She does it with a lot of glamour.

You have done a spy film in the past. How would you compare it with this one?

Olga: Johnny English Strikes Again (which recently premiered on Sony Pix) has a very nice plot. It talks about the danger that the world is facing and there are a lot of stunts and action moments in the film. The only difference between that it is just full of humour. Johnny English is as clumsy as ever and also does things really wrong which makes us crack up. So it has it everything a thriller does, including glamour. It’s just very funny.

What did you think of Rowan?

Olga: I thought that he’s a very funny and goofy guy. But he is the total opposite of what his characters have been. He is a very serious and concentrated person. He is very intelligent and works really hard at what he does. You don’t actually expect it but that’s how he is. It was lovely to be around such a gentleman who is very polite and well-spoken.

Is it difficult to just not laugh around him?

Olga: Don’t even ask me that. (Laughs) There are moments when you obviously find him funny and there were moments where I wanted to laugh but I managed not to because I have to do what I had to. There were moments when they say cut and we all just crack up because we thought, Oh my god, that was funny! The most rewarding thing is when the whole crew laughs when they cut the scene and if everybody laughs then you know you have done it right and it’s very gratifying. And of course, on the set it’s good atmosphere because apart from it being very serious, everybody is focussed at the same time. It was a good atmosphere to be in. I miss it.

It is a very different kind of comedy film. So did this help you to discover your own abilities?

Olga: Surprisingly, I feel like a fish in the water when I am doing comedy. I just love it. I have no problem in making fun of myself and that has never been an issue. I literally do not care but the thing is that nobody lets me, even though I’m involved in comedy. But then, there are scenes like, in this film, I have to be cold, so even if I try, I just have to tell myself that you have to be cold. And I think if I can be goofy. But there are moments where you can just let it go and enjoy. For instance, the dancing scene in the film, which was quite funny for me. It’s so short and yet one of my favourite scenes. Rowan is hilarious, his dance is priceless, he is like an inspiration and he loves what he does, which is why people love him.

What would you like to say on Rowan’s comedy?

Olga: Rowan’s comedy is physical and more expressive that’s why he doesn’t really need to speak. It’s not even about the writing. It could be funny or not funny but even if it is a super serious scene that he’s doing, by just looking at his face, the way he is going to move, his facial expression... everything probably makes people crack up because it’s his ability. His physicality and the facial expressions are just universal. People react to an image and he is probably the best. No one can give as amazing expressions as Rowan can.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/when-opposites-meet-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/when-opposites-meet.html
191,25-1-20,Historical humiliation,"Atletico Madrid were knocked out of the Copa del Rey on Thursday, defeated 2-1 in extra-time by third division Cultural Leonesa.

Atletico, who are third in La Liga and are looking forward to a Champions League clash next month against Liverpool, were one of four top-flight sides dumped out of the tournament on Thursday at the last 32 stage.

Argentine striker Angel Correa put them in front in the 62 minutes before Leonesa levelled seven minutes from the end through Julen Castaeda.

Sergio Benito then delievered the winner for the hosts in the second period of extra-time.

Defeat completes a miserable January for Diego Simeone’s Atletico who were defeated in the Spanish Super Cup by Real Madrid and 2-0 at Eibar in La Liga last weekend.

“The responsibility is mine alone,” admitted Simeone.

“Cultural deserved the victory, we had no forcefulness.”

Also exiting the Copa del Rey on Thursday were Eibar, Real Betis and Celta Vigo.

Real to go to Zaragoza

Real Madrid were on Friday drawn away to six-time winners Zaragoza while Barcelona take on La Liga rivals Leganes in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey.

Looking to win the Cup for the first time since 2014, Madrid will travel to La Romareda next week to face Zaragoza, who were relegated from the top flight in 2013 and have not been back but did beat Mallorca in the last 32.

The Catalans, who have won the Copa del Rey more times than any other club and reached the last six finals, will entertain a Leganes side sitting in the relegation zone in La Liga.

Meanwhile, third-tier Cultural Leonesa’s reward is a home tie against the holders, Valencia.

192,25-1-20,The run goes on,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp hailed another moment of magic from Roberto Firmino as the Brazilian’s late winner opened up a 16-point lead at the top of the Premier League with a 2-1 victory at Wolves on Thursday.

The European champions’ now 14-game winning streak in the league seemed set to end as Raul Jimenez cancelled out Jordan Henderson’s early opener.

Liverpool were even grateful to goalkeeper Alisson Becker for not falling behind in the second half.

However, like crucial victories against Leicester, Aston Villa and Crystal Palace earlier in the campaign, Liverpool left it late to snatch another vital three points in their quest to end a 30-year wait to win the title as Firmino smashed home six minutes from time.

“You just have to find a way to win and have someone who makes the perfect decision and that was Bobby again,” said Klopp.

“A worldie I would say from Bobby, a super goal.”

Liverpool, who now have 22 wins in 23 league games this season, also have a game in hand over second-placed Manchester City to come.

However, victory could still come at a cost as Mane hobbled off with a hamstring injury in the first half.

“We don’t know exactly (the severity of the injury). He felt something in the hamstring,” added Klopp, whose side are also still in the hunt for the FA Cup and Champions League.

Defeat leaves Wolves still six points off the top four in seventh, but Nuno Espirito Santo’s side showed why they are on form the most likely challengers to fourth-placed Chelsea for a place in next season’s Champions League.

“It was a fantastic game of football,” said Nuno. “We have to keep going and keep getting stronger.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/the-run-goes-on.html

Sharan and Sitak lost to the Brazilian-Croat pair 6-7, 3-6 in a second round match that lasted one hour and 17 minutes.

With Sharan’s loss, India’s campaign in the men’s doubles ended as Rohan Bopanna had made a first-round exit on Wednesday.

194,25-1-20,Black Friday,"Serena Williams crashed out, 15-year-old Coco Gauff stunned Naomi Osaka and Roger Federer survived a five-set thriller as the form book went flying out of the window at the Australian Open on Friday.

Men’s title-holder Novak Djokovic eased into the last 16 but elsewhere there were surprises all over Melbourne Park with Williams the biggest victim and Federer fighting back from 4-8 down in a fifth-set tie-break with John Millman.

Williams’ bid for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam was shattered by the unlikely figure of China’s Wang Qiang, who triumphed in three tough sets — after winning just one game when they played at the US Open in September.

Gauff then stepped up her giant-killing Melbourne debut as she ousted Japanese defending champion Osaka, 22, in dismissive style, winning 6-3, 6-4 in just 67 minutes to reach round four.

“Oh my gosh. Two years ago I lost first round in the juniors and now I’m here — this is crazy,” said the teenager, who shocked Venus Williams in the first round.

Federer came within a whisker of repeating his 2018 US Open upset by Millman as he was taken to five punishing sets by the tough Australian.

The 20-time Grand Slam champion was facing defeat in the super tie-breaker but he clawed back from 4-8 down to clinch his 100th win at the Australian Open.

“Oh God, it was tough,” said Federer. “Thank God it was a super tie-breaker (10 points), otherwise I would have lost this one.

“It came down to the wire in the end.”

‘I made it happen’

With Williams now 38, 23 years older than Gauff, the two players are at opposite ends of their careers.

And with Williams’ close friend Caroline Wozniacki retiring on Friday, after defeat to Ons Jabeur, it looked like a changing of the guard in women’s tennis.

But Williams, who has now had eight winless Grand Slams since returning from childbirth, said she hadn’t given up hope of matching Margaret Court’s 47-year-old record for Grand Slam titles.

“I definitely do believe (I can equal it) or I wouldn’t be on tour,” said Williams.

Williams was the bookies’ favourite to lift the trophy for the eighth time but she came unstuck against a determined Wang, who won 6-4, 6/7 (2/7), 7-5.

Her defeat came just minutes after Denmark’s Wozniacki was knocked out by Tunisia’s Jabeur, bringing a tearful end to the former world number one’s final tournament before retiring.

“I had a dream when I was a kid. I wanted to win a Grand Slam. I wanted to be number one in the world,” said Wozniacki, the Melbourne winner in 2018.

“People thought that I was crazy being from a small country. But I made it happen.”

Rattled Osaka

Williams’ exit removes a major hurdle for Australia’s world number one Ashleigh Barty, 23, who had been on course to meet her in the semi-finals.

Barty, bidding to become the first Australian champion since 1978, hit form in a 6-3, 6-2 demolition of Elena Rybakina, saying she had played her best tennis so far this year.

Gauff, who trained with Serena Williams in the off-season, had promised she would be less nervous than in her last meeting with Osaka, when she was thrashed in round three of last year’s US Open.

And so it proved as the teenager broke once in the first set and twice in the second to floor a rattled Osaka and ramp up a rivalry that could run and run.

In the men’s draw, reigning champion Djokovic thrashed Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 to reach the round of 16 at a canter.

But Greek sixth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas was also on the receiving end of an upset as he went down in straight sets to Canada’s Milos Raonic, the world number 35.

Former US Open champion Marin Cilic, 31, outlasted Robert Bautista Agut in five tough sets and Tennys Sandgren, under fire during his last deep run in Melbourne over links to right-wing activists, beat fellow American Sam Querrey in straight sets.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/black-friday.html
195,25-1-20,Rahul loving dual role,"Wicket-keeping alongside batting is a lot more work but India’s KL Rahul on Friday said “he is loving” the additional responsibility as it is bringing the best out of him.

Rahul, who scored 56 runs of 27 balls in the first game kept full-time first during three-match ODI series against Australia last week. Following his good work with both bat and behind the stumps, Kohli had said he will continue with his dual role “for a while” as it lends massive balance to the team.

“I’m quite honestly loving it. At the international stage, it might seem very new and it might seem like I’ve never kept. (But) I’ve kept for my IPL franchise for the last 3-4 years, and I’ve kept for my first-class team as and when there is an opening. I’ve still stayed in touch with wicket keeping.

“I enjoy staying behind the stumps and it also gives me a great idea about how the pitch is playing, and I can pass on that message to the bowlers and the captains with field-sets and everything. As a keeper, that’s also your responsibility to stay active and pass the message on to your captain as to what lengths are better and what I feel we can do better.”

It is extra work but staying behind the stumps also helps batting, feels Rahul.

“As a batsman as well, after keeping for 20 overs, especially you get a fair idea on what are the good shots on this kind of wicket and so I’m enjoying the responsibility and so far so good for me.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/rahul-loving-dual-role.html

In an interview to PTI, Rai said, ""BJP has not done any work and is raking up these issues which has in turn exposed the negativity of the saffron party.""

""People are getting irritated by the way BJP is raking up CAA, NRC and it is showing the BJP in bad light. The people who voted for the BJP in Lok Sabha polls are also supporting AAP in the upcoming polls,"" he said.

BJP leader Amit Shah has raised the issue of CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in his election campaign and accused the Opposition of saying the same things as Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan.

Rai, who is seeking re-election from the Babarpur Assembly constituency, asserted that the Lok Sabha polls were fought on national issues but the upcoming Assembly election will be contested on local issues.

""The only thing people are talking about is the work done by the AAP. People are in the mood to vote on the basis of work done by our government,"" he said.

Ruling out any possibility of any post-poll alliance with the Congress, Rai asserted that the AAP would be winning over 67 seats in the upcoming polls so no such question arises.

""Congress is not in competition this year. Congress is not in competition and people are with AAP and there is no doubt among people on it,"" he said.

""If Congress is able to win a single seat in Delhi then it will be a big thing so there is no relevance to what they are saying,"" he said.

Rai said in the last five years his focus has been on providing basic facilities in his constituency.

""We have constructed roads, old cement pipelines have been replaced and opened 16 mohalla clinics, installed 2,000 CCTV cameras among other things,"" he said.

But in the next five years, he said he would focus on big projects.

""And in the next five years, we aim to build a hospital here and mini stadium and a conference hall where social functions can take place. Then we are also planning to install 2,000 more CCTV cameras in the area,"" he said.

""We are also planning to install street light in every lane of my constituency. A new school will also be constructed,"" he said.

Rai further said that he will be coming out with a separate manifesto for his constituency which will released soon.

The Assembly elections will be held on February 8 in Delhi which will witness a triangular contest among the ruling AAP, the BJP and the Congress.

The Aam Aadmi Party has dropped 15 sitting MLAs from its list of 70 candidates and given ticket to a total of 24 first-timers.

In the Assembly polls five years ago, the AAP registered a thumping win with the party bagging 67 seats, leaving just three for the BJP.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bjp--irritated--people-of-delhi-by-raking-up-caa--nrc-during-poll-campaign--aap-leader-gopal-rai-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/bjp--irritated--people-of-delhi-by-raking-up-caa--nrc-during-poll-campaign--aap-leader-gopal-rai.html

According to a notification issued by the home department of the Jammu and Kashmir administration, access to the internet with 2G speed on mobile phones will resume from January 25.

Access shall be limited only on whitelisted sites and social media applications will continue to remain out of bounds for the Valley's residents, it said, adding, data services shall be available on postpaid as well as prepaid sim cards.

The move comes within a week of the administration ordering restoration of prepaid mobile services in the Valley and resumption of 2G mobile data service on whitelisted websites across the Jammu division.

The sites approved include search engines and those associated with banking, education, news, travel, utilities and employment.

The latest development comes after the Supreme Court, in a significant ruling on January 10, asked the Jammu and Kashmir administration to review within a week all orders imposing curbs in the Union Territory.

The Supreme Court came down heavily on the UT administration for arbitrarily shutting down the internet, the facility described as a fundamental right by the apex court.

200,25-1-20,PM Modi and Brazilian Prez hold talks to boost bilateral ties,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazilian President Jair Messias Bolsonaro on Saturday held wide-ranging talks with an aim to inject a new momentum into strategic ties between India and Brazil.

In the talks, the two leaders focused on boosting bilateral ties in key areas of trade and investment, energy, defence and security, medicine and scientific research, officials said.

The two countries are expected to ink around 15 agreements providing for enhancing cooperation in a range of areas.

Earlier, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar called on Bolsonaro and discussed ways to further broaden cooperation between the two countries.

After the meeting, Jaishankar, in a tweet, said Bolsonaro's visit will open ""new opportunities"" for bilateral cooperation.

The Brazilian president was given a ceremonial welcome at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in presence of President Ram Nath Kovind and Modi.

Bolsonaro arrived here on Friday, accompanied by his daughter Laura Bolsonaro, daughter-in-law Leticia Firmo, eight ministers, four members of the Brazilian parliament and a large business delegation.

The Brazilian president is in India primarily to grace the Republic Day celebrations on Sunday as chief guest and explore ways to boost trade ties with India at a time when both the large economies are hit by slowdown.

India's ties with Brazil, the largest country in Latin America, has been on an upswing in the last few years. The country has a population of 210 million with USD 1.8 trillion economy.

This is the first visit of President Bolsonaro to India.

Bolsonaro, a former army captain, won a landslide victory in Brazil's presidential election in October 2018 and took the reins of the country in January last year.

India-Brazil ties have been on an upswing in the last few years.

The volume of bilateral trade was USD 8.2 billion in 2018-19. This included USD 3.8 billion worth of Indian exports to Brazil and USD 4.4 million as imports by India.

Both the governments feel there is huge potential to enhance the bilateral trade further.

In his plea filed before the Additional District and Sessions Court I, Mulakkal claimed that prima facie there was no case to frame charges against him.

The trial court adjourned the matter to February 4 for the prosecution to file its objection to the plea filed by the Bishop, accused of raping and sexually assaulting a nun of the same diocese.

The Bishop filed the discharge plea as the Court was supposed to commence the preliminary hearing on charges on Saturday.

However, he was not present in the Court.

The case is based on a complaint filed against the bishop by the nun.

In her complaint to the police in June, 2018, the nun had alleged that she was subjected to sexual abuse by the Bishop during the period of 2014 and 2016.

The Bishop, who was arrested by the Special Investigation Team probed the case, has charged him with wrongful confinement, rape, unnatural sex and criminal intimidation in the case.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bishop-franco-mulakkal-files-discharge-plea-in-nun-rape-case-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/bishop-franco-mulakkal-files-discharge-plea-in-nun-rape-case.html
203,25-1-20,India rule in run fest,"Shreyas fireworks, KL onslaught give Men in Blue 6 wicket win over Black caps

The immensely talented Shreyas Iyer enhanced his reputation as a finisher with a scintillating 29-ball-58 in India’s six-wicket victory over New Zealand in a high-scoring first T20 International at Eden Park on Friday.

Iyer built on KL Rahul’s (56 off 27 balls) blazing start and Virat Kohli’s useful 45 off 32 balls as India made short work of a 204-run target, knocking it off with an over to spare.

Credit should be given to Indian bowlers for restricting New Zealand towards the end considering the dimensions of the ground.

Earlier, Colin Munro and Kane Williamson had smashed quick-fire half-centuries as New Zealand scored 203-5.

In pursuit of 204, India lost Rohit Sharma (7) early in the second over as he played one too many shots in a bid to go after spinner Mitchell Santner (1-50).

Rahul and Kohli then took charge of the innings with an 99-run partnership coming off only 50 balls. The duo launched a good array of strokes with seven fours and four sixes between them as New Zealand struggled to contain the runs.

Continuing his fine form, Rahul notched up his half-century off 23 balls while Kohli fell short of his landmark by just five runs. Together, they provided the base for India’s middle order to finish the chase.

The Black Caps roared back into contention with a double blow. First, Rahul was out caught off Sodhi in the 10th over and then seven balls later, Martin Guptill pulled off a screamer at deep mid wicket to send back Kohli.

India lost their set batsmen for six runs and their ploy to send Shivam Dube (13) up the order only had limited success. Dube and Iyer added 21 runs to provide some acceleration, before the all-rounder was Sodhi’s second dismissal of the night.

Iyer then took charge of proceedings as he smacked five fours and three sixes to propel India to victory. He added 50 off 29 balls with Manish Pandey, who hit 14 not out off 12 balls with a six.

It was an immaculate display by the young batsman who showed the benefits of reaping experience batting in the middle order and perhaps answering India’s questions regarding the number four situation.

This was after Munro, Williamson and Ross Taylor (54 not out off 27 balls) made the Indian bowlers suffer. Jasprit Bumrah (1-31) put in a good shift with clever change of pace and control.

Also Yuzvendra Chahal (1/32 in 4 overs) and Ravindra Jadeja (1/18 in 2 overs) kept a check on the run-flow during the back-end.

Munro scored 59 off 42 balls, including six fours and two sixes, while Williamson hit four fours and four sixes in his 26-ball 51-run innings as the Black Caps’ made good use of the peculiar Eden Park shape to pile on the runs.

Shardul Thakur (1-44) and Mohammed Shami (0-53) proved to be expensive in their opening spells before Dube (1-24) got the breakthrough with Rohit Sharma catching smartly to dismiss Guptill. It brought Williamson to the crease and the onslaught continued as he put on 36 off 24 balls with Munro.

The latter reached his half-century off 36 balls before holing out off Thakur. India quickly got a second wicket in the space of four balls with Ravindra Jadeja (1-18) dismissing Colin de Grandhomme (0).

New Zealand, at 117-3 in the 13th over, were placed awkwardly but Williamson and Taylor put on 61 off 28 balls to completely decimate the Indian bowling in the second half of their innings.

Taylor smashed three fours and three sixes, taking 22 runs off Shami in the 16th over, as he raced to a 25-ball half-century. It was his first T20I half-century in six years. Williamson too completed his half-century off 25 balls.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-rule-in-run-fest-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-rule-in-run-fest.html
204,25-1-20,Serena Williams not going quietly as Coco makes case as heir,"Serena Williams suffered her earliest exit from the Australian Open since 2006 but the 23-time Grand Slam champion is not ready to hand over the baton to heir apparent Coco Gauff just yet.

The 38-year-old Williams was downcast but quietly defiant in the aftermath of her shock third-round loss to Wang Qiang on Friday, the 27th-seeded Chinese winning 6-4, 6-7 (2/7), 7-5.

Five hours later, the 15-year-old Gauff pulled off an upset of her own, defeating reigning champion Naomi Osaka 6-3, 6-4 in 67 minutes.

Gauff is the youngest player to beat a defending champion at the Australian Open in the Open era, which began in 1968.

Williams had already won six Grand Slams when Gauff was born in 2004 and there heavily symbolism in the older American passing the younger one on her way out the Melbourne exit door.

But Williams signalled that she will not go quietly in her quest to equal or perhaps surpass the record 24 Grand Slams won by Australia's Margaret Court.

""I feel like I'm on the way up, so we'll see,"" Williams said, asked if she will be back at Melbourne Park 12 months from now.

""I don't know. I'm not even thinking about anything about not being here.""

And in a show of the commitment that has made her one of the greatest players of all time, Williams said: ""I'm definitely going to be training tomorrow.

""That's first and foremost, to make sure I don't do this again.""

But Chris Evert, an 18-time Grand Slam champion, cast doubt on whether Williams will ever win another Major.

""Her best shot now has to be Wimbledon because she's won that so many times (seven) and her game is, I think, better suited to that surface than any other,"" the retired former number one told Australian media.

""But I'm just amazed that she's still playing at a high level now at 38 years of age.

""I have a lot of admiration for her, but at the same time the (other) players are only getting better and you wonder how much better she can get.""

Williams's last Grand Slam title came three years ago in Melbourne, when she was pregnant with daughter Olympia.

The American great has since reached four Slam finals but failed to win a set in any of them and her last defeat, in the US Open final, was at the hands of 19-year-old Canadian Bianca Andreescu.

Gauff 'having fun'

If Williams is on the way down, albeit reluctantly, Gauff is very much on the way up.

The question now is high and how fast the teenager -- the youngest player in the draw at the Australian Open -- can go.

Gauff and her idol Williams spent time on and off court in pre-season and Williams said in Melbourne that she had been ""nowhere near"" Gauff's level when the same tender age.

Gauff, who faces American 14th seed Sofia Kenin in the last 16, watched Williams lose while she was waiting for her clash with Japan's two-time Grand Slam champion Osaka.

""I still get nervous when that happens,"" Gauff said.

The fast-emerging American beat Serena's older sister Venus, a seven-time Major champion, in her Grand Slam debut at Wimbledon last year.

She then repeated the feat in her Melbourne opener, before dumping out Romania's Sorana Cirstea after being a set and 3-0 down.

Gauff was left in tears in the third round at the US Open after a 6-3, 6-0 mauling to then-world number one and title-holder Osaka. She admitted she was overawed by the occasion.

But the tables were turned in Melbourne and it was the Japanese who wilted under the spotlight of a showdown billed as a glimpse into the future of women's tennis.

""Definitely a difference in the mentality entering into the match,"" Gauff said.

""I was a lot more calm. This match was hyped up, too, but also US Open was hyped up.

""I think now coming into this, I'm just going to have fun, play my best tennis and see what happens.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/serena-williams-not-going-quietly-as-coco-makes-case-as-heir-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/serena-williams-not-going-quietly-as-coco-makes-case-as-heir.html
205,25-1-20,"Nadal, Kyrgios target Australian Open last 16","Home favourite Nick Kyrgios steps up his charge for a first Grand Slam title when he plays Karen Khachanov in the Australian Open third round on Saturday.

The flamboyant but temperamental 23rd seed is enjoying growing popularity after leading fundraising for Australia's bushfires crisis, but he faces a tough match-up in the Russian 16th seed.

Kyrgios showed new composure in his testing win over Gilles Simon and hopes are high that he will take another step towards ending Australia's 44-year wait for a homegrown men's champion.

If he beats Khachanov, Kyrgios could face a mouthwatering showdown in the last 16 with Rafael Nadal, the man he disparagingly labelled ""super salty"", part of a long-running feud.

But first the world number one takes on Pablo Carreno Busta as he goes in search of a record-equalling 20th Grand Slam title.

Nadal has a strong record against his fellow Spaniards, owning a 17-match winning streak dating back to his first-round shock against Fernando Verdasco at the 2016 Australian Open.

He has only dropped one set in four meetings with Carreno Busta, his Davis Cup team-mate, making him hot favourite to join defending champion Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer in the last 16.

However, after converting only three out of 20 break points in his straight-sets win over Federico Delbonis in round two, Nadal said he needed to be more clinical.

""I need to play better. Especially I need to convert the break points,"" said Nadal, who is on the trail of Federer's record for Grand Slam titles.

""I have been practising every day a little bit better. I am confident that I am going to play better because every day in the third set I have been able to show a good level of tennis.""

Wimbledon champion Simona Halep will look to charge forward in a women's draw vacated by Serena Williams -- who was shocked by China's Wang Qiang on Friday -- when she plays Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva.

206,25-1-20,Ruthless Nadal crushes Carreno Busta to reach last 16,"Top seed Rafael Nadal routed fellow Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta for the loss of just seven games Saturday as the world number one revved up his bid for a 20th Grand Slam title.

The 33-year-old was in virtuoso form to charge past the 27th seed 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 in hot sunshine on Rod Laver Arena and make the round of 16 at Melbourne Park for a 13th time.

""My best match of the tournament so far, without a doubt,"" said Nadal. ""I'm improving every day, so super-happy.

""I did well on my serve and hit good forehands down the line, which is a key shot for me."" Nadal joined defending champion Novak Djokovic and great rival Roger Federer in the fourth round with a potential showdown next with Nick Kyrgios.

The Australian, who disparagingly labelled Nadal ""super salty"" last year, and mimicked his serving routine during his second-round clash, meets Russian Karen Khachanov later.

Nadal, a finalist last year when he crashed to Novak Djokovic in straight sets, was far from clinical in his previous match against Federico Delbonis, winning only three out of 20 break points.

But his conversion rate against his Davis Cup teammate was much better, putting away five from 10 in a dominant display from the 2009 champion.

He broke Carreno Busta on his first service game to immediately take charge, dictating the rallies and forcing his opponent around the court.

Carreno Busta became a spectator as Nadal raced through the set in 29 minutes and he then broke again early in the second set to inflict more pain.

Nadal's relentless consistency was too much for the 28-year-old, who had no answers to the constant pressure and pinpoint service returns that were a trademark in the easy win.

If Nadal clinches a second title in Melbourne, he will equal the 20 Grand Slam crowns held by Federer.

Victory would also make him the first man in the Open era -- and only the third in history -- to win all four Major titles twice, after Roy Emerson and Rod Laver.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ruthless-nadal-crushes-carreno-busta-to-reach-last-16-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ruthless-nadal-crushes-carreno-busta-to-reach-last-16.html

The notice was issued on Friday by the Hari Nagar constituency's Returning Officer.

209,25-1-20,Nirbhaya case: Prosecution tells court Tihar jail supplied all documents sought by convicts' lawyer,"A Delhi court on Saturday said no further directions were required on a plea by the lawyer of the death row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case alleging the prison authorities were not handing over certain documents required to file mercy and curative petitions, and disposed of the petition.

Additional Sessions Judge Ajay Kumar Jain said the convicts' lawyer can take pictures of the relevant documents, notebook and paintings or sketches from the Tihar jail authorities.

The court noted that the jail authorities had already complied with the request made by the convicts by supplying the documents whatever was lying with them.

The authorities had also brought several documents, around 10 paintings and sketches made by Vinay Kumar Sharma and his 19-page note book titled 'Darinda' and other documents to the courtroom and told the judge that if directed, those can be supplied to the convicts.

""In view thereof, no further directions for supply of any documents required. However, the jail authorities are directed to hand over copy of paintings and note book titled 'Darinda' to the counsel for convicts today in court itself against acknowledgement.

""Application disposed of accordingly,"" the judge said.

The hanging of all four convicts in the case is to take place on February 1 at 6 am, according to the court order.

During the proceedings, the public prosecutor, appearing for the Tihar jail authorities, told the court that they had supplied all the relevant documents sought by the lawyer of the death row convicts in the case.

He claimed that the convicts are only adopting ""delaying tactics"".

""The convicts are adopting the delaying tactics by filing these applications. The entire process is to defeat the law. We have already supplied all the documents. We procured all the documents from all the jails where they went,"" the counsel said.

While producing the documents, note book and paintings and sketches, he said, ""These are all we have. If the court directs, we can hand these over to the convicts right now.""

The prosecutor, however, said there was no such diary containing 170 pages.

Advocate A P Singh, appearing for the convicts, alleged that Vinay was being slow poisoned and was hospitalised, but his medical reports were not being supplied to him.

He further said though he had received some documents Friday night from the jail authorities, Vinay's personal diary and medical documents have not been supplied.

""They (Tihar jail authorities) say there is no such record. Vinay was being slow poisoned. That's why he was sent to hospital. Vinay made several paintings and we want to inform the President about it. Also, what he earned from those paintings needs to be informed,"" Singh said.

He also alleged that another convict Pawan Singh's head was ""split open"" in Mandoli jail here and he was shifted to a hospital, but those documents were not supplied to the counsel too.

The documents related to the third convict Akshay Kumar Singh's health were also not supplied and were required to file his curative and mercy petitions, the lawyer said.

Singh had moved an application alleging that the jail authorities were yet to give the documents which are required to file the mercy petition for Vinay (26) and curative petitions for Akshay (31) and Pawan (25).

The Supreme Court recently dismissed the curative petitions of other two convicts -- Vinay and Mukesh Singh (32). Mukesh's mercy petition was rejected by the President earlier this month.

The 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was gang-raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012, in a moving bus in south Delhi by six people before she was thrown out on the road.

210,25-1-20,Nepal offers to play role of mediator between India and Pakistan,"Nepal on Saturday offered to play the role of a mediator between India and Pakistan, saying that it was important for the two countries to have dialogue to resolve their issues.

""Dialogue is the best way to resolve any problem. There may be differences but it can be resolved through dialogue. If necessary, we can play the role of a mediator too,"" a Nepal government source said here.

The source said that better solution to resolve the issues would be to develop better dialogue between two countries. ""We can be instrumental, but it will be better (for the two sides) to develop direct contact,"" the source said.

Tensions between India and Pakistan have spiked since India abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August last. India's decision evoked strong reactions from Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties and expelled the Indian envoy.

""When we come together, sit together and share views then things will be resolved. In every situation, we have to sit together and try to resolve the problem otherwise things can be deteriorated,"" the source said.

Expressing concern over the uncertainty prevailing over the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit, the source said the grouping should be revitalised and misunderstandings should be removed.

""SAARC is not dead. It is alive. Only thing is that we have not met. Hope we can revive it,"" the source said.

The last SAARC Summit in 2014 was held in Kathmandu, which was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The 2016 SAARC summit was to be held in Islamabad. But after the terrorist attack on an Indian Army camp in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir on September 18 that year, India expressed its inability to participate in the summit due to ""prevailing circumstances"".

The summit was called off after Bangladesh, Bhutan and Afghanistan also declined to participate in the Islamabad meet.

In the last three years, India has been distancing itself from the SAARC, citing security challenge facing the region from terror networks based in Pakistan, which is also a member of the grouping.

""We are strongly against all forms and manifestations of terrorism. But there is no relationship between the two (SAARC and terrorism). We cannot connect the two issues,"" the source said.

Identifying the terrorism as a common threat to peace loving countries, the source said, ""We have to deal with issue of terrorism"".

""I think that misunderstandings should be narrowed down and SAARC should be revitalised. It would be better to revise SAARC. I have told India that SAARC should be revitalised. We can find out amicable solutions,"" they said.

SAARC summits are usually held biennially and hosted by member states in alphabetical order.

211,25-1-20,China virus puts India on alert,"Coronavirus screening for 11 who returned from China; quarantine wards set up

As the world gears up to tackle the deadly coronavirus outbreak, as many as 11 people — seven in Kerala, two in Mumbai and one each Bengaluru in Hyderabad — are under observation in hospitals to check for possible exposure to the deadly virus, which originated in China. The suspects are among hundreds of passengers who recently returned from China.

Officials in Kerala said another 73 people are being kept under medical surveillance at their homes in the State. Over 20,000 passengers returning from mainland China and Hong Kong underwent thermal screenings at the seven international airports of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Cochin.

In Mumbai, two Indian students, who returned from Wuhan, China, has been kept under observation for suspected infection of coronovirus. Also, on the basis of the details provided by the Indian Embassy in China, around 25 students who have returned to India recently from Wuhan are being closely monitored, the official said. Their details have been shared with district-level officers and they are being monitored closely for any symptoms.

In neighbouring Nepal, a student who came back from the same Chinese city has been found infected with the fast-spreading disease, sending panic across the globe.

India is on high alert and sources in the Union Health Ministry said the country may soon start screening all fliers from Nepal and Bhutan and those who travelled by road.

In Delhi, AIIMS too has set up an isolation ward and kept beds ready for providing treatment to any suspected case of coronavirus infection.

AIIMS director Randeep Guleria said, “We have an isolation ward and we have beds kept ready for providing care and treatment for suspected coronavirus cases in Delhi or elsewhere in India. All precautionary measures — in terms of personal protection equipment for healthcare workers to prevent the spread of the disease while treating infected patients — are in place.”

Guleria said hospital preparedness with regard to management and infection prevention control facilities has been also reviewed. “If need be, we have the capacity to increase our isolation ward facilities and provide treatment to such patients,” he added.

In Mumbai, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has created an isolation ward at the Kasturba hospital. “The isolation ward has been created for diagnosis and treatment of persons suspected to have the virus infection,” said Dr Padmaja Keskar, executive health officer of the BMC.

Keskar said the two persons under observation at the hospital have mild cough and exhibited cold-related symptoms. Doctors at the airport have been asked to send travellers returning from China to the isolation ward if they show any symptoms of the virus.

“All private doctors in the city have been asked to alert us if they observe symptoms of coronavirus in any person who has returned from China,” she added. According to Kasturba Hospital sources, they have received detailed instructions from the Maharashtra Government about how to deal with coronavirus infection.

As on January, 24, 2020, nearly 20,844 passengers from 96 flights have been screened for the virus symptoms while health advisory has been extended to 12 more airports-Ahmadabad, Amritsar, Coimbatore, Guwahati, Gaya, Jaipur, Bagdogra, Lucknow, Trivandrum, Trichy, Varanasi and Vizag in addition to the current seven, Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Cochin.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) had already alerted Nepal about the possible risk of the spread of the virus. “Coronavirus is responsible for the outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, so the movement of people between Nepal and China could spread the deadly virus to Nepal,” said the WHO recently.

In China, around 830 were diagnosed with coronavirus and there had been 26 deaths as of now.

However, the global health agency has decided not to declare the outbreak as an international public health emergency. The outbreak is “an emergency in China”, WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a Press conference in Geneva. “But it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one.”

India on its part is already on high alert and has taken several precautionary measures to prevent the possible risk of transmission of the virus in the country. National Institute of Virology, Pune is fully geared up to test samples of the virus. Ten other laboratories under Indian Council of Medical Research’s Viral Research and Diagnostics Laboratories network are also equipped to test such samples, if a need arises, said a senior official from the Health Ministry. States and hospitals have been asked to set up insolated wards and be ready for emergency, if any.

Guleria suggested that as a precautionary measure, people should maintain good standards of hand hygiene, avoid travelling in crowded places and use masks. Any person having slight symptoms of cough, fever and weakness should immediately report to the nearest health facilities, he said.

“ As of now, there is no definite treatment, antibiotics or vaccines available for combating the particular virus strain and only supportive treatment for pneumonia is given. One has to follow preventive medication strategies,” he said..

Coronavirus are a broad range of viruses that can cause infections ranging from mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses like common cold to much more serious diseases like SARS.

To give a major fillip to road constructions across the country, the Centre on Friday set a target of building 40 km of national highways (NH) every day under new projects, expansions, doubling and renovations.

Taking stock of the ongoing `3 lakh crore projects, Road Transport & Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said he will hold a review meeting on the first and third Mondays of every month to ensure timely completion at various legs.

The target for highway building in the current financial year (2019-20) is 12,000 km, which is higher than the 10,800 km achieved in the 2018-19 fiscal. Till December 31, 2019, road construction stood at 24-25 km/day, which came down from 32 km/day because of extended rains.

A senior Road Ministry official explained that by the end of this fiscal, construction will cross 35 km/day because the work is at peak from November to mid-June and it dips from June to November because of weather conditions.

NH construction averaged about 12km/day in 2014-15 and had a quantum jump to 30km/day in 2018-19. According to the Ministry, as of March 2019, India had about 1,42,126 kilometres of NH.

To deal with the timely construction of projects, Gadkari has directed all chief engineers in the Road Ministry and all members of Central road making agency NHAI to organise two “Review Mondays” every month. Technology and video-conferencing will be the means for review and monitoring.

“Delay in completion of projects invariably leads to cost escalation. Hence, we need to focus on review and monitoring to keep the construction under check in addition to timely delivery of projects,” said Gadkari after the two-day long marathon meeting at Manesar near Gurugram.

About 740 national highway projects of 16 States were reviewed where Gadkari instructed to start performance audit of officers and fix responsibility for delays.

Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways General (Retd) VK Singh and officials of the Ministry and stakeholders were present in the meeting.

“The review was done State-wise. All senior officials of the Ministry, NHAI, State Governments, contractors, concessionaires, and consultants attended the meeting. Every ongoing project was reviewed with a 360-degree view from all stakeholders. The meeting led to identification of issues and way forward with clear timelines for most of the delayed projects,” said a NHAI official present in the meeting.

Delay in land acquisition and impediment in regulatory clearances such as for quarrying, etc, as well as lack of coordination and communication between and within Government agencies emerged as main roadblocks in completion of road projects.

Gadkari went into the minutest detail of every project making sure a clear path forward emerged to speed up projects. Officials and contractors also committed themselves to take every step to ensure timely completion of projects.

The issue of timely approval of Extension of Time (EOT) and change of scope (COS) was particularly raised by the Contractors/ Concessionaire. As timely approvals would help in facilitating lending by banks, an online tool called “GATI” was also launched on the first day of meeting on January 23..

Interacting with media after the meeting, the Minister informed 22 Greenfield Corridors of 7,500 kms is being developed with a total capital cost of Rs 3 lakh crore.

“Work has started on some while awarding all other projects are/will be completed expeditiously. These projects are being pursued vigorously and are being implemented on priority,” said Gadkari.

He added that besides reducing length and decongesting existing NHs, the projects will work as growth engines as they pass through the less developed backward/ tribal areas. The development of way-side amenities will result in more opportunities for business and employment.

He also informed that the progress of FASTags was also reviewed. All 537 Toll Plazas are now ETC enabled and more than 1.37 cores FASTags have been issued. My FASTag App has crossed 10 lakh down loads.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/centre-aims-to-build--40-km-nhs-each-day-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/centre-aims-to-build--40-km-nhs-each-day.html
213,25-1-20,"HC asks students to enroll at old fee, seeks JNU reply on challenge to hostel hike","JNU students who have not yet registered for the new academic year have been asked by the Delhi High Court to do so under the old fee, even as it sought response from the university on the plea of JNU Students’ Union that has challenged the decision to amend the hostel manual.

A Bench of Justice Rajiv Shakdher issued notices to the Union HRD Ministry and the UGC. The plea, filed by JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh and office-bearers Saket Moon, Satish Chandra Yadav and Md Danish, challenged the minutes of the Inter Hostel Administration (IHA) issued on October 28, last year, jurisdiction of the High Level Committee constituted on November 24 and recommendations made by it.

The petition sought directions to quash the Draft Hostel Manual “illegally approved by the IHA as the decisions taken by the IHA are malafide, arbitrary and illegal and adversely affect the students”.

It claimed the decisions to bring about amendments in the hostel manual are contrary to provisions of the JNU Act, 1966, Statutes, Ordinances and the Hostel Manual.

“The amendments include reducing JNUSU representation in IHA, increased rates as applicable to hostel residents and also brought amendments to clauses of the Hostel Manual adversely affecting reserved category students in the University,” the plea submitted.

Earlier, the hostel room fee was hiked by Rs 10 and Rs 20 for double and single-occupancy rooms respectively.

The rent for all students, including those with Junior Research Fellowship, Senior Research Fellowship and other equivalent scholarships or fellowships, for single and double-seater rooms has been hiked to Rs 600 and Rs 300 per month.

The rent for Below Poverty Line (BPL) category students for double and single-seater rooms has been increased to Rs 150 and Rs 300 per month respectively.

Earlier, there was no utility and service charge, but now the university will charge BPL students Rs 500 and other students Rs 1,000 for the same.

The JNUSU had also sought directions to restrain the university from registering students for the new term on the basis of the new fee structure through its circular for registration in Winter Semester-2020.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hc-asks-students-to-enroll-at-old-fee--seeks-jnu-reply-on-challenge-to-hostel-hike-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/hc-asks-students-to-enroll-at-old-fee--seeks-jnu-reply-on-challenge-to-hostel-hike.html
214,25-1-20,"Tihar holding papers, delaying mercy pleas: Nirbhaya rapists","Lawyer of 3 convicts moves court against prison authorities

Advocate AP Singh, appearing for the three of the four death-row convicts — Akshay Singh and Pawan Gupta and Vinay Kumar — in the 2012 Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case on Friday moved a Delhi court alleging that the Tihar jail authorities are not handing over documents and this is causing delay in filing their mercy and curative petitions.

Singh moved an application alleging that the jail authorities are yet to give the documents which are required to file the mercy petition for Vinay (26) and curative petitions for Akshay (31) and Pawan (25). The plea is likely to be taken up for hearing on Saturday. The apex court recently dismissed the curative petitions of other two convicts — Vinay and Mukesh Singh (32).

Mukesh's mercy petition was rejected by the President earlier this month. The hanging of all four is to take place on February 1 at 6 am, according to the fresh death warrant.

In his petition, the lawyer said he had expressed ""an urgent will to file a mercy petition before the relevant authorities and undertook several steps to obtain relevant information to file it"".

He said Vinay wanted to attach his personal diary containing 70 pages with the mercy petition and had asked the jail authorities to provide the same. However, the diary is yet to be provided and because of this the plea could not be filed, he said. The counsel said he had also sought some documents of convicts Pawan and Akshay which have not been provided. The petition sought a direction to jail authorities to provide the documents on ""an urgent basis"".

Meanwhile, Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia accused AP Singh of making fun of the system by using tactics to delay their hanging. Sisodia said. ""In the Nirbhaya case, the lawyer is using tactics to delay the execution. In this way, he is making fun of the system. We must work together to ensure speedy justice so that laws can be amended to remove shortcomings,"" Sisodia said in a tweet in Hindi.

The 23-year-old paramedic student, Nirbhaya, was gangraped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012, in a moving bus in South Delhi by six people before she was thrown out on road. She was flown to a hospital in Singapore where she died.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tihar-holding-papers--delaying-mercy-pleas--nirbhaya-rapists-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/tihar-holding-papers--delaying-mercy-pleas--nirbhaya-rapists.html
215,25-1-20,"Vijayvargiya stirs row, links B’deshis with eating poha","Poha and Bangladeshis. It is bizarre to see any linkage between the two, but BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya thinks otherwise. He kicked up a row by claiming some construction workers to be Bangladeshis just because they ate flattened rice (poha).

When Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a similar remarks last month by saying that people who are setting fire (to property) can be seen on TV and can be identified by the clothes they are wearing, it caused a countrywide outrage. Vijayvargiya’s claim to identify illegal migrants from Bangladesh by their poha-eating habit triggered both amusement and uproar.

While the BJP tried to play down Vijayvargiya’s claim, the Congress cited it as an instance to caution what the National Population Register (NPR) exercise will entail.

Vijayvargiya had, at an event in Indore on Thursday to support the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, said that he suspected that some of the construction labourers working at his house were Bangladeshis by noticing their strange habit of eating only poha. Vijayvarigiya was mocked by the twitterati.

Poha, a popular breakfast dish, is eaten across north India with no particular connect with Bangladesh as suspected by Vijayvargiya.

BJP leader and Union Minister Prakash Javadekar termed it as a non-issue. Asked about Vijayvargiya’s comments, which have drawn flak from several quarters, Javadekar told reporters here, “I also eat poha and serve it to you (journalists). So it’s a non-issue”.

Meanwhile, Congress leader Sushmita Dev slammed the comment stating that the BJP which can judge nationality by food, will use NPR to profile people. Mumbai Congress too tweeted, “Kanda POHA is a favorite food of Mumbaikars. We will be more than happy to host Sh.@KailashOnline over a plate of scrumptious #Poha, whenever he is in Mumbai.”

In West Bengal the ruling Trinamool Congress and Opposition Congress and CPI(M) in West Bengal on Friday slammed Vijayvargiya. “The statement is not an isolated one but a reflection of the “racist and communal” mindset of the present BJP dispensation, the parties said.

Senior TMC leader and State Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Tapas Roy said such racist and communal statements are reflection of BJP’s “anti-Bengali” mindset.

“We all know that the BJP is an anti-Bengali party. Such communal statements only reflect that mindset. The BJP and its leaders don’t know anything about Bengal, its culture and eating habits and are dreaming of ruling Bengal. They would get a befitting reply for insulting Bengalis,” he said.

Roy’s views were echoed by CPI(M) Politburo member Mohammed Salim, who alleged that the BJP is trying to do a racial profiling of the country.

“Just because someone is not eating roti does not make him a Bangladeshi. Poha, which is known as chirey in this part of the country, is a staple diet and is very popular as breakfast food. What is BJP trying to do? They are trying to racially profile the country on the basis of dress code, eating habits and lifestyle,” Salim said.

He also said Vijayvargiya’s comments are “just an extension” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remark that those indulging in violence over the citizenship law could be identified by their attires.

Leader of Congress in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury too criticised Vijayvragiya and said his comments are an “insult to the people of West Bengal”.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/vijayvargiya-stirs--row--links-b---deshis--with-eating-poha-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/vijayvargiya-stirs--row--links-b---deshis--with-eating-poha.html
216,25-1-20,"SC refuses blanket ban on NSA, says anti-CAA riots may be organised","The Supreme Court on Friday said it cannot issue blanket orders restraining authorities from invoking the stringent National Security Act (NSA) against people protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) as “properties are being burnt and that may be organised”.

A Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Indira Banerjee said, “We are of the opinion that general writ will not lie in this case. We cannot invoke powers under Article 32. We agree that the NSA should not be misused, but we cannot issue a blanket order. If a general direction is passed this will create a chaos. You don’t know what is going on in Kolkata, Tripura and Assam. Properties are being burnt and that may be organised,” said the Bench.

Petitioner-advocate ML Sharma said that anti-CAA protests are going on peacefully in Shaheen Bagh area of Delhi and other places and persisted with seeking relief by asking a blanket ban on the imposition of the NSA.

To this the Bench said, “If a person is involved in violence and involved in say hundred criminal cases. Then what would Government do. Will not the Government act?”

It asked Sharma to file an amended petition showing some specific instances where NSA has been invoked against the ant-CAA protesters. The bench told Sharma that he can also file an intervention application in the pending cases challenging the validity of CAA and seek appropriate relief.

Sharma then sought liberty to withdraw the petition and file an amended petition giving specific details of violations of NSA, which was granted by the court. Sharma’s plea said NSA has been imposed to curb and pressure people protesting against the CAA, National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC).

Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on January 10 had extended detaining powers to Delhi Police under the NSA for a three-month period starting January 19. This allows police to detain a person for 12 months without a trial.

Sharma had made the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Manipur parties to the plea.

The plea had termed the notification, allowing police to invoke NSA to detain persons, as “unconstitutional” and violative of fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19 (1) (freedom of speech and expression) and 21 (right to life) of the Constitution.

“The cause of actions arose on January 10, when respondents (States) imposed NSA Act for next three months with effect from January 19 in Delhi as well as in Andhra Pradesh by the state government to arrest and detain...For protests against a person holding office of the PM and ministers in the Central government...,” the plea said, seeking a direction to quash the notification.

The plea also sought that it be declared that the NSA cannot be used against protesters. Besides, it sought a compensation of Rs 50,00,000 each to those who have been detained so far under the NSA for “mental agony, defamation in society and loss of reputation”.

Protests are taking place at various places in the country against the enactment of CAA and exercise of National Population Register (NPR).",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sc-refuses-blanket-ban-on-nsa--says-anti-caa-riots-may-be-organised.html

224,25-1-20,"Remain non-violent when fighting for a cause, President tells countrymen on R-Day eve","President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday urged people, particularly the youth, to remain non-violent when fighting for a cause and stressed on the need to ""hold fast to constitutional methods"" of achieving social and economic objectives.

His remarks come in the backdrop of protests against the new citizenship law although he made no reference to them.

In his customary address to the nation on the eve of 71st Republic Day, Kovind cited Mahatma Gandhi's gift of 'Ahimsa' (non-violence) to the humanity and said that his talisman for deciding whether an act is right or wrong ""applies to the functioning of our democracy"".

He said modern India comprises three organs - Legislature, Executive and Judiciary - which are necessarily interlinked and interdependent.

""Yet, on ground, the people comprise the State. 'We the People' are the prime movers of the Republic. With us, the people of India rests the real power to decide our collective future,"" he said.

Stressing that both the government and the opposition have ""important roles to play"", the president said ""while giving expression to their political ideas both must move forward in tandem to ensure that development of the country and welfare of its people are promoted consistently"".

In his televised address, Kovind said Gandhi's ideals remain relevant in the nation-building efforts.

""It should be part of our daily routine to introspect on Gandhiji's message of truth and non-violence, which has become all the more necessary in our times,"" he said in his speech.

Recalling the importance of January 26, he said that even before 1947, this day was celebrated 'Purna Swaraj Day' (complete independence day) from 1930 to 1947.

Kovind said though the Constitution gave rights to all the citizens of a free democratic nation, but also placed on responsibility to always adhere to the central tenets of the democracy - justice, liberty, equality and fraternity.

""It becomes easier for us to follow these constitutional ideals, if we keep in mind the life and values of the Father of our Nation. By doing so, we will be adding a meaningful dimension to our celebrations of 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji,"" he added.

The president said the present third decade of the 21st century will be ""the decade of the rise of New India and a new generation of Indians.

""More and more of those born in this century are participating in the national discourse. With the passage of time, we are gradually losing living links with our great freedom struggle, but there is no reason to worry about the continuity of the beliefs that guided it,"" he said.

Kovind said with advances in technology, the young minds of today are better informed and more confident. ""The next generation remains strongly committed to the core values of our nation. For our youth, the nation always comes first. With them, we are witnessing the emergence of a New India,"" he said.

Concluding his speech by quoting Babasaheb Ambedkar ""If we wish to maintain democracy not merely in form, but also in fact, what must we do? The first thing in my judgment we must do is to hold fast to constitutional methods of achieving our social and economic objectives"", the president said ""these words have always lighted our path. These words will continue to show us the way ahead to new glories"".

Speaking about security, he said strong internal security is essential for the development of the country and therefore, the government has taken several concrete steps to strengthen the internal security system.

""I have nothing but unreserved praise for our armed forces, paramilitary and internal security forces. Their sacrifices to preserve the integrity and unity of our country present a saga of unparalleled courage and discipline,"" he said.

Kovind said as India and Indians march forward, ""we remain committed to engaging the global community to build a secure and prosperous future for ourselves and for the entire humanity.""

He made a mention about the achievement of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and said they were making further progress in Mission Gaganyaan. ""... The nation excitedly looks forward to the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme gaining further momentum this year.""

Speaking about number of welfare scheme launched by the government, Kovind highlighted the ‘Swachchh Bharat Abhiyan' which has achieved astounding success in such a short time.

He said the same spirit could be seen in other endeavours and added ""be it giving up cooking fuel subsidy or pushing digital payments, the common man has made the government programmes his own, making them truly effective.""

He said the 'Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana' is a matter of pride, as the target of 8 crore beneficiaries has been achieved. ""With this, those in need have access to clean fuel.""

About the farmers, he said under 'Pradhanmantri Kisan Samman Nidhi', more than 14 crore farmer families have become entitled to receive minimum annual income of Rupees six thousand which has enabled the farmers, who feed the nation, to live a life of dignity.

He expressed hope that schemes like 'Jal Jeevan Mission', aimed at water conservation, will soon take form of a popular movement.

He said along with the welfare of needy, every policy initiative of the government is guided by the 'nation-first' principle and there is a consistent effort by the government to ensure overall development of each and every part of the country – be it Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh, the states in the North-East or our Islands in the Indian Ocean.

The president also spoke about sound education system built in ancient times, with the setting up of great universities like Nalanda and Takshashila. ""In India, knowledge has always been considered more valuable than power, fame or riches. In our tradition, educational institutions are respected as temples of learning.""

He said the educational system mereged as path of empowerment after a long colonial rule.

""Even though the development of our educational institutions commenced soon after Independence, in an environment of scarcity of resources, our achievements in the field of education have followed a remarkable trajectory,"" he said, adding ""our endeavour is to ensure that no child or youth is denied education. At the same time, we need to strive to reach global education standards by continuous reform of our educational systems.""",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/remain-non-violent-when-fighting-for-a-cause--president-tells-countrymen-on-r-day-eve-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/remain-non-violent-when-fighting-for-a-cause--president-tells-countrymen-on-r-day-eve.html
225,25-1-20,India's 'passive' foreign policy yielding to one advancing its interests: US official,"India is moving away from having a passive foreign policy to the one vigorously advancing its interests, a top American diplomat said Friday, attributing the trend to New Delhi's ""broadening strategic horizons"" over the past two decades.

“It's clear that India's broadening strategic horizons over the past two decades have resulted in a shift away from a passive foreign policy to the one that advances Indian interests more vigorously,” acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Alice Wells told reporters at a news conference.

Wells, who has just returned from a trip to the region besides attending the Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi, said nowhere this shift is more visible than in the Indo-Pacific region.

“Whether it's in our growing maritime and naval cooperation, the Quad, India's Act East Policy, there's virtually no daylight in our approaches to the Indo-Pacific,” she said. Deputy National Security Advisor Matt Pottinger's remarks at Raisina Dialogue endorsing an Indo-Pacific region stretching from California to Kilimanjaro only further reinforced the strategic convergence, she added.

While in New Delhi, she had meetings with her Indian counterparts, which she said were focused on how to build on the diplomatic and defence gains achieved during the 2+2 ministerial dialogue last December.

With continued progress on defense cooperation, peacekeeping operations, space, counterterrorism, trade, people-to-people initiatives, and more, she said the quality and frequency of India-US naval cooperation, especially the information sharing, have reached unprecedented levels.

The two countries also remain focused on achieving a trade deal that promotes fairness and reciprocity, she noted.

“The visit also offered an opportunity to hear more regarding developments with India's Citizenship Amendment Act, which is undergoing, I would say, a vigorous democratic scrutiny, whether it's in streets, by the political opposition, media, or the courts. We continue to underscore the importance of the principle of equal protection under the law,” Wells said.

“On Jammu and Kashmir, I was pleased to see some incremental steps, including the partial return of internet service in Kashmir,” she told reporters.

She also described the visit by US ambassador and other foreign diplomats to Jammu and Kashmir as ""a useful step"".

“We also continue to urge the government to permit regular access by our diplomats, and to move swiftly to release those political leaders detained without charge,” Wells said.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-s--passive--foreign-policy-yielding-to-one-advancing-its-interests--us-official-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/india-s--passive--foreign-policy-yielding-to-one-advancing-its-interests--us-official.html
226,25-1-20,Boeing could again cut production on 787 plane: Source,"Boeing, still in crisis mode due to the grounding of the 737 MAX, is considering further production cuts to another key commercial plane, a person close to the matter said on Friday.

The move could affect the 787 Dreamliner plane, which is bigger than the MAX and was the company's most-delivered jet in 2019 while MAX deliveries were halted.

In October, Boeing trimmed 787 output to 12 from 14 per month, describing the move as necessary given lower orders from China.

The company may cut the 787 output further, the source said, confirming a report on CNBC.

Boeing would maintain a ""disciplined rate management process taking into account a host of risks and opportunities,"" a company spokesman said on Friday.

""We will continue to assess the demand environment and make adjustments as appropriate in the future.""

Former chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said in October that Boeing expected the lower 787 production rate for two years and stressed that the company was still bullish on the long-term prospects for the jet, which can seat between 250 and 335 people.

Boeing is expected to benefit from the US-China trade agreement signed last week that commits China to increased purchases of $78 billion in manufactured goods such as aircraft.

Boeing on Monday signalled it does not expect to receive regulatory approval to return the MAX to service before mid-2020, a later timeline than had been expected and one that has sharpened concerns about a deeper economic hit from the crisis.

The company is set to update investors when it reports earnings on January 29.

227,25-1-20,"France confirms 2 cases of virus from China, 1st in Europe","France on Friday announced two cases of the deadly new virus from China, the first cases in Europe.

The two confirmed cases were announced by the health minister, Agnes Buzyn. She said that both of the sickened people had travelled to China.

The minister said she expects more cases. “We have two cases,” she said. “We will probably have other cases.”

The minister said she believes that one reason why France is the first European country to have confirmed cases is that it has developed a test allowing medics to rapidly diagnose the sickened.

One of people sickened, a 48-year-old man, passed through Wuhan, the epicentre in China for the virus, before travelling to France on Wednesday, the minister said. That person is hospitalized in the southwestern city of Bordeaux.

The other person is hospitalized in Paris. The minister said that that person also travelled to China but that she has little other information about the case.

""Yes, this is true. I am shocked to hear the news. It's very difficult for me to believe as I had met her just 10 days ago and we had even chatted on WhatsApp on Sunday. I am unable to come to terms with the news. I met her 10 days back and she was absolutely fine,"" Aru K. Verma, Sejal's co-star in ""Dil Toh Happy Hai Ji"", told TimesofIndia.com.

Verma, who played Sejal's brother in the show, further told the portal: ""Her family discovered the news today morning, but I think she committed suicide yesterday night. Her family has taken the body to Udaipur for her last rites.""

Reports claim the possible reason behind the suicide might be some disturbance in the late actress' personal life.

Sejal hailed from Udaipur and came to Mumbai in 2017 to try her luck in showbiz. Before her debut on the Star Plus show ""Dil Toh Happy Hai Ji"", she appeared in a few commercials. She had also featured in a web series titled ""Azad Parindey"".

229,25-1-20,Study on Pandavas’ capital on hold for Rs 10 lakh!,"The shortage of fund has put a break on the Centre’s quest for finding a link between the 16th-century Purana Quila here and Indraprastha, the capital of the Pandavas of the Mahabharat era. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), under the Union Culture Ministry, had to stop the much-ambitious excavation, before it could begin, as the Rs 10 lakh fund allocated for the purpose had to be “urgently” diverted for another work.

Purana Quila’s supposed association with the city of Indraprastha has long attracted the ASI, though its quest has failed to deliver results for the fifth time in a row.

The previous expedition which ended in early 2018 was led by archaeologist Vasant Swarnkar. But it failed to establish the site’s association with the Mahabharat.

The approval for the latest excavation to find traces of Indraprastha was given in November last year. The ASI had earmarked around Rs 10 lakh for the job and e-tenders to deploy the labourers have already been floated. But recently, the ASI withdrew the money and diverted it for another “important” job. Now, the fresh fund will come only next fiscal, that too depending on the Budget outlay.

VN Prabhakar, the director of ASI’s Institute of Archaeology, Exploration & Excavation, was to oversee the project along with superintendent archaeologist BR Singh. When contacted, Prabhakar refused to provide details about the status of the excavation.

According to the epic, “Indraprastha” is located inside somewhere Purana Quila. The first attempt to find this assumption was made by ASI in 1955, and then the second one between 1969 and 1972. The third and fourth attempts were made between January 9, 2014, and June 30, 2014, and December 2017 and June 2018, respectively.

According to various reports, the digging had unearthed artefacts such as sickles, parers, terracotta toys, kiln-burnt bricks and painted grey bowls and dishes belonging to the pre-Mauryan period of the third century BC and are displayed at the Archaeological Museum on the fort complex.

""I went on a skiing holiday with my children and didn't ski because I just walked up and down the lanes, all day, learning lines. But Guy's dialogue is certainly meaty and very brave. The challenge is to make that live and breathe and be your own, and I quite enjoyed doing that,"" he added.

Produced by Ivan Atkinson, Bill Block and Ritchie, ""The Gentlemen"" is a crime caper set in London. Matthew McConaughey leads the cast as Mickey Pearson, an American drug lord along with Charlie Hunnam, Grant, Colin Farrell, Henry Golding, Jeremy Strong and Michelle Dockery, in the drug-infused drama about a British drug lord attempting to cash out his fortune.

The film is written and directed by Ritchie. It promises to be a complete entertainer as the characters get out of the game and sparks all kinds of repercussions among the criminal underworld bringing together a compelling mix of humour and crime.

In the film, Grant portrays a sleazy investigator named Fletcher.

Talking about the role, he said: ""He will work for anyone, but in this particular case, in this film, he's working for the boss of a very nasty tabloid newspaper. He is hired by that newspaper boss to dig around, get some dirt on this prominent marijuana dealer, Mickey, played by McConaughey, and Fletcher gets up into all kinds of mischief, double crossing people and getting up to all that kind of stuff.""

PVR Pictures will release the film in India on January 31.

233,25-1-20,"High-protein diets clog arteries, up heart disease risk","High-protein diets may help people lose weight and build muscle, but there is a downside to it a"" a greater heart attack risk. Researchers now report that high-protein diets boost artery-clogging plaque.

The research in mice showed that high-protein diets spur unstable plaque -- the kind most prone to rupturing and causing blocked arteries.

More plaque buildup in the arteries, particularly if it's unstable, increases the risk of heart attack.

""There are clear weight-loss benefits to high-protein diets, which has boosted their popularity in recent years,"" said senior author Babak Razani, associate professor at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri.

""But animal studies and some large epidemiological studies in people have linked high dietary protein to cardiovascular problems. We decided to take a look at whether there is truly a causal link between high dietary protein and poorer cardiovascular health,"" Razani added.

The researchers studied mice who were fed a high-fat diet to deliberately induce atherosclerosis, or plaque buildup in the arteries.

Some of the mice received a high-fat diet that was also high in protein. And others were fed a high-fat, low-protein diet for comparison.

The mice on the high-fat, high-protein diet developed worse atherosclerosis -- about 30 per cent more plaque in the arteries -- than mice on the high-fat, normal-protein diet, despite the fact that the mice eating more protein did not gain weight, unlike the mice on the high-fat, normal-protein diet.

""A couple of a scoop of protein powder in a milkshake or smoothie adds something like 40 grams of protein -- almost equivalent to the daily recommended intake,"" Razani said.

""To see if protein has an effect on cardiovascular health, we tripled the amount of protein that the mice receive in the high-fat, high-protein diet -- keeping the fat constant. Protein went from 15 per cent to 46 per cent of calories for these mice"".

Plaque contains a mix of fat, cholesterol, calcium deposits and dead cells. Past work by Razani's team and other groups has shown that immune cells called macrophages work to clean up plaque in the arteries.

But the environment inside plaque can overwhelm these cells, and when such cells die, they make the problem worse, contributing to plaque buildup and increasing plaque complexity.

""In mice on the high-protein diet, their plaques were a macrophage graveyard,"" Razani informed.

To understand how high dietary protein might increase plaque complexity, Razani and his colleagues also studied the path protein takes after it has been digested -- broken down into its original building blocks, called amino acids.

""This study is not the first to show a telltale increase in plaque with high-protein diets, but it offers a deeper understanding of the impact of high protein with the detailed analysis of the plaques,"" said Razani.

""This work not only defines the critical processes underlying the cardiovascular risks of dietary protein but also lays the groundwork for targeting these pathways in treating heart disease,"" he added.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/high-protein-diets-clog-arteries--up-heart-disease-risk-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/high-protein-diets-clog-arteries--up-heart-disease-risk.html
234,25-1-20,Not meeting FATF obligations would be devastating for Pak economic reform program: US,"Not meeting the obligations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) would have a devastating impact on Pakistan's economic reform program, a top US diplomat said.

Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Alice Wells made the comments on Friday, a day after Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the country should be taken off the FATF's 'grey list' as it has made considerable progress on the requirements of the international terror financing watchdog.

“Obviously, if Pakistan were not to meet FATF obligations or were to fail and be blacklisted, that would be devastating for Pakistan's economic reform program and for its ability to attract investors,” Wells told reporters here.

“We've been pleased to see progress by Pakistan towards fulfilling FATF obligations,” said Wells, who has just returned from her trip to the region, including a visit to Islamabad.

She was responding to a question if the funding by the International Monetary Fund could get affected if Pakistan does not meet the FATF regulations or the rules.

“There is a meeting underway currently in Beijing where Pakistan is presenting its actions to the task force. So I defer to that task force to make its evaluation,” she said.

“But the more evidence of Pakistan's seriousness in both documenting its economy and in shrinking the space for militants to be able to take advantage of Pakistan's either banking system or territory, the more confidence that the international community and business community will have in working with Pakistan,” Wells said.

A Pakistani delegation led by Minister for Economic Affairs Division Hammad Azhar is in Beijing to brief the financial task force about the steps taken by Islamabad to implement the recommendations made by the FATF.

The FATF in October last decided to keep Pakistan on its 'Grey' list for failure to curb funnelling of funds to terror groups Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad and others.

If not removed off the list by April, Pakistan may move to a blacklist of countries that face severe economic sanctions, such as Iran.

Observing that FATF is a technical process, Wells said that there has been an action plan that was presented to Pakistan.

“It's a question of fulfilling the requirements that have been spelled out and that are asked of all countries in the international system. So it's not a political process, but we certainly support and stand ready to assist Pakistan as it implements these obligations,” she added.

The US, she said, welcomes efforts by Pakistan to meet its counterterrorism financing obligations under FATF.

“We strongly encourage Pakistan to work with FATF and the international community to fully satisfy its action plan commitments,” she said.

Completion of the FATF action plan is critical to Pakistan's economic reform efforts, including its IMF program, as well as for demonstrating sustained and irreversible action against all militant groups based in Pakistan without distinction, she added.

“We've seen obvious progress in our relations with Pakistan, from the high-level engagement such as the President's (Donald Trump) warm and constructive meeting with Prime Minister (Imran) Khan at Davos to the restoration of the International Military Education and Training programs,” she said.

Wells during her trip to Islamabad had extensive conversations on how the two countries can bolster their economic partnership where the US is Pakistan's largest export market, largest trade partner, and historically one of its most significant investors.

There are obvious synergies in energy and agriculture, and opening Pakistan's markets to American investments creates jobs and wealth without sacrificing standards or fuelling corruption.

“We're looking forward to welcoming 10 Pakistani buyer delegations to the US and five regional trade shows in 2020, which will build deeper relationships between US and Pakistani firms. Prime Minister Khan's economic reform efforts contributed to the World Bank identifying it as one of the top 10 reformers globally in 2019,” she said.

Responding to a question on China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), she said Pakistan needs to adhere to the “buyer beware.”

“That Pakistan is a buyer, these are not – this is not grant assistance from China, it's loans, often not with concessional financing. And Pakistan should beware of the terms, to make sure that they're getting the most for their money, that brings the greatest economic prosperity,” she noted.

“This is Pakistan's sovereign right to decide what investment it seeks and on what terms. And a friend of Pakistan, we certainly urge that they take on investment projects that create wealth, generate employment, and are sustainable, and think we have great options for the Pakistani market,” she said in response to a question.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/not-meeting-fatf-obligations-would-be-devastating-for-pak-economic-reform-program--us-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/not-meeting-fatf-obligations-would-be-devastating-for-pak-economic-reform-program--us.html
235,25-1-20,Democrats conclude opening arguments in Senate impeachment trial,"House impeachment managers on Friday night concluded their argument before the Senate to remove US President Donald Trump from office, saying he misused his position and indulged in obstruction to the Congress.

The house managers closed their marathon 24-hour argument spread over three days with an impassioned plea that the trial be fair.

The ruling Republican Party enjoys 53-47 majority in the 100-member Senate. Democrats, who have majority in the House, have alleged that the Republican leadership in the Senate will be partisan during the trial.

""I implore you -- give America a fair trial. She's worth it,"" said Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Adam Schiff.

Trump is only the third president in American history to have been formally impeached by Congress.

From Saturday, Trump's attorneys would begin presenting their defense. Like the House managers they too have 24 hours over the next three days for their argument in support of the president.

Trump has asked the Senate to dismiss both the charges against him. He argues that he has done no wrong.

In his concluding argument, Schiff outlined what he thinks Trump's attorneys will say.

""So what do all these defenses mean? What do they mean collectively when you add them all up? What they mean is under Article 2, the president can do whatever he wants. That's really it, stripped of all the detail and all the histrionics, what they want us to believe is the president can do whatever he wants under Article 2, and there is nothing you or the House can do about it,"" Congressman Schiff asserted.

On Saturday, Trump's team would present their argument for three hours.

""I guess I would call it a trailer, kind of coming attractions would be the best way to say it. Obviously, we have three hours to put it out so we'll take whatever time is appropriate during those three hours, kind of layout with that case will look out like, but no, next week is where you'll see the full presentation, but there will be plenty to see,"" Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow told reporters.

In an interaction with the media, he slammed Schiff.

""Adam Schiff just said that this idea of the solicitation of foreign interference is deplorable,"" he said.

""I wonder if he thought that about the fact that the Clinton campaign had sought when it's completely corroborated, it's uncontested, that (the) Steele dossier who is utilising both supposedly assets that a former British spy had in Russia to get information on the president then candidate. Was that not foreign interference? Was that not an attempt for foreign interference?"" he asked.

The Steele dossier is a private intelligence document pertaining to alleged misconduct, and co-operation between Trump's presidential campaign and the Russian government during the 2016 election.

""So you can get on your horse and act haughty and proud about it, but you know what? Let's look at what the evidence says. And here's what the evidence says. There was foreign involvement, but let's not forget where it originated from. Let's not forget, and we haven't even begun to put on our case yet. We still will not begin until, actually, tomorrow morning. But I want you to think about this. Where did that foreign intelligence come from? Foreign information come from?"" Sekulow asserted.

""It came from connections from the Federal Bureau of investigation, the number three, whose wife happened to work for Fusion GPS, who happened to be hired by the DNC to happen to do an investigation on Donald Trump,"" he argued.

""She didn't just do it with that Steele dossier, she was also involved with, guess what, Ukraine. We haven't put our case out, obviously, haven't begun to, but you should be able to get a sense from what I'm saying right now that this is going to -- you're going to hear -- we're going to rebut and refute and were going to put on affirmative case tomorrow. But that's just one, just one issue,"" he asserted.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the House presentation has been strong, detailed, comprehensive and, at many times, compelling.

""Just drew you right into it. They successfully in advance, preempted just about all of the arguments that the President's lawyer will make. They anticipated what those arguments would be and they answered them even before the President's lawyers got there and then they have to do that because they don't' get another chance to rebut the way McConnell set out the rules,"" he told reporters.

The House managers did an amazing job and set a very high bar which will be difficult for the President's lawyers to overcome, Schumer asserted.

Referring to the arguments made by his Democratic colleagues from the House, Schumer said the argument was incredible and strong.

""It has become clear that President Trump demanded complete immunity, participated in a blanket obstruction and had absolute defiance,"" he said.

""Trump in saying he wanted immunity for everything past, present and future said I'm not a President I'm a king and no one can stop me. Nobody can oversee me. Nobody can put a check on me. That is not America. It what President Trump has demanded and what justifies the House bringing these articles is totally out of sync with the Constitution, the founding fathers and every other impeachment trial,"" Schumer said.

""Neither President Andrew Johnson, President Nixon or President Clinton had the gall, the temerity to come close to even asking what President Trump is asking for,"" he said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/democrats-conclude-opening-arguments-in-senate-impeachment-trial-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/democrats-conclude-opening-arguments-in-senate-impeachment-trial.html
236,25-1-20,"China's Coronavirus afflictions claim 41 lives, nearly 1300 confirmed cases, 237 critical","The deadly Coronavirus continues to wreak havoc in China and abroad as the death toll due to it in this Far East country rose to 41 with 1,287 confirmed cases, China's National Health Commission announced on Saturday.

Of the 1,287 confirmed cases as of Friday night, the condition of the 237 is stated to be critical, the Commission announced.

The confirmed cases have crossed 1,000 mark for the first time with many Chinese cities struggling to fight the afflictions.

The pneumonia situation had resulted in 41 deaths, including 39 in central China's Hubei province and one in northeastern province Heilongjiang, it said.

Additionally, a total of 1,965 suspected cases have also been reported, it said.

The virus has spread to Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Nepal, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and the United States as of Thursday. Japan on Friday reported a second confirmed case.

It has triggered a cause of concern for India too as many of the 700 odd Indian students studying in universities of Wuhan and Hubei provinces are still stuck up there. The Indian Embassy has established hotlines to keep close contact with them.

Battling the fast spreading Coronavirus, China has begun building a 1,000-bed hospital in Wuhan which is expected to be completed in less than ten days.

It also began deploying military medics to step up the treatment facilities in Wuhan and 12 other cities in Hubei province which are under total lock-down with suspension of all public transport.

The fast spreading virus dampened the celebrations of China's Lunar New Year which began today. On Friday Chinese bid goodbye to ""the year of the pig"" to welcome ""the year of rat"" on Saturday.

In Chinese lunar calendar, years are grouped into a 12-year cycles, with each year assigned an animal symbol: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and pig.

In view of the virus scare, several cities, including Beijing, have cancelled special events. The festival is also known as the Spring Festival. Large cultural activities during the spring festival in Beijing such as temple fairs were cancelled to prevent the spread of the virus.

China's biggest city Shanghai raised the emergency response to public health safety to level 1, the highest, following Beijing, and Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang, Anhui and Guangdong provinces as more cases were reported.

Beijing so far has reported 34 confirmed cases of Coronavirus infection, official media reported.

The Chinese disease prevention authority on Friday released pictures and information of the first Wuhan Coronavirus that Chinese experts had discovered.

The Wuhan government is rushing to build a 1,000-bedded hospital in the outskirts of Wuhan to treat Coronavirus patients.

Dozens of excavators were feverishly working at the site where the hospital is being built on a 25,000-sq metre plot in just about 10 days. It will be ready by February 3, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Workers are being paid 1,200 Yuan (USD 173) per day, three times their usual wage, to accelerate the construction.

The hospital will be modelled on the one built in Beijing for the treatment and control of SARS or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, that spread rapidly on the Chinese mainland in 2003, killing over 800 people. Beijing then had built the Xiaotangshan Hospital, a temporary medical centre in the northern suburb of the city.

Amid the unknown virus wreaking havoc, Chinese and American researchers are working together to develop a vaccine against the deadly new strain of Coronavirus.

At present, there is no cure for the virus which has pneumonia-like symptoms and is contagious among humans.

237,25-1-20,Pompeo loses his temper with journalist over Ukraine questions,"Shouts, glares and unprintable words: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lost his temper at a journalist after she questioned him on the administration's stance on Ukraine, a country at the heart of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial.

It began when Pompeo gave an early morning interview to NPR radio.

Much of the discussion dealt with Iran, but journalist Mary Louise Kelly closed by asking Pompeo about Ukraine.

Democrats accuse Trump of abusing his office by pressuring Kiev to investigate his potential election challenger Joe Biden, a charge for which Trump has been impeached and is currently facing trial in the US Senate.

Pompeo, a close associate of Trump, has been accused of personally failing to defend Marie Yovanovitch, Washington's former ambassador to Ukraine who was abruptly called home last spring after being subjected to a smear campaign led by Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer.

""Do you owe Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch an apology?"" Kelly asked Pompeo.

A tense exchange followed, wherein Pompeo said he had ""defended every State Department official,"" while Kelly asked, in vain, when he had publicly defended Yovanovitch.

""I've said all I'm going to say today. Thank you,"" Pompeo said finally, ending the interview.

But the story didn't end there, and Kelly related the rest in an NPR broadcast on Friday evening.

She said she thanked the secretary, who did not reply but leaned in and glared at her before leaving the room.

A staffer then invited Kelly to Pompeo's private living room, without her recorder.

There, Pompeo ""was waiting and... He shouted at me for about same amount of time as the interview itself lasted,"" Kelly said.

""He was not happy to have been questioned about Ukraine,"" Kelly said, adding that the secretary asked her ""do you think Americans care about Ukraine?"" while saying swear words.

Pompeo then asked his advisers to bring out a map of the world without the countries labeled, to prove that Kelly knew where Ukraine was located. ""I pointed to Ukraine. He put the map away,"" Kelly said.

""People will hear about this,"" said Pompeo, who has publicly attacked journalists in the past.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pompeo-loses-his-temper-with-journalist-over-ukraine-questions-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/pompeo-loses-his-temper-with-journalist-over-ukraine-questions.html
238,25-1-20,Powerful quake kills 20 people in eastern Turkey,"A powerful earthquake has killed at least 20 people and injured more than 1,000 in eastern Turkey, as rescue teams searched through the rubble of collapsed buildings for survivors on Saturday.

At least 30 people were missing following the magnitude 6.8 quake on Friday night, which had its epicentre in the small lakeside town of Sivrice in the eastern province of Elazig.

""It was very scary, furniture fell on top of us. We rushed outside,"" 47-year-old Melahat Can, who lives in the provincial capital of Elazig, told AFP.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said all steps were being taken to aid people affected by the quake, which caused widespread fear.

""We stand by our people,"" Erdogan said on Twitter.

The Turkish government's disaster and emergency management agency (AFAD) said the quake hit Sivrice at around 8.55 pm (1755 GMT). Turkey lies on major faultlines and is prone to frequent earthquakes.

Turkish television showed images of people rushing outside in panic, as well as a fire on the roof of a building.

Interior, environment and health ministers, who were in the quake zone, said the casulties were in Elazig province and in the neighbouring province of Malatya, which lies to the southwest.

At least 20 people died and 1,015 others were wounded, according to AFAD.

""There is nobody trapped under the rubble in Malatya but in Elazig search and rescue efforts are currently under way to find 30 citizens,"" Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said on Friday.

Rescue teams were searching for survivors trapped in a five-storey collapsed building in a village some 30 kilometres from Elazig, according to AFP journalists at the scene. One person was pulled alive from the rubble.

Emergency staff and people waiting at the scene lit fires in the streets to stay warm in freezing temperatures.

Sports centres, schools and guest houses had been opened to accommodate quake victims in Malatya.

Sivrice -- a town with a population of about 4,000 people -- is situated south of Elazig city on the shores of Hazar lake -- one of the most popular tourist spots in the region and the source of the Tigris river.

The lake is home to a ""Sunken City"", with archaeological traces dating back 4,000 years in its waters.

The tremor was felt in several parts of eastern Turkey near the Iraqi and Syrian borders, the Turkish broadcaster NTV reported, adding that neighbouring cities had mobilised rescue teams for the quake area.

""Everybody is in the street, it was very powerful, very scary,"" said Zekeriya Gunes, 68, from Elazig city, after the quakes caused a building to collapse on her street.

""It lasted quite long, maybe 30 seconds,"" added Ferda, 39. ""I panicked and was undecided whether to go out in this cold or remain inside.""

The US Geological Survey assessed the magnitude as 6.7, slightly lower than AFAD, adding that it struck near the East Anatolian Fault in an area that has suffered no documented large ruptures since an earthquake in 1875.

""My wholehearted sympathy to President @RTErdogan and the Turkish people following the devastating earthquake that has hit Turkey. Our search and rescue teams stand ready to assist,"" Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis wrote on Twitter.

In Athens, the Greek premier's office said later that Mitsotakis had spoken by phone to Erdogan.

""The Turkish president... Said Turkish teams had the situation under control for now and that it would be re-evaluated in the morning,"" his office added.

In 1999, a devastating 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Izmit in western Turkey, leaving more than 17,000 people dead including about 1,000 in the country's largest city Istanbul.

In September last year, a 5.7-magnitude earthquake shook Istanbul, causing residents to flee buildings in the economic capital.

Experts have long warned a large quake could devastate the city of 15 million people, which has allowed widespread building without safety precautions.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/powerful-quake-kills-18-people-in-eastern-turkey-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/powerful-quake-kills-20-people-in-eastern-turkey.html

240,25-1-20,Bigg Boss 13: Fans blame Salman Khan for breaking SidNaz,"""Bigg Boss 13"" contestants Sidharth Shukla and Shehnaz Gill are no longer friends. After having been in the spotlight for their cute bonding in the ""Bigg Boss"" house, things between the two nose-dived after host Salman Khan asked the actor to be cautious.

#SidNaz fans are blaming the superstar for the rift.

Their relationship has been one of the most talked-about topics in the house and outside. In fact, it was just last month that actress Jasmin Bhasin had said she was ""jealous"" of Shehnaz because of her ""cute bond"" with Sidharth.

However, over the past few episodes, #SidNaz, as they are called by fans, have hit a rough patch. Sidharth recently told Shehnaz that if she can't be loyal to her own parents, she could never be loyal to anyone else. In fact, Shehnaz, in another episode, said #SidNaz ""kharab ho gaya hai"".

According to a poll by bollywoodlife.com, fans feel that the rift between Sidharth and Shehnaz is caused because of Salman.

In a Weekend Ka Vaar episode, Salman told Sidharth that Shehnaz is in love with him, adding: ""It is a bad one."" Salman also asked Sidharth to handle things carefully. In another episode, he bashed Shehnaz for her behaviour towards Sidharth.

As per the poll, 64 per cent of people feel Salman has caused problems between #SidNaaz, and 22 per cent feel the issues have been created due to Shehnaz Gill's 'flipper' attitude. Another 5 per cent feel it is because of Paras Chhabra and Aarti Singh and because of emotional exhaustion, and 4 per cent feel Sidharth himself is the reason for the rift between him and Shehnaz.

242,25-1-20,Google to test more desktop Search design after backlash,"After facing backlash from its users, Google announced on Twitter that it will test more variations and changes to the desktop search results.

Last week, Google introduced a new design for desktop Search that adds site afavicons' to every result which did not go well with users.

A 'favicon', also known as a shortcut icon, website icon, tab icon, URL icon, or bookmark icon, is a file containing one or more small icons, associated with a particular website or web page.

In a tweet, Google said it has heard the feedback from users.

""Last week we updated the look of Search on desktop to mirror what's been on mobile for months. We've heard your feedback about the update. We always want to make Search better, so we're going to experiment with new placements for favicons,"" the tech company tweeted late Friday.

""Our experimenting will begin today. Over the coming weeks, while we test, some might not see favicons while some might see them in different placements as we look to bring a modern look to desktop Search,"" Google added.

Not just SEOs and SEMs but a wider set of searchers and Google users criticized the desktop Search changes.

""Our early tests of the design for desktop were positive. But we appreciate the feedback, the trust people place in Google, and we're dedicated to improving the experience,"" said Google.

243,25-1-20,India look to extend advantage over New Zealand at high-scoring Eden Park,"India are unlikely to change a winning combination but a few changes in the bowling department won't come as a surprise when the visitors take on New Zealand in the second T20 at the high-scoring Eden Park here on Sunday.

Jasprit Bumrah was the only bowler on either side to concede less than eight runs per over at the peculiar shaped ground with short boundaries in the series opener on Friday.

Both Mohammad Shami (0/53 in 4 overs) and Shardul Thakur (1/44 in 3 overs) were taken to the cleaners with New Zealand batsmen using their pace to collect boundaries at will.

Since Shami is expected to retain his place in the playing eleven, Thakur might make way for Navdeep Saini. However, Saini, with his extra pace, too could go for big runs at the small ground.

It remains to be seen whether India stick to three specialist pacers and two spinners combination or bring in an extra tweaker in Kuldeep Yadav to partner Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravindra Jadeja. Washington Sundar is the the other spin option India have.

If India do play an extra tweaker, all-rounder Shivam Dube will be third fast bowling option.

Considering the conditions, Jadeja and Chahal had done a decent job on Friday, conceding 50 runs off 36 balls and taking a wicket each.

Additionally, Chahal and Kuldeep are yet to play together since the ODI World Cup ended. With the batting bearing a settled look, the team management might be keen to take a punt on their reunion.

On the batting front, Virat Kohli was a pleased skipper as the much scrutinised middle-order delivered for the team under pressure. Shreyas Iyer solidified at his position at number four with an unbeaten 58 off 29 balls.

It was a near perfect start of the tour for the away team which chased down 204 with relative ease to go 1-0 up in the five-match series.

Ahead of the Indian team's departure, there was concern about constant shuffling, much like the ODI experimentation ahead of the 2019 World Cup.

Iyer's form has put paid to all that chatter. The batsman has figured in all of India's 12 T20Is since September last year, averaging 34.14 in 11 innings with two half-centuries and strike-rate 154.19. With his match-winning temperament at Eden Park, Iyer has stitched down a spot in the batting line-up for good.

As Manish Pandey and Dube alternate in finishing duties, aided by K L Rahul's wicket-keeping skills, India's T20 batting line-up finally seems set in the short term barring unforeseen changes.

New Zealand were left pondering about a shortage of 10-15 runs to their total as well as missed chances in the field that allowed the visiting batsmen to get away with a high scoring rate.

Partly, it also had to do with India's surprisingly quick adaptation to the awkward conditions on offer at Eden Park.

In turn, the Black Caps themselves now have to come to terms with India's adaptation if they are to prevent an early 2-0 lead within three days. India had also won here in February 2019, albeit it was a three-match T20I series they had eventually lost 1-2.

Irrespective of the result, the tide seemed to turn for the hosts in terms of their batting form. Senior batsmen Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor defied recent criticism to score attacking half-centuries. It complimented their top-order's runs, albeit they only finished with a par score.

India won key battles during their innings in that new batsmen at the crease were able to maintain the momentum previously generated. It is something New Zealand cannot simply fix with a change in personnel. As such they will be hoping the likes of Colin de Grandhomme and Tim Seifert to come good.

There is a school of thought in the hosts' camp that Williamson should open the batting in T20 cricket, thus taking advantage of the powerplay overs. Given the lightning start provided by openers Martin Guptill and Colin Munro, this seems infeasible for the next game, atleast.

New Zealand expect to field the same eleven, avoiding any temptation to take a look at all-rounders Scott Kuggeleijn and Daryl Mitchell.

Both teams enjoyed a day off on Saturday in lieu of the tight schedule and sterner battles ahead.

Eden Park was only an estimated 60 per cent full on Friday despite New Zealand Cricket anticipating more gate collections owing to the Indian team's popularity.

It remains to be seen if the scheduled late-starts (7.50-8 pm local time) continues to have an impact on match attendances during this T20I series.

Teams:

India: Virat Kohli (captain), Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul (wk), Manish Pandey, Rishabh Pant, Sanju Samson, Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur, Navdeep Saini, Washington Sundar. PTI CN

244,25-1-20,We've to be more aggressive with the ball against India: Sodhi,"Leg-spinner Ish Sodhi believes New Zealand need to be more aggressive with the ball against India's world class batting unit during the second T20I to make an immediate comeback in the five-match series.

India claimed a six-wicket win in the first T20I after chasing down 204 with relative ease to go 1-0 up in the five-match series.

Sodhi feels the hosts didn't bowl many attacking spells to put enough pressure on the visitors.

""We put 200 on the board again. If we can look to be more aggressive with the ball that attitude will be a great learning from the first game. If we are going to go for runs or miss out on a couple opportunities for wickets, you only learn after you try it out,"" said Sodhi on Saturday.

""You have to see how the game is going on. But it differs from batsman to batsman and bowler to bowler. You have to discuss with the captain and the bowling group as well.

""Mitchell Santner and myself do that a lot. Last night he was in the outfield so I spoke a lot with Kane (Williamson). I bowled 2-3 overs' spell, and one of them was a defensive spell; the other was an attacking spell. So we have to bowl with the same attacking attitude throughout,"" he added.

The spinner said it is difficult to create pressure on India, which boosts of some world class batsmen but New Zealand must find a way to make an immediate comeback in the second T20I.

""They have five or six world class batsmen in their side and it will always be difficult to contain them at the best of times. Eden Park with its boundary size is a challenge as well,"" said Sodhi, who took 2 for 36 on Friday.

""Kane was good with the bowlers at end of the game and the thinking as a bowling group was that we have to take wickets. 45 from 4 overs would be decent here but it won't be on many other grounds. So we have to make the aggressive shift for the next game but we did really good with 200 runs on the board. We just need to defend it better.""

Sodhi, who will be a crucial part of the New Zealand attack again, also spoke about the possibility of the Eden Park pitch slowing down for the game on Sunday.

""You have to look at whether wicket gets better. We found it was holding on Friday night, cross-seamers were holding a bit and the ball was spinning a bit too,"" he said.

""We will have to see if it gets slower and if there is dew factor like there was under the lights (on Friday). It's just one of those grounds where good and bad balls go for sixes, and it can be quite hard to contain at times.""

Talking about the challenge of playing at Eden Park, Sodhi said: ""We don't play a lot of cricket there but it's unique. Boundaries are not favouring any one side, same for both sides, and we have been successful in the past there.

""We just have to figure out how to defend there or if we need to change tactics and bowl first. The team management will have that conversation.""

Dew made for a surprise at Eden Park on Friday and Sodhi said it remains to be seen if the same conditions will be prevalent for the second match. He also felt late starts could be a factor throughout this five-match series.

""I haven't had much time to process it but last night we thought we played a decent game. The first half was nicely set up, a huge positive with the bat. The Indians came out pretty hard in the first six overs. They had momentum from end of our innings and we couldn't really go hard at them.

""Maybe we need to train a bit more under lights otherwise we are all used to playing at 8pm starting time. It is not too bad and we have played in the IPL at night time.""

Sodhi, who had dropped a sitter off Virat Kohli, said the floodlights sometimes make it difficult to hold on to catches.

""The lights here are a bit different as most stadiums have five-six towers. Here they are low and in a line, so it can be tough catching. It hits you harder when the ball comes down, but no excuses,"" he said.

""When that catch went down (off Virat Kohli), I was thinking what if he scores big now. But that is the nature of professional cricket and you have to take your chances,"" Sodhi signed off.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/we-ve-to-be-more-aggressive-with-the-ball-against-india--sodhi-2020-01-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/we-ve-to-be-more-aggressive-with-the-ball-against-india--sodhi.html
