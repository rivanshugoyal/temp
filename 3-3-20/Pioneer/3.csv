A decision in this regard was taken at a meeting chaired by Collector Balwant Singh on Sunday.

As per the decision, the beggars would be provided shelter in special houses called ‘Niladri Nilaya’. As many as eight shelter homes, each having an accommodation capacity of 50, would be constructed in the town.

Identification and shifting of the beggars would be carried out by Social Welfare Officers with the help of NGOs. The beggars would be provided food, clothes and other basic amenities free of cost at the shelter homes.

Besides, families of the beggars would be contacted if they can be sent back home. Funds for the purpose would be allocated under the ‘Praful’ scheme of the State Government.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/puri-beggars-to-be-sent-to-8-rehab-homes.html

2,03-3-20,Matric answer sheet evaluation from March 18,"Evaluation of answer sheets of the annual High School Certificate (HSC) Examination that concluded on Monday would begin on March 18.

The evaluation would be held at 61 centres across the State and total 15,000 teachers be engaged for the same, informed Board of Secondary Education (BSE) President Ramashis Hazra here.

Hazra said all necessary steps would be taken to ensure error-free and hassle-free evaluation of the answer sheets this year. The evaluation of answer sheets would continue longer than usual owing to changes in the examination pattern this year. Earlier, the entire evaluation process used to get completed within 12 to 13 days.

“As there were changes in the examination pattern, the evaluation process will continue for 20 days so that teachers get additional time to check,” said Hazra.

4,03-3-20,‘Forests lose growing capacity when stressed’,"An average of seven million acres of forests is being destroyed in the world every year, according to the Jungle Status report published by the United Nations in 2016.

While forests on six million hectares are being reduced due to expansion of agriculture activities, the rest area one million hectares is being cleared of forests due to industrialisation, mining, creation of new human habitations and developmental activities. Thus, goods, services and livelihood sources provided by forests have been depleted gradually. Inhalation of carbon dioxide by trees, flows of rivers and fountains, groundwater, conservation of soil and protection of biodiversity have been impacted negatively. Utilisation of big jungle stretches, increase in cattle grazing area, poaching of wild animals and frequent fires have also put the jungle resources in danger. If the trend of destruction and pressure continues, the forests would lose the power of blossoming.

Experts viewed this at a seminar titled “Reformative programmes for forest management’ organised by the Orissa Environment Society (OES) here on Monday.

They suggested that a roadmap be prepared and activated for protection and conservation of existing forests and creation of new jungles at the earliest.

Noted orchid expert Dr Sharat Chandra Mishra presided over the seminar where former PCCF Suresh Chandra Mohanty attended as chief speaker.

Mohanty stressed on steps for enhancing productivity of forests and protection of diversity, maintaining a record of various categories of trees and animals and shifting of human habitations from jungles. He too stressed on plantation of commercially viable trees and participation of private agencies in creation of forests.

OES Secretrary Dr Jayakrushna Panigrahi said it has been challenge for all to protect natural values of forests now. At outset, vice-president Dr Lala AK Singh delivered the welcome address. Many environmentalists and intellectuals attended the programme. The event came to an end with a vote of thanks proposed by former Nalco General Manager Dr Chittarnajan

7,03-3-20,Reformer par excellence,"Given the ignorance of modern critics and the tragic fact that social evils still persist, it’s time to examine Savarkar’s ignored legacy as a reformer against the caste system

When Vinayak Damodar Savarkar passed away on February 26, 1966, at the ripe age of 82, despite his health wracked by the dehumanising conditions at Cellular Jail, Andaman and Nicobar Islands (July 1911-May 1921), and further imprisonment in Alipore, Ratnagiri and Yerawada jails (till January 1924), some stalwarts remembered his contribution to the freedom movement. Prof Hiren Mukherjee, a Communist Party of India (CPI) MP, had urged the Lok Sabha to pass a resolution condoling his death. After his demise, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had praised him and said that his name was a “byword for patriotism and courage” and in 1970, the then Government issued a commemorative stamp.

When Pandit Bakhle, secretary, Swatantra Veer Savarkar Rashtriya Smarak, informed Indira Gandhi about its plans to observe Savarkar’s birth centenary, she replied, “I have received your letter of May 8, 1980. Veer Savarkar’s daring defiance of the British Government has its own importance in the annals of our freedom movement. I wish success to the plans to celebrate the birth centenary of the remarkable son of India.” (No. 836-PMO/80).

Indira Gandhi even donated `11,000 from her personal account to the Savarkar Trust and directed the Films Division to produce a documentary film on his life, which she personally cleared in 1983. As former Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Vasant Sathe explained, “Savarkar’s contribution to the freedom struggle has to be viewed in totality. You can disagree with his Hindutva but you cannot ignore the fact that he was a great poet and a rationalist.”

However, in February 2003, when the then President, APJ Abdul Kalam, unveiled Savarkar’s portrait in the Central Hall of Parliament, the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) boycotted the function. In fact, influenced by some Leftists, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi urged the President to reconsider his decision to unveil the portrait, though the decision was taken by the joint committee on the installation of portraits/statues of national leaders/parliamentarians in Parliament House Complex, where Pranab Mukherjee (Congress) and J Chittaranjan (CPI) were members.

Savarkar was deeply respected by contemporaries across the spectrum. MN Roy called him “my inspiration.” C Rajagopalachari said, “Savarkar is a symbol of courage, bravery, fearlessness and intense patriotism and he is a foremost leader, who has laboured hard to ignite the desire of freedom in the Indian people (1937).” Mahatma Gandhi said, “Sacrifice is the link that binds both of us together (1944).”

Given the ignorance of modern critics and the tragic fact that social evils, which Savarkar fought against, still persist, it is time to examine his largely ignored legacy as a social reformer. Savarkar was interned in Ratnagiri district for 13 years (January 1924-June 1937) and was asked to abstain from politics, publicly or privately. So, he plunged into the field of social reform with the same passion he once devoted to revolutionary activities. He advocated social reform through his powerful writings and worked to stimulate the change he desired.

The Indian society then was suffocating under a range of taboos: Untouchability (sparsha-bandi), ban on inter-dining with certain castes (roti-bandi), on inter-caste marriages (beti-bandi), on certain occupations (vyavasaya-bandi), on travel overseas (sindhu-bandi), on rites sanctioned by the Vedas (vedokta-bandi) and ban of reconversion (shuddhi-bandi) to the Hindu dharma.

Analysing the social system, Savarkar said birth-based caste categories probably gave stability to Hindu society in the past but the present divisions rested on the debris of the ancient chaturvarna (four varnas). Disagreeing with the view that caste division was an upper caste conspiracy, he said that all castes had to share the blame as almost all used the system to assert superiority over others; hence, all should work to reform it. Savarkar said the varna-caste system was only a custom and Sanatana Dharma would not collapse if caste divisions were destroyed. He emphasised on equal access to wells and temples and said ex-untouchables (poorva-asprushya) had the right to launch civil agitations to secure their lawful rights if caste Hindus resisted.

In 1925, Savarkar organised mass singing of bhajans in small towns around Ratnagiri, urging an end to caste-based segregation in schools. He helped children of unprivileged castes to attend school by distributing chalk and slates and giving monetary incentives to their parents. He also exposed schools that continued caste-based segregation while sending false reports to higher authorities. In 1932, he asked the authorities to drop the title, “Special schools for low caste children” as it gave the children an inferiority complex. Savarkar raised a girl from the Maang community in his own home and personally taught ex-untouchables to read, write and recite the Gayatri mantra. He organised shuddhi for those who had left the Hindu fold under duress and wished to return. He supported BR Ambedkar’s Mahad and Nashik campaigns against untouchability.

In 1930, Savarkar launched the first pan-India Ganeshotsav with kirtans by the so-called untouchables. He started the Patitpavan Mandir, open to all Hindus, and said a priest need not be a Brahmin by birth but should have knowledge of all priestly duties. The temple was consecrated in February 1931 and ex-untouchable leader, Rajbhog of Pune, did pad-puja of Shankaracharya Dr Kurtakoti, thereby breaking a major taboo. The temple trustees were drawn from all varnas. Savarkar said every Hindu, whether Mahar or Maharaj (king), should have the right to recite the Vedas.

Savarkar organised several “dining together” functions, where Muslims and Christians also participated. In March 1936, the famous Marathi actor-singer, Narayan Shripad Rajhans (named Bal Gandharva by Lokmanya Tilak), visited Ratnagiri and asked Savarkar to attend one of his performances. Savarkar agreed on condition that an inter-caste dining be arranged after the show; this was done on March 6, 1936.

When a Congress Government was formed in Bombay Presidency after elections under the Government of India Act 1937, it ordered Savarkar’s unconditional release in 1937. Now free to travel, Savarkar, who had become president of the Hindu Mahasabha, visited homes of ex-untouchables wherever he toured; he would speak at Ganesh festivities only if his lectures were open to them.

Savarkar thundered against caste inequalities: Jatyuchchedak Nibandh (Essays on abolition of caste), Samaj Chitre (Portraits of society) and a drama, Ushaap (Antidote to a curse), on the problem of untouchability, abduction of women, shuddhi and the dishonesty of conservatives. Since he was confined to Ratnagiri, he wrote in Marathi to reach the local audience and stimulated significant social reform in one of the most backward districts of Maharashtra. Although his writings were not translated, his ideas and programmes spread as others picked up the threads.

8,03-3-20,No big deal,"Staying clear of the optics and bonhomie on display all through the US President’s recent visit to India , one gets a sense that the road to even a limited trade deal is thorny

Prior to the maiden visit of US President Donald Trump to India, there was a sense of dejection about the possibility of the US and India signing even a limited trade deal, leave aside a major one. This is to be seen in the backdrop of the absence of United States Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer from the delegation. Earlier, too, Lighthizer had cancelled a visit to New Delhi when he was scheduled to wrap up discussions on a trade agreement.

However, the mood was buoyant at the end of Trump’s visit. This was reflected in the press statement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 25. He stated, “As far as bilateral trade is concerned, there have been positive talks between the two Commerce Ministers. President Trump and I have agreed that our teams will give a legal shape to the understanding that our Commerce Ministers have reached. We have also agreed to start negotiations for a big trade deal. We hope that it will yield good results in mutual interest.”

So, what is the understanding reached between the Commerce Ministers on either side? What is the time-frame for reaching a limited trade deal? What is the big trade pact? When will it happen?

Participating in the ‘US-India Forum: Partners for Growth’ on February 25, Commerce Minister, Piyush Goyal said, “On the economic front, having almost closed the last contours of the limited trade deal and with the announcement of a much larger trade deal in the offing, we have moved to a new level of engagement.” The deal could include restoration of benefits of low or zero duty to certain Indian exports under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) and market access for each other’s agricultural products, including pulses, dairy, almonds, walnuts and so on (items of interest to the US), fruits like pomegranate and grapes (of interest to India).

Even as the limited deal is largely about goods and market access, the big deal — call it Free Trade Agreement (FTA) — is all-encompassing, going much beyond goods and incorporating inter alia intellectual property rights (IPRs), investment and services, issues related to visas and manpower movement. The USTR has begun the filing process to initiate FTA talks. As per extant rules, the US Trade Promotion Authority requires the administration to notify the Congress 90 calendar days prior to entering into a trade agreement.

Staying clear of the optics and bonhomie on display all through, one gets a sense that the road to even a limited trade deal is thorny. At a fundamental level, both Trump and Modi are hard core nationalists and have increasingly leaned towards “protectionism” (even though in their posturing, they talk of “free” and “fair” trade. This was seen in the address by each). While the former has orchestrated his policies under “Buy American, Hire American”, the latter does it under the “Make in India” banner. Trump has unilaterally taken a number of steps which seriously undermine the multilateral rules of “free” and “fair” trade under the World Trade Organisation (WTO). These include rejecting the demand of developing countries for finding a “permanent solution” to stockholding for food security despite a decision at the ninth WTO ministerial held in Bali in 2013; hike in customs duty on steel and aluminum to 25 per cent and 10 per cent on imports (sans preferred friends of the USA); review of the H-1B visa programme to restrict the entry of foreign specialists/professionals to only “most-skilled and highest-paid applicants.”

Early last year, the US also asked the WTO to do away with the extant Special and Differential Treatment (S&DT) available to developing countries. The S&DT enables the latter to give less than reciprocal commitments. A major plank of this special dispensation is a fairly liberal threshold of 10 per cent aggregate measurement support (AMS) — an acronym for subsidies in WTO parlance — for agriculture for developing countries as against five per cent for developed countries. If, S&DT is withdrawn, India will have to limit its subsidies to less than five per cent of the value of agricultural production against 10 per cent currently. Last year (June), Trump also withdrew the over five decades old special dispensation viz. Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) available to developing countries (including India) under which they are eligible for export of specified products such as textiles, leather footwear and to the USA at low or “zero” customs duty. Justified on the ground that India is no longer a developing country, it has affected Indian exports worth $5.6 billion. The US, under the Trump administration, has also blocked the appointment of members of the appellate authority of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) — an authority for adjudicating disputes arising from non-compliance with WTO rules. At present, there being just one member in the body against the required strength of seven, the dispute resolution process has come to a grinding halt.

India, too, has pursued its protectionist agenda with alacrity. Thus, it levies high customs duty on import of electronic items, especially mobile phones, dairy products and automobiles (for instance, Harley Davidson bikes in which Trump has keen interest); controls the price of medical equipment viz. stents, knee implants and so on; restricts policy on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in e-commerce; localisation of data generated from transactions by international digital and payment companies from their operations in India. There is a lack of effective enforcement of laws for protection of IPRs, especially patents, absence of a law on data protection and so on.

In pursuit of its “Buy American, Hire American” mission, Trump is seeking to do away with special privileges available to developing countries under the WTO and undermining the authority of this multilateral body on the one hand and extracting concession for its industries and businesses under bilateral deals with individual countries on the other.

Modi seems to be equally determined to protect the interests of India’s industries and consumers and has even taken recourse to retaliatory measures. For instance, after the US hiked tariff on steel and aluminum, India imposed duties of up to 50 per cent on 28 products, including almonds, walnuts, apple and so on.

The tit-for-tit syndrome can be seen from the US side as well. For instance, the withdrawal of GSP dispensation by Trump was triggered by changes in India’s policy on 100 per cent FDI in e-commerce “market-place” vide December 26, 2018 circular amending the Press Note 3 (2016-17) to say that “the marketplace can’t have ownership of the vendors selling on the platform”, nor can it have an “exclusive” arrangement with the latter. This hit the US-based MNCs like Amazon and Walmart, forcing them to rework their business plans; hence, the retaliatory action by the US. The gulf between the stance taken by the US and India is even wider in areas such as 100 per cent FDI in multi-brand retail (MBR), offline and online; localisation of data generated by international digital and payment companies from their operations in India; effective enforcement of laws for protection of IPRs, especially patents and law on data protection (this is mainly with respect to the data generated and submitted by MNCs in pharmaceutical and agrochemical sectors to the national regulators viz. the Drug Controller General of India [DCGI] and Central Insecticides Board & Registration Committee [CIB&RC] to seek approval for marketing of their new products in India).

Citing the dire need to protect the interests of millions of small traders, India has ruled out 100 per cent FDI in MBR. On data generated by international digital companies, while India would like them to retain all critical data with Indian servers and even set up a local office, Trump is uncomfortable with the idea. On protection of IPRs, even as India has retained Section 3(D) in the Patent (Amendment) Act 2005 (this is to prevent grant of frivolous patent), the US wants this to go. On data protection, another demand vociferously put up by the USTR (albeit on behalf of US-based MNCs), India is in no mood to oblige. It has argued that this goes even beyond what has been agreed to under the Trade-Related Aspects of the Intellectual Property Rights agreement of the WTO (1995).

Given these positions, which are poles apart, the FTA, that too before this year-end, sounds like daydreaming. A limited deal with some concessions on both sides could be done within this time frame. However, from the statements emanating from “key persons”, it would appear that even this idea has been put on the backburner for now.

9,03-3-20,The Bengal gamble,"Amit Shah continues to drive the CAA as a key campaign plank for the Bengal polls. What should Mamata do?

No matter what the results of the Delhi elections have been, no matter how people rejected the politics of polarisation and divisiveness, the BJP will not stop running with the flare gun. Even if it burns lives and sears memories, it will go ahead with its identity politics in the name of cleansing and securing the nation. If the promise of development was the access card for the 2014 mandate, May 2019 onwards the rationale is about why development is in ferment because of pollutants among people, because the nation is not secure from “virus” threats of the “alien” kind implanted many centuries ago. This justification works in core factories of the Sangh Parivar, one that has led Union Home Minister and party supremo Amit Shah to unfurl his campaign for the Bengal 2021 polls with a renewed emphasis on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The BJP hopes this will be a trumpcard for three reasons. First, it sharpens the polarity with its harshest critic on its identity and race-profiling policies, Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee. Second, Bengal has become a fertile ground for polarisation with the decimation of both the Left and the Congress as secular entities. It is home to about 27 per cent Muslims that congeal around Mamata and is a swirling petri dish of latent anxieties about Partition and infiltration. Third, Bengal represents the Leftist liberal way of life and, as another bank of the ideological divide, is one that the BJP wants to desperately breach. Emboldened by its performance in the Lok Sabha polls with 18 seats, the BJP is pitching CAA as its arrowhead, hoping to consolidate those numbers. Hindu refugees are a deciding factor in about 80 Assembly seats and spread around 50 others in the 294-member House. Besides, by just talking about the CAA, Shah is selling it as a virtuous proposition in itself, as opposed to Mamata’s linking it with census profiles under the National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). Even at the national level, the BJP is using CAA to explain how it helps persecuted Hindi refugees and covering up what it implies, that it is exclusionary in violation of the Constitution. Or that Muslims left out for want of legacy data in census drives, intentionally or not, have no other way of proving citizenship or seeking redress. Mamata is the only politician to expose a sinister design behind the CAA-NRC combination that has put the BJP on the backfoot in a State that hasn’t taken to divisive politics, except in pockets dominated by migrant labourers or border districts. Hence, Shah’s fervent appeal to Hindu refugees like Matuas and Rajbanshis to vote for the BJP because by protesting against CAA, he argued, Mamata was eroding their settler status vis-a-vis Muslims. Matuas, who migrated from Bangladesh during Partition, matter in 74 seats. Since 2009, they have been with the Trinamool. But ever since the death of their leading matriarch, Boro Ma, who was close to Mamata, they are a house divided. And BJP has successfully used Mamata’s overt minority appeasement of the past to tell Matuas that they have been cheated.

Mamata, too, has wisened up after the Lok Sabha debacle. At her recent rallies in these constituencies, she has run down CAA as a needless exercise, saying she had regularised refugee colonies and that official recognition meant that all Hindu residents were genuine citizens. She, therefore, nullified the need to queue up for fresh documents under CAA. She is also making right noises about “extremists” among minorities and may have to follow through her promises of a Matua Welfare Board, dedicated colleges and a university. While the polarisation of the Hindu and Muslim vote had helped her at one time, the Trinamool chief, like many other Opposition leaders, has realised that the predominant Hindu sentiment is now a decisive factor in the country’s political eco-system. One that is not about winning over Muslim votes but about convincing Hindu voters that they are a priority. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal also displayed signs of Hindu ritualism, which is the new normal, despite winning a mandate based on his performance. The BJP has successfully supplanted votebank politics with a consolidated Hindu appeasement. Mamata is a Kali bhakt herself and chooses to live her faith than sporting it for political reasons. That is the reason she played to the Muslims through visual rhetoric, landing herself in the BJP’s trap. The question is how reactively Hindu she will be in the light of the local body elections later this year? The bigger question is, can her all-pervasive crusader image afford it? But Didi has a pulse of her people and a personality cult that makes her almost a demi-god to the masses. For the first time, she can’t take that for granted.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-bengal-gamble-2020-03-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/the-bengal-gamble.html
10,03-3-20,Well begun but not half done,"The proposed law is silent on the right to parenthood of LGBTQs and doesn’t specify monetary compensation to the surrogate mother

Surrogacy in India has come a long way, from the country becoming a popular destination for childless couples since 2002 to the surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2016, which restricted the option of surrogacy for many. The law regulating surrogacy was first mooted in 2016 in the wake of disturbing reports of exploitation of women, who were confined to hostels, not provided adequate post-pregnancy medical care and paid a pittance for repeatedly becoming surrogate mothers to supplement family income. In 2018-19, too, several cases of harassment and violence against surrogate mothers were reported to the police and brought before courts in the country. These incidents led to an increase in demands for a law regulating surrogacy, protecting rights of both parents and surrogate mothers.

As a result, on February 26, the Union Cabinet approved recommendations made by the 23-member Rajya Sabha Select Committee on Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2020. This allows a “willing woman” and not just a “close relative” to become a surrogate mother and proposes that single women can also benefit from its provisions, besides infertile Indian couples.

Today, there are two types of surrogacy. The first type of surrogacy arrangement is “traditional surrogacy” or “complete surrogacy” in which the eggs of the surrogate mother are used in the conception of the child. The surrogate mother is genetically related to the child and is thus more accurately considered the child’s biological mother. In this process the surrogate mother conceives the baby by means of “artificial insemination.” It is a form of surrogacy in which a gestational carrier is paid to carry a child to maturity in her womb. The second type of surrogacy arrangement is “gestational surrogacy”, in which the wife is fertile but incapable of carrying a growing foetus; the child is conceived by “in-vitro fertilisation” using the wife’s eggs and her husband’s sperm, and the resulting embryo is implanted in the surrogate mother’s uterus.

There is another kind of surrogacy called “altruistic surrogacy”. It is a situation where the surrogate receives no financial reward for the pregnancy or the relinquishment of the child. Another term “commercial surrogacy” is much in debate where a woman agrees to bear the child for a fee over and and above the medical expenses.

The earlier version of the Bill defined commercial surrogacy as a surrogacy or its related procedures undertaken for a monetary benefit. In India, the demand for surrogacy has been on the rise due to decisions to have a baby later in life, problems with the uterus, pelvic tuberculosis, infections and so on. India is one of the few countries that allowed commercial surrogacy for a long period of time apart from Russia, Ukraine and some states in the US.

With the new law, commercial surrogacy will be prohibited, including sale and purchase of human embryo and gametes and ethical surrogacy to lndian married couples, Indian-origin married couples and Indian single woman (widows or divorcees between the age of 35 and 45 years) will be allowed on fulfillment of certain conditions. The proposed law says that only Indian couples can opt for surrogacy in the country. It also allows the person using a surrogate mother to pay just for her medical expenses to reduce commercialisation. The proposed insurance cover for surrogate mothers has now been increased to 36 months from 16 months provided in the earlier draft. The text further proposes to regulate surrogacy by establishing a National Surrogacy Board at the central level and State Surrogacy Board and appropriate authorities in States and Union Territories respectively.

The proposed law allows a “willing woman” and not just a “close relative” to become a surrogate mother for the simple reason that with families getting smaller these days, it is becoming difficult to find somebody among close relatives for the task. So altruistic surrogacy has been allowed, where there is no element of coercion and is done in the spirit of helping somebody. This would ensure that all those who are needy can take advantage of science.

However, the definition of “infertility” as the inability to conceive after five years of unprotected intercourse should be deleted on the ground that it is too long a period for a couple to wait for a child. Further, the proposed legislation is silent on the right to parenthood of LGBTQ couples. Health experts, however, criticised the absence of monetary compensation for the surrogate. They say that while it is a good step to omit near relative clause for a surrogate, it doesn’t help to not include monetary compensation for the surrogate because not many women would be interested in carrying someone’s child without being paid for it. They also seek establishment of surrogate clinics for mothers at the district level with a full time woman medical practitioner. Surrogacy is a boon for women who are looking to make ends meet. Although, surrounded by a few criticisms, this is a welcome move by the Government where a liberal view or approach on the issues of reproductive rights of women, was much needed.

11,03-3-20,A Chair for women,"Honouring women scientists with 11 Chairs is good provided we find enough candidates to fill them

Not a single woman features in a quick search of India’s top 10 scientists. A name doesn’t even feature in GK quizzes. As per a report published by the World Economic Forum, only 14.3 per cent of science researchers in the country are women. In such a scenario, the Government’s decision to set up 11 Chairs in the name of eminent Indian women scientists in various fields “to inspire, encourage, empower women and give due recognition to young women researchers excelling in various fields” came as a breath of fresh air. For those who missed the news, the 11 eminent women to be so honoured are physicist Bibha Chowdhuri, mathematician Raman Parimala, botanist Janaki Ammal, organic scientist Darshan Ranganathan, cytogeneticist Archana Sharma, chemist Asima Chatterjee, anthropologist Iravati Karve, doctor Kadambini Ganguly, meteorologist Anna Mani, engineer Rajeshwari Chatterjee and biomedical researcher Kamal Ranadive. Even though some would term the move too little and too late, the fact remains that the only woman from India after whom a Chair has been set up till now is the late Mother Teresa. So this is a step in the right direction. Women constitute 35-40 per cent of the total enrollment in science programmes. But just a few of them go on to pursue scientific careers. Nobody asks why till the images of women scientists celebrating the launch of a mission are used to symbolise the great surge forward by them. Even after the film Mission Mangal, how many of us know about the real women portrayed in the film? Just the way most of us don’t watch women’s cricket or even know the names of the cricketers save for a few star players, we are not conditioned to celebrate women who break the glass/mud ceiling or their achievements. It is no wonder then that even in ISRO, which should promote a scientific temper and hence “never rely on pre -conceived notions/biases”, a little over eight per cent women work in its scientific and technical department. Since its emergence, not a single woman has ever headed the organisation.

The Indian National Science Academy, Indian Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Agricultural Sciences have awarded only five per cent of their fellowships to women, a patronising and placatory soother really. But, given the dismal figures of women’s participation in different disciplines of science, will they find 11 women eminent enough to fill these Chairs? Only time will tell.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-chair-for-women-2020-03-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/a-chair-for-women.html
12,03-3-20,Is faith enough to clean the Ganga?,"A Ganga yatra and awareness drive may be the first steps to save the river but are far from the solution. Thousands of crores have already been spent to clean the Ganga. Yet, in Allahabad, the river water is undrinkable

Ecological violence is contagious, much like indifference, which has become the norm in our society. Violence and indifference are enough to set a nation on the path of destruction. We have eroded our mountains and chopped up catchment forests so that India is poised on the edge of the environmental precipice. The cost, 7,00,000 people die prematurely due to water pollution, while millions linger on with symptoms of dysentery to heavy metal poisoning. Our surface water resources shrink and groundwater retreats into newer depths, all precursors to water wars in the next decade.

While, younger “contractors” loot and destroy our rivers and sandbanks, illegally steal gravel and mine the bedrocks, the sententious older generation preaches duty, conveniently forgetting that it instilled indifference in us.

The Government is not responsible for the pollution: We are. The Ganga river, venerated as a living goddess, today is laden not with fertile silt and minerals but with a toxic mixture of garbage, faeces, untreated sewage, heavy metals and drug-resistant pathogens. Ganga is the fourth most polluted river of the world, toxic not only for human beings but even for the fishes and plants.

There are reports, right from The New York Times to the Government’s own assessments, that reveal mother Ganga to be little less than malodorous sewage meandering across the Gangetic plains. It was shameful that especially for US President Donald Trump’s visit, we admitted Yamuna into the ICU and galvanised it by dumping water into the river. Now that Trump has gone, the Yamuna will again become a filthy stream carrying flush water to the ocean.

A Ganga Yatra and awareness drives may be the first steps to cure this problem but it is far from the solution. Thousands of crores have already been spent to save the Ganga, yet even today in Allahabad, the river water is undrinkable.

I am reminded of the aftermath of the Ardh Kumbh Mela in 2019, one of the biggest gatherings of the Hindu faith, which saw the whole city drenched in pathogens and waste rotting all along the river banks. There is no question mark on the faith of the millions of devotees but is this faith in good faith?

The answer is tricky but the truth is obvious. Misguided faith or rather lip service to faith has killed one of the largest rivers systems of our world and in record time. A bath in the Ganga is cheap indulgence for the sinning mind. To care only for oneself and not the river is not Hinduism but egomaniacal perversion of Hinduism.

The solution is also a hard one which involves sacrifice. In good faith, we have to first regulate the holy dips in the river, especially in the upper regions of Uttarakhand. Sewage, which is 80 per cent of the pollution, needs to be immediately stopped.

A national plan for Ganga conservation should pay special attention to effective sewage management, especially in the upper tracts of the river. Currently, we can’t even stop waste. from rafting camps on the Ganga. We have to ensure purity at source, without an effective sewage management system, the river can never heal.

There is also a need for an active portal that reports the health of the river, including that of her tributaries. The next step is to restore catchments areas of the Ganga. This means that all tributaries of the Ganga, need to be declared a national treasure and any sand mining, rock mining or waste dumping should become a serious crime. Harsh punishments need to be proposed.

The rural police across States needs to be made aware about these issues, as water may even be more precious than gold in the very near future. But the biggest polluters, the industry needs stricter regulations and a new Clean Ganga tax. As part of the stricter regulations, the Government needs to look at Norway or Sweden and their river policy.

All polluting industries need to have a treatment plant on site and the State Pollution Board reports on water need to verified by a third party to have complete transparency in the matter.

CSR funds from major pollutant cities in the Ganga Basin need to be redistributed for rejuvenation activities. Eco-entrepreneurs need to be encouraged and ecological services should be valued and monetised. For example, if tanneries in a particular area cannot themselves set up a treatment plant, they can tie up with these entrepreneurs to provide them with ecological services. Small pockets along the river need to be developed not as industry zones but as green industry zones, exclusively for projects related to cleaning of water and green zones along the river. NGOs and farmers around the Ganga should be encouraged to adopt organic farming and the State Governments need to subsidise the transition to organic farming. Ganga Organic can even be developed as a brand for consumers. The Bihar Government has undertaken a similar programme called the Javik Setu that needs to be emulated across the Gangetic plains.

It is about time, we the people of India and children of the river civilisations reclaim our sanity and love for our mothers — the rivers of India. One is reminded of the Garuda Purana — “Thousands of man’s sins get destroyed by the holy sight of the Ganges, and he becomes pure by the touch of the water of the Ganges, by consuming it, or just by pronouncing Ganga.”

Such was the holiness and purity of our mother Ganga. It is time we clean ourselves and our society of greed, selfishness and ecological violence and through good faith make the Ganga our holy mother again.

To conclude, the crisis of the Ganga or Yamuna or any other river for that matter is a crisis of faith. We as a society have destroyed our culture and now reap the harvest — disease and pollution. A dead river represents a dead faith and a cadaver of Hinduism. Our greed and our religion cannot co-exist.

Either the river lives, with all sacredness within it or triumphs greed and ecological destruction. Money and Government efforts are not enough to clean the Ganga, only sacrifice and faith can heal our river. We need a Ganga Satyagraha to ensure the sense of duty is rekindled in our society.

13,03-3-20,Cong says Govt creating fear in commuters,"Even as RTO officials are going all out against traffic violators, the Congress on Monday alleged that the State Government is only creating a sense of fear among commuters.

Reacting to the allegations of misbehaviour by police personnel during checking of vehicles, Congress MLA Suresh Routray said the Government is creating an environment of fear for the commuters. “People commuting to important places like hospitals and schools are facing a lot of inconveniences due to the strict enforcement of the new MV Act,” he told reporters.

However, refuting Routray’s allegations, Transport Minister Padmanabha Behera said, “We don’t encourage such behaviour. All RTOs have been directed not to misbehave with any commuter during checking. Since September 2019, there has been a decline of 50 per cent in the number of road accidents in the State due to the strict enforcement of the MV Act. We further aim to reduce the number of accidents and protect human lives,” he added.

Notably, a whopping amount of fine of Rs 1.06 crore was collected from traffic rule violators across the State under the amended MV Act in the past 24 hours. The six-month relaxation period for implementation of the law came to an end on February 29, 2020.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-says-govt-creating-fear-in-commuters.html
14,03-3-20,Women colleagues would go for tonsuring en masse,"Agitating in the State Capital on 83rd day, guest faculties of the Government colleges of Madhya Pradesh threatened that their women colleagues would get their heads tonsured collectively. To start with, one teacher was tonsured on Monday.

One of the women guest faculties, Lashkari Das, got her head tonsured by a barber as a mark of the protest on Monday at the Shahjehani park, where the protest has been underway since December 2. “Regularisation as promised by the Congress leaders is the only demand for us,” Das told the media accusing the State Government of ignoring their pleas persistently.

Asked what would be next step if the State Government still fails to fulfill their demand, a committed Das stated that women teachers would go for tonsuring en masse on March 8 and then they would be compelled to immolate themselves if nothing happens. President of the Guest Faculties Agitation, Devraj Singh, also got his head tonsured in solidarity with Das.

On February 19, Dr Shaheen Khan too had got her heads tonsured in protest. Her hair was sent to Congress president Sonia Gandhi through courier as mark of protest. On being told that Higher Education Minister Jitu Patwari had announced to fill up 1,250 posts with guest faculties, Dr Khan said this should be done through the department portal.

Including Sanjay Kumar who had committed suicide in disgust, the guest faculties have lost three more of their colleagues due to one reason or the other in the course of the protest.

Dr Surjeet Singh Bhadauria, the convener of the protest claimed that they won’t compromise on their protest unless orders for regularisation are issued.

Thousands of guest faculties were employed with Government colleges for years but recently the State Government started filling up these posts with candidates who had cleared Public Service Commission exam, thus around 4,500 lost jobs and started protesting in Bhopal.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/women-colleagues-would-go-for-tonsuring-en-masse.html

So, friends, if you are happy that your doctor told you “your reports are excellent, do not worry for another five years!”

27,03-3-20,Sustainable wildlife mgmt is need of hour,"The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) decided to proclaim March 3, the day of the adoption of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 1973, as “World Wildlife Day”. This year, the day’s theme is “Sustaining all life on earth.""

Wildlife plays an important role in balancing the environment. It provides stability to different natural processes of nature. The importance of wildlife can be categorized as ecological importance, economic importance, investigatory importance and conservation of biological diversities etc.

Many nations have established their tourism sector around their natural wildlife. South Africa has, for example, many opportunities for tourists to see the country's wildlife in its national parks, such as the Kruger Park. In South India, the Periar Wildlife Sanctuary, Bandipur National Park and Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary are situated in and around forests. India is home to many national parks and wildlife sanctuaries showing the diversity of its wildlife and much of its unique fauna. There are 89 national parks, 13 bio reserves and more than 400 wildlife sanctuaries across India which are the best places to go to see Bengal tigers, Asiatic lions, Indian elephants, Indian rhinoceroses, birds, and other wildlife which reflect the importance that the country places on nature and wildlife conservation.

India is home to a large number and variety of animals. It is a hot spot for biodiversity with its various ecosystems ranging from the Himalayas in the north to the evergreen rain-forest of the south, the desert sands of the west to the marshy mangroves of the east.

India, lying within the Indomalaya ecozone, is home to about 7.6 per cent of all mammalian, 14.7 per cent of all amphibian, 6 per cent of avian (bird), 6.2 per cent of reptilian, and 6.0 percent of flowering plant species. The exploitation of land and forest resources by humans along with capturing and trapping for food and sport has led to the extinction of many species in India in recent times. These species include mammals such as the Asiatic cheetah, wild zebu, Indian Javan rhinoceros, and Northern Sumatran rhinoceros.

Some species of birds have gone extinct in recent times. The Indian Government has established eighteen biosphere reserves of India which protect larger areas of natural habitat and often include one or more national parks and/or reserves, along buffer zones that are open to some economic uses.

40,03-3-20,Setback for Odisha’s solar power plan,"Solar energy sector in Odisha faces a huge setback with the Green Energy Corridor (GEC) not being given green signal by the Centre.

Odisha has planned to generate 2,200 MW solar power by 2022 and with GEC not being approved, evacuation of solar power will face a hurdle.

The OPTCL designated State Transmission Utility was supposed to evacuate 280 Mega Watt (MW) of solar power from solar park.

Under Ultra Mega Solar Power Park, a 1,000-MW Solar Park was allotted by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy to be developed by Green Energy Development Corporation of Odisha (GEEDCOL). Accordingly, a Detailed Project Report (DPR) was prepared with an estimate of Rs 313.80 crore for establishment of solar evacuation pooling station at Nildungri for evacuation of 225 MW and another 55 MW at Manmunda .

The DPR was sent to the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) for approval and after examining the DPR, the CEA approved the proposal.

So the OPTCL went ahead with tendering process and when it was at final stage, the OPTCL requested for 40 per cent (PC) of the grant from the National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF).

The NCEF is a fund created in 2010-11 using the carbon tax - clean energy cess - for funding research and innovative projects in clean energy technologies of public sector or private sector entities, up to the extent of 40 per cent of the total project cost.

However, the MNRE instead of approving the proposal has informed that the Green Energy Corridor (GEC) II Scheme has not yet been approved by the Government of India. So no sanction can be issued and contract cannot be awarded by the State under GEC II.

Unless 40 per cent of funding is released, the pooling station at Nildungri in Jujumura and Manmunda will not come up resulting in a setback for the solar power generation plan, officials admit.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/setback-for-odisha---s-solar-power-plan.html

Similarly, employees on first year of optional extension in service, those who have attained the age of 58 or 60 years, as the case may be, and are availing the first year of optional extension in service, or whose first year optional extension is scheduled to start in the inter-regnum period, shall stand retired from the service from September 30, 2020.

Notably, the State Government had earlier allowed extension in service to all categories of employees, up to the age of 60 or 62 years, on submission of option in this regard, as per the (amended) Rule 3.26. This had enabled the Government to make recruitment to fill up the large number of vacancies in government posts and tackle the shortage of staff in various departments. However, with the staff shortage now effectively managed, this ground for optional extension can no longer be justified, the Cabinet felt.

Further, the extension in service had also led to the promotion chances of the feeder categories of employees being adversely impacted, triggering resentment among the employees.

It was also felt that the existing unemployment scenario demanded increasing employment avenues for the state’s youth, both within and outside the government.

In any case, felt the Cabinet, the policy was only for a temporary phase and was never intended to be a permanent feature. That is why the date of retirement on superannuation has also been retained at 58 or 60 years in the relevant Rule, with the provision for extension in service kept to be used only under exceptional circumstances and in public interest only.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/weed-corrupt-employees--deadwood-out--cm.html
48,03-3-20,Punjabi freedom fighters’ sacrifices to be highlighted in Andamans,"More than 70 years after they were lodged in the Cellular Jail at the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Punjab wants to honour its freedom struggle heroes. The state lawmakers on Monday batted for giving a dignified space for the Punjabi freedom fighters and martyrs in the narrative of Port Blair’s Cellular Jail, earlier known as Kalapani.

To ensure that the echo of their supreme sacrifices will be heard loud and clear thousands of kilometers away, Punjab Vidhan Sabha unanimously accepted the recommendations of the House Committee to prominently mention about the Punjabis and Sikhs’ contribution in the light and sound show presented at Cellular Jail, to name a road in Port Blair and one of the 350 islands after a Punjabi martyr, to install statues of Punjabi freedom fighters and martyrs outside Cellular Jail, among others.

The House panel, headed by the Congress MLA from Ajnala Harpartap Singh Ajnala, was constituted by the Speaker Rana KP Singh on December 12, 2018, to seek a report on the supreme sacrifices made by the Punjabis in the freedom struggle at Andaman and Nicobar islands along with other facts.

Pointing that the Punjabi freedom fighters have been sidelined in the Cellular Jail Museum and the Light and Sound programme that is staged there every evening, the Committee urged the Punjab Government to take up with the authorities of Andaman and Nicobar islands to ensure that the names of Punjabi freedom fighters and martyrs be prominently mentioned along with their pictures in the show.

The report listed the names of Udham Singh (Gaddar Movement), Sohan Singh Bhakna (Gaddar Movement), Amar Singh Engineer of second Mandalay Conspiracy Case, Babbar Gian Singh or Babbar Movement, Lahina Singh Mistry of Kuka Movement, Indian Independence League president Dr Diwan Singh, besides those who were sentenced to Kalapaani including those punished under martial law, guilty under Amritsar alliance bank action case and national bank action case, among others.

The Committee also urged the State Government to prepare a light and sound show or a laser show on all the Punjabis and Sikhs sentenced to Andaman and Nicobar and present it at the Jang-e-Azaadi memorial, at Kartarpur in Jalandhar by allotting a separate space for the same.

“The show must have all the names and photographs of all the freedom fighters and martyrs along with their brief life history. A special gallery, by the name of “Freedom Fighters and Martyrs of Andaman and Nicobar Islands (Kalapaani island)” should also be set up showing their pictures, names along with their complete address so that our current and future generations must know about these brave hearts,” recommended the panel.

Ajnala, while presenting the report, informed the House that the panel held 22 sittings and “also visited the Cellular jail, Andaman and Nicobar Islands…We are presenting the report after deep research into various sources, contacting the subject experts, besides going through related books and documents”.

The committee also comprised Congress MLAs Barindermeet Singh Pahara, Kulbir Singh Zira, and Tarsem Singh DC; Aam Aadmi Party MLA Kanwar Sandhu, SAD MLA Gurpartap Singh Wadala, BJP MLA Som Parkash (later replaced by fellow party MLA Dinesh Singh Babbu after his election to the Parliament).

Notably, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, while concluding the discussion on the Governor Address in February 2019, had suggested that the state may have a memorial built in the memory of many Punjabis who have sacrificed their lives for the country while serving sentence in the Cellular Jail.

The state Jails Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, in November 2018, had raised the issue with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the then Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh by writing a detailed letter demanding a dignified space for Punjabi freedom fighters in the narrative of Cellular Jail.

Randhawa, in his letter, had sought the Prime Minister’s intervention “to preserve this national heritage in the right perspective”, while demanding to rectify the “distortions in history”. He had demanded that the names of all the freedom fighters from Punjab deported to Andaman should be displayed, along with photographs. The Light and Sound programme should be recast to reflect the totality of the situation in a balanced way with the addition of Punjab’s contribution to the freedom struggle in the context of Kalapani, he had added.

In fact, the Shiromani Gurudwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) had also taken up this issue with the Andaman and Nicobar authorities, in May 2017, with its then Lt Governor Prof Jagdish Mukhi assuring to name three roads in Port Blair after Shaheed-e-Azam Bhagat Singh, Shaheed Dr Diwan Singh Kalepani and Shaheed Madan Lal Dhingra, revisiting the light and sound show, among other things.

Going by the record available, out of 121 freedom fighters who courted gallows, 93 were Sikhs. Similarly, out of 2,646 freedom fighters sentenced to life imprisonment, no less than 2,147 were again Sikhs.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjabi-freedom-fighters----sacrifices-to-be-highlighted-in-andamans.html
49,03-3-20,"CM orders special girdawari of rabi crops affected by heavy rains, hailstorm","Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday announced special girdawari (revenue survey) of rabi crops affected due to heavy rains and hailstorms in some parts of the state recently.

The special girdawari was ordered for assessment of crop loss so that the farmers can get compensation for damaged crops. The CM made the announcement in the State Assembly here after some members expressed concern over loss of crops due to unseasonal rains and hailstorms.

On Sunday, Haryana's Cooperation Minister Banwari Lal had inspected fields of farmers and interacted with those whose crops were damaged due to rains and hailstorm in Rewari district. In the Assembly, Khattar said that the ‘Meri Fasal Mera Byora Yojana’ portal is in the interest of the farmers of the State. After every six months, the farmer uploads the information of his sown area on this portal. The availability of the maximum information to the Government will certainly be beneficial for the farmers.

Apprising the House on the issues raised during the discussion on the budget address, Khattar apprised the House that the produce of the farmers who are registered on ‘Meri Fasal Mera Byora’ portal will be purchased firstly and later the produce of other farmers not registered on the portal will be purchased. After this, the produce of the farmers of the other neighboring states whether from Uttar Pradesh or Punjab and Rajasthan will be purchased, he added.

The Chief Minister also informed the House that he himself constantly monitors the information on the ‘Meri Fasal Mera Byora Yojana’ portal. He said that as he checked till 3.50 pm on Monday, 44,10,000 acres of land had been registered, which after one hour increased to 44,13,000 acres, which certainly reflects that the farmers are interested in registering their land on this portal.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-orders-special-girdawari-of-rabi-crops-affected-by-heavy-rains--hailstorm.html
50,03-3-20,Punjab Assembly all for promotion of Punjabi language,"All for promotion and prioritizing Punjabi language, Punjab lawmakers on Monday want Punjabi to be made a compulsory subject in State’s all Government, private, and even convent schools till Class X. The legislators, cutting across party lines, resolved to make efforts to implement Punjabi language in capital city Chandigarh.

Besides, the Vidhan Sabha also resolved to recommend the State Government to ensure that all official work in Government’s offices and even courts is done in Punjabi language.

The resolution, unanimously passed by the House, was moved by the state Technical Education and Tourism Minister Charanjit Singh Channi urging that all Punjab Government institutions should be made mandatory to work in Punjabi language and the functioning of the courts should also be ensured in Punjabi.

The state government was also recommended to enact necessary law along with the proper arrangements to check the activities or steps to be taken against the promotion of Punjabi language by an individual or undertaking.

“A Commission should be set up by the government to act against those officers or any employee who hesitate and do not work in Punjabi ,” said Channi while insisting that Punjabi should be implemented as second language in Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Chandigarh — which are carved out of Punjab.

He also demanded translation of all proceedings and rules of the Vidhan Sabha in Punjabi. “Technical Education Department has taken a lead to provide syllabus of all technical education courses in Punjabi. I appeal Higher Education and Medical Education Minister to provide syllabus books in Punjabi,” he added.

The resolution also welcomed every step taken by the State Government to promote the mother tongue Punjabi, and applauded the government notification to give Punjabi the first place on signboards. “This should be made mandatory for all the private institutions also,” he said while expressing concern over the fact that children speaking in Punjabi are being punished in state schools and other languages are being given priority, which should be dealt strictly.

Supporting the resolution, SAD legislative wing leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon said that Punjabi should be implemented in all private and convent schools also, and not only in government schools.

Lok Insaaf Party MLA Simarjeet Singh Bains demanded that the question papers of exams held by the Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC), Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), should also be provided in Punjabi.

Demanding judicial work in all Punjab’s courts, including district and high court, in Punjabi also, he demanded that the resolution thus passed must be “strictly implemented”.

Asking the members to start from the House, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan urged all the members to start signing in Punjabi. “We will boycott the Governor Address next year if it was not delivered in Punjabi,” he said.

Sandhwan also sought to immediately fill 800 posts of Punjabi translators in the High Court, providing of adequate funds to the Languages Department and the Punjab Art Council, saying that the Punjabi should be kept atop in all government and non-government boards and departments.

AAP MLA and the Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema demanded that a tribunal may be set up so that those violating the law on the Punjabi language could be punished when found flouting.

Cheema proposed that instructions should be given to all district and also the High Court in the State to carry all work in Punjabi language. He also demanded a grant of Rs five crore to the cash-starved Central Library, Patiala, and filling of all vacant posts in the Languages Department.

AAP STAGES WALKOUT

Raising the issue of Cabinet Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu's alleged derogatory remarks against the Balmiki community, the AAP staged a walkout to register its protest.

During the zero hour, the Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema raised the issue over the viral video involving Ashu passing derogatory remarks against the community, demanding stern action against him.

Cheema, who also sought Speaker’s permission to play the audio, said that the incident had exposed the anti-Dalit face of the controversial Minister Ashu.

“Why the Chief Minisyter is repeatedly protecting the Minister, whose name was first surfaced in multi-crore Ludhiana CLU scam, brow-beating a DSP rank officer, the Gur Mandi bomb blast and now passing nasty comment against the Valmiki community, with no action in sight by the government in the saddle,” said Cheema.

At the same time, Cheema also called upon MLAs from all political parties to cut across party lines and support AAP move to initiate action against Ashu.

As Congress MLAs — Amarinder Singh Raja Warring and Khushaldeep Singh Dhillon — questioned Cheema, AAP MLAs entered into war of words.

AAP MLAs entered the well of the House, and staged a walkout after a brief protest.

Ashu clarified that all the allegations against him are “baseless”, and was misinterpreted.

WHY TRANSPORT POLICY NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED: CONG MLA

Highlighting the huge difference in the prices of Punbus Volvo and Indo Canadian buses, Congress MLA Kulbir Singh Zira asked why the transport policy has not been implemented so far.

“Punbus charges Rs 1200 for journey from Delhi to Rajpura, and Rs 280 upto Karnal, while the Indo Canadian bus charges Rs 2600 whether one has to travel up to Rajpura or Karnal,” said Zira asserting that this loot could have been stopped if the transport policy is implemented.

“The A-G (Advocate General) Atul Nanda should be asked why there is delay…is there any stay on the policy by any court…why the transport policy is put on the back burner,” he asked during the zero hour.

51,03-3-20,"Opp to corner Hry Govt on Budget, Govt stoutly defends proposals","Even as the Opposition on Monday criticized State budget 2020-21, saying there is nothing to address unemployment, farmers’ concerns and doubling of their income, ruling BJP asserted it is a pro-farmer and common man’s budget.

BJP MLA Aseem Goel said the budget is a mirror of the government’s policies and common man's interest has been taken care of in this budget. Emphasis is laid on health, education and agriculture and it is dedicated to common man. Emphasis is laid on education. 4,000 playway schools will be opened for children of 3 to 5 years. Government has allocated Rs 416.02 crore for employment department to generate employment for youth.

JJP MLA Ishwar Singh applauded the government for framing good budget, saying government has laid emphasis on education sector and increased its share. Several steps have been taken to upgrade the status of framers and other sectors of the people and Rs. 519.34 crore for Welfare of Schedule Castes and Backward Classes Department, he added.

Participating in the debate, senior Congress leader Raghuvir Singh Kadiyan BJP-JJP coalition government has been formed in the State but this budget has failed to follow the spirit of coalition dharma. ""Budget does not reflect government’s intention to implement the promises made by both the parties during the election,"" he said.

Kadiyan said both the parties had promised to give old people pension of Rs 5100 per month and unemployed allowances to youth of Rs 11,000 per month untill they get employment, but both of these election promises were completely silent in the budget.

""Budget should have dealt with issues of farmers’ distress, government’s plan to double the framers’ income and redressal of unemployment issues,"" he said, adding that it is completely silent on the issue of agrarian distress, industrial stagnation and joblessness that currently affect the people of the state.

The Senior Congress leader alleged that the chief minister has misled the people of the State by giving wrong figures regarding allocation of funds in agriculture and education sectors in the budget. On this issue, CM countered and said that fact and figures given in Budget paper is correct.

HEATED ARGUMENTS ON RSS

The arguments erupted when Congress leader Kadiyan made controversial statement on BJP-led State government, saying former US president Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) defined democracy as: Government of the people, by the people, for the people. But this government defines democracy as: Government of the RSS, by the RSS and for the RSS.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kanwar Pal Gujjar countered it, saying due to RSS, we follow the principal of ‘Haryana Ek Haryanvi Ek’ and ‘Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas’ (uniform development across the State). Backed by several MLAs of their respective parties, both the ruling and the opposition traded charges. BJP MLAs took a dig at Congress saying it believes in dividing the people. As the arguments seemed to reach a flashpoint, BJP MLAs said Congress party was responsible for dividing the country into two parts.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/opp-to-corner-hry-govt-on-budget--govt-stoutly-defends-proposals.html
52,03-3-20,Maternal deaths on the higher side in Punjab,"Every day, a mother is breathing her last after giving birth in Punjab, on an average. As many as 480 maternal deaths in 2018-19 and 370 in 2019-20 (up to December 2019) have been reported across Punjab.

Among the districts witnessing high maternal deaths are Ludhiana — 59 in 2018-19 and 65 in 2019-20, Amritsar — 62 in 2018-19 and 46 in 2019-20, Jalandhar — 39 in 2018-19 and 27 in 2019-20, Tarn Taran — 32 in 2018-19 and 18 in 2019-20, Ferozepur — 24 in 2018-19 and 21 in 2019-20, Muktsar — 24 in 2018-19 and 15 in 2019-20, among others.

Even as the State Government maintained that its performance in bringing down the maternal deaths is improving every year, the figures are somewhat disturbing. The state health and family welfare department, in close coordination with the Social Security and Child Development Department, are making all out efforts to being down the figures.

As per the latest data released by SRS (Sample Registration System), Punjab has recorded a remarkable cutback in Maternal Morality Rate (MMR) by 19 points from 141 per lakh live births to 122. In 2012, Punjab’s MMR was 172.

A senior government official told The Pioneer that to improve the infant mortality rate (IMR) and the maternal mortality ratio, “the Government is setting up new mother and child health (MCH) centres which has proved to be a boon for the mothers and the newborns”.

Finance Minister Manpreet Badal, while presenting the budget proposals on Friday, has announced six new MCH wings to be constructed at a cost of Rs 38 crore at Sub-Divisional Hospitals of Kharar, Phagwara, Jagraon, Budhladha, Malout and Giddarbaha.

Already, the State Government is establishing MCH centres at Moga, Tarn Taran, Fatehgarh Churian, Bham, Samana, Khanna, Sangrur, Malerkotla and Nakodar. Proposals to set up more MCH centres at Fatehgarh Sahib, Goniana, Khanna, among others, is also under consideration of the Health Department.

Other than that, the state government, during 2019-20, provided supplementary nutrition, immunization, health check-ups, referral services and pre-school education to as many as 8.4 lakh children along with pregnant women and lactating mothers under the ‘Integrated Child Development Scheme’.

For the same, an allocation of Rs 65 crore has been made in the budget this year for achieving improvement in nutritional status of children from newborns to six years, pregnant women and lactating mothers.

The official listed our various reasons like illiteracy, poverty, unawareness about nutritional requirement and diet as manor reasons for the maternal deaths.

“We have been able to improve the institutional deliveries from 59 percent in 2008-09 to 98.3 percent in 2018-19,” said the official.

“Over the years, we have developed modernized infrastructure. We are also providing skill-based trainings with technical support so that the competency of health staff can be improved, and the intra-partum and immediate post-partum care services could also be improved,” added the official.

In addition to that, the State Government is also running a special campaign to motivate the families to conduct deliveries of pregnantwomen at the government hospitals instead of home.

“Public hospitals are well equipped with the advanced infrastructure, equipments, specialists, skilled Medical Officers and staff to save the precious lives of women and infants,” said the official.

As per Health Management Information System (HMIS) data (April-August 2019), Punjab has recorded the 98.3 percent institutional deliveries across the State which is the key factor of overall improvement of the IMR and MMR in Punjab.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/maternal-deaths-on-the-higher-side-in-punjab.html

57,03-3-20,J'suguda NGO for women empowerment unveiled,"A voluntary organisation ""Women's Voice"" was flagged off here on Sunday. On the occasion, a toll-free number 1800123500029 was also launched.

Founder of the organisation, Deepali Das, daughter of State's Health and Family Welfare Minister Naba Kishore Das, said that the organisation would focus on helping women counter torture and harassment, particularly those who didn't have access to legal and financial support.

While addressing the meeting, Das said there was still a large number of women who had no access to education and were more vulnerable to abuse, exploitation and poverty. That education empowers women is an indisputable fact; so Government and policy makers need to make education for women an important issue while women should consciously develop their skills and assist themselves in the men-dominated society, she added.

She further said that generally women in rural sectors do not express their problems freely. However, if they convey their difficulties through the toll free number , the organisation will come forward to solve the issues within 24 hours.

60,03-3-20,Cong a divided house before Budget Session,"The show of unity shown by different factions of Congress party in the ‘Laltain Yatra’ held at Haldwani recently appeard to fizzle down at Bharadisain on Monday when only six MLAs including the leader of opposition Indira Hridayesh attended the meeting of Congress parliamentary board.

The Dharchula MLA, Harish Dhami exposed divisions in the party when he claimed that he was not invited in the meeting. He said that he was earlier informed that the meeting of the Congress parliamentary board would be organised at 2 PM and he had arrived in his room at MLA hostel at around 11.30 am.

Dhami said that the meeting was later postponed to 4 pm but he was not informed about the meeting. In the meeting of the parliamentary board, strategy of the party during the session is discussed and absence of as many as five MLAs clearly showed that all is not well in the grand old party.

Apart from Indira Hridayesh, the meeting was attended by Govind Singh Kunjwal, deputy leader of the Congress legislative party Karan Mahra, Qazi Nizzamuddin, Adesh Singh Chauhan and Rajkumar.

It is pertinent to mention here that on February 26, the state unit of Congress party had organised a massive public meeting at start of Laltain Yatra.

In this rally a good chemistry between chief minister Harish Rawat, Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief Pritam Singh and LoP Indira Hridayesh was observed which had enthused the party cadre of Congress party.

But it appears that old divisions in the party have again come to fore just ahead of the crucial budget session of the assembly. It is a well known fact that the Congress in Uttarakhand is a divided house.

The party leaders are divided into the factions led by former CM Harish Rawat and combined camp of PCC chief Pritam Singh and LoP Indira Hridayesh.

62,03-3-20,General-OBC employees plan to gherao MLAs in Gairsain,"The members of Uttarakhand General-OBC Employees Association commenced an indefinite strike from Monday against the demand for reservations in promotion by SC-ST employees.

According to the members of the association, the indecisiveness of the State Government in the matter is the reason for their strike. Meanwhile, the State government issued a no work, no pay order but this has not had the intended effect on the general and OBC workers carrying out work boycott.

While addressing the crowd, the state head of association Deepak Joshi said that in spite of the judgement of Supreme Court that seniority and merit should be the criteria for promotion, the State Government is not implementing the order because of the politics of the vote banks. According to the members of the association, the Government is trying to challenge the Supreme Court order or manipulate it so that they do not displease their vote banks.

Recently, the regional head of the Uttarakhand SC/ST Employees Federation Karam Ram accused Joshi of making an insulting statement when he said that the government should appoint a nodal officer for the budget session of Vidhan Sabha from SC/ST employees.

Talking about this to The Pioneer, Joshi said, “There is nothing wrong in what I said.

They were claiming that they will work double throughout the budget session so I just stated that the Government should also appoint the nodal officer from SC-ST employees too. Besides, if the government will keep suspending the decision, the bitterness among the employees will keep on increasing with time.”

Joshi also stated that the teams of their association from Almora, Pauri, Bageshwar, Rudraprayag and Chamoli have arrived and their regional team will also arrive in Gairsain to gherao the MLAs.

According to one of the general-OBC employees Prajikata Negi, “Giving reservation to the needy is understood but proposing reservations for promotion is very wrong.

An employee seeks promotion because he/she works very hard for their respective organisations. Reservation in promotion will devastate the culture of hard work and improvement in merit.

We’ll not back out until the State Government rejects the demand for reservation in promotion.”

To show their anger and disappointment towards the government, the members of the association also burned the copies of the government’s order of no work, no pay issued considering the work boycott by the general-OBC employees.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/general-obc-employees-plan-to-gherao-mlas-in-gairsain.html
63,03-3-20,"Promotions on merits, not reservation, opine citizens","Amidst the ongoing battle for and against reservations in promotions between the employees of general-OBC and SC-ST in Uttarakhand, locals in Dehradun expressed their views on this issue. According to the majority of people, promotions in jobs should be on the basis of merits and not reservation.

“Demanding reservation in promotion after getting a job through reservation is like demanding for 90 per cent marks in exams just because somebody got admission under SC/ST quota. I don’t know why some people are making it a complicated issue. It is a simple thing that if you do well in exams, you get good grades. Similarly, if you perform well in your job, you will get the promotion. Some people are just trying to take advantage of the reservation system in India,” said a businessman, Arun Prajapati.

According to a school teacher Brahmanand Lal Sharma, “I myself belong to a scheduled caste community and I understand that there are still narrow-minded people who discriminate on the basis of caste and religion. However, providing reservations in promotions besides jobs would be crippling to the society. A promotion is the indication of growth, hard work and dedication of an employee, if the reserved candidate will be promoted, no one would respect the position as well as the candidate. In the long term, it is the worst thing any government can do to its citizens as it will create disparity among the employees in the same field.”

“Initially the idea behind the reservation for some communities in India was to uplift the people belonging to SC, ST and OBCs socially and economically. But now more than 50 per cent people are just misusing it. There are people who undoubtedly need reservations in different sectors but that should be as per their financial status. What is the need for the reservation in promotions to those employees who are probably living a better life than a person living in poverty who belongs to the general category? It is just a selfish move by a few people,” said a PhD student from Chakrata, Mohit Chauhan.

According to an undergraduate student Anshu Saini, “The demand for reservation in promotions is absolutely wrong. According to me, only one generation of SC-ST people should be given the advantage of reservation so that others in need can benefit from it too. When the person is well to do and capable of living and providing a quality life, the reservation should not be extended further by the government. My father was a poor man belonging to the community of scheduled tribe. He could study and got a job because of reservation system. Now my siblings and I do not need it to make our lives better. People should think about others in need rather than exploiting the help provided by the government.”

However, according to some people there should be reservation in the promotions. “The so-called upper caste people have oppressed us for so long that the discrimination is still prevalent in the society. In my village, we are still not allowed to eat together with the upper caste people. How can we trust that SC-ST people will be given fair chance in promotions? Reservation is supposed to give us a sense of security that at least people of our caste or community will be promoted too,” said Rajkumar Ram.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/promotions-on-merits--not-reservation--opine-citizens.html

Income tax recessions, better medical facilities, improvement in the education sector are what Ranchiites are looking for.

“In the education sector, changes need to be made regarding higher education. There is a lack of teachers and qualified lecturers should be appointed on a permanent basis instead of contractual basis and this should also be a continuous process.

Over the years standard of general education has deteriorated drastically. The budget for the education sector should also be increased so that quality education can be imparted. For rural development animal husbandry should also be promoted,” said Dr Ashok Kumar Shrivastava, Retired Dean of Ranchi Veterinary College.

For senior Citizen RP Shahi, better medical facilities and tax recessions would be a welcome move. “As a retired senior citizen, I feel medical care should be exempted from taxes.

If the Government can give free medical care to everyone it will be appreciated by all but it should certainly be tax free for seniors.

This is primarily because, after retirement there is no extra income and more medical support is required. The amount required for medical care should be deducted from the tax which is already being paid,” said Shahi.

“Schemes like ‘One time settlement’ which have been implemented by the neighbouring States can be done here as well.

In this the State government can get good revenue and pending cases will also be resolved. The MSME’s which give employment and revenue to the government should be promoted.

The budget on eco tourism should also be increased and Jharkhand with its untapped natural beauty should be made into a major tourism hub of the country.

Suggestions for making all government offices on the out skirts of the City have also been made,” said Kunal Ajmani, President Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI).

“The market has people belonging to various stratas of the society- the creamy layer, the down to earth and the ones in between.

The ones belonging to the middle class and the lower middle class need to struggle a lot in order to fulfill their daily financial requirements and basic needs.

The government needs to make such an agenda that people get some relief from the education sector, so that the guardians send their children to good institutes for higher education which sometimes they cannot afford.

These agendas not just need to be made but should also be implemented,” said Ramesh Kumar, a city based financial portfolio planner.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/city-residents-keep-high-expectations-from-state-budget.html

The survey report prepared by the Centre for Fiscal Studies, Planning cum Finance department, Government of Jharkhand further stated that the economy of Jharkhand grew by 12.5 per cent in the financial year 2014-15, but the growth rate took a nosedive and fell by – 6.2 per cent in the year 2015-16.

The per capita income (per capita NSDP) is estimated to be Rs. 83592 at current prices and Rs. 60,339 at constant prices in the year 2019-20.

However, the per capita income of Jharkhand is one of the lowest in the country. Out of the 28 states of the country it ranks 25th. The per capita income of only Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Manipur is less than that of Jharkhand, says the survey.

The tertiary sector has been the major contributor in the growth of Jharkhand’s economy. It has contributed 65 per cent to the growth of the State’s economy in the year 2019-20. The primary and secondary sectors have made a contribution of approximately 15 and 20 per cent, respectively.

In the current financial year it is estimated to contribute about 33 per cent to the revenue receipts of the State.

The report further states that the dependence of the State on the Centre for revenue has increased over the years because of the increase in the State’s share in Central taxes in the period of 14th Finance Commission.

According to the survey the excess expenditure of the State over its total receipts has been financed by the fiscal deficit that had mostly remained within the limits set by the FRBM.

But, it exceeded the FRBM limits in 2016-17 and 2017-18 when it became 4.31 and 4.32 per cent of GSDP respectively.

“If the verdict in cases like this is not delayed, there will certainly be a decline in the number of such heinous crimes. A delay in the verdict discourages and disheartens not only the victim but the family members also and enables the culprits to go scot free a lot of times. The administration should ensure that such crimes do not occur in the future.

“Women empowerment is a major agenda right now. The judiciary has granted justice on time and the saying ‘Justice denied’ has been removed. Young boys should be given family orientation on how to behave with women in general. The verdict has come in three months time only after analyzing all the evidences. It is important to analyze the circumstances under which such crimes take place,” said Dr Vasavi Kiro, former member of Jharkhand Women’s Commission.

“This must be the first in such a case where the verdict has come in record three months showing that the administration is keen to grant justice. There are numerous other cases which also need to be deal with at the earliest. If the case is stretched for too long, a lot of times, the crime is not proven and the culprits are let go off.

On Monday, Chandrashekhar Azad met Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar at the VVIP Guest House where he has put up.

The two leaders decided to contest the 2022 UP assembly poll as part of a larger alliance called Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha.

“We have a common enemy in the Bharatiya Janata Party and we both will unite Dalits, Other Backward Classes and minorities under the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha in the 2022 assembly polls,” Rajbhar told reporters after the meeting. Charging that the BJP did not want peace to prevail in the country, the SBSP chief further said, “All Dalits, OBCs and minorities will come together under this Morcha and we will work towards defeating the BJP.”

A former ally of the ruling party, the SBSP snapped ties with the BJP when Rajbhar was dismissed from the Yogi Adityanath government after the Lok Sabha elections in May last year.

“The BJP wants people to fight with each other for its vested vote politics. We are ready to fight for the cause of the oppressed besides raising the atrocities on Bhim Army members in the assembly,” he stated.

The Bhim Army chief has already announced to float a new political outfit on March 15 next.

Meanwhile, Chandrasekhar Azad visited Ravidas temple in Lucknow under tight security where he offered prayers to the Dalit saint and then met Dalit students living in a dilapidated hostel nearby.

132,03-3-20,Diggy slams BJP,"Senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh here on Monday made a sensational attack on the BJP state unit accusing the Opposition party of trying to bring down the Congress Government in Madhya Pradesh by offering Rs 25-35 cr to party MLAs.

Singh categorically named former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and former minister Narottam Mishra.

“Shivraj is dreaming to become Chief Minister and Narottam Mishra is planning to become Dy CM,” alleged Singh talking to the media in Indore.

“Those who looted the state for 15 years are now alluring Congress MLAs with Rs 25 to 35 cr.

The first instalments would be Rs five cr, second instalment would be paid after Rajya Sabha nominations and third one would be finally paid after the state government is brought down,” claimed the senior leader.

He, however putting up a brave face claimed that this (MP) wasn’t Karnataka and no Congress MLA was available for sale. “I never level any allegations without proof.” The remarks came close on the heels of BJP starting its preparations for Rajya Sabha nominations as the assembly session gets underway from March 16.

Leader of Opposition Gopal Bhargav replied saying the Congress party is facing sharp divisions and such statements are only a vindication of their internal tussle. “None is in my touch, and those who wish to act on their conscience are most welcome,” said Bhargav on being asked if anyone (Cong MLA) was in his touch.

If he (Singh) has proofs, let him furnish it publically, Bhargav dared the Congress leader.

BJP state head VD Sharma has started preparations for chalking out the strategy for Rajya Sabha nomination in Bhopal by summoning all the leaders to party office.

133,03-3-20,‘Nath lacks focus as nothing has been done for farmers suffering from abrupt weather changes’,"If former CM Digvijay Singh is claiming horse trading on BJP, he should provide evidence, allegations of illegal money transactions on members of Legislative Assembly is highly disgracing for democracy and Madhya Pradesh never had tradition of horse trading and would never see in future, said Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly Gopal Bhargava

He said that Digvijay should reveal names of all members of legislative assembly who have been offered money from BJP and condemned the allegations raised by Digvijay.

There are several factions in Congress due to which internal tussle is at the highest level and burdened with tribe mentality. Congress fears that any of the factions would deflect and join BJP.

Digvijay should prove base of the allegations as every BJP MLA is strong and dedicated but the same do not applies to Congress due to which they lack belief in their members at the State Assembly.

The purpose is to pressurize high rung leader for Rajya Sabha and due to which he is creating sensation, said Bhargava.

CM Kamal Nath lacks focus as nothing has been done for farmers suffering from abrupt weather changes. The farmers who were waiting for loan waiver have faced untimely rainfall resulting in crop damages.

Several meetings have been organised for events like IIFA but for government has no plans for relief package and on the other side relief of Rs 1000 crore for excessive rainfall hit regions was not disbursed.

134,03-3-20,Cong sulks as DMK denies party RS seat,"nWith the DMK refusing to part with even a single seat to the Congress in the upcoming Rajya Sabha election from Tamil Nadu, the grand old party of India is sulking silently and has to continue as second fiddle to the Dravidian major.

The sight of the DMK drubbing the Congress, which commenced in the 1967 Assembly elections, is continuing unabated and this has resulted in the latter becoming more vulnerable and weak, according to senior Congress leaders in the State.

Even in 1967 when the Congress was defeated by the DMK for the first time, the former had polled 41 per cent of the popular votes while the Dravidian party could poll only 40.7 per cent. From that respectable vote share, the strength of Congress has come down to just 6.47 per cent (in the 2016 Assembly election).

Govindarajan Satymurthy, veteran scribe who has tracked the Congress in Tamil Nadu for more than four decades, said that the DMK made hay while the Congress became weaker and weaker over the years. “In the 2006 Assembly election, the DMK under M Karunanidhi managed to win just 96 seats in a House with an effective strength of 234 members. Though the Congress won 34 seats as an ally of the DMK, Karunanidhi refused point blank to share power with the former. Karunanidhi became chief minister and ruled the State for five full years without yielding to the demands made by the State leaders of the Congress for a share of power,” said Satyamurthy.

He pointed out that the situation was different at the Centre. “The Congress formed Governments in 2004 and 2009 at the Centre and had to accommodate the DMK by offering them some of the plum ministries. The situation was entirely different in Delhi,” he said.

When asked whether he would give place to the Congress in Tamil Nadu Government, Karunanidhi replied with a wink: “I have given them a major place in my heart”. The Congress High Command was happy with Karunanidhi allocating them a place ion his heart and failed to bargain effectively with the DMK leadership. Though Jayalalithaa used to describe the Karunanidhi-led Government as “the minority DMK Government” at each and every juncture, the Congress leaders failed to take the cue and pressurize the DMK for its pound of flesh.

There is massive resentment in the Congress over the “double-standard” of the DMK. “We do not hope that Stalin, the DMK chief would accommodate us in the State Government after the 2021 election. For that to materialize, the High Command should bargain effectively with the DMK leadership. The situation is ripe because the DMK is not in the best of health. If we fail to bargain tough with the DMK, chances are that many senior leaders may walk over to the outfit to be launched by Rajinikanth,” said a senior Congress leader who did not want his name to be quoted.

Satyamurthy also pointed out that the DMK was magnanimous enough to nominate Vaiko of the MDMK to the Rajya Sabha despite the latter drawing a blank in the 2016 assembly election, the Congress which had polled 6.5 per cent votes was ignored. The party had to get P Chidambaram elected as Rajya Sabha member from Maharashtra,” said Satyamurthy.

If the Congress fails to negotiate tough with the DMK prior to the 2021 Tamil Nadu assembly election, the former is likely to end up as a non-entity in the State despite the party boasting of some of the top leaders from South India.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cong-sulks-as-dmk-denies-party-rs-seat.html
135,03-3-20,Mamata calls Delhi riot ‘planned genocide’,"Mamata Banerjee on Monday launched a scathing counter attack on the BJP Government after Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday slammed the Chief Minister for running a Government of extortionists and rioters in Bengal.

Launching a blistering attack on the Centre, Banerjee said that the BJP was trying to repeat the “Gujarat model” (refer to Ahmedabad riots) throughout India even as she referred to the Delhi riots. “I am deeply anguished at what happened in Delhi where so many people were killed. What happened there was a planned genocide,” Banerjee said adding how the BJP was trying to implement the Gujarat model in Bengal which she would not allow them to do.

Her speech came a day after Shah vowed to conquer Bengal in the next year’s Assembly elections. She was addressing a ‘strategy meeting’ of party workers in Kolkata where the TMC launched special 75-day campaign called “Banglar Garbo Mamata (Bengal’s pride Mamata) conceived by pollster Prashant Kishore.

“Delhi is just as big as a municipality if compared to bigger states like Bengal. And they cannot control law and order there. And shamelessly they have come to conquer Bengal instead of apologizing for allowing so many deaths to happen in Delhi. Even today some bodies were found in the drains in North-east Delhi,” she said reminding how Delhi Police which reported to the Centre and not the Delhi Government was responsible for all that happened.

Shah had on Sunday had linked Delhi riots to Bengal violence post enactment of CAA in December 2019 when several trains and railway stations were torched.

Apparently referring to his speech Banerjee on Monday said Bengal was an absolutely peaceful state and the people here enjoyed communal harmony unlike the states ruled by the BJP adding the people of Bengal would never vote for a communal outfit.

Banerjee also attacked the Bengal BJP leadership for trying to fan communal hatred in the State and bringing the “goli maro” (shoot the traitors) slogan from Delhi to Kolkata and said strong actions would be taken against those who raised such slogans from Shah’s rally on Sunday.

“Remember this is Bengal and not Delhi. We will not allow you to create a communal problem here. The people of Bengal will resist you with all their might and the Government will not spare those who raise such slogans to create disturbance,” Banerjee said. “The Goli Maaro slogans are illegal, scary and provocative and aimed at creating communal hatred. We will take strong action against those who did it. No one will be spared,” she said wondering who the real “gaddars’ (traitors) were.

“It is not the BJP but the people to decide who the real gaddar or traitors are,” she said.

In fact the police had arrested three persons for raising the “goli maro” slogan from Shah’s rally on Sunday. “In Delhi, BJP leaders who gave provocative slogans have not been arrested, but I got three of the BJP workers arrested,” she said.

The three BJP workers identified as Surendra Tiwari, Dhruba Basu and Pankaj Prasad were arrested and produced at a local court. While the court granted Surendra Tiwari and Pankaj Prasad two days of police custody as demanded by the police the third BJP worker – Dhruba Basu was granted bail on grounds of his old age.

However referring to the arrests Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh on Monday said the Chief Minister had no courage to arrest the people who had committed the violence in December. The Bengal BJP had earlier disowned the Sunday’s sloganeers saying they were in fact planted by the CPI(M) and the Congress.

Meanwhile, the Left and the Congress questioned Banerjee’s sincerity in combating BJP’s communal politics even as CPI(M) politburo member on Monday wondered “how she changes her colours at the drop of hat.

Two days ago she was sharing dinner with Amit Shah at Bhubaneshwar despite the Delhi riots and two days later she is changing her voice here.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mamata-calls-delhi-riot-----planned-genocide---.html

139,03-3-20,Prashant flays Nitish for not saying single word on Delhi violence in speech,"Election strategist and former JD(U) national vice-president Prashant Kishor on Monday slammed Nitish Kumar, saying it was “bad” on the Bihar Chief Minister’s part to not mention the Delhi violence in his over an hour address to party workers.

Kishor, who was expelled from the Kumar-led Janata Dal (United) in January, was referring to the Chief Minister’s speech on Sunday at a party ‘karyakarta sammelan’ here.

“It was bad on his (Nitish Kumar) part not to say a word on the Delhi violence,” Kishor tweeted.

The last week communal riots in northeast Delhi left at least 42 people dead and over 200 injured.

Latching on to claims by opposition parties in Bihar that the sammelan saw a less than impressive turnout, Kishor took a swipe at Kumar, saying the event saw “bhaari bheed” (huge crowd).

At a press conference held a couple of days ahead of the event, Bihar JD(U) president Vashishtha Narayan Singh had predicted a turnout of about two lakh people.

“While addressing a ‘bhaari bheed’ of JD(U) workers Nitish Kumar claimed that the NDA will win more than 200 seats (in the assembly polls) but did not explain why despite 15

years of his ‘sushasan’ (good governance) Bihar continues to be the most poor and backward state in the country”, Kishor said in a tweet in Hindi.

Kumar had on Sunday exhorted JD(U)workers to strive towards ensuring the NDA’s win in “more than 200 seats” when elections to the 243-member Bihar Assembly are held this year.

Claiming that there was a poor turnout at the event, Kumar’s rivals have asserted that it reflected the waning popularity of the ruling JD(U) in the state.

RJD leader Rabri Devi, who is a former chief minister of Bihar, told reporters outside the state assembly premises that “it was a test for Nitish Kumar and his party”.

“They failed miserably and will end up finishing third in terms of seat tally when the assembly polls are held,” she said.

On Sunday, Rabri Devi’s son Tejashwi Yadav, who the RJD’s chief ministerial candidate in this year’s Bihar polls, had termed the ‘karyakarta sammelan’ a “maha nukkad sabha” (a big street corner gathering).

However, JD(U) leader and state minister Ashok Choudhary said that “it was not a public rally but a meeting of workers”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/prashant-flays-nitish-for-not-saying-single-word-on-delhi-violence-in-speech.html
140,03-3-20,Probe ‘illegal appointments’ made in J&K Bank during BJP-PDP regime: JKNPP,"The Jammu & Kashmir National Panthers Party (JKNPP) on Monday demanded a probe into the alleged 3,000 illegal appointments made in the J&K Bank during the PDP-BJP regime in the Union Territory.

The party also questioned the rationale behind cancellation of the selection process for J&K Bank POs and banking associates conducted and duly completed by the Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS).

JKNPP chairman Harsh Dev Singh claimed that 145,000 applicants were anxiously awaiting for the results after having appeared in the preliminary and main exams conducted by the IBPS in 2018.

Singh said rather than quashing the selection process of banking personnel held by a reputed central agency, the focus of UT administration needed to be over the “illegal backdoor appointments made by corrupt political regime”.

142,03-3-20,Man detained for ‘raising’ pro-Pak slogan in K’taka,"A 43-year-old man was on Monday detained after he allegedly raised pro-Pakistan slogans in front of the mini Vidhan Saudha at Kundapur in neighbouring Udupi district in Karnataka, police said.

The man, said to be mentally unstable, came in front of the mini Vidhan Soudha (a complex housing Government offices) at around 10 am and shouted Pakistan Zindabad several times.

Then he moved on to the corridor and continued shouting the slogan, police said.

A video of the incident recorded by locals became viral within minutes.

On being alerted by locals, police personnel reached the spot and took the man into custody.

Kundapur tahsildar also gave a written complaint to the police.

According to police, the man was said to be mentally unstable and currently under treatment. He was working as teacher and had lost his job eight years ago on account of the ‘illness’.

His health condition will be assessed at a hospital. After the report from doctors, further investigation will be held, Udupi Assistant Superintendent of Police Hariram Shankar said.

Family sources said the man, who regulary watches television, may have been influenced by the news items telecast on such slogans raised by some persons elsewhere.

Three students from Kashmir studying at a private engineering college in Hubballi were arrested on sedition charges last month for allegedly raising pro-Pakistan slogans and posting a video of it on a messaging platform on the first anniversary of the Pulwama terrorist attack.

On February 20, a young woman, later identified as Amulya Leona, had raised “Pakistan Zindabad” slogan thrice at an event in Bengaluru against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

144,03-3-20,"Kerala CM rejects CBI probe over missing cartridges, rifles","The CAG report on missing rifles and live cartridges rocked the Kerala Assembly on Monday as Opposition Congress-led UDF insisted on a CBI probe which was rejected by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

The Assembly was adjourned for the day in the pre-lunch session by Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan as the United Democratic Front members stormed the Well holding banners and raising slogans after their notice for an adjournment motion on the issue was rejected.

It was first raised during the Question Hour and again by way of the adjournment motion notice, but Vijayan asserted no rifle was missing from the Special Armed Police Battalion here as found by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) and the cartridges were lost mainly during the previous UDF rule.

The Chief Minister said the Left government was viewing the matter ‘seriously, adding one police official was arrested and a departmental inquiry pending against 11 others in connection with over 12,000 cartridges going missing.

“There is no relevance for a CBI probe right now. An effective and comprehensive investigation by our own agency, crime branch, is progressing...Let its report come first,” he said.

Replying to the notice for adjournment motion later, he said: “we don’t have anything to hide. We just followed the procedures.”

As the Opposition targeted state police chief Loknath Behara, who came in for rap from the CAG for purchasing luxury vehicles and constructing villas diverting funds and violating norms, Vijayan said it was not fair to “tarnish the image of a person who is not in the House”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/kerala-cm-rejects-cbi-probe-over-missing-cartridges--rifles.html

NGO, People’s Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL), Jammu & Kashmir High Court Bar Association and an intervenor had sought referring of the matter to a larger bench on the ground that two judgements of the apex court - Prem Nath Kaul versus Jammu & Kashmir in 1959 and Sampat Prakash versus Jammu and Kashmir in 1970 - which dealt with the issue of Article 370 were conflicted each other and therefore, the current bench of five judges could not hear the issue.

154,03-3-20,Govt allows export of onions,"The Modi Government has decided to allow the export of onions from March 15 as the onion wholesale prices at the country’s largest market at Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) crashed to Rs 1200 per quintal, down fromRs 1900-2100 per quintal, due to increase in supply of the bulb.

After a bumper crop, onion prices have stabilised. Presently, onion is being sold at Rs 25-30 a kg depending on the quality and locality of the areas.

According to Ministry of Agriculture, onion prices increased by Rs 300 per quintal on an average at Lasalgaon APMC after reports came in, on February 27, that a ban on its exports had been lifted by the Centre. However, a notification on the lifting of the export ban is yet to arrive, leading to fall in prices, which resulted in protests and agitations by farmers. Onions were auctioned at Rs 700 minimum, Rs 1,200 maximum per quintal at Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Lasalgaon,” officials said. On Monday, onion’s minimum price was recorded Rs 400 per quintal while the maximum rate was of Rs 1200 per quintal.

The fall in prices led to angry members of Maharashtra Onion Growers’ Association and APMC farmers stopping auctions.

Officials said that farmers have held protests in Lasalgaon, Dewla, Pimpalgaon, Yeola and Andersul district in Maharashtra on Monday. Currently, the arrival of rabi (winter) crop of onion has begun in small quantities and would increase from mid-March onwards.

In a tweet, Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said that the Government will allow export of onions from March 15 in the interest of farmers. The decision will help boost the income of farmers, the Minister said in a tweet.

The Government last week decided to lift nearly six-month-old ban on export of onions as prices are likely to fall sharply due to bumper rabi crop. The ban was imposed after the prices of the commodity skyrocketed.

Expected monthly harvest in March is over 40 lakh MT compared to 28.4 lakh MT last year, Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan had tweeted on Wednesday.

In September 2019, the Government banned onion exports and also imposed a MEP of USD 850 per tonne. The move came after prices started skyrocketing due to supply-demand mismatch. There was shortage of onion as kharif crop was adversely affected due to excess rains and floods in key producing states, including Maharashtra.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/govt-allows-export-of-onions.html

156,03-3-20,Won’t allow BJP to disturb Maha peace: Sena,"A bitter war of words has broken out between the Opposition BJP and the ruling Shiv Sena over the former’s demand for renaming Aurangabad as Samabhajinagar, with the Sena slamming its erstwhile saffron ally for making it an issue and it that it would not allow the latter to disturb peace in the State.

Three days after State BJP president Chandrakantdada Patil demanded that Aurangabad be renamed as “Sambhajinagar”, the Shiv Sena in its official mouth-piece “Saamana” on Monday hit out at Patil whom it dubbed as “Dadamiya” for his demand and stated: “People have begun to think if the Opposition (BJP) has been reduced to kicking its own leg in the air and making irresponsible statements. We need peace in Maharashtra. The BJP should realise that as much as it may whip up the Aurangabad renaming issue, but it would not able to disturb peace in the State” .

“The BJP has been invoking the name of Shivaji for the past five years. It has become so arrogant that it has published a book that Prime Minister Modi is himself Shivaji Maharaj... It is now demanding that Aurangabad should be renamed as Sambhajinagar. Who prevented (former chief minister Devendra) from renaming Aurangabad after Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj?,” the “Saamana” editorial asked.

“From when BJP’s Dadamiya (Patil) has become a historian? If he really likes to be historian, he should have known Hinduhriday Samrat” Balasaheb Thackeray had renamed Aurangabad as Sambhajinagar 25 years ago. He had said: from now on Aurangabad would be known as Sambhajinagar. From thereon every Hindu with self-pride used to call Aurangabad as Sambhajingar,” the editorial said.

Coming down heavily on Patil for his statement that “We are descendants of Maratha warriors Chhatrapati Shivaji Mahataj and Sambhaji Maharaj and not of Aurangazeb, Hence, Aurangabad should be named after Sambhaji Maharaj”, the Sena’s official mouth-piece said: “There is no need for Dadamiya to make a claim that We are descendants of Maratha warriors Chhatrapati Shivaji Mahataj and Sambhaji Maharaj. He should know that no one in Maharashtra is a descendent of Aurangazeb. Maharashtra has buried Aurangazeb for good. We are all proud of this fact”.

Taking at pot shot at the BJP for invoking Hindutva and nationalism, the Saamana editorial said: “Can’t people understand as to why there is sudden surge of love for Hindutva and nationalism in the BJP?. Sometimes, it ( the BJP) talks about Veersavarkar, while on some other occasions, it talks about Sambhajingar. Neither has it even laid a brick for the grand memorial for Chhatrapati Shivaji ( in mid-sea off south Mumbai) nor has it given Bharat Ratna posthumously to Veer Savarkar. If Ram Mandir is being built at Ayodhya, it is courtesy Supreme Court. Only thing is that it is lying emphasis on renaming of Aurangabad as Sambhajinagar”.

“Hindu self-pride is inter-linked with nationalism. In Maharashtra, nationalism will never die. Anyone who tries to kill nationalism will take a beating from the Hindus. This is because we are all descendents of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Sambhaji Maharaj and Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray. Like Moghuls, the BJP’s horse is not ready to drink water in a normal way,” the Sena mouth-piece said, while criticising Patil for his irresponsible statement.

It may be recalled that the State BJP president had on Saturday last latched on to the Sena’s oft-raised issue and rooted for renaming of Aurangabad as Sambhajinar.

Talking to media persons at Aurangabad after holding a meeting with his party’s district office bearers on preparations for the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) polls scheduled to be held in March-April, State BJP president Patil had said: “We are descendants of Maratha warriors Chhatrapati Shivaji Mahataj and Sambhaji Maharaj and not of Aurangazeb.

158,03-3-20,BSY: Questioning legitimacy of my Govt amounts to ridiculing public mandate,"Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa on Monday flayed Opposition parties for questioning the legitimacy of his Government and said such criticism is like “ridiculing” the public mandate.

He also claimed that his Government has in the last seven months boldly faced several challenges and made strong efforts to bring in transparency in administration.

Yediyurappa was replying to the motion of thanks to the Governor for his address to the joint sitting of the state legislature, in the legislative assembly.

The Chief Minister’s reply was marred by protests and sloganeering by opposition parties from the well of the House, demanding that they be permitted to raise the issue of BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal’s “derogatory” comments against centenarian freedom fighter HS Doreswamy.

Even as the Chief Minister read out his reply, the Congress and JD(S) legislators shouted slogans like “jai to freedom fighters”, “save democracy and constitution”, “down down British agents” from the well of the House. Stating that he did not like to talk politics while speaking on the Governor’s address, but will have to reply to opposition’s criticism against his government, Yediyurappa said “in democracy numbers matter, and in this number game our party has won.”

Pointing out that by winning 12 of 15 seats in December bypolls “we have proved that public mandate is in favour of our party”, he said it was our “moral victory.”

“You should be aware that the people of the state are completely with us. In Lok Sabha polls your party had won one seat, we had won 25+1 (one BJP supported independent),” he said, adding that criticism against Government’s legitimacy is like “ridiculing” the public mandate.

He cautioned that if the opposition continues to indulge in such criticism, people will start taking them lightly. “Because of my concern towards you, I’m giving you this advice,” he said.

Calling the BJP Government in Karnataka as “child born illicitly from Operation Kamala”, Leader of Opposition in the assembly Siddaramaiah had said the government in the state did not come to power with the people’s mandate, but by engineering the defection of 17 Congress-JD(S) legislators.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bsy--questioning-legitimacy-of-my-govt-amounts-to-ridiculing-public-mandate.html

160,03-3-20,95 MPs didn’t attend Parl panels’ meetings: Naidu,"Nearly 40 per cent Members of Parliament (MPs), who as members of Parliamentary Standing Committees were tasked to review allocations for different Ministries in the 2020-21 Budget, gave it a miss, prompting Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on Monday to term it as “really unfortunate” and urge them to honour the mandate given to them.

Naidu said as many as 95 of the MPs did not attend even a single meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committees and that he released the figures to ensure accountability and transparency for better functioning of Parliament.

Giving an account of the meetings on the first day of the Rajya Sabha when it assembled after a three-week recess during the ongoing budget session, he appealed to the various political parties to ensure better attendance of their members.

The two dozen department-related parliamentary standing committees, with 244 MPs from both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, considered demands for grants of all the Ministries during the recess.

Naidu said 95 members, accounting for 39 per cent of the total 244, did not attend any meeting on the Demands for Grants. Only 28 members had zero attendance last time, he added.

Of the 78 Rajya Sabha MPs on these committees, 23, or 29 per cent, did not attend any meeting as against 11 such members in the last review in December last year. Out of 166 Lok Sabha MPs, 78, or 47 per cent, were absent in all meetings of these panels against 72 MPs in the last review, he said.

Highlighting the importance of the parliamentary panels, the Chairman said since the introduction of department-related parliamentary

standing committees in 1993, substantial work of Parliament is being transacted by these panels which have members from all parties and work in a nonpartisan manner.

The meetings of these panels make up for the about 30 sittings of Parliament and fill the void created by the decline in the number of days when the Parliament meets -- on 60-70 days in a year from earlier 100 or more, he said, adding that the three-week recess was meant for 24 department-related parliamentary standing committees to consider Demands for Grants of all the Ministries as proposed in the Budget presented on Feb 1.

“The total number of members who skipped two or more successive meetings has increased from 100 last year to 106 now. These include 28 members from Rajya Sabha as in the case of last review and 78 members from Lok Sabha, with an increase of six from the last time,” he said.

Naidu said out of the 24 department-related parliamentary standing committees, 8 relating to Rajya Sabha saw 45.35 per cent attendance in the 20 meetings held in the budget recess.

Presenting the break-up of attendance, Naidu said four of the eight committees reported attendance of more than 50 per cent, which is a positive sign. The highest attendance of 65.51 per cent has been in the meetings of the Committee on Health and Family Welfare. Lowest attendance of 32.25 per cent has been in respect of the Committee on Commerce, he said.

He also noted the attendance of the Rajya Sabha MPs at 52.57 per cent continues to be higher than that of Lok Sabha at 46.37 per cent. On party wise representation, Naidy said while the overall attendance of members of the BJP and the Congress, accounting for a total of 142 members, was higher than 50 per cent, the attendance of members from other parties, accounting for 102 Members, was only about 40 per cent.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/95-mps-didn---t-attend-parl-panels----meetings--naidu.html
161,03-3-20,Direct Tax Vivad to Vishwas Bill introduced,"The Government on Monday introduced and started debate on the Direct Tax Vivad se Vishwas Bill, enabling one time settlement in the decades’ long appeals in the Income Tax disputes, amid a din on the issue of Delhi riots.

Introducing the bill, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said direct tax dispute resolution scheme announced in Budget will be of great help to people as they will be able to save time and money spent in fighting cases.

As many as 4.83 lakh direct tax cases worth Rs 9.32 lakh crore are locked up in various appellate forums such as Commissioner (Appeals), ITAT, High Courts, Supreme Court and Debt Recovery Tribunals. “The scheme will give settlement option to all those with disputed tax. This will be of great help because people spent a lot of time and money in settling cases,” Sitharaman said while moving the Bill, while Opposition MPs were in the Well demanding reply and resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah in the wake of Delhi riots.

Under the proposed scheme, taxpayers willing to settle disputes shall be allowed a complete waiver of interest and penalty if they pay the entire amount of tax in dispute by March 31 this year, following which a 10 per cent additional disputed tax shall have to be paid over and above the tax liability.

Further, where arrears relate to disputed interest or penalty only, then 25 per cent of disputed penalty or interest shall have to be paid if the payment is made by March 31, beyond which the same shall be enhanced to 30 per cent. Also in search and seizure operations where the recovery is up to Rs 5 crore, this scheme can be availed once the Bill is passed by Parliament. The scheme would remain open till June 30, 2020.

While debating on the bill, BJP’s Sanjay Jaiswal provoked the agitating Congress MPs by saying that the Vivad se Vishwas Bill is actually helpful to corrupt Congress leaders like Sonia and Chidambaram. Jaiswal asked the Congress MPs to cooperate with the Bill and save from the probes on the money looted during the UPA regime. MPs rushed to Jasiwal, when all of a sudden during his speech, he attacked Sonia and Priyaka Gandhi for inciting people leading to Delhi riots. The House was adjourned thrice after this and debate is expected continue on Tuesday.

162,03-3-20,EC not in favour of State funding of polls,"The Election Commission (EC) is not in favour of State funding of elections as it will not be able to prohibit or check candidates’ own expenditure over and above provided for by States.

In a written reply to Lok Sabha, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur said the ECI’s view is that for addressing the real issues, there have to be radical changes in the provisions regarding receipts of funds by political parties and the manner in which such funds are spent by them so as to provide for complete transparency in the matter.

“The Election Commission has informed the Government that it is not in favour of State Funding as it will not be able to prohibit or check candidates own expenditure or expenditure by others over and above that which is provided for by the State,” the Minister said. Thakur further said that in order to discourage cash transactions and bring in transparency in the sources of funding of political parties, the Government has amended the Income Tax Act and limited anonymous cash donations to Rs 2,000.

The Government introduced the ‘Electoral Bond Scheme 2018’ to establish a transparent political funding system in the country with well established audit trail.

In another reply, he said the number of assessees filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) has consistently increased during each of the last three years as well as in the current year.

As per the data provided by him, the total number of e-returns (excluding revised returns) were 5.18 crore in assessment year 2016-17 and 6.35 crore during Assessment Year (up to Feb 15, 2020).

The belated returns of AY 2019-20 can be submitted up to March 31, 2020,

therefore, this number will increase further, the Minister said.

Thakur said the Income Tax Department has implemented the Non-Filers Monitoring System (NMS) which assimilates and analyses in-house information as well as transactional data received from third parties to identify such persons/entities who have undertaken high value financial transactions but have not filed their returns.

The number of non-filers with potential tax liabilities identified in the last three assessment years was 33 lakh, 38.81 lakh and 15.58 lakh.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ec-not-in-favour-of-state-funding-of-polls.html

166,03-3-20,Fitch Solutions cuts India’s economic growth forecast to 4.9%,"Fitch Solutions on Monday cut its forecast for India’s economic growth to 4.9 per cent in the current fiscal that ends March 31, saying manufacturing could come under pressure from weak domestic demand and supply chain disruptions due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The GDP growth is forecast to recover slightly to 5.4 per cent in 2020-21 (April 2020 to March 2021), it said.

“We at Fitch Solutions are revising down our forecast for India’s real GDP growth to 4.9 per cent in FY2019/20, from 5.1 per cent previously, and 5.4 per cent in FY2020/21, from 5.9 per cent previously,” the agency said in its outlook for the country.

India’s real GDP growth decelerated to 4.7 per cent in the third quarter (October-December) from an upwardly revised 5.1 per cent in the second quarter owing to slower government consumption, a steeper contraction in gross fixed capital formation and a smaller net exports contribution.

“A failure of the FY2020/21 Union Budget to provide support to the industry will also bring little reprieve for a sluggish industry already coming under heavy pressure from a credit squeeze following the collapse of several key Non-Bank Financial Companies (NBFCs),” it said.

NBFCs are a key channel in which consumers obtain loans for vehicle and housing purchases. “Our revision is due to our view for disruption in the automotive and electronics supply chain from the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak in China to weigh on India’s export manufacturing sector, and for this to have negative knock-on effects on the broad services sector,” Fitch Solutions said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/fitch-solutions-cuts-india---s-economic-growth-forecast-to-4-9-.html
167,03-3-20,"Poultry sector faces Rs 1,750 cr losses due to coronavirus rumours","Poultry breeders on Monday demanded a relief package from the Government claiming that the sector has incurred heavy losses of around Rs 1,750 crore in a month due to fake news that coronavirus was spreading due to chickens.

Poultry bird prices have plunged to Rs 10-30 per kg at farm gate level due to a slump in chicken demand while the average cost of production is Rs 80 per kg, the All India

Poultry Breeders Association (AIPBA) said in a representation to the Ministry of Animal Husbandry.

“The repeated onslaught of social media with wrong information on consumers has shaken consumer confidence and depleted the demand for chicken products,” AIPBA Chairman Bahadur Ali said.

The loss of broiler farmers, integration companies and breeding companies put together was about Rs 1,750 crore during the third week of January till the third week of February, he said, adding that it has created “massive crisis” and forced poultry sector to “bankruptcy”.

Expressing concern that the “fake” coronavirus threat spread by social media among consumers has created a massive problem for the poultry sector, Ali said, “If these conditions persist in March going forward a loss of Rs 1,750 crore per month will be additional.”

This will also impact maize and soyabean farmers because without poultry there is no market for soyabean meal and maize in the country,

he said, adding that maize prices have droppped from Rs 25 per kg to Rs 15 per kg in the last few days.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/poultry-sector-faces-rs-1-750-cr-losses-due-to-coronavirus-rumours.html

169,03-3-20,India’s mfg activity eases marginally in Feb,"The country’s manufacturing sector activity eased in February from a near eight-year high in the previous month and business sentiment took a hit amid impact of coronavirus outbreak on exports and supply chains, a monthly survey said on Monday.

At 54.5 in February, the headline seasonally adjusted IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) held close to January’s near eight-year high of 55.3, signalling improvement in operating conditions across the sector.

This is the 31st consecutive month that the manufacturing PMI has remained above the 50-point mark.

In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.

“Factories in India continued to benefit from strong order flows in February, from both the domestic and international markets. The pick-up in demand meant that companies were able to further lift production and input buying at historically-elevated rates,” said

Pollyanna de Lima, Principal Economist at IHS Markit. The strong manufacturing sector expansion seen in India at the start of the year was maintained in February, with rates of growth for factory orders, exports and output holding close to January’s recent highs. While firms were willing to step up input buying, hiring activity increased only fractionally.

“However, alarm bells are ringing for Indian goods producers as the COVID-19 outbreak poses threats to exports and supply chains. Businesses became less confident about the year-ahead outlook for output, in turn restricting hiring activity,” Lima added.

The coronavirus outbreak has brought a large part of the world’s second-largest economy China to a standstill and its impact has been felt across industries.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/india---s-mfg-activity-eases-marginally-in-feb.html

171,03-3-20,Virus to cut India’s diamond exports to $ 19 bn for 2020-21,"The country’s diamond exports could shrink by a fifth to USD 19 billion by the end of 2020-21, as the novel coronavirus (n-CoV) outbreak amplifies sluggishness in global demand, according to a report.

In 2018-19, India’s diamond exports stood at USD 24 billion, according to Crisil Ratings. Consequently, exports in the next financial year would remain down or at best flat because any traction in the second half would be offset by the weak first half, the report added.

In the first nine months of this fiscal, India’s total diamond exports by value were down 18 per cent, year-on-year. About 40 per cent of these exports are to Hong Kong, which has seen dysfunctional local markets over the past year or so.

Moreover, it said there has been no diamond exports to the island since January 15 this year.

“Exports would continue to fall in the closing quarter of this fiscal, which typically accounts for roughly a third of India’s exports to the Southeast Asian region. Given extended holidays in the region and shutdown of markets in the aftermath of the n-CoV outbreak, exports worth over USD 1 billion may be lost in this quarter alone,” Crisil Ratings Senior Director Subodh Rai said.

The report added the n-CoV impact could not have come at a worse time for an industry that has been buffeted by tepid demand, declining realisations and the ongoing political conflict in Hong Kong.

Even if the n-CoV outbreak is contained in the next two months, trade normalcy and demand uptick from Hong Kong are unlikely before the middle of the next fiscal, it added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/virus-to-cut-india---s-diamond-exports-to---19-bn-for-2020-21.html
172,03-3-20,Anti-Naxal ops: CRPF to turn choppers into air ambulances,"Over a dozen helicopters operating in the country's anti-Naxal operations grid are being retrofitted by the CRPF with air ambulance-like facilities as part of a maiden initiative to reduce casualties of its troops and other personnel, officials said on Monday.

A specialised training module for helicopter-based air ambulance services, for the force's doctors and paramedical staff, was launched on Monday at a CRPF camp in Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh, they said.

The officials said as the in-service choppers only have basic medicines and doctors on-board when on a 'mission sortie' to evacuate a seriously wounded or ill personnel, administering quick specialised medical care in the air is not possible.

The time taken in the entire process of lifting injured personnel and getting them admitted to a hospital leads to instances of excessive blood loss and also losing the 'golden hour' to save a person hit in operation.

A senior official told PTI the new CRPF chief, AP Maheshwari, has now directed that over a dozen choppers, drawn from the IAF and the BSF, will be “retro-fitted” with air ambulance-like facilities so that as soon as they lift an injured or ill personnel the doctors on-board can give them “vital life saving treatment” with the help of dedicated medical equipment.

“When a trooper injured in an anti-Maoist operation or someone seriously ill in a similar remote location is to be evacuated, a fixed-wing air ambulance is sent in. But they can only go upto major locations where there is a tarmac or landing strip and cannot land in a jungle or makeshift helipad like a chopper does.

“This is where it was felt necessary that choppers need to double up as air ambulances so that essential life saving procedures are administered to the injured or sick as soon as they are brought on-board,” the official said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/anti-naxal-ops--crpf-to-turn-choppers-into-air-ambulances.html

176,03-3-20,Bill to extend upper limit of abortion to 24 weeks introduced in Lok Sabha,"A bill that seeks to extend the upper limit for permitting abortions from the present 20 weeks to 24 weeks was introduced in Lok Sabha on Monday.

Health Minister Harsh Vardhan introduced the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2020 amid vehement protests by opposition members against the Central government over the Delhi violence which has left more than 40 persons dead.

After approving the bill last month, the government said this will ensure safe termination of pregnancies and also give women reproductive rights over their bodies.

The extension to 24 weeks will also help victims of rape, girls with disabilities as well as minors, who may not realise they are pregnant until later, it said, describing the draft legislation as progressive.

One of the salient features of the proposed amendments is “enhancing the upper gestation limit from 20 to 24 weeks for special categories

of women which will be defined in the amendments to the MTP Rules and would include 'vulnerable women including survivors of rape, victims of incest and other vulnerable women (like differently-abled women, minors) etc,” an official statement said.

If the pregnancy has to be terminated in 20 weeks, the opinion of one doctor is required. But beyond that, opinion of two doctors would be needed and one of them has to be a government physician.

Name and other particulars of a woman whose pregnancy is terminated shall not be revealed except to a person authorised in any law which is in force, the statement said.

The statement said the “upper gestation limit” for medical termination of pregnancy will not apply in cases of “substantial foetal abnormalities” diagnosed by the Medical Board.

The composition, functions and other details of Medical Board will be prescribed subsequently in rules to be framed under the Act.

The amendments are aimed at expanding access of women to safe and legal abortion services on therapeutic, eugenic, humanitarian or social grounds, the statement had said.

“It is a step towards safety and well-being of the women and many women will be benefitted by this. Recently several petitions were received by the courts seeking permission for aborting pregnancies at a gestational age beyond the present permissible limit on grounds of foetal abnormalities or

pregnancies due to sexual violence faced by women.

“The proposed increase in gestational age will ensure dignity, autonomy, confidentiality and justice for women who need to terminate pregnancy,” it had said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bill-to-extend-upper-limit-of-abortion-to-24-weeks-introduced-in-lok-sabha.html

182,03-3-20,Israel votes for third time in 12 months,"Israelis voted on Monday in an unprecedented third parliamentary elections in less than a year to break the deadlock on government formation, with the country’s longest serving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fighting for his political survival amid indictments on graft charges.

Israel’s Central Elections Committee (CEC) said that 27.6 per cent of registered voters had cast their ballots by noon, the highest figures for this hour since the 1999 elections when incumbent Prime Minister Netanyahu lost to Ehud Barak in direct elections for premiership.

Neither Netanyahu, who heads the right-wing Likud party, nor his main challenger, Benny Gantz — leader of the Blue and White alliance — were able to put together majority coalitions following the last two elections.

The final opinion polls suggested the latest round is too close to call.

Some 10,631 polling stations opened at 7 AM Israel time to enable about 6,45 miliion eligible voters to cast their ballots. There were 14 special polling stations for Israelis quarantined due to possible exposure to coronavirus.

President Reuven Rivlin expressed a feeling of “deep shame” while voting.

“This is normally a festive day, but the truth is that I don’t feel like celebrating. I only feel a sense of deep shame when I face you, my fellow citizens,” Rivlin said after casting his vote at the Yefe Nof school in Jerusalem.

“We just don’t deserve this. We don’t deserve another awful and grubby election campaign like the one that ends today and we don’t deserve this never-ending instability.

Prime Minister designate Mohammed Allawi blamed political parties he did not name, saying they “were not serious about implementing reforms that they promised to the people” and accusing them of placing obstacles in the way of a new and independent government.

“If I agreed to offer concessions, I would be prime minister now, but I tried everything possible to save the country from sliding toward the unknown and resolve the current crisis. But the negotiations hit repeated snags,” he said in a short address to the nation, explaining his decision to withdraw.

He accused some parties of negotiating “purely for narrow interests.”

Allawi’s withdrawal a month after he was selected for the post plunges the country in more uncertainty at a critical time and as the country weathers troubled times, including ongoing anti-government protests and the constant threat of being ensnared by festering US-Iran tensions.

Shortly after he spoke, two mortar shells landed in Iraq’s Green Zone where the US Embassy and government offices are located, without causing any injuries, two security officials said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.

184,03-3-20,Biden fights for momentum in Dems’ shifting primary,"An emboldened Joe Biden is trying to cast himself as the clear moderate alternative to progressive Bernie Sanders as the Democrats’ shrinking presidential field raced toward Super Tuesday.

One of Biden’s leading moderate rivals, former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg, dropped out of the campaign Sunday just 24 hours after Biden scored a resounding victory in South Carolina, his first of the 2020 rollercoaster nomination fight.

While other rivals appeared undeterred, Biden pressed his case during a round of national television interviews that reflected a stark reality a day after his resounding primary victory in South Carolina: The former vice president was forced to rely upon free media coverage because he was understaffed, underfunded and almost out of time as he fought to transform his sole win into a national movement. Biden vowed to improve his campaign operation, his fundraising haul — and even his own performance — in an interview on ABC’s “This Week.” He warned of a “stark choice” between him and Sanders, while making the case he was the candidate who could win up and down the ballot and in states beyond those voting next week. Biden added a swipe at one of Sanders’ signature lines during an appearance on “Fox New Sunday”: “The people aren’t looking for revolution.

They’re looking for results.” The newfound confidence came at a crossroads in the Democratic Party’s turbulent primary season. Sanders remained the undisputed front-runner. But the rest of the field was decidedly unsettled, even after Biden’s South Carolina blowout and Buttigieg’s sudden departure.

Most notably, New York billionaire Mike Bloomberg could create problems for Biden as the race sped toward Super Tuesday, when 14 states from Maine to Alabama to California hold Democratic elections as the 2020 primary moved into a new phase. No longer would individual states hold primaries every week. Starting Tuesday, and most Tuesdays through early June, batches of states would vote at the same time in what had essentially become a national election.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/biden-fights-for-momentum-in-dems----shifting-primary.html

188,03-3-20,World economy may shrink because of virus: Watchdog,"A global agency says the spreading new virus could make the world economy shrink this quarter, for the first time since the international financial crisis more than a decade ago.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says Monday in a special report on the impact of the virus that the world economy is still expected to grow overall this year and rebound next year.

But it lowered its forecasts for global growth in 2020 by half a percentage point, to 2.4 per cent, and said the figure could go as low as 1.5 per cent if the virus lasts long and spreads widely.

The last time world GDP shrank on a quarter-on-quarter basis was at the end of 2008, during the depths of the financial crisis. On a full-year basis, it last shrank in 2009.

The OECD said China’s reduced production is hitting Asia particularly hard but also companies around the world that depend on its goods.

It urged Governments to act fast to prevent contagion and restore consumer confidence.

The Paris-based OECD, which advises developed economies on policy, said the impact of this virus is much higher than past outbreaks because “the global economy has become substantially more interconnected, and China plays a far greater role in global output, trade, tourism and commodity markets.”",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/world-economy-may-shrink-because-of-virus--watchdog-2020-03-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/world-economy-may-shrink-because-of-virus--watchdog.html

Finance ministers and central bank chiefs from G7 countries will hold talks later in the day to discuss ways to coordinate their responses to cushion the epidemic's impact on the global economy.

The 30-share index was trading 533.37 points, or 1.40 per cent, higher at 38,677.39, and the NSE Nifty jumped 179.75 points, or 1.61 per cent, to 11,312.50.

All Sensex components were trading on a positive note. Top gainers included Sun Pharma, Tata Steel, Reliance Industries, Hero MotoCorp, ICICI Bank and HCL Tech.

In the previous session, the 30-share BSE barometer closed 153.27 points or 0.40 per cent lower at 38,144.02, and the broader Nifty closed lower by 69 points or 0.62 per cent at 11,132.75.

Further, on a net basis, foreign institutional investors (FPIs) sold equities worth Rs 1,354.72 crore, while domestic institutional investors bought shares worth Rs 1,138.74 crore on Monday, data available with stock exchanges showed.

The tribunal also modified the resolution plan and said Rs 750 crore deposited by Jaiprakash Associates would be part of the plan.

The successful resolution will provide a big relief to over 20,000 homebuyers across various housing projects launched by Jaypee Infratech in Noida and Greater Noida (Uttar Pradesh).

195,03-3-20,Dear diary,"Artist Pooja Aggarwal presents her first solo, The Third Dimensions, a series of 15 3D paintings that mirrors the landmarks of the cityscape and her surroundings. By Team Viva

Artist Pooja Aggarwal diverts from the traditional treatment of flat canvas and creates three-dimensional forms that seems to break the limits of the frame. She expresses her thoughts using novel 3D techniques on an organic wooden surface, using acrylic and oil colours, in her latest exhibition, The Third Dimensions.

Each painting reflects dimensions of her life as they unfold — a kind of a diary. These paintings belong to a series of works that re-imagine landmarks by staging a virtual event that would alter the viewer’s memory, suggesting how the virtual could affect and alter the real.

She explains, “Art in the broadest sense is a form of communication. In my art, I first make a broad sketch of what I want to convey and then get into the minute details to make it more impactful. My art is a literature born of my thoughts. It’s like documentation of your own feelings, inspiration and progress. The subject matters could be my surroundings or something which I have encountered during my travel or any memory.”

The idea of being able to move things around within the space of the mind is a magical power that we as human beings possess. This inspired her to highlight the uniqueness and individuality of the expressions. Thus, she paints her meditation series titled The Path Within and Circles of Life. Her perspective is reflected in her paintings that represents space and provides an illusion of depth while creating a 3D world for the viewer. Thus, another one of the paintings has been aptly named Gullibility of Human Senses.

Pooja discovers that 3D can convey a lot more by implying movement towards our ideals. The intriguing part of the paintings is that those parts of the picture which seem farthest away are actually physically the nearest to the viewer, similar to what we discover during meditation. She says, “These paintings created on a 3-dimensional surface give an amazing optical illusion where the parts of the picture which seem farthest away are actually physically the nearest. This surface provides a powerful and often disorienting impression of depth and movement. As the viewer walks by the painting put up at eye level, the composition seems to move with him/her and shows how gullible human senses can be.”

(The exhibition is on from March 6 and runs till March 12 at All India Fine Arts and Society.)",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dear-diary-2020-03-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/dear-diary.html
196,03-3-20,A healing medium,"Crafts can help refugees find community and maybe a living

When Bahija Karim arrived in Idaho as an Afghan refugee in 2005, she knew little about American culture. She didn’t speak English. A volunteer directed her to Artisans for Hope, a local crafts initiative for refugees. There, she was taught crafting skills and English. Artisans for Hope took Karim on field trips. They found her a job with a seamstress, which she held for nine years, and then they helped her start her own custom drapery business, The Golden Needle.

Karim says Artisans for Hope helped her feel like an empowered member of her new community. With their help, she says, “all the people know we are human beings. We could make something for ourselves, for them, for the country, for the community.”

Around the world, crafting is being used as a tool to help refugees — and especially women — get acclimated to a host country, learn skills and, sometimes, earn a living. “We provide a venue for refugee women to craft together, build a community, make some friends, and have a safe way to interact with each other and talk about what they’ve been through,” says Sharon McCreary, who in 2007 helped found A Little Something, a women’s refugee crafts organization in Denver.

A Little Something also sells the crafts and gives artisans 75 per cent of the earnings. In Paris, the Agency of Artists in Exile (aa-e) supports professional artists — from painters to photographers to dancers to musicians — who come to France as refugees. Founded in 2017 by Judith Depaule and Ariel Cypel, the group works with about 200 artists from 45 different countries, many of them seeking political asylum. The organisation hosts a festival, provides workspace, offers French classes, and helps artists find grants, residencies and jobs. If they need lawyers, psychiatrists or accommodations, aa-e helps find those too.

“When you get to a country in the way of exile,” Depaule says, “you can have a lot of bad experiences, very hard, very traumatising experiences. And when you are waiting for papers it’s very hard, too. Because you don’t know if they will say yes or not, so (art) is a possibility to start to build something, and to start thinking about something else.”

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees also runs a craft-based initiative, Made51. It partners with local groups around the world to help artisan refugees connect to markets where they can sell their products.

Made51’s Global Manager Heidi Christ says that after forming a successful partnership with Virgin Megastores in the United Arab Emirates, the Made51 team is now working to expand and grow its direct-to-consumer market. “We see lots of possibility,” Christ says. “People love the storytelling behind Made51, love the idea of being able to buy from refugees in many different countries and do it in a way that also supports local business growth in these developing countries.”

She hopes a ripple effect of Made51 will be to shift people’s perception of refugees. “Despite the conditions that a refugee artisan is living in, they’re able to make this beautiful product,” she says, “And then the way the consumer can think about refugees changes.”

Depaule, too, hopes to change attitudes, aiming to hold more aa-e festivals in countries where taking in refugees is controversial. And back in Idaho, Artisans for Hope worked to change hearts and minds through a travelling quilt project. In partnership with the Idaho Commission on the Arts, the artisans created story quilts and travelled around Idaho, Oregon, and Utah to display them.

“It was for me a very good experience,” says quilt project participant Wafaa Alwan, “because I was seeing support from people.” Alwan came to the United States from Iraq, and was connected to Artisans for Hope after opening up to a friend about struggling with homesickness.

“It’s not just a centre for crafting,” she says. “It’s a healing centre for us. It’s really a second chance for refugee ladies to find a place to live and prosper in the community.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-healing-medium-2020-03-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-healing-medium.html

198,03-3-20,Bengal takes firm control of Ranji semis,"Hosts Bengal tightened their grip over the Ranji Trophy semifinal by reducing Karnataka to 98 for three after setting them a stiff 352-run target on day three of the contest, at Eden Gardens on Monday.

Resuming the day at 72 for four, Bengal could manage just 161 but the massive 190-run first innings lead meant that Karnataka now have a mountain to climb.

Anustup Majumdar, who staged a fourth rescue-act this season with an unbeaten 149 in the first innings, hit a combative 41 in Bengal’s second innings amid yet another batting collapse.

Bengal, who won their previous Ranji title during Sourav Ganguly’s debut season in 1989-90, would go for the kill to make their first final in 13 years. They had lost to Mumbai by 132 runs in their last final appearance in 2007.

Karnataka have already lost their top-order and they have to produce a superlative batting effort to score the required 254 runs in the remaining two days of the match.

KL Rahul (0) was dismissed by a peach of a delivery by the first-innings hero Ishan Porel.

On a pitch which has slowed down and ball has turned soft, Karnataka duo of R Samarth and Paddikal put up a 57-run partnership after the fall of Rahul.

Bengal broke the partnership overturning the umpire’s decision with a successful review from the bowling of Akash Deep who had Samarth plumb in front.

Mukesh Kumar dismissed Karun Nair (6) as all the three pacer had a share of one wicket each at the close of day three.

The 19-year-old Padikkal remained unbeaten on 50 in company of Manish Pandey (11).

Earlier, Sudip Chatterjee (45) was Bengal’s top scorer in their second innings, while Majumdar and all-rounder Shahbaz Ahmed (31) continued their fine form in a 61-run partnership to prop up their overall lead after a familiar top-order collapse.

Mithun bagged 4/23 and was their most impressive bowler.

Gaja leads fight back

Rajkot: Medium pacer Chintan Gaja grabbed a fifer to lead Gujarat’s fight-back after they conceded a 52-run first-innings lead against Saurashtra.

Gaja (5/15) reduced Saurashtra to 66 for 5 in their second essay at the end of the day three as the hosts took an overall lead of 118 at the SCA Stadium in Khandheri.

The 25-year-old Ahmedabad-born Gaja bowled in the right areas and was handsomely rewarded for his efforts.

His scalps included Harvik Desai (0), Kishan Parmar (0), Avi Barot (1), Vishwaraj Jadeja (6) and first-innings centurion Sheldon Jackson (0) to reduced Saurashtra to 15 for 5.

But an experienced Arpit Vasavada (23 not out) and Chetan Sakariya (32 not out) stood tall against the Gujarat bowlers till stumps were drawn.

This was after the hosts, who had posted 304, bundled out Gujarat for 252 in their first essay.

Gujarat was reeling at 155 for 8 at one stage in their first innings, but then Rujul Bhatt (71 off 212 balls) and Gaja (61 off 103 balls) joined hands to bail their side out by adding 87 runs for the eighth wicket.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bengal-takes-firm-control-of-ranji-semis.html
199,03-3-20,Faf back for India series,"Left-arm spinner George Linde received his maiden call-up while former South Africa skipper Faf du Plessis returned to the side for the three ODIs in India, beginning March 12 in Dharamsala.

Linde had made his Test debut during the tour of India last October.

The 15-man squad also sees the return of rested players, du Plessis and Rassie van der Dussen to bolster the batting line-up and the retention of newcomer Kyle Verreynne who impressed selectors with his score of 48 off 64 on debut against Australia.

Du Plessis has not played an ODI since South Africa’s disappointing World Cup campaign under his leadership. Keshav Maharaj and Lutho Sipamla are also among the retained players.

“The selections are a continuation of Cricket South Africa’s (CSA) search for the next generation of Proteas who will potentially represent the country in the 2023 ICC World Cup in India...,” Cricket South Africa said in a statement.

“It is also a good opportunity for the players selected to put their hands up and show what they are capable of in the tough playing conditions of India,” it added.

Spinner Tabraiz Shamsi was not available for selection. Lead pacer Kagiso Rabada remained unavailable due to a groin strain.

200,03-3-20,"Aus enter Women’s T20 WC semis, NZ out","Defending champions Australia advanced to the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup semifinals after knocking out New Zealand with a four-run win in their must-win final Group A match here on Monday.

Beth Mooney’s brilliant half-century proved the difference as four-time champions Australia halted New Zealand in a chase of 155 four runs short. Mooney hit 60 off 50 balls in the must-win match.

Leg-spinner Georgia Wareham’s three for 17 sent the top-order into collapse and ensured a semi-final berth for the hosts, who will face either South Africa or England in Sydney.

Mooney’s 60 runs from 50 balls, including six fours and two sixes, helped Australia to 155 for five with the White Ferns requiring the highest successful chase of the tournament to win at Junction Oval.

New Zealand, who have made the semi-finals once since 2012, fell agonisingly short as their top-order struggled in Melbourne for the third successive game.

Megan Schutt took three for 22 but Wareham was the pick of the bowlers after taking the crucial wickets of Suzie Bates, Sophie Devine and Maddy Green to set Australia on their way.

Siriwardena shines

Elsewhere in the other game, Shashikala Siriwardena produced the perfect swansong to her international career by taking four wickets in Sri Lanka’s victory over Bangladesh.

Siriwardena’s World Cup best and Achini Kulasuriya’s two for 19 saw Bangladesh slip up in their final match of the tournament.

Hasini Perera’s 39 not out helped to seal Sri Lanka’s first victory by nine wickets with 27 balls to spare.

Siriwardena’s figures were the best in the tournament to date in her final international match, with her four for 16 a memorable farewell after 17 years of service to Sri Lankan cricket.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/aus-enter-women---s-t20-wc-semis--nz-out.html
201,03-3-20,50 more runs would have made things challenging: Williamson,"New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson says their victory in the second Test well inside three days is not a fair reflection of how competitive the match was and If India had scored 50 more runs, the chase would have been much more challenging.

“It’s an outstanding performance. I sort of said it recently but I don’t think the result reflected how competitive the match was. Perhaps another 50 more runs from the India’s perspective would have made it quite a balanced-looking match,” Williamson said at the post-match conference.

Unlike the flat sub-continental tracks, the tracks for two Tests had an ideal balance between bat and ball where it was hard to score runs. “Both games were a really good balance in terms of the surface between bat and ball and runs were quite tough to come by. You had to have a little bit of fortune go your way and then try and put a bit of pressure on the bowlers first. A great performance over the last two games from the guys.”

Williamson had no qualms in admitting that tracks were tilted in favour of bowlers.

“I guess you look at the surfaces and they both were perhaps seam-bowler friendly. But as a batting unit as well, the contributions that were made to get us to parity in the first innings of this game and in Wellington to get competitive totals on the board on these surfaces were really pleasing to see.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/50-more-runs-would-have-made-things-challenging--williamson.html

The deadly virus that first emerged in China in December last year has spread to more than 70 countries and has infected more than 88,000 people, including over 80,000 in China.

China’s National Health Commission (NHC) said on Sunday it received reports of 202 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Sunday, taking the total number of cases in the mainland to 80,026.

The new cases are the lowest since January 22 when Beijing initiated emergency measures, including placing the worst-hit Wuhan city and 17 other cities with over 50 million people under lockdown.

Forty-two deaths were reported on Sunday in the virus-hit Hubei Province and its capital Wuhan, the NHC said in its daily report.

The overall cases included 2,912 people, died of the disease, 32,652 patients who were still being treated and 44,462 patients discharged after recovery, it said.

The commission said that 715 people were still suspected of being infected with the virus.

Hubei province and its capital Wuhan which remained the epicentres of the coronavirus outbreak reported 196 new confirmed cases.

The latest report brought the total confirmed cases in the hard-hit province to 67,103 and that of total deaths to 2,803, including 2,227 fatalities in Wuhan, local health commission said.

203,03-3-20,Will resume ops against Afghan forces: Taliban,"The Taliban said Monday they were resuming offensive operations against Afghan security forces, ending the partial truce that preceded the signing of a deal between the insurgents and Washington.

The declaration comes only a day after President Ashraf Ghani said he would continue the partial truce at least until talks between Afghan officials and the Taliban kick-off, supposedly on March 10.

It ran for one week ahead of the signing of the historic accord in Doha on Saturday, and continued over the weekend.

“The reduction in violence... Has ended now and our operations will continue as normal,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told AFP.

“As per the (US-Taliban) agreement, our mujahideen will not attack foreign forces but our operations will continue against the Kabul administration forces.”

Fawad Aman, deputy spokesman for the defence ministry said the government was “checking to see if (the truce) had ended”.

“We have not had any reports of any big attacks in the country yet”, he added.

Since the deal signing on Saturday, the Taliban have been publicly celebrating their “victory” over the US.

Under the terms of the deal, foreign forces will quit Afghanistan within 14 months, subject to Taliban security guarantees and a pledge by the insurgents to hold talks with the Kabul government.

The dramatic fall in attacks due to last week’s partial truce between the Taliban, US and Afghan forces offered Afghans a rare opportunity to go about their daily lives without fear of violence.

Ghani warned the insurgents Monday that he was not committed to a key clause in the Doha deal involving the release of thousands of Taliban prisoners.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/will-resume-ops-against-afghan-forces--taliban.html
204,03-3-20,On a serious note and in a lighter vein,"Founder-director Maheep Singh says that the Khushwant Singh Humour Fest 2020 is an attempt to bring various generations under one roof and inspire them to think. By Chahak Mittal

I think humour can be a very lethal weapon. You make somebody a laughing stock and you kill him. But most journalists don’t do it. They get angry, which doesn’t serve the purpose,” said Khushwant Singh once. For the author, humour was something very subtle, something that eludes precise definition and isn’t hurtful. Known for his large “repertoire of jokes,” Singh had an unusual ability to not just laugh at himself but also make valid points through comedy without hurting any sentiments.

To celebrate this true comic, founder-director Maheep Singh conceptualised the Khushwant Singh Humour Fest (KSHF). The idea, he says, came about while having a spirited conversation about a pertinent subject — ‘Where has all the humour gone?’ And he found an answer. He adds, “And there it was. I have delved into stand-up comedy for the longest time alongwith theatre, radio and TV. I have written plays and lyrics, poetry, fiction and found a common thread that strings all the genres together. The fest is an attempt to look for humour in our mundane lives through a multi-art festival of spoken word.”

Rahul Singh (author’s son) says, “The fest takes the audience through a journey that not just rejoices in good-quality humour but also commemorates the spirit of Sardar Khushwant Singh who never ceased to call it a day, drew unique observations out of the ordinary and unapologetically laced it with witty sarcasm. It strives to bring all generations under one roof and have a good laugh, bond over jokes and rejoice the hilarity of life, keeping all the humdrum and monotony of everydayness at bay. It urges all and sundry to break out of the mundane and celebrate life.”

The fest will see performances by stand-up comedians like Amit Tandon, Neeti Palta, Anubhav Singh Bassi, Rajneesh Kapoor, Gursimran Khamba, Atul Khatri and Zakir Khan, who have been a rage in the Indian comedy circuit. The line-up will also have the best of Delhi’s comedy talent performing.

Given Singh’s literary background, one may wonder why the fest doesn’t have any authors or writers on board. Maheep argues that there is already a literary fest dedicated to Khushwant Singh’s name. “He certainly has a literary background, no doubt, but if one remembers him the most now, then it is for his column, With Malice Towards One and All. With his famous jokes at the end, he would make the most fiercely written articles bearable for even his strongest critics. I think it’s most appropriate that we choose humour to remember him,” he says.

However, he points out that one shouldn’t mistake the festival to be a stand-up comedy event. He says, “It involves a lot more from so many different artforms. We have carefully curated a festival which includes a wide range of programmes that would attract the attention of all age groups. From stand-up comedy to humorous Urdu poetry, from Hari Shankar Parsai’s writing through feminist perspectives to Qissebaazi/Dastangoi by Danish Husain of Hoshruba Repertory, The Kyunki Ladkiya Funny Nahin Hoti, a comedy collective based on women’s issues by Mahila Manch, Gujarat, names like Mark Tully and Rahul Ram of Indian Ocean, who have made a connection with so many generations — there is a lot to look forward to.”

So how does he aim to revive Singh’s writings and jokes through this fest? “Khushwant ji’s family and friends have immensely contributed towards creating sessions about his personal life. He is remembered not only as a writer but also as a friend who loved telling jokes at parties. And this fest is a befitting tribute to the man we all loved and loved to hate.”

Today, humour has become a tool of dissent with satire embedded in it. Does that make it as free-flowing? Says Maheep, “Comedy has become a strong platform for youngsters to express their thoughts in a rather candid way, a trait which was otherwise non-existent or very subtle in classic arts. The irreverence and the freedom that stand-up comedy allows youngsters automatically resonates with the rebellion the youth craves to express. They club that with political awareness, given the expansion of social media and you have voice of dissent. However, satire has always been an important tool for writers, journalists, cartoonists and various other forms of expression.”

He recalls the “common man” by R K Laxman. “In today’s time, we have strong voices like Kunal Kamra, Varun Grover and Sanjay Rajaura, who have used their satire to put across their perspective in such an effective and efficient way. I’m really happy to see this in present times,” adds he.

Singh had said that if we love our country, we will have to save it from communal forces. He had hoped that the present generation totally rejects the communal and fascist policies. The author has also been known to have taken several digs at religious fundamentalists. Asked whether this aspect will be touched upon, Maheep says that Singh’s ideologies are certainly needed in today’s sensitive time. “By creating a platform like KSHF, we are not only making space for laughter but also making you think,” he adds.

(The fest will be held from March 5 to 7 at Hotel Ambassador, Sujan Singh Park from 12 noon to 10 pm.)",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/on-a-serious-note-and-in-a-lighter-vein-2020-03-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/on-a-serious-note-and-in-a-lighter-vein.html

I am grateful to Priyanka and Sonam, for supporting the initiative.”

‘It feels good to deliver eight back to back hits but what is equally fulfilling is that I have tried to give different and meaningful cinema to the audience.

206,03-3-20,"Outer influences, inner truths","Modernist PRODOSH DAS GUPTA deals with the human form, specifically in terms of insight and intuitive reasoning, says Uma Nair

To be trained at the Madras School of Arts under the eagle eye of Devi Prasad Chaudhury is for the fortune’s favoured few. To be former director and curator of the National Gallery of Modern Art is a designation of envy and art history. To be a sculptor, who had the opportunity to study and sculpt in London as well as Paris, is a lesson in learning and leaning.

Art lovers, sculptors and artists can view at least 23 sculptures by Prodosh Das Gupta at Akar Prakar Contemporary in Delhi. Among the many small sculptures (1947-1991) lie lessons of beauty for modern day artists and sculptors in dealing with the human form, specifically in terms of insight and intuitive reasoning.

Indian modernists

Let us go back to the post-Independence days when Indian artists were seeking fresh insight into idioms that were built on the foundations of British and Western grammar and techniques but were hungry for a new language. Das Gupta began with European echoes. But when we look closely, he slowly pared down dogmas and started creating works that celebrated the simplicity of contours. He harnessed his imagery with a feminine fervour amid a love and passion for what he created.

As an Indian modernist, Das Gupta imbibed a lot of Western styles – classical realism, cubism, primitivism and abstraction. But because of the cultural context of the Indian sub-continent, he began to draw on Indian mythology and history. This is evident in works like Pounding Corn and Surya Mukhi. In Sun Worshippers, he blended his innate spirituality with accents of the modernist Constantin Brancusi, enriching his sculptures with neat contours and minimalism. The Indian art world had not seen the likes of his works.

Influence of European Masters

While there is a lot of Henry Moore, who brought about a humanist tradition in sculpture with his series of reclining nudes, we can also see a Rodinesque resonance in two pieces. But it is the evocative elegance of Egg Bride and Unfolding Spring that are a critic’s delight. In both these works, Das Gupta advocates a certain responsiveness. In Bride, we sense a longing for the shadows in the overlay of the ovoid and its sliced entendre. In Unfolding Spring, it’s the elegance of abandon and the sinuous curves that speak to us about his admiration and reverence for the female figure. He knows very well that a sculptor must balance the will to expose as well as the will to be sensitive while dealing with the feminine form.

When you see the many female forms in this exhibition, they seem tactile and palpable. Their lines are fluid and there is a profound understanding of vulnerability. There is an inherent balance of looking within and without which doesn’t hurt the human sentiment.

Fusion of trends

It is important to ponder over Das Gupta’s own writings to understand his viewpoint and his brilliance as a diarist of art history and sculptural jottings.

“When we look back into our own history of sculptural culture, it becomes quite evident that gradually there has been fusion between the different regional trends, a mixing of the artistic concepts in the formal as well as technical applications t build up the images. The Greco Buddhist fusion was no doubt the starting point in the history of our sculptural manifestations running through the ages. It took time to assimilate the Greek influence into our own indigenous concepts and finally when we see its fulfillment in the stupendous works of sculpture in the Kushan period of Mathura, we realise how a work of art can be developed and enriched with proper understanding and careful handling of the methods and material without surrendering to abject imitation.

“This fusion to my mind has been there throughout the ages and indeed this process is inevitable and most welcome to renovate periodically the indigenous arts to instill into them a fresh breath of life. In this vast world, nothing can remain absolutely pure in its indigenous approach. Mixing and intermixing has always been there from time immemorial. Civilisation today is a variegated phenomenon like the colours of the artist’s palette. It is futile to search for the lily-white purity there.”

Lucid drawings

The drawings on the walls at Akar Prakar talk to us about time and space, memory and mood. Feminine curves align themselves with the space that surrounds them. Das Gupta’s drawings on newspaper are a lesson for students of arts colleges. The equilibrium between a simple interior and an elusive exterior informs his drawings.

A sculptor can be gregarious like Picasso or gently private like Brancusi and this is where the deeper rhythms of Das Gupta’s sensibility lies. The feminine body is there before you, there’s nothing to hide but how you translate the feminine form into a modernist mould will live and speak long after you made it. This is what signifies your stance and temperament as a sculptor. Translating Modernism is about understanding the rudiments of realism and abstraction before settling into the niche of the true modernist.

207,03-3-20,An odyssey of sorts,"One of the most celebrated shoe designers in the world, Christian Louboutin dreamt of making footwear for showgirls as a child. Since then he has grown his company into a global brand and been adored by women and men the world over. He commissions a series of features exploring the theme of his ‘journeys’

My father was a cabinet maker and he once told me that you have to follow the vein of the wood rather than try to impose your own will on it. I took this literally and have chosen to keep myself open to opportunities and encounters life throws at me. Throughout my 29-year career as a shoe designer, I’ve never had a set plan and I truly believe that everyone has their own specific journey. My advice is — enjoy the adventure. There isn’t one narrow way to reach your goal.

My experience of journeys started from a young age. When you’re a child, your imagination allows you to fly beyond yourself, it’s something that nobody can take from you.

I am reminded of a French book written in 1790 by Xavier de Maistre, called A Journey Around My Room. Stuck in one place for six weeks, the author recounts the ‘journeys’ he had while never going outside.

In a similar way, films can show you different worlds. Where I grew up, in the 12th arrondissement in Paris, there was a cinema called L’Athena and another nearby called L’Avron, where they screened films from India and Egypt. I would skip school and go there when I was meant to be in class. I wasn’t into French films of the time and by watching the ways of people and locales far from everything I knew in my day-to-day life, I could travel without leaving home.

Another major influence from my childhood was the Palais de la Porte Dorée, a stately art deco museum at the end of my street. There was a tropical aquarium in the basement, and I loved the bright colours of the fishes. Upstairs, at the time, the Palais was home to the Musée des arts africains et océaniens (MAAO). This place fed my imagination. Eventually, I explored the whole building. Alongside the beautiful frescoes, I travelled the world through all these amazing objects from countries in Africa and Oceania.

Shoes

I started designing shoes when I was a child. My early attempts were driven by my love of showgirls. To me, these dancers were like exotic birds of paradise. I thought to myself, “the only thing that I can give a bird that it doesn’t already have is shoes.”

But my career as a shoe designer nearly ended before it began. At 23, I began working with the master shoe designer Roger Vivier as his right-hand man. He was hugely inspiring and a mentor for me. I worked with him on his exhibition at Musée des Arts Décoratifs. After that, I truly believed that I would never design shoes again, because I didn’t want to work for anyone else. I thought this particular journey had ended.

When I stopped designing shoes in my early 20s, having done it for almost a decade, I wouldn’t say that I had lost my way as such, but I did make a significant change in my professional life. I started pursuing landscape design. I loved being close to nature and flowers.

And then there was a happy accident — an unexpected fork in the road, you might say — which changed the course of my life once again. It started with a chance encounter with the owner of a wonderful shop in the Galerie Véro-dodat, Eric Philippe. I fell in love with a lamp there and tried to buy it but he told me it wasn’t for sale. I kept going back and still he wouldn’t sell it to me.

In the end, it turned out that he had already sold it before I had seen it. But our conversations and my persistence led Eric to mention that a shop in the Galerie, which is a beautiful covered passageway in the 1st arrondissement, had become available. He believed this would be the perfect place for me to set myself up for a return to shoe design.

I decided to start the Louboutin company. I had never projected that I would run a label under my own name but I found myself here and this shop is where Louboutin was born.

Meaningful places

Throughout my life, I have always been interested in other cultures and civilisations. I’ve connected with countries that aren’t mine, cultures and food that were exotic to me. My career has allowed me to travel the world and sometimes my chance encounters have influenced my designs.

There are a lot of places that are meaningful to me — Egypt, Portugal, Rio and Paris, of course. Another place is Bhutan. I’d always wanted to travel there but the visa process was very complex and I didn’t manage it when I was younger. Then about 10 years ago, I finally went with my friend Diane von Furstenberg. She knew the King and Queen of Bhutan and was going to visit them. Since then, I have been coming back to the country almost every year. I love the country and the people, their way of life, their approach to craftsmanship and how they look to the future.

About seven or eight years ago, the Queen of Bhutan introduced me to artisans from the Zorig Chusum Institute. That was a really transformative experience. In Bhutan, there are 13 arts and crafts that represent the spirit and identity of the country. Shortly after, I wanted to create wedding shoes for a friend of mine who is a Buddhist. I thought about working with those artisans. It was from that initial thought that I ended up collaborating with them to create an entire collection of shoes and handbags, called LouBhoutan.

A secret revealed

Nearly 10 years ago, I made a powerful discovery about my own life. My elder sister told me my father was not my birth father and that I was actually half-Egyptian. I was surprised, of course, but also happy that my mother had had a love story in the middle of raising a family, and it gave me even more respect for the father who brought me up. I was also happy to be part of a larger world than I had thought, and it made sense to me for I had always felt an attachment to Egypt.

When I told the people closest to me that my biological father was Egyptian, none of them were surprised. I thought, how could they know this when I didn’t even know it myself? But I also remembered having fantasies when I was a child about being Egyptian, and truly, I felt that I had known, even before I had been told this was the truth. This path, though surprising, had been there inside me the whole time.

Return to the golden door

As an adult, there was a period of time when I didn’t visit the Palais de la Porte Dorée, not for any particular reason other than it was no longer local to me and life took me elsewhere. I then came back not that long ago with my business partner. I was once again very impressed by the bas-reliefs that cover the façade and sides of the building. They were designed by Alfred Auguste Janniot and they are truly monumental — covering 1,130 square metres of the building.

There are also two salons at each end of the building dedicated to Asia and Africa respectively. I was taking him around and wanted to point out all the features that had captured my imagination as a child — the warthog tusks door handles and the monumental frescos — and noticed that they were missing or in need of repair. I felt that it was my responsibility to give back to this place that had been so important to me as a child, which I’ve done by supporting the restoration of the two marvellous salons.

Now I’m really keen that more people know about it, so this is why I decided to put on my exhibition, L’Exhibition[niste] here. It’s in the east of Paris and not as visited as some of the major museums in the centre but I’m hoping to bring new people to the area so that they too can explore and enjoy the building like I did as a child.

When putting together the exhibition of my work to be shown at this museum, I chose objects with the curator that linked to my creative process. They might seem disparate — birds, dancers, Marilyn Monroe, cinema, sports, stain-glass, video art, photography, furniture, sculptures, popular ceramics, crosses, crowns — but there is a through-line. Sometimes you don’t realise where your inspiration comes from and the pieces might not seem to fit together but there is a connection, even if it only becomes apparent further down the road. This is the way I look at my life in general. I encourage everyone to stay open and embrace the unexpected.

Composer and songwriter AR Rahman will work with Expo 2020 Dubai to create a world-class music recording studio in the UAE. He has been announced as a mentor and a composer for the first project — Expo 2020’s new all-female orchestra.

Rahman will lead the Firdaus Women’s Orchestra, which is now the new Firdaus Studio by AR Rahman. The orchestra will bring together 50 talented women musicians from across the UAE and wider MENA region to create a unique musical project that will benefit from the state-of-the-art facility, which will serve as the orchestra’s rehearsal base. It aims to draw on inspiration from the UAE and region’s centuries-old rich musical traditions through instruments like the oud, rebaba and darbuka.

The orchestra is set to perform at the Expo 2020, including two AR Rahman concerts, a special show for International Women’s Day on March 8, 2021, plus a number of other events and performances across the site.

Rahman said, “This world-leading studio will attract the cream of the industry to Dubai.

209,03-3-20,CAC to shortlist candidates for selectors' job today,"The BCCI’s Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) will finally get down to the work of picking two national selectors at its first meeting here on Tuesday.

The three-member CAC, which is supposed to pick the selectors as per the BCCI constitution, has not had much to do since its appointment on January 31.

The committee comprising former India cricketers Madan Lal, R P Singh and Sulakshana Naik will be shortlisting the candidates for personal interviews.

Lal, who had earlier told that 44 applications have been received for two positions, confirmed on Monday that he will be travelling to Mumbai for the meeting.

“Yes, I will be going for the meeting but I don’t know the details yet,” he said.

However, a BCCI source confirmed that the meeting is scheduled to shortlist the candidates.

The CAC is looking for replacements of outgoing selection panel chief MSK Prasad and fellow panel member Gagan Khoda.

Ganguly, who did not travel to Dubai for the Asian Cricket Council meetings due to the rising threat of novel coronavirus, is likely to be present at the BCCI headquarters on Tuesday.

In January, the BCCI boss had said the new selection panel will pick the India squad for the home ODIs against South Africa, beginning in Dharamsala on March 12.

“There is still time for the South Africa series. The entire process for picking the new selectors will be done this week,” said a BCCI official.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/cac-to-shortlist-candidates-for-selectors--job-today.html
210,03-3-20,"Mir, Mansi win Bronze at Dutch Jr","Young Indian shuttlers Tasnim Mir and Mansi Singh won a Bronze medal each in the girls’ singles event at the Yonex Dutch Junior International 2020 in Haarlem, Netherlands.

It was the first time India won two Bronze medals in girls’ singles at this BWF Junior International Grand Prix tournament.

Mir put up a gritty show against the third seed So Yul Lee but it was not enough as the Korean pulled off a 19-21, 10-22 win in 36 minutes in the semifinals.

The 11th seeded Mir, Gold medallist at the Dubai International Series last year, has had a sensational run at this tournament and showed exceptional fighting spirit against higher-ranked players.

Mansi was the other Indian who stood out. She had won both the selection tournaments in the run-up to the Dutch International and carried that momentum to make it to the semifinals, where she lost to Indonesia’s Saifi Rizka Nurhidayah 11-21, 16-21.

Mansi had earlier toppled fifth seed Amy Tan 22-20, 21-14 in the third round.

The Indian contingent will now look to continue their heroics at the Yonex German Junior 2020 to be held in Berlin from March 4 to 8.

211,03-3-20,City consistency delights Pep,"Pep Guardiola hailed his Manchester City side’s desire to leave a lasting legacy after lifting a third straight League Cup by beating Aston Villa 2-1 at Wembley on Sunday thanks to goals from Sergio Aguero and Rodrigo.

City have now won eight of the last nine trophies on offer in English football under Guardiola, who has now won 29 trophies in his managerial career.

“(Since) we won the first title here against Arsenal in the League Cup we played 11 competitions and won eight. Is a lot,” said Guardiola.

“For this club it is not just about one title it is about showing every game we play counts and we want to win.

“Everybody knows we have the responsibility to fight, to try to win the titles. Eight out of 11 is something remarkable.”

After City sped into a 2-0 lead inside 30 minutes, Mbwana Samatta pulled a goal back for Villa, but their wait for the club's first silverware since 1996 goes on.“I'm disappointed. Everyone wrote us off, but there was a lot of belief in that dressing room,” said Villa boss Dean Smith.

“Unfortunately you have a mountain to climb against a team like Man City when you go 2-0 behind.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/city-consistency-delights-pep.html
212,03-3-20,"Saina, Ankita lead Fed Cup challenge","Ankita Raina’s red-hot form and Sania Mirza’s assuring presence will give India a much better shot at the Play-offs place when the six-team Fed Cup competition begins here today.

India will begin their campaign by locking horns with China today and are scheduled to clash with Uzbekistan (Wednesday), Korea (Thursday), Chinese Taipei (Friday) and Indonesia (Saturday) during the week.

Ankita has been in tremendous form since the start of the season, winning two ITF singles and as many doubles titles.

She is placed at a career-best 160 in the singles ranking chart but during the Fed Cup the gritty Ankita has always punched above her weight, giving tough times to formidable opponents.

She would be captain Vishal Uppal’s biggest weapon apart from multiple-time doubles Grand Slam champion Sania, who is returning to Fed Cup after four years.

The three-week delay in the start of the tournament due to Coronavirus outbreak has given Sania a chance to recover from her calf injury which had forced her to retire mid-way from her Australian Open women’s doubles opener.

Her experience of playing and winning at the big stage will help younger players in the side in handling the pressure situations better.

“I had a good start to the season, so I am confident going into the competition. And definitely Sania will inspire all of us to give our best. Her advise and tips will be more than helpful,” admitted Ankita.

Riya Bhatia rose in the ranks and her new-found confidence will be good for India’s chances. Karman Kaur Thandi has slipped in rankings after an injury and it will be an opportunity for the tall Delhi girl to not only regain her confidence but also help the team qualify for the next stage.

India had finished fourth at the Asia/Oceania Group I event but this year they have a realistic chance to make it to top-two.

With three top-50 players, China will test Indian players the most in the Asia/Oceania Group I competition, where the top two teams will be promoted to the Play-offs, to be held on April 17-18.

Qiang Wang (ranked 29), Saisai Zheng (34) and Shuai Zhang (35) make a formidable trio in the Chinese side, which missed out on promotion last year after losing 1-2 to hosts Kazakhstan.

Another side which may trouble India would be Chinese Taipei, who have Su-Wei Hsieh in their ranks.

It should not be problem for India to handle the challenge of Indonesia and Uzbekistan, though Korea have some good players.

“Yes, we have a very realistic chance of qualifying. The team is upbeat and hungry and with Sania in the squad it makes us stronger in doubles which has bolstered our chances,” Uppal said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/saina--ankita-lead-fed-cup-challenge.html
213,03-3-20,Klopp to beef up FA Cup side,"Jurgen Klopp said he would name a more senior side for Liverpool’s FA Cup trip to Chelsea today after relying on the club’s talented youngsters to make it to the fifth round.

Klopp left under-23 coach Neil Critchley, who was named Blackpool manager on Monday, in charge for a 1-0 fourth-round replay win over Shrewsbury, while Klopp and his senior players enjoyed a two-week winter break.

However, the layoff has done Liverpool little good in recent weeks. They returned rusty and lost for the first time in 45 Premier League games at Watford on Saturday, beaten 3-0.

Klopp could still rest a number of key players at Stamford Bridge but pointed to a 2-2 draw at Shrewsbury that forced the replay in January as indicative of his plans.

Adrian, Dejan Lovren, Joel Matip, Fabinho and Divock Origi all started that game, while Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain came off the bench.

“It didn’t destruct us, it’s just the situation,” Klopp said at his pre-match press conference on Monday, referring to the Watford defeat. “Nobody can tell us how to deal in the best way with runs like this because not a lot of teams had it.

“I was not happy with the performance but I was always clear there will be a moment when it can happen. Now it happened, that’s how it is, nothing else.

“It’s a different situation like it was in the last round. If you see the Shrewsbury team at Shrewsbury that was a FA Cup team for us in the moment we thought would make sense.

“It will not be the same team that played the second game against Shrewsbury.”

Chelsea are also desperate for a cup pick-me-up as they were thrashed 3-0 at home by Bayern Munich in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie and have won just five of their past 16 Premier League games.

The faltering form of the chasing pack behind them means Frank Lampard’s men are still clinging onto fourth place in the Premier League and Klopp insisted the former England midfielder is still doing a fine job in his first full season at Stamford Bridge.

“The way they go is really promising and Frank is doing an incredible job, but for all managers and especially Frank, he was a very successful player, to deal with defeats is the biggest challenge,” added Klopp.

“The fight for the Champions League means you have to beat three or four teams with similar circumstances, similar opportunities in a really long and demanding season. That’s not so easy.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/klopp-to-beef-up-fa-cup-side.html
214,03-3-20,Madrid take Clasico honours,"Real Madrid won the Clasico and might have saved their season as they ended their slump in the best way possible on Sunday by beating Barcelona 2-0 and returning to the top of La Liga.

Vinicius Junior’s deflected finish and a stoppage-time goal from Mariano Diaz decided a frenzied contest at the Santiago Bernabeu, where Madrid found new life after a Champions League defeat by Manchester City had left them on the brink of crisis.

“It’s been a tough week,” said Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane. “We talked about how we had an opportunity this weekend and we took it.”

Victory put them one point clear at the top of the table and shifts focus back to Quique Setien’s Barcelona, who were outfought and, at times, outplayed.

“The reality is we lost a lot of confidence with the ball,” said Setien. “We entered a nervous spell and that’s when the goal came.”

Lionel Messi’s rasping shot was saved by Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois in the first half but it was the Argentine’s opposing captain, Sergio Ramos, who was thrashing his arms in celebration after the final whistle.

His reaction was an indication of the importance of this victory, not only for the effect it has on the standings but on the dynamic of the title race, which had seemed to be switching firmly in favour of Barca.

Opportunity missed

Cristiano Ronaldo, now of Juventus, was watching from an executive box and Madrid could have done with him during a period in which they had won only one of their last five games.

Zidane said on Saturday this match would not decide who lifted the trophy in May but a Barca win and a five-point gap might well have been difficult to close.

Yet from the start Barcelona seemed keener to kill the game than win it, playing for time in the hope of keeping the contest tight, when they might have been better off attacking their opponents’ fragility.

“The Madrid we faced in the first half was one of the worst Madrids I have faced at the Bernabeu,” said Gerard Pique.

“I don’t say it as a criticism, we also have our problems, but we’ve missed an opportunity.”

There was more tension than creativity in the early stages as Fede Valverde crashed into Arthur Melo before fellow Spain full-backs Dani Carvajal and Jordi Alba were both booked after a disagreement.

Madrid had the better of the play and regularly broke at speed through Vinicius down the left but constantly they failed to make the final pass, with Isco once left with his head in his hands after Marcelo opted not to pull the ball back.

But Madrid remained in the ascendancy and in the 71st minute they took the lead. Benzema came short and pointed right to encourage Vinicius to run in behind. Kroos found him and Vinicius’s shot deflected off the sliding Pique to beat Ter Stegen at his near post.

The game opened up as Barcelona chased an equaliser. Marcelo celebrated when Messi’s surge through was stopped by Raphael Varane. Pique headed Messi’s cross over at the near post. Messi picked up a yellow card for a frustrated slide on Casemiro.

In injury time, Ter Stegen ventured up for a late free-kick but it was Madrid that struck again. Mariano sped past Semedo and finished from the angle.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/madrid-take-clasico-honours-2020-03-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/madrid-take-clasico-honours.html
215,03-3-20,Harika starts with draw in FIDE Women's Grand Prix,"India's number two Dronavalli Harika started her campaign in the FIDE Women's Grand Prix here with a draw against Swedish veteran Pia Cramling in the first round.

The strong tournament featuring 12 players including world champion Ju Wenjun (China) is the third in the series of four Grands Prix from which two with the highest points tally would qualify for the next candidates event.

India's world No.2 Koneru Humpy leads the Grand Prix standings after two events with 293 points while Grandmaster Harika is joint fifth with Wenjun (120 points, 1 event).

On a day of draws, the 29-year old Harika, the world No.9, held the former world number from Sweden to a draw in 37 moves late on Monday.

Wenjun is the highest rated player in the event while Harika is the fifth-seed. The Chinese world champion shared the point with Zhansaya Abdumalik of Kazakhstan, who came in as a replacement for Zhao Xue.

In another game, the Muzychuk sisters from Ukraine-Mariya and Anna, signed the peace treaty in just 16 moves.

Harika meets Frenchwoman Marie Sebag in the second round later on Tuesday.

Results: Round 1: Alexandra Goryachkina (RUS) drew with Alina Kashlinskaya (RUS); Alexandra Kosteniuk (RUS) drew with Nana Dzagnidze (GEO); Ju Wenjun (CHN) drew with Zhansaya Abdumalik (KAZ); D Harika (IND) drew with Pia Cramling (SWE); Anotaneta Stefanova (BUL) drew with Marie Sebag (FRA); Anna Muzychuk (UKR) drew with Mariya Muzychuk (UKR).",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/harika-starts-with-draw-in-fide-women-s-grand-prix-2020-03-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/harika-starts-with-draw-in-fide-women-s-grand-prix.html
216,03-3-20,Kohli indicates 'mini transition' of pace unit in near future,"The Indian pace bowlers aren't getting any younger and team's think-tank realises the need to get the next crop of speed merchants ready in the near future, said skipper Virat Kohli.

While Jasprit Bumrah is expected to lead the pace pack for many more years, Ishant Sharma, who will be 32 this year and Mohammed Shami (29) have already reached the peak of their prowess. Not to forget, Umesh Yadav will turn 33 this year.

""These guys are not getting any younger so we need to be very careful and very aware and accept that these are situations that can potentially come up and have guys who can replace them and ready up and running as soon as possible,"" skipper Kohli didn't hide what's in store in the next few years.

Ishant's poorly handled rehabilitation which saw a recurrence of ankle tear and the kind of workload that Shami has taken in the past two years, is an indicator that may be in another two years, this team has to be ready for transition in the pace department.

""From the point of view of the larger picture, we do need to recognise who are the next three-four guys that can keep the standard up because you don't want to feel a void suddenly if a couple of guys miss out,"" Kohli gave enough indications that they are zeroing in new talents with an eye on future.

With Indian team's packed schedule across formats, Kohli said that it's inhuman to ""squeeze the life out of individuals"".

""That's what happens in cricket. Mini transitions happen every now and then, and you need to be aware of them. You can't squeeze the life out of individuals, and when they are done, you have no back-up. I think we as a side are pretty aware that these things are quite possible,"" Kohli said.

Navdeep Saini is already a part of the set-up and there are two or three more names in the pipeline, the skipper said.

""Saini is one who has come into the system. We have two-three more that we have an eye on. We need to be very careful and we need to understand that this is one factor that has got us a lot of success and we need to make sure that standards are kept high,” the skipper said.

The kind of success that trio of Yadav, Ishant and Shami (Bumrah excluded) have got over years, Kohli wants men who can replicate their success.

""We recognise and understand guys who can do a similar job potentially as well as these, Umesh included.""

While Kohli didn't name any other fast bowlers but the potential ones in the pecking order for red ball cricket include Mohammed Siraj of Hyderabad, Sandeep Warrier of Kerala, Avesh Khan of Madhya Pradesh and Ishant Porel of Bengal.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kohli-indicates--mini-transition--of-pace-unit-in-near-future-2020-03-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kohli-indicates--mini-transition--of-pace-unit-in-near-future.html
217,03-3-20,Kohli irked when asked about his celebration of Kane’s dismissal,"India captain Virat Kohli on Monday got annoyed after being asked about his animated celebrations over Kane Williamson’s dismissal on day two of the second Test before clarifying that match referee Ranjan Madugalle had no issues with what happened.

Following India’s loss, one of the local journalists sought Kohli’s reaction on allegedly swearing at Williamson and that did not go down well with the away team captain.

“What do you think? I am asking you the answer,” the irritation was writ large on Indian skipper’s face as he came up with a sharp retort.

“You need to find out an answer and come up with a better question. You can’t come here with half questions and half details of what happened. Also if you want to create controversy, this is not the right place. I spoke with the match referee (Madugalle) and he had no issues with what happened,” said Kohli.

It was on day two when Williamson was dismissed by Jasprit Bumrah and Kohli was animated as ever in his celebrations.

218,03-3-20,"We were completely outplayed, can’t live in denial: Kohli","A disappointed Virat Kohli on Monday admitted that his side was “completely outplayed” by New Zealand in the two-Test series and they can’t live in denial about “not being brave enough” to counter adverse conditions.

The Indian batting was in complete shambles in the series and the skipper said that with a packed schedule, the team management will have to find solutions despite time constraints.

“Obviously quite disappointed with how we played in this series. I feel like we were completely outplayed in this series,” the Indian captain was honest and forthright in his assessment following the seven-wicket loss.

“We obviously didn’t play the kind of cricket we do as a team. The thing to take away from here is to not shy away from things that have gone wrong and instead address them straight up, and not be in denial,” he said.

Asked to point out what exactly went wrong, Kohli felt the outlook towards a series in adverse conditions was “not ideal”.

“I think the outlook as far as I am concerned, and as far as I saw things happening, was not ideal for us in this series. We were not positive enough. We were not brave enough in moments, which we have done in the past. Skills follow your mindset, simple as that.”

However, he didn’t like New Zealand being called India’s “bogey team”, having lost to the Black Caps in 2019 World Cup semifinal and two series in white and red ball formats.

“I am sure no one was saying that in first half of the tour,” he said referring to his team’s 5-0 win in the T20 series.

“You can’t just make a team a bogey team because of one Test series defeat and a semi-final loss. They played better cricket on that day, and in this Test series, and there is no shame in accepting that.

“We are not trying to create some controversy by tagging a team or naming a bogey team or something like that,” the skipper certainly wasn’t amused.

Asked about specific mistakes that this team can rectify, Kohli said that clarity of mind is paramount.

“Something (clarity) we failed to do as a batting unit, and I truly believe that we made too much of the conditions from the first day onwards, of the first Test: overcast, a bit of dampness on the pitch — we never spoke of these things before.

“If you’re not clear in your head then the feet don’t move, you’re not quite sure whether to play the shot or not, leave the ball or play the ball. I think these sort of things can creep in, and which have crept in our game in this series. It’s something we have recognised already,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/we-were-completely-outplayed--can---t-live-in-denial--kohli.html
219,03-3-20,"Lock, Stock & Barrel","A star-studded India was outplayed by seven wickets inside three days in the second Test against New Zealand here with the home team making a mockery of the visitors’ world No 1 status to complete a memorable series sweep.

New Zealand prevailed by seven wickets, chasing down a modest target of 132 in just 36 overs, after India’s second innings folded for 124 in less than an hour on the third day. India, perched at the top of the World Test Championships right now, were humiliated 0-2, found wanting yet again when up against high-quality seamers overseas.

Tom Latham (52 off 74 balls) and Tom Blundell (55 off 113 balls) had a good batting session as Mohammed Shami didn’t bowl post lunch due to a ball-impact injury while batting.

A solid 120 points took New Zealand’s tally to 180 even as India stayed on top with 360 points courtesy their series wins against the lowly West Indies, depleted South Africa and a below-par Bangladesh.

The feel good factor of a 5-0 T20 series victory seemed like ancient history as a dream start turned into a virtual nightmare for Kohli’s bunch that has always taken immense pride in performing well in overseas conditions.

However, a look at India’s overseas performance indicates that whenever the ball swings and seams, reputations end up in tatters. It happened in England in 2014 and 2018 and now New Zealand have exposed them one more time.

The main culprit was the batsmen, and Kohli had no qualms in admitting it.

“The batsmen didn’t do enough for the bowlers to try and attack. The bowling was good, I thought even in Wellington we bowled well. Sometimes if you bowl well and things don’t happen, you have to take it in your stride,” Kohli said.

More than the margin, the manner of surrender will come back to haunt the current Indian team, which leaves this part of the world with a lot of unanswered questions.

It’s not only about technique of some top players against the moving deliveries but also about their mindset when put under the pump.

There were only four half-centuries across four innings in this series with techniques of some of the players like Ajinkya Rahane, Mayank Agarwal against seam and swing leaving a lot to be desired.

Skipper Kohli’s 38 runs in four innings was one of the biggest setbacks for the visitors in the series.

Prithvi Shaw is a work in progress when it comes to his decision-making on deliveries on the fourth stump and, of course, the short ball, which the Kiwis used liberally to get rid of him since the start of the practice games.

Kohli’s problems against the seaming deliveries resurfaced again during the series but there is little time to go back to the drawing board with a packed schedule for the remaining part of the year.

On Monday, there was another lower-order collapse as the last four wickets went for 34 runs, but lack of gumption from someone like Rishabh Pant, playing for his place in the side, was disheartening.

It was the pair of Tim Southee (3/36 in 11 overs) and Trent Boult (4/28 in 14 overs), which once again tormented the Indian batsmen, who were all at sea against quality bowling on a slightly challenging track.

In the morning, Hanuma Vihari (9) was caught down the leg-side off an innocuous Southee delivery.

On a track where it was next to impossible to defend, Pant was seen pushing and prodding defensively, something that’s not his natural game. The result was a half-hearted poke at an away going delivery that safely landed in the wicketkeeper’s gloves.

The much talked-about “intent” was completely missing in Pant’s game and his approach defied logic. Especially after coach Ravi Shastri spoke about how his aggressive batting scored over Wriddhiman Saha, but questions will certainly be asked on if scores of 19, 25, 12 and 4 justify his inclusion over a more accomplished stumper.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/lock--stock---barrel.html
220,03-3-20,Panghal gets top billing in Asian Oly Qualifiers,"World Silver-medallist Amit Panghal (52kg) has been given the top billing in the men’s competition while the iconic M C Mary Kom (51kg) seeded second in the women’s event of the Asian Olympic Qualifiers for boxing starting here today.

Eight men and five women from India will be aiming to secure Tokyo Olympics berths at the continental event being conducted by the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) Boxing Task Force.

While Panghal is the lone Indian man to be seeded, two-time world Bronze-medallist Lovlina Borgohain (69kg) and Pooja Rani (75kg) have been seeded second and fourth respectively in the women’s competition.

The Indian team arrived in Jordan on Friday last week after a training stint in Assisi, Italy.

“Everything is fine here. The team is in high spirits and we are looking forward to a strong performance,” Indian boxing’s High Performance Director Santiago Nieva said.

“We have worked on some areas to ensure that our opponents do not stand a chance,” he asserted.

The tournament has 63 quota places on offer and a boxer will be assured for a Tokyo ticket on reaching the semifinals stage.

In some weight categories, depending on the size of the draw, there could be box-offs between losing quarterfinalists to decide the Olympic berths.

The Indian hopes will be spearheaded by Panghal and Mary Kom, both proven and consistent performers on the big stage.

Panghal became the first Indian male boxer to claim a world Silver medal in September last year, while Mary Kom collected a record-shattering eighth world medal a month later in the same year.

Expectations will also be high from Borgohain, who has been rising up the ranks with some strong performances, including back-to-back world Bronze medals. Also, national champion Simranjit Kaur (60kg) can be considered among the contenders after having beaten veteran Sarita Devi in the trials.

Among the men, Commonwealth Games Silver-medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) is a strong contender to book a Tokyo spot along with Panghal.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/panghal-gets-top-billing-in-asian-oly-qualifiers.html
221,03-3-20,Sumit Sangwan’s doping ban lifted,"The one-year doping ban on former Asian silver medal-winning boxer Sumit Sangwan (91kg) was on Monday lifted after the National Anti-Doping Agency's (NADA) appeals panel ruled that his intake of a banned substance was unintentional.

Sangwan was cleared after a hearing conducted here on Monday.

""Sumit has been cleared and his ban lifted as he has convinced the NADA panel that the diuretic he tested positive for was a case of unintentional intake,"" a Boxing Federation of India official told PTI.

Sangwan was banned for a year in December 2019 after testing positive for Acetazolamide, listed as a diuretic and masking agent under World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) 2019 Prohibited List.

""I am relieved, a huge weight is off my shoulders. I knew I wasn't in the wrong. I am glad I could prove myself,"" an emotional Sangwan said.

""I convinced the NADA panel of my innocence by submitting some medical reports, which I had not presented in the first hearing when the ban was imposed on me,"" he added.

The 27-year-old international medallist said medical records showing the enlargement of his liver following the intake of the medicine helped him prove his case.

""The doctors in the panel agreed that the presence of the substance in my system at the time of testing despite me taking the medicine much earlier was because an enlarged liver had prevented it getting flushed out in the normal course of seven days,"" he explained.

""It (Acetazolamide) showed in my system 13 days after the intake which led to the earlier conclusion that I had taken it at the time of weigh-in at the national camp,"" he added.

Sangwan had maintained, from the very beginning, that it was a case of unintentional intake as he had duly consulted a doctor before taking the medication for an eye infection.

""I was in so much pain when medicines were given to me that I couldn't even open my eyes at that time. I couldn't have possibly known what was being given to me. I relied on the doctors who were treating me,"" he said.

The suspension cost Sangwan dearly as the 2012 Olympian missed out on appearing for trials for the Olympic Qualifying Tournament, which begins in Amman (Jordan) on Tuesday.

""I will write to the federation and ask them to reinstate me in the national camp based on my record. I was the national champion when this happened, I should be allowed to be back (in the national camp) and I am confident I will be,"" he said.

Sangwan's sample was collected ""out of competition"" on October 10.

""I have suffered a lot. To live with a blemish like that on your record is a huge mental agony. I hope to put this all behind me and find my way back to the top,"" Sangwan said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sumit-sangwan---s-doping-ban-lifted.html
222,03-3-20,Wilder to face Fury for another rematch in July,"Tyson Fury and dethroned world champion Deontay Wilder will stage the next leg of their fight trilogy in July at the Las Vegas venue where their rematch took place.

Wilder officially exercised his right to another fight against Fury and plan is to have it on July 18 at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, US media reported Sunday night. ""We received a letter from Wilder's team on Friday night, and we agreed with the networks and the hotel that July 18 was the optimal date,"" promoter Bob Arum told the Los Angeles Times newspaper.

""We had a seamless promotion last time with Al Haymon, PBC (Premier Boxing Champions) and Fox. We look forward to working with them again.""

The news comes a little over a week after Britain's Fury stopped Wilder in the seventh round of their heavyweight title rematch in Las Vegas.

Despite clamor for a unification fight between Fury and fellow Briton Anthony Joshua, Wilder had been expected to exercise his contractual right for a rematch.

Wilder also said this week that he would keep co-trainer Mark Breland in his corner, despite earlier hints that he was ready to part company with Breland, who threw in the towel in the seventh round of the loss to Fury.

Breland, a former Olympic and world champion, called a halt to the rematch at the MGM Grand Garden Arena after Wilder had been knocked down twice by Fury.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/wilder-to-face-fury-for-another-rematch-in-july.html
223,03-3-20,Lampard to look at goalkeeper options at end of season,"Chelsea manager Frank Lampard said on Monday he would reassess his goalkeeping options at the end of the season after dropping the world’s most expensive goalkeeper, Kepa Arrizabalaga, in recent weeks.

The Spanish international has fallen behind 38-year-old Willy Caballero after a series of poor performances in his second season after a £72 million ($92 million) move from Athletic Bilbao.

“Of course in the summer then we look at the group as a whole and think how can we improve but there are no decisions or thoughts beyond the game tomorrow night as far as I'm concerned,” Lampard said.

Kepa could return to face the runaway Premier League leaders at Stamford Bridge and Lampard praised his response to being dropped for the past five games.

“He’s been professional as expected and has trained well, kept his head down, supported the team, and the group,” added Lampard.

“Every player is in control of their destiny in terms of how they train and how they play.

“This is Chelsea and we’re trying to close the gap to the top, so there can be no one that can be relaxed or loose, we have to push every day.”

Lampard will again be without the injured Tammy Abraham and Christian Pulisic for the visit of Liverpool but hopes to have both back in the near future to aid Chelsea’s challenge for a top-four finish in the Premier League.

“It’s certainly frustrating for them, particularly Christian, who has had a big phase out now and is desperate to get back,” said Lampard.

“I’m hoping they might be fit over the next week or two. I just can’t say that with clarity because they’ve both had their issues.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/lampard-to-look-at-goalkeeper-options-at-----end-of-season.html

Hardik was at his brutal best as he hit eight fours and 10 huge sixes en route his blitzkrieg as Reliance 1 posted 252/5 in 20 overs. After the innings, Hardik said he is happy with the way he is shaping up after being away from the game for almost six months.

""It's fantastic (platform) for someone like me. I have been away for almost six months. This is my second game after a long time. For me it is a good platform to see where I am currently and test my body. I am really happy with the way things have gone,"" Hardik said on DY Patil Sports Academy Facebook page.

On his big-hitting prowess, the 26-year old added: ""If it's there in my arc I just back myself and go for it. Most of the times, it comes out pretty well. There is no plan that I am going to go out there and smash it.""

Pandya showed his all-round skills with a knock of 38 off 25 balls to help his side post 150 for eight in their 20 overs in the first match as well.

Pandya underwent a surgery after suffering a lower-back injury five months ago and has since been on a road to recovery. He could not be fit in time for the New Zealand tour but started bowling at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru after returning from a check-up in UK.

227,03-3-20,UN rights chief files intervention application in SC on CAA,"The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the citizenship amendment law, in an unprecedented move which was sharply criticised by India.

External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said the Citizenship Amendment Act is an internal matter of India and that ""no foreign party"" has any locus standi on issues pertaining to the country's sovereignty.

India's Permanent Mission in Geneva was informed on Monday evening by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet that her office has filed an ""intervention application"" in the Supreme Court on the amended citizenship law, he said.

The Supreme Court is hearing a batch of pleas challenging the new law.

""The CAA is an internal matter of India and concerns the sovereign right of the Indian Parliament to make laws. We strongly believe that no foreign party has any locus standi on issues pertaining to India's sovereignty,"" Kumar said.

He said the CAA is constitutionally valid and complies with all requirements of its constitutional values.

""It is reflective of our long standing national commitment in respect of human rights issues arising from the tragedy of the Partition of India,"" he said.

""India is a democratic country governed by the rule of law. We all have utmost respect for and full trust in our independent judiciary. We are confident that our sound and legally sustainable position will be vindicated by the Supreme Court,"" the MEA spokesperson said.

When asked whether OHCHR can approach the Supreme Court, an official familiar with the matter said it was for the apex court to decide.

India witnessed massive protests in the last two months over the new law with the opposition parties and rights groups terming it as violative of founding principles of Indian Constitution.

Rejecting the criticism, the government has been accusing the opposition parties of misleading people on the law for political gains.

The CAA, which was notified on January 10, grants Indian citizenship to non-Muslim minorities -- Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian -- who migrated to India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh till December 31, 2014, following persecution over their faith.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/un-rights-chief-files-intervention-application-in-sc-on-caa-2020-03-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/un-rights-chief-files-intervention-application-in-sc-on-caa.html

229,03-3-20,Poll affidavit case: SC dismisses plea of Devendra Fadnavis seeking review of 2019 verdict,"In a setback to former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, the Supreme Court dismissed his plea seeking review of its 2019 verdict asking him to face trial for allegedly failing to furnish details of two pending criminal cases against him in his 2014 poll affidavit.

A three-judge bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said that there was no ground to review the verdict pronounced last year.

""We find no ground to interfere in the review petitions. The same are dismissed,"" said the bench also comprising justices Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose.

The order was passed on February 18 but it was uploaded on the apex court website on Tuesday.

While seeking review of the 2019 verdict, Fadnavis had told the court that there was a ""clear error"" in the apex court's judgement as the law stipulates for disclosure of details about criminal cases only if charges are framed and on conviction.

In its October 1, 2019 judgment, the apex court had set aside a Bombay High Court order which gave a clean chit to Fadnavis and held that he did not deserve to be tried for the alleged offence under the Representation of Peoples Act (RPA).

The verdict had come on an appeal by one Satish Ukey, who had challenged the high court's order.

The apex court had last year revived a criminal complaint filed against Fadnavis for allegedly failing to furnish details of two pending criminal cases in his 2014 election affidavit and had asked the trial court to consider it afresh.

The top court had allowed the appeal by Ukey, who had filed a criminal complaint against Fadnavis before a magisterial court in Nagpur, seeking registration of a case against him under section 125-A of the RP Act.

Section 125-A of the RP Act deals with the penalty for ""filing false affidavit"" and says that if a candidate or his proposer fails to furnish or gives false or conceals any information in his nomination paper on issues like pending criminal cases then the person may be awarded six months' jail term or fine or both.

Ukey had initially moved a magisterial court, which had dismissed his complaint against Fadnavis on September 7, 2015.

Later, he moved the sessions court, which remanded the matter to the magisterial court for a ""de novo"" (afresh) consideration.

Aggrieved by the sessions court order, Fadnavis had moved the high court which, on May 3, 2018, set it aside.

Ukey alleged that Fadnavis had failed to disclose the pendency of two criminal cases against him in his election affidavit filed in 2014.

The two complaints of alleged cheating and forgery were filed against Fadnavis in 1996 and 1998 but charges were not framed.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/poll-affidavit-case--sc-dismisses-plea-of-devendra-fadnavis-seeking-review-of-2019-verdict-2020-03-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/poll-affidavit-case--sc-dismisses-plea-of-devendra-fadnavis-seeking-review-of-2019-verdict.html

The legislator from Delhi, who is in Goa to strengthen Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) base, said the party wants to emerge as an alternative to the Congress and the BJP and win the 2022 Assembly elections in the coastal state.

The party has not shut its doors for ""good people"" from other political parties, she said.

""We have always said our doors are open for good people from other political parties. It would be arrogant to say good people are there only in AAP,"" the MLA from south Delhi's Kalkaji seat told PTI on Monday.

""There are lot of good people in other political parties also, there are good people who have often found they are not happy with the culture that exists in their political party,"" she said.

Atishi said her party has been very clear about its criteria of inducting leaders and workers.

""We will never have someone who has the background of being corrupt, criminal or communal. We are open to leaders and volunteers from other political parties, those who have fought for people's issues,"" she said.

The AAP leader also said there are lessons to be learnt from the party's defeat in the 2017 Goa Assembly polls.

""From the Goa experience, what we learnt is that we didnot have a grassroot organisation during the 2017 polls. The party's campaign was talked about and there was public support. But, as we did not have a grassroot organisation, we could not build on the support,"" she said.

In 2017, the AAP contested 39 out of the total 40 Assembly constituencies in Goa, but it did not win a single seat and its candidates lost deposits in majority of the seats.

""We don't think it was a mistake to contest 39 seats. We wanted to pass on the party's message to everyone. A political party is the voice of people.

241,03-3-20,Coronavirus rises like phoenix in India,"One fresh case each in Delhi, Jaipur, Telangana after all 3 earlier patients in Kerala recuperated

Days after three coronavirus-infected patients walked out of a Kerala hospital completely cured, three new positive cases of the deadly virus were reported on Tuesday — one each in Delhi, Telangana and Jaipur.

Giving details of the fresh cases, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said the person from Delhi had travelled to Italy, while the other patient who has tested positive for the coronavirus infection in Telangana had recently travelled to Dubai.

The Telangana man is undergoing treatment in an isolation ward at a hospital in Hyderabad, while Delhi man is being treated in a hospital in Delhi. “Both the patients had self-reported after they developed symptoms. They tested positive. They are stable and being closely monitored,” he told reporters.

The person in Delhi had reported at the RML hospital after returning to India while the one in Telangana had initially gone to a private medical facility and then was referred to a Government hospital in the State, the Minister said.

Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma said an Italian tourist has been found positive of coronavirus in Jaipur. He is being treated at Jaipur’s SMS Hospital.

In the first sample collected on February 29, the man was tested negative but his condition deteriorated so the second sample was collected which tested positive on Monday, the Minister said, adding, “since there is a variation in the reports, samples have been sent to NIV-Pune for testing.”

Talking to reporters here after the meeting of the Group of Ministers on the disease, Dr Harsh Vardhan said the Indian Government is in discussion with Iran and Italian authorities to evacuate Indians there.

“Indian citizens need to avoid non-essential travel to Singapore, Republic of Korea, Iran and Italy. People coming from Republic of Korea, Iran and Italy or having such travel history since February 10, 2020 may be quarantined for 14 days on arrival in India,” he said. Universal screening is being done for the travellers from 12 countries for all the flights from China, Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, Nepal, Indonesia, Iran and Italy at the earmarked aero-bridges.

As many as 25,738 people are under community surveillance across the country while thirty seven people across the country are currently hospitalised after showing symptoms of COVID-19.

Asked if there could be a drug shortage in the country as around 70 per cent of the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) come from China, Vardhan said he has spoken to the Minister in-charge who has informed that “we are adequately prepared to deal with the situation as of now”.

Vardhan said around 1,086 people who returned from Iran in recent times have been recommended for community surveillance.

Earlier, three students from Kerala, who had confirmed to have the virus, were discharged from hospital after they recovered and tested negative for the pathogen. The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday raised its global risk assessment of the new coronavirus to its highest level after the epidemic spread to sub-Saharan Africa and financial markets slumped.

The WHO said the virus appears to particularly hit those over the age of 60 and people already weakened by other illness.

The deadly virus, first detected in China in December last year, has spread to more than 60 countries and infected more than 88,000 people. China has so far witnessed 2,912 deaths due to coronavirus while the total global death toll from the outbreak crossed 3,000 on Monday.

The detection of the fresh cases spooked the stock market which squandered away the gain of nearly 800 Sensex points to crash by nearly 800 points before staging a recovery and closing 900 point from the day high.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus-rises-like-phoenix-in-india-2020-03-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/coronavirus-rises-like-phoenix-in-india.html
242,03-3-20,"BJP, Cong MPs shove each other as Opp insists on Shah’s resignation","The BJP and the Congress members pushed and shoved each other in the Lok Sabha on Monday as a slogan-shouting Opposition demanded the resignation of Union Home Minister Amit Shah over his alleged failure to check communal violence in Delhi.

Speaker Om Birla suspended House proceedings thrice before adjourning it for the day. MPs from both sides complained to the Speaker over their alleged manhandling inside the House.

The Rajya Sabha too was adjourned with Opposition members accusing the Government of “sleeping” while the national Capital burnt in communal riots.

Amid heated exchanges in the Lok Sabha, some women members insisted their alleged manhandling was on account of their being Dalits, and lodged complained to the Speaker.

Congress member Ramya Haridas lodged a complain that she was assaulted by a BJP woman MP inside the Lower House and sought immediate action over the matter.

“On March 2, at 3 pm, inside Lok Sabha, I was physically assaulted by MP Jaskaur Meena (BJP parliamentarian from Rajasthan),” Haridas said in her complaint.

In her complaint to Birla, she asked if such things were repeatedly happening to her because she was a Dalit and a woman. She sought action against Meena who incidentally also comes from Dalit background.

Meena dismissed the allegations as false. “As she opened the banner in Lok Sabha, it hit me on my head. I asked her to move ahead. I didn’t hit or push her. If she says she is using ‘Dalit’ word, then I’m also a Dalit woman,” she said.

During the Winter Session last year, the Congress had alleged that two of its women parliamentarians, including Haridas, were “manhandled” by marshals in the Lok Sabha when they were protesting in the Well of the House over the Maharashtra Government formation. Both the MPs had lodged a complaint with Speaker Birla.

Union Minister Smriti Irani alleged that Congress MPs in Lok Sabha misbehaved with BJP women members, who also complained to the Speaker against some Opposition party lawmakers.

“Congress MPs misbehaved with BJP women MPs in the Lok Sabha. I would appeal to the Speaker (Om Birla) to take the strongest possible action against them,” Irani told reporters outside Parliament.

“For the past two to three sessions ‘goonda’ elements of the Congress are disrupting Parliament proceedings,” she said, adding that the action of Congress members in Parliament shows the desperation of the Gandhi family.”

The mood in the Lower House was set with the word go as Congress members stormed the Well shouting slogans against Shah and demanding that he steps down for allegedly not taking timely action against rioters in Delhi.

In turn the treasury side accused senior Congress leaders of inciting violence by their provocative statements.

Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu said the issue was definitely important, but the priority should be to restore normalcy and then discuss ways and means of preventing it. The House was adjourned till 2 pm.

As the Upper House re-assembled at 2 pm Opposition MPs including those belonging to the Congress, AAP, Left, TMC, SP, BSP and DMK were up on their feet with several shouting slogans and accusing the Government of failing in its duty in controlling violence which has so far claimed 47 lives in North-East Delhi. The House was thereafter adjourned for the day.

The Lok Sabha witnessed dramatic events when it resumed proceedings at 2 pm with the BJP and the Congress members pushing and shoving each others. .

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi condemned their “unruly behaviour” and asked the Speaker to continue with proceedings.

Joshi alleged that “these are the people who have provoked the riots. They murdered 3,000 people in 1984 (riots) and did no investigation. The priority is to restore peace... But they want to create tension.”

Seeking to restore normalcy in the House, Birla asked Opposition members who were in the Well to take their seats even as they continued to shout “we want justice” and “Amit Shah Murdabad” (Down with Amit Shah).

They were also holding placards saying “stop hate speech, save our India”.

The verbal clash seemed to turn physical as Congress’ Gaurav Gogoi and Ravneet Singh Bittu holding the black banner went to the Treasury benches where BJP’s Sanjay Jaiswal was speaking on ‘Vivaad Se Vishwas’ Bill and criticising Congress and its leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi.

BJP members, including Ramesh Bidhuri and Nishikant Dubey, asked Congress MPs to return to the Well.

Some Congress members tore papers and hurled them in the air that further provoked BJP MPs with many rushing towards the Congress benches .

Members from both sides then began pushing and shoving each other following which the proceedings were adjourned till 3 pm by the Speaker.

Union Ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and Smriti Irani were seen trying to pacify the agitated members.

Congress president Sonia and party leader Rahul were present in the House during the uproar.

When the House reassembled at 3 pm, some BJP members were seen blocking the way to their side of the Well. Congress member Ramya Haridas complained about being manhandled by BJP members.

BJP’s Rama Devi, who was in the Chair, adjourned the House again till 4 pm saying “whatever you have done is wrong”.

But the ruckus continued when the House again met and it was adjourned till 4.30 pm by the Chair.

However, the slogan-shouting by the BJP members continued even after the adjournment.

They chanted slogans like “Desh ki raksha kaun karega, hum karenge hum karenge (Who will defend the nation, we will do it)” and “Mahatma Gandhi amar rahein, nakli Gandhi jail mein rahein (Long live Mahatma Gandhi, fake Gandhis stay in jail)”.

Some Opposition members placed a placard demanding Shah’s resignation on the Speaker’s table but it was swiftly removed by the staff.

The Lok Sabha was adjourned thrice till 4.30 pm amid continuing ruckus. Birla said he is pained by what has happened during the day, before adjourning the House till Tuesday.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/bjp--cong-mps-shove-each-other-as-opp-insists-on-shah---s-resignation.html

246,03-3-20,Take alternate root,"Although herbs can’t promise to cure chronic conditions, they do mitigate the risks of occurrence of several women-specific health conditions. ARCHANA JYOTI tells you more

The International Women’s Day falls annually on March 8 and though we feel that just one day isn’t quite enough to deliberate on the myriads issues confronting the fairer sex — we’re using the occasion to dwell on medicinal plants meant to take care of women healthcare.

Although herbs cannot promise to cure chronic conditions, they do mitigate the risks of occurrence of several women-specific health conditions such as post menstruation syndrome, fertility, menopause, physical stamina, stress and many other conditions. Herbs have been for long a friend of women in ensuring their wellbeing.

In fact, according to a study published last year in International Journal of Scientific Research and Reviews even today, tribal women and certain women local communities in India still practice herbal medicine to cure a variety of diseases and disorders. They collect and preserve locally available, wild and cultivated plant species.

Similarly, as per a review, nearly 2000 different plant species are reported to be used in over 5000 combinations. Plants with numerous efficacious observations have historically been used as a starting point in the development of new drugs while a large percentage of pharma firms have developed drugs derived from medicinal plants.

“Medicinal plants play a crucial role in drug discovery, with at least 25 per cent of modern medicine being derived either directly or indirectly from them.

“For instance, available in syrup and tablets, our herbal formulation based on shatvar or shatvari, ashwagandha and putranjeevak, Amycordial is women centric — a uterine tonic aiming to maintain healthy and balanced production of female harmones as well as effectively reduces symptoms of pre and post menopause,” said Sanchit Sharma from AIMIL Pharma.

No doubt, the list of herbs for ensuring women well-being is long. Here we have tried to elaborate on a few of them.

Known as herbal magic potion for women’s health, there are a number of studies documenting benefits of ashwagandha that helps against inflammation, fatigue, hormonal issues, and more. Other studies show that it can bolster mental clarity and brain function. Yet another study even showed that the herb’s active ingredients (steroidal alkaloid and steroidal lactones) are important fertility hormone precursors and stimulate blood flow to reproductive organs.

Another herb red clover (tipatiya) offers an excellent source of plant-derived, natural phytoestrogens called isoflavones that various researches show to replicate the structure and functions of the fertility hormone estrogen in a woman’s body. Regular consumption of this herb can elevate estrogen levels, thus helping in treating fertility disorders. It is also said to be a rich source of essential body nutrients like calcium, thiamine, niacin, potassium, and vitamin C besides being beneficial for women suffering from hot flushes, vaginal dryness and night sweating.

Ayurveda experts say that the leaves, root, and stem of the nettle leaf has powerful diuretic and antioxidant properties, help cure urinary tract infections, allergies and osteoporosis — a common symptom of menopause that are quite common among women. Similarly, in pregnant women and lactating mothers, it acts as a rich source of Vitamin K and helps in increasing milk production.

Nettle leaf is also a rich source of iron that can fight anemia while its anti-oxidising properties are useful in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and PMS through the stabilisation of hormonal imbalances.

Chamomile is another herb that has proven calming and anti-inflammatory properties and is an effective treatment for stress, sleep apnea or insomnia and similar conditions. It offers a natural herbal remedy to women suffering from PMS and irregular menstrual cycles by regulating the menstrual cycle and relieving menstrual cramps.

Similarly, shatavari is said to be useful in maintaining good female health for ages. This herb has a balancing effect on the fertility hormones in women and helps maintain physical activeness and improve sex drive. Research has shown its effectiveness in managing fertility in women,in alleviating symptoms of PMS and in the repair of damaged vaginal tissues as well.

To manage stress, herbal experts recommend passionflower or krishna kamal in Hindi, a natural relaxant that is very effective in treating sleep apnea, anxiety disorders, and stress through its ability to increase the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain, according to various researches.

Commonly found herbs like amla, beetroot, aloe vera, ginger and punarnava are already proven for their efficacy in preventing anaemia.

254,03-3-20,Dockyard : Don’t read in dim light,"While working with reflecting surfaces like computers, use anti-reflection coated glasses, to avoid glare and eyestrain. Position the monitor in such a way that there is a 45-degree angle between the eyes and the bottom of the screen

With the onset of March, arrives exams and with exams comes its first casualty: eyes. Exam time means a lot of reading, writing that brings a lot of stress and strain to the eyes, the usually neglected part of our body.

When it comes to taking proper care of your eyes, there are a number of things that you should be aware and informed of. Few people actually understand the various exercises and steps that should be performed in order to maintain proper function of the eyes.

Here are the critical ten commandments for eye care:

Never lie flat on your back and read.

As far as possible, try to maintain a reading distance not less than 25 cms from the eye.

Take adequate intervals of rest (five to 10 minutes) in between reading for long hours. One can also relax the eyes by looking at a distant object five meters away.

It is crucial that you eat plenty of fruits and vegetables such as carrots, spinach, papaya and mangos, because all of these are rich in beta-carotene and therefore help you to have healthy eyes and proper vision.

Do not compromise on sleep.

In order to keep the eyes fresh one should avoid rubbing the eyes and should splash cold water instead.

Never read in dim illumination as that may lead to eyestrain.

Never read when in motion (as on a moving train or a bus).

While working with reflecting surfaces like computer terminals, use anti-reflection coated glasses, to avoid glare and eyestrain. Position the monitor in such a way that there is a 45-degree angle between the eyes and the bottom of the screen.

""I'm meeting with the pharmaceutical companies later on this afternoon. We have a big meeting with the biggest companies...We're talking about a vaccine... Maybe a cure; it's possible. So, we'll see about that,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office of the White House.

""We're talking about a vaccine. They are moving along very quickly. All pharmaceutical companies are moving along very quickly,"" he said.

The US so far has reported 80 cases of infection and two deaths from COVID-19, which was first detected in China in December.

The US, Trump said, is working with other countries to find vaccine for the novel coronavirus.

""We're working very much with a lot of other countries on -- including Colombia -- but we're working with a lot of other countries on helping them with respect to this problem.

256,03-3-20,"Shy of two seats, Netanyahu gains majority in general elections: Exit polls","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to gain majority in the unprecedented third parliamentary elections in the country with the exit polls projecting him to win 59 seats, just two short of the majority in the 120-member Parliament, according to media reports on Tuesday.

Israelis voted on Monday for the third time in less than a year to break the deadlock on government formation, with the country's longest serving premier Netanyahu, 70, fighting for his political survival amid indictments on graft charges.

The final voter turnout in the polls was 71 per cent, up from 69.8 per cent in the last elections held in September, which were called after Netanyahu and his main challenger Benny Gantz -- leader of the Blue and White alliance -- were unable to put together majority coalitions.

The exit polls were published shortly after the voting ended.

However, the official results which were scheduled to be declared on Tuesday have been delayed due to new procedures enacted for this election, as well as the issue of counting ballots of voters under quarantine for coronavirus, the Harretz newspaper reported.

Final vote tallies are expected by Wednesday, it said.

Likud party is leading with 36 seats, while Gantz earned 29 seats after 31 per cent of votes were counted at 6:40 AM (Israeli time) on Tuesday, the report said.

The Joint List is currently the third largest party with 12 seats, closely followed by United Torah Judaism and Shas, each with 11. Yamina has eight seats, Labor-Gesher-Meretz seven, and Yisrael Beiteinu has six, it said.

The initial exit polls had predicted 60 seats for Netanyahu, while the new prediction of 59 seats leaves him two short of a majority in the Knesset (Israeli Parliament), The Jerusalem Post reported.

The numbers are expected to change as the votes of soldiers, who tend to lean to the right, have not yet been counted and the Joint List tends to go down a seat when the soldiers' votes are added, it said.

Meanwhile, Netanyahu spoke to the heads of the parties in his camp immediately after the exit polls were announced, the Jerusalem Post said in its report.

Sources in Likud said he would even try to form a government before his criminal trial begins on March 17.

Netanyahu, who has been the premier for a total of more than 13 years, faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three cases.

Israel has always had a coalition government and never seen a single party rule since its independence. The religious parties, themselves a divided lot but definitely on the Right side of the political spectrum, have always been a part of the coalition governments except one led by Ariel Sharon.

The voter turnout in the latest elections is the highest since the 1999 elections when incumbent Netanyahu lost to Ehud Barak in a direct contest.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shy-of-two-seats--netanyahu-gains-majority-in-general-elections--exit-polls-2020-03-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/shy-of-two-seats--netanyahu-gains-majority-in-general-elections--exit-polls.html

All the six deaths in the US are from the Washington state with 43 domestic cases and 48 cases of the individuals who returned to the US, officials said on Monday.

The coronavirus outbreak that started in China's Wuhan city in December has killed 2,943 people in the country with total confirmed cases crossing 80,000 as it continues to spread to new countries around the world.

US President Donald Trump along with Pence reviewed the situation at the White House on Monday with top health officials and those leaders from the pharma corporate sector who are working on either vaccine or therapeutics for the COVID-19.

""Despite today's sad news, let's be clear, the risk to the American people of the coronavirus remains low according to all of the experts that we are working with across the government,"" Pence told reporters at the White House.

""As the president has said, we are ready for anything, but this is an all hands on deck effort,"" he said.

In his meeting with the leaders of the Pharma industry, Trump said that since the start of the outbreak his administration has taken the most aggressive action to protect the service sense, including closing the borders very early.

""I ordered sweeping travel restrictions, increased travel advisory levels, establish screening measures and imposed historic quarantines. We have quarantines all over the country, a lot of them,"" he said.

""The coronavirus shows the importance of bringing manufacturing back to America so that we are at home the medicines and equipment and everything else that we need to protect the public's health and I have been talking about this for a long time,"" Trump said.

At a political rally in North Carolina later in the day, the president pointed to the meeting at the White House with pharmaceutical executives.

""They're really working hard and they're working smart. They're going to have vaccines, I think, relatively soon,” he said.

""Washington Democrats are trying to politicise the coronavirus, denigrating the noble work of our public health professionals,"" he said.

Trump said his administration is encouraging the quick development of coronavirus therapies: “We will bring these therapies to market as rapidly as possible,"" he added.

Pence told reporters at the White House that many companies are already beginning to work on, but just as importantly, the development of therapeutics and it is remarkable to think that there may well be a vaccine going to clinical trials within the next six weeks.

""The nature of trials, as the experts have explained to us, is that the vaccine might yet not be available till late this year or early next, but the therapeutics giving relief to people that contract the coronavirus could literally be available by the summer or early fall,"" he said.

The US pharmaceutical companies, have formed a consortium to work together to share information in the development of therapeutics and vaccines.

The US has also updated its travel advisories for portions of Italy and South Korea and the implementation of screening of personnel from across those countries who are trying to take a direct flight to the US.

Within the next 12 hours, there will be 100 per cent screening of all direct flights at all airports across Italy and across South Korea. The president has directed them to bring the full resources of the federal government and to bring the very best minds in this country to bear on this effort, Pence said.

On March 1, President Trump announced restrictions on travel from Iran and advised fellow citizens not to travel to certain areas of South Korea and Italy.

The United States has already restricted travel on people who have visited China and Iran.

On Monday, President Trump said he is still considering additional travel restrictions for countries with rampant coronavirus outbreaks, CNN reported.

China's National Health Commission, (NHC) said on Tuesday it received reports of 125 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 31 deaths on Monday in the country.

According to the World Health Organisation, there are 89,527 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 3,056 deaths reported globally in 67 countries.

In terms of confirmed cases in China, officials said Monday's numbers were the lowest since the country began to report about the coronavirus epidemic, showing signs of stabilising, especially in the Chinese mainland.

All the deaths were in Hubei Province and its capital Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, the officials said, adding that of the 125 new confirmed cases reported on Monday, 114 are from Hubei.

NHC said the overall confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland had reached 80,151 by the end of Monday.

This included 2,943 people who died of the disease so far, 30,004 patients still undergoing treatment and 47,204 patients discharged after recovery, the officials said.

By the end of Monday, 100 confirmed cases including two deaths had been reported in Hong Kong, 10 confirmed cases in Macao and 41 in Taiwan, including one death.

With the virus spreading at a rapid pace globally, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said it is an infectious disease caused by a new coronavirus introduced to humans for the first time and it can be contained with the right measures.

Noting that knowing and understanding the epidemic is the first step to defeating it, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tweeted on Monday that ""we are in unchartered territory with COVID-19. We have never before seen a respiratory pathogen that is capable of community transmission.""

""It spreads from person to person mainly through the droplets produced when an infected person speaks, coughs or sneezes,"" Ghebreyesus, who visited China in January, said.

A 12-member WHO team also visited the virus-hit areas in China and submitted a detailed report.

Ghebreyesus said containment of COVID-19 is still feasible and must remain the top priority for all countries right now, though there is no one-size-fits-all approach.

""Our message to all countries is: this is not one-way street. We can push this coronavirus back,"" he said.

""Your actions now will determine the course of the COVID-19 outbreak in your country. There's no choice but to act now,"" he said.

WHO has been advising countries to take actions on the ""first case, first cluster, first evidence of community transmission.""

Meanwhile, Ghebreyesus also deplored stigmatizing during the outbreak, which he said is ""more dangerous than coronavirus itself.""

""It is painful to witness the level of stigma we are seeing. We are not angels, we are human beings, but we can do the right thing,"" state-run Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying.

Meanwhile, six people died of the deadly virus in the United States, while over 90 confirmed cases have been reported from the country.

259,03-3-20,Nawaz Sharif awaiting medical procedure in UK: PMLN spokesperson,"Former Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif is awaiting a medical procedure in the UK which restricts his travel, a Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) spokesperson has said.

The 70-year-old three-time former premier's aides in the UK dismissed the prospect of the Imran Khan-led government seeking Sharif's deportation from the UK government because he was in the country on medical grounds on a visit visa.

""Mian Sahib is here on medical grounds and is awaiting a medical procedure,"" a PML-N UK spokesperson said on Monday.

""He is here on a visit visa for medical treatment and wasn't handed over to the UK government,"" he said, in reference to the deportation claims emanating from Pakistan.

Sharif left for London in November last for treatment after the Lahore High Court allowed him to go abroad on medical grounds for four weeks.

According to the PML-N UK aides, Sharif is due to undergo a similar medical procedure which resulted in health complications a few years ago. Meanwhile, he is keenly waiting for a ""visit by his daughter"", Maryam Nawaz, if she is granted bail and allowed to travel abroad.

According to Sharif's physician, the top leader of the PML-N is suffering from complex multi-vessel coronary artery disease and substantial ischemic and threatened myocardium for which he is due to undergo surgery.

""It is time to bring back the VIP prisoner who is having a lavish stay abroad,"" Firdous Ashiq Awan, the Special Assistant to the Pakistan Prime Minister on Information, was quoted as saying in Islamabad over the weekend.

""The government has decided in principle to write a letter this week to the British government, seeking deportation of PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif, as he is an absconder not fulfilling the terms and conditions of the bail granted to him on medical grounds,"" she said.

Last week, the Punjab government refused to extend Sharif's bail, declaring that it had found no ""legal, moral or medical ground"" necessitating an extension in his stay abroad.

The Lahore High Court had, in October last year, granted bail to Sharif on medical grounds for four weeks, allowing the Punjab government to extend it further in the light of his medical reports.

The Islamabad High Court had also granted bail to Sharif in the Al Azizia Mills corruption case, in which the former prime minister was serving a seven-year jail term, clearing his way to travel abroad for medical treatment.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nawaz-sharif-awaiting-medical-procedure-in-uk--pmln-spokesperson-2020-03-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/nawaz-sharif-awaiting-medical-procedure-in-uk--pmln-spokesperson.html
260,03-3-20,"S Korea coronavirus cases approach 5,000","South Korea's coronavirus case total -- the largest in the world outside China -- approached 5,000 Tuesday as authorities reported 477 new cases.

Two more people had died, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, taking the toll to 28.

South Korea has seen a rapid rise in infections in recent days as authorities carry out checks on more than 260,000 people associated with the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a religious group often condemned as a cult that is linked to more than half the cases.

Scores of events -- from K-pop concerts to sports seasons -- have been cancelled or postponed over the contagion, with school and kindergarten breaks extended by three weeks nationwide.

The central bank has warned of negative growth in the first quarter for the world's 12th-largest economy, noting the epidemic will hit both consumption and exports.

A 61-year-old female Shincheonji member developed a fever on February 10 but attended at least four services in Daegu -- the country's fourth-largest city with a population of 2.5 million and the centre of the outbreak -- before being diagnosed.

Lee Man-hee, the 88-year-old founder of the secretive sect, apologised for the outbreak on Monday -- twice bowing his head to the ground at a televised press conference -- insisting his entity was cooperating with the government's containment efforts.

Seoul city authorities have filed a complaint with prosecutors seeking to have him and other Shincheonji leaders charged with murder and other offences.

Of the 4,812 cases nationwide, nearly 90 percent were in Daegu and the neighbouring province of North Gyeongsang, the KCDC said.

The South has so far carried out more than 125,000 coronavirus tests on possible carriers and the figures are expected to rise further.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/s-korea-coronavirus-cases-approach-5-000-2020-03-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/s-korea-coronavirus-cases-approach-5-000.html

After 18 years of war, the US and the Taliban signed the peace deal in Doha on Saturday to facilitate intra-Afghan dialogue in Oslo this month and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan in 14 months.

""This was an important first step toward a political solution to end the war in Afghanistan. As I reiterated to our Afghan partners, this is a conditions-based agreement,"" Esper told reporters on his return from Afghanistan.

In an interaction with Pentagon reporters, Esper said that the US is watching the Taliban's actions closely to assess whether they are upholding their commitments.

""This agreement was enabled by the tremendous sacrifices our servicemen and women have made over the past 18 plus years,"" he said.

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Mark Milley said that a negotiated political settlement is the only responsible way to end the war in Afghanistan, and this was an important step.

""This agreement would not have been possible without the thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines that have served and sacrificed over the last 18 years. We owe an extraordinary debt of gratitude to America's sons and daughters who made the ultimate sacrifice and their families, who have given their all to this nation,"" he said.

Responding to a question, Esper said that their expectation is that a reduced level of violence would occur and it would decrease over time as they move forward.

""So, this is going to be a step-by-step process, and we'll evaluate each day,"" he said.

Noting that the agreement calls for reduction of troops to 8,600 within 135 days, Esper said that he has already given his consent to start the drawdown.

""Our agreement, our commitment under the agreement was to enable, to facilitate the exchange of persons between the Taliban and the government of Afghanistan. And I've said over and over, it's all conditions-based, but we are going to show good faith and begin withdrawing our troops and we can stop that at any moment. We can pause it based on, again, changing circumstances,"" Esper said in response to a question.

The mission, he said, is to make sure Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for terrorists to attack this country.

""We've been very successful for the past 18 years for doing that; and then number two, support our Afghan partners in the process; and then number three, again, as we can, bring our troops home, withdraw our presence in the country,"" Esper added.

Under the US-Taliban pact signed in Doha, the US has agreed to reduce its troops in Afghanistan from 13,000 to 8,600 in the next 130 days and withdraw all its soldiers in 14 months.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/peace-deal-with-taliban-is-conditions-based-agreement--us-defence-secretary-2020-03-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/peace-deal-with-taliban-is-conditions-based-agreement--us-defence-secretary.html
262,03-3-20,Get rid of lines & wrinkles,"There are many habits that influence ageing. KEWAL KAPOOR tells you how to get rid of those

Plenty of habits influence the ageing process. While genetics is a key driver, your lifestyle plays an equally important role in how fast you age. Let us take a look at some routine habits that shorten your lifespan.

Lack of sleep: Sleep is crucial for hormone regulation, memory development, muscle recovery, and proper metabolism among other things. If you skip on sleep, it will eventually lead to anxiety, depression, weight gain, and insulin resistance, triggering Diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. Sleep deprivation is also related to pale skin, fine lines, and wrinkles. If you do not get at least eight hours of sleep daily, make it a point to do so.

Excessive drinking: Drinking in moderation has been proven to have measurable health benefits. Go overboard, and you damage everything from your skin to your internal organs. Alcohol depletes the body of Vitamin A, which is essential for cell regeneration. Try not to drink regularly, avoid cocktails with added sugars and try not to have more than two drinks when you do.

Regular smoking: This one bears repeating multiple times. Not only does smoking causes heart disease and makes you susceptible to lung cancer, it also has noticeable effects on your physical appearance. The harmful chemical sin tobacco smoke show up as fine lines and wrinkles on the face. Nicotine constricts blood vessels, limiting the reach of nutrients to the epidermis, causing wrinkles. If you still have this habit, it is best to drop it altogether.

Sedentary lifestyle: If you think manual labour is dangerous, then you might be concerned to know that a desk job is doubly so. Sitting idle for more than eight hours increases the risk of premature ageing and death by over 50 per cent. Not only does it increase the risk of heart disease, it also slows down the blood circulation, interferes with the regulation of blood sugar, and pushes up the cholesterol levels.

Excessive sugar consumption: From sugary drinks and cereals to nutrition bars to plain old ketchup, you consume unhealthy amounts of sugar on a daily basis. Not only is it unhealthy, it also makes you age faster. Excess sugar causes proteins like elastin and collagen to bind together, increasing the level of inflammation markers that accelerate the process of ageing. Luckily, it is reversible. Research has found that cutting out sugary foods and increasing the intake of foods rich in antioxidants led to a decrease in the level of inflammation markers.

Too much exposure to the sun: While sunshine not only boosts the mood and help your body get much needed Vitamin D, excess exposure is bad for you. Chronic damage from the sun is the cause for common skin wrinkling. Sun damage depletes the elastin and collagen, causing the skin to wrinkle. It makes you age rapidly, and even cause skin cancer, including the lethal melanoma. To avoid this, ensure that you wear a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 every day.

Eating fried food: French fries, onion rings, and fried chicken — they are all bad for the gut. Deep frying food exposes the fat and oil to very high temperatures. It is best to avoid eating any fried foods as it not only affect your body internally but externally too.

If you are guilty of any of the above habits, now is the perfect time to turn your life around. If you follow these suggestions, you will begin to see an improvement in your appearance and state of mind in just a matter of months.

There are several reasons why a baby can get an upset tummy. One could be that they have just started to eat solids and their stomach is not used to the same. For a baby, the pain can be too much to handle. However, a few home remedies can do the trick to ease the pain.

When I was a baby my mother used to ease stomachaches by gently pressing a warm compress against the abdomen. It worked wonders. The procedure can be repeated two-three times in a day.

Apply mustard oil. Lay the baby on his back and gently massage his tummy using mustard oil. Apply it around the baby’s navel in an anti-clockwise direction. This will help stimulate the digestive system.

Give your little one a glass of warm water to drink. This will help dispel gas in the stomach.

If your baby is colic, garlic is the best remedy. However, you can’t feed it to the baby. Gently rub garlic with nutmeg on the stomach.

The event was jointly organised by Faridabad Menopause Society, Faridabad Obstetrics and Gynecology Society and Rajiv Gandhi Cancer institute and research center, Niti bagh, South Delhi.

“Ovarian cancer is the third most common gynecological cancer in females. Earlier ovarian cancer was called a silent killer since symptoms were supposed to remain undetected till it was too late. However studies have revealed that certain subtle symptoms point to the onset of ovarian cancer. These include bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty in eating or feeling fullness without eating much and increase in urgency or frequency of urine. if these symptoms are occurring frequently in a woman , one should see a gynecologist”, said Dr Manish Sharma, Consultant, Medical Oncology, RGCIRC Niti Bagh.

The risk factors for Ovarian cancer include infertility, polycystic ovarian syndrome, Endometriosis and tobacco smoking. Ovarian cancer is hereditary too.

267,03-3-20,Studycentre,"People with Diabetes, hypertension and depression might be able to continue taking life saving medications in small doses even while they heal from drug-induced liver injuries, suggests new research.

The findings, published in the journal Drug Metabolism and Disposition, suggests that doctors need not always make patients with drug-induced liver injury stop taking all their medications until the liver healed.

“Doctors give patients drugs to treat diseases. No one wants their liver damaged, but it happens all the time,” said Xiaobo Zhong from the University of Connecticut in the US. When a person takes a medication by mouth, it goes into their stomach and then to the intestines, where it is absorbed into the blood. This blood, in turn, passes first through the liver before reaching the rest of the body. The liver has enzymes that break down medicines.

But different people naturally have more or less of these enzymes. Sometimes, what could be a safe and effective dose in one person is too much for someone else who has different enzyme levels. This is why some individuals are more vulnerable to liver damage, even when taking drugs just as a doctor prescribed. There is no standard guidance for doctors when a patient gets drug-induced liver damage.

Patients who have had 9 or more antibiotic prescriptions for common infections in the previous three years are 2.26 times more likely to go to hospital with another infection in three or more months, said the researchers.

Patients who had two antibiotic prescriptions were 1.23 times more likely, patients who had three to four prescriptions 1.33 times more likely and patients who had five to eight 1.77 times more likely to go to hospital with another infection.

""We don't know why this is, but overuse of antibiotics might kill the good bacteria in the gut (microbiota) and make us more susceptible to infections, for example,"" said Professor Tjeerd van Staa from the University of Manchester in Britain.

The study, published in the journal BMC Medicine, is based on the data of two million patients in England and Wales.

The patient records, from 2000 to 2016, covered common infections such as upper respiratory tract, urinary tract, ear and chest infections and excluded long term conditions such as cystic fibrosis and chronic lung disease.

The risks of going to hospital with another infection were related to the number of the antibiotic prescriptions in the previous three years.

A course is defined by the team as being given over a period of one or two weeks.

""GPs (general physicians) care about their patients, and over recent years have worked hard to reduce the prescribing of antibiotics,""""Staa said.

""But it is clear GPs do not have the tools to prescribe antibiotics effectively for common infections, especially when patients already have previously used antibiotics.

""They may prescribe numerous courses of antibiotics over several years, which according to our study increases the risk of a more serious infection. That in turn, we show, is linked to hospital admissions,"" Staa added.

It not clear why hospital admissions are linked to higher prescriptions and research is needed to show what or if any biological factors exist, said the research team.

""Our hope is that, however, a tool we are working for GPs, based on patient history, will be able to calculate the risks associated with taking multiple courses of antibiotics,"" said Francine Jury from the University of Manchester.

273,03-3-20,Pakistan urges Afghan Govt to create 'favourable environment' for intra-Afghan dialogue,"Pakistan on Tuesday called on the Afghan government to create a ""favourable environment"" for intra-Afghan dialogue, warning that the peace and reconciliation process with Taliban would not move forward if any side showed ""stubbornness"".

Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi in a statement called on President Ashraf Ghani to abide by a prisoner swap clause in the US-Taliban peace deal, the rejection of which saw the Taliban resume attacks on Afghan forces in the northeast of the country.

“It is the responsibility of the Afghan leadership to create a favourable environment to take the talks forward,"" Qureshi said.

The intra-Afghan negotiations are due to begin March 10 according to a US-Taliban deal signed in Doha on Saturday, but a dispute over a prisoner swap has raised questions about whether they will go ahead.

The agreement includes a commitment for the Taliban to release up to 1,000 prisoners and for the Afghan government to free around 5,000 insurgent captives -- something the militants have cited as a prerequisite for talks but which President Ghani has refused to do before negotiations start.

The foreign minister said that Pakistan cannot take decision on the part of Afghans. “Pakistan can create a favourable environment, it cannot take (Afghanistan's) decisions, he said.

Qureshi reminded the parties to Afghan conflict that the agreement signed by the US and Taliban representative on Saturday in Doha contained provisions for exchange of prisoners.

“Exchange of prisoners has happened in the past. When we move from war towards peace, it needs to be done to show a positive intention,"" the foreign minister said.

He warned that the process of peace and reconciliation would not move forward if any side showed ""stubbornness"". He urged the parties to take “confidence-building” steps in order to move forward.

Qureshi said that intra-Afghan process was a test of Afghan leadership and it would show if the Afghans were ready to leave the past behind and work for peace.

He said that Doha agreement was just the first step, though an important on, for a lasting peace in Afghanistan.

He said that Pakistan would continue to provide support for an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process.

Qureshi said that the Taliban pledged that would not allow “al Qaeda or any terrorist organization to operate in Afghanistan.”

The foreign minister warned that the “spoilers” were not would be uncomfortable with the deal but there were many people who are comfortable with it.

“There are many who feel that it is in Afghanistan's long-term interest. It is in region's long term interest and it is essential for global peace and stability,” he said.

274,03-3-20,Nirbhaya rapists live on borrowed time for fortnight,"Death warrant put off for third time; as mercy plea rejected, convicts get at least 14 more days to live

A Delhi court on Monday suspended the death warrant issued against four death-row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case till further orders as convict Pawan Kumar Gupta’s advocate told the court that his mercy plea was pending with the President.

However, President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday evening rejected the mercy plea of Pawan.

This for the third time the hanging of the convicts — Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26), Akshay Kumar Singh (31) and Pawan, who are lodged in Tihar Jail — has been deferred. The convicts were scheduled to be hanged till death on Tuesday at 6 am.

According to the Delhi Prison Rules, if a mercy petition is submitted, a 14-day period has to be given to the convict after the dismissal of the mercy plea, for a new death warrant.

“Despite stiff resistance from the victim’s side, I am of the opinion that any condemned convict must not meet his Creator with a grievance in his bosom that the courts of the country have not acted fairly in granting him an opportunity to exhaust his legal remedies… I am of the opinion that the death sentence cannot be executed pending the disposal of the mercy petition of the convict,” said Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana.

Earlier on Monday, Pawan moved a clemency plea before the President shortly after his curative petition was dismissed by the Supreme Court. The curative plea for commuting the death sentence was heard in chamber by a five-judge SC bench. It is the last legal remedy available for a convict to get any reprieve.

In its 6-page order, the judge said, “I have no hesitation in holding that mercy petition is an important constitutional legal principle ‘Ubi jus ubi remedium’, i.E., where there is a right, there is a remedy, I am of the opinion that the application(of Pawan) is very much maintainable.”

Earlier in the day, while it was reserving the order on Pawan’s fresh plea, the judge rapped the convict’s lawyer AP Singh for acting so late in filing the curative and mercy pleas. The court, thereafter, asked him to come post lunch to argue his case.

In the post-lunch hearing, the court pulled up Singh saying, “You are playing with fire, you should be cautious” and added “one wrong move by anybody, and you know the consequences”.

The first date of execution, January 22, was postponed to February 1 by a January 17 court order. Then, the trial court on January 31, stayed, “till further orders” the execution of the four convicts as they had not exhausted all their legal remedies.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nirbhaya-rapists-live-on-borrowed-time-for-fortnight-2020-03-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/nirbhaya-rapists-live-on-borrowed-time-for-fortnight.html

That's one of the reasons she connected with her ""Captain Marvel"" co-star Lashana Lynch.

""I am an introvert, but I'm super open in scene work. I don't hold back in that, and she

doesn't either, so it was a really interesting experience. The two of us did a chemistry read together and it was pretty vibe-y from the beginning. Lashana's a badass and really special, so it was easy to connect with her. We were spending so much time together hanging out that we developed a real bond through it,"" Larson said.

The Oscar-winning actress broke the misconception that female superheroes can't hold strong on their own at the box office when her ""Captain Marvel"" had a smooth take-off in the superhero universe last year.

The project introduced the Marvel Cinematic Universe's (MCU) first standalone, female-franchise title character, Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel, essayed by Larson. It followed Danvers' journey as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes.

The film joined its superhero counterparts (""Avengers: Infinity War"", ""Black Panther"", ""The Avengers"", ""Captain America: Civil War"", ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and ""Iron Man 3"") in the 'billion dollar' club. It will air in India on March 8 on Star Movies.

Talking about taking on the landmark role, she said: ""There was a scene where two male characters were talking about my character and they called me a 'woman' and I realised that in the past, if I would have read a script written by a man it would have been 'girl', and I had to take a step back and go 'oh my gosh, I'm 28 years old and I'm used to being referred to as a girl'. Those little things and big things come from this script being passed through the hands of women and being written by women. They're just slight things, and I realised it changed the way I viewed myself.""",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/brie-larson--i-am-an-introvert-2020-03-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/brie-larson--i-am-an-introvert.html

The preliminary proposed class-action settlement still requires approval by the US district judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California, reports Inc.com.

If you owned an iPhone that suffered from performance throttling -- iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7Plus or SE, running iOS 10.2.1 prior to December 21, 2017 -- you are entitled for the claim.

Apple admitted in 2017 that the software update slowed down certain iPhone models with degraded batteries. The iPhone maker said that the update was necessary to prevent unexpected shutdowns and preserve the life of the devices.

However, the Cupertino-based tech giant also apologised for not communicating to users properly and offered affected customers cut-price iPhone battery replacements.

France's consumer fraud group earlier last month imposed a 25 million-euros fine on Apple for deliberately slowing down certain older iPhone models.

The Directorate General for Competition, Consumption and the Suppression of Fraud (DGCCRF), which is part of the country's economy ministry, concluded that Apple had failed to inform users that iOS updates to older iPhones could slow down their devices.

""We know that some of you feel Apple has let you down. We apologise,"" Apple had said in a statement.

Apple also reduced the price of an out-of-warranty iPhone battery replacement by $50 from $79 to $29 for anyone with an iPhone 6 or later whose battery needs to be replaced.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/apple-to-pay--25-each-to-iphone-users-for-slower-performance-2020-03-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/apple-to-pay--25-each-to-iphone-users-for-slower-performance.html
