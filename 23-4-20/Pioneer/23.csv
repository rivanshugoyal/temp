|

Aiming to facilitate growth and promotion of a healthy, transparent, productive and competitive real estate sector, Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UPRERA) has decided to go for grading of developers and builders across the state.

As per Section 32(f) of the Real Estate Regulation Act, measures to encourage grading of projects on various parameters of development, including grading of promoters, will be done.

For this, the UPRERA had earlier appointed a consultant for setting up a system for grading of developers and projects in measurable parameters.

After inputs from development authorities, industrial development authorities, home buyers associations, promoters associations and other stakeholders, the UPRERA in consultation with its consultant CRISIL Limited (CRISIL) designed a grading framework for projects registered in RERA and the promoters.

The proposed grading framework has been uploaded on UPRERA portal (https://www.up-rera.in/index) for feedback, if any, by stake- holders by May 13, 2020.

Suggestions can be offered in the form provided for the purpose by using the link https://forms.gle/1A2RXqSqohvs2ivm9.

The UPRERA would suitably upgraded the grading system based on suggestions of stakeholders and implement them in consultation with the state government.

The grading would be on a scale of I to V in ascending order. The objective of grading system, to be done annually, is to assess promoters and projects registered with UPRERA and rate them so that home buyers could make an informed choice.

This grading scale would help in creating a track record for promoters and better understanding off issues like delays in possession and major slowdown in projects and level of performance of the promoters.

UPRERA Chairman Rajiv Kumar said on Wednesday, “RERA will assign grades to projects and promoters with a view to assisting a prospective home buyer while investing in a project. Through this, prospective home buyers will have knowledge of the credentials of promoter and quality of the projects under consideration.”

Promoter grading essentially involves assessing the promoter’s track record in executing projects and analysing associated organisational, legal and financial risks. Key parameters of promoter grading are financial quality, organisational structure and certifications, track record, compliance adherence and very importantly customer feedback.

The promoter’s capability is then benchmarked against parameters as set in grading framework.

A project’s assigned grading will serve as a benchmark against other graded projects in the state and will be applicable to all UPRERA registered projects.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/uprera-to-grade-developers--builders.html

Personnel of Ayodhya police and Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) jawans came to a head when the local police stopped two PAC personnel from going to market to purchase medicines on Wednesday morning.

Senior police officers rushed to the spot and were trying to defuse the situation.

Taking a serious note of the incident, the ADG (PAC) directed his junior officers to initiate action against the guilty.

As per reports, one company of PAC personnel was deputed to assist Ayodhya police in enforcing lockdown and were put up at RD Inter College in Raunahi.

On Wednesday afternoon, some PAC personnel in civvies went for shopping in Suchitaganj market when local cops stopped them citing lockdown. This led to a heated argument after which the police took two PAC jawans to a local police station.

As the news reached the PAC camp in Raunahi, angry jawans swarmed the police station and clashed with local cops to free their colleagues. On learning about the incident, SSP of Ayodhya, Asheesh Tewari, rushed to the spot and sealed the area and efforts were being made to resolve the issue.

The SSP informed his senior officers about the conduct of the PAC jawans so that necessary action could be taken. He also asked Sadar Circle Officer Virendra Vikram to probe the matter and submit a report.

Dismissing any clash inside the police station, Tewari said that two PAC jawans were brought there for violating lockdown norms.

PAC Deputy Commandant Sanjay Kumar told local media persons in Ayodhya that two jawans had gone to purchase medicines from a market when they were detained as they were in plain clothes. He said that the matter was being looked into so that appropriate action could be taken.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/policemen--pac-jawans-spar-during-lockdown.html
4,23-4-20,UP govt acts tough against Jamaatis,"

|

The Uttar Pradesh government is coming down hard on those Tablighi Jamaat members, including foreign nationals, who attended the Nizamuddin markaz meet in Delhi and chose to sneak to different parts of the state and did not report for check-ups, resulting in the spread of coronavirus across the state.

After being quarantined for 14 days, those who have tested negative for the virus are now being sent to jail for violating the Epidemic Diseases Act and provisions of the Foreigners Act.

In Uttar Pradesh, the total number of coronavirus positive cases is over 1,337 and of this, Tablighi Jamaat members and their contacts account for over 840.

A total of 92 foreign Jamaat members were put in quarantine across the state and now they are being sent to jail. Another 200 Jamaatis have been jailed for violation of lockdown and Epidemic Diseases Act. The government has set up 26 special jails to lodge them.

Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi said in Lucknow on Wednesday that the government would not spare anyone who violated the law and threatened the lives of the people.

“Jamaatis, who were earlier quarantined and did not test positive for coronavirus, will now be sent to 26 jails that have been set up to lodge these people,” he said.

A total of 45 FIRs were filed against 259 foreigners who attended the Nizamuddin markaz meet and later slithered to different areas of the state and hid themselves instead of getting tested for the viral infection.

Earlier, 325 foreigners, including 66 Nepalese citizens, were identified staying in different parts of Uttar Pradesh. The police confiscated their passports for violating Foreigners Act by attending a religious gathering against a tourist visa.

Lucknow reported the maximum number of 23 Jamaatis of foreign origin being sent to jail. Earlier on April 11, 17 foreign Jamaatis were sent to jail in Bahraich and 16 were sent to jail in Bulandshahr. Similarly, six foreign Jamaat members were jailed in Prayagraj on Monday while 14 were jailed in Jaunpur and 11 in Bhadohi.

Besides, 3,000 Jamaatis were identified across the state and of them, 2,800 were quarantined. They were also accused of violating lockdown norms and FIRs were lodged against them under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code. A total of 33 Indian Jamaatis were jailed in Bulandshahr, three in Bhadohi, 26 in Mau and 30 in Jaunpur.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-govt-acts-tough-against-jamaatis.html
5,23-4-20,Akhilesh slams Centre over Chinese test kits,"



|

Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav questioned the efficacy of coronavirus rapid test kits procured from China and demanded a clarification from the Union government.

Akhilesh said, “Importing rapid test kits from China and putting them in use without testing its quality is deceiving the people. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which has now stopped these tests, should have warned about it in advance. The government should clarify such a negligence and how accurate were the tests conducted before.”

The use of rapid test kits was stopped for two days in the country after serious questions were raised on the huge fluctuation in results by the Rajasthan government. Now, the Central teams will assess the results closely and action will be taken accordingly.

The SP chief slammed Team 11 comprising bureaucrats that has been set up by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for supervising the relief work, for the crisis caused by COVID -19.

“Bureaucrats with Anglican mindset have no idea about ground reality of the state where a vast majority resides in rural areas and depends on agriculture. To shrug off accountability, the officers adopted online technology to which a vast majority has no access,” Akhilesh said.

Questioning the online classes for students started by the Education department due to lockdown, the SP chief said that it was the most definite example of government ignorance of ground reality of the state.

“Quoting some surveys , the government said that 48 percent and 55 percent people in Lucknow and Varanasi respectively, owned smartphones. This is a shining example of bureaucratic ignorance about the state,” Akhilesh said.

The SP chief also alleged that the government wanted to deprive rural youths from getting government jobs through competitive examinations conducted by UP Public Service Commission.

“Candidates have been asked to apply online for recruitment to various posts even as there is poor or no connectivity in rural areas. This will only deprive rural youths of appearing in competitive exams,” Akhilesh Yadav said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/akhilesh-slams-centre-over-chinese-test-kits.html
6,23-4-20,Males more prone to coronavirus,"



|

With COVID-19 cases peaking in Uttar Pradesh, the government has come up with a survey which suggests that males are more prone to coronavirus infection than members of the fairer sex.

Principal Secretary (Health) Amit Mohan Prasad said that of the 1,412 coronavirus positive cases reported till April 22 in UP, 78.80 per cent were males while the rest 21.2 per cent were females.

Prasad said that 19.51 per cent cases were found in 0-20 year age group that included 15.48 per cent boys and 4.03 per cent girls. Similarly, he said, 47.49 per cent people were infected in 21-40 year age group among which 37.03 per cent were males and 10.46 percent females.

Besides, he said, 24.66 per cent infected people were in the 41-60 age group, of which 19.01 per cent were men and 5.65 per cent women.

“People over 60 years of age account for 8.3 per cent cases among whom males constitute 7.28 percent and females 1.06 per cent,” he said.

Experts attribute a number of factors working against men — their lifestyle, drinking habits, biological reasons and even immune system.

“It is no secret that women have greater ability to fight infections than men and the reason could be the estrogen hormone. This hormone seems to be the key and therefore baby girls are more likely to reach their first birthday than boys,” says Dr SK Pandey from RML Institute of Medical Science, Lucknow.

The doctor said that women also produced stronger immune responses for vaccinations which could be the reason that even in 0-20 year age group, it is the males who are more vulnerable to this disease.

“In a higher age group, one can argue that as male goes out and does all errands, he is more susceptible. But figures in 0-20 age group proves the inherent biological superiority of females over males in keeping infections at bay,” Dr Pandey said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/males-more-prone-to-coronavirus.html
7,24-4-20,India records biggest single-day spike in coronavirus cases,"In the biggest spike in coronavirus infection on a single day, India on Friday recorded 1,752 fresh cases taking the total number of infected people to 23,452 even as doubling rate of the disease improved to 10 days from 7.5 reported earlier this week, according to the Health Ministry.

The death toll from the infection rose to 723 with 37 fatalities reported since Thursday evening, said an official, adding about 20.52 per cent of the infected people have recovered so far.

At a daily media briefing, Director of National Centre for Disease Control S K Singh said around 9.45 lakh suspected coronavirus cases have been under surveillance and their samples are being collected upon detection of symptoms of the infection.

Niti Ayog member V K Paul, chairman of an empowered group on COVID-19, said India would have recorded around one lakh cases of the infection by now if Prime Minister Narendra Modi had not taken the ""timely step"" step of enforcing a nationwide lockdown from March 25.

The officials said the outbreak of the pandemic has been ""under control"" in India largely due to a robust surveillance network along with implementation of the lockdown and other containment measures.

Out of the total 1,752 new cases, Maharashtra reported the highest number of 778 new infections followed by Gujarat with 217 cases and Madhya Pradesh with 157 cases, according to government data.

The previous highest single day increase of the infection was on April 20 when 1,540 cases were reported. India's first coronavirus case was reported on January 30.

Paul said the lockdown has been effective in slowing down the rate of spread of the deadly infection and that the doubling rate now stands at 10 days.

""No need to fear about hidden spike in cases, The disease is under control,"" he said.

On April 20, the Health Ministry said the doubling rate has improved to 7.5 days as against 3.4 days before the nationwide lockdown was imposed.

""If we go back to March 21, the cases were doubling in around three days. An important turn came on March 23 after the janata curfew had happened. The direction changed and the doubling rate increased to five days,"" Paul said.

""By then, we had already put in place travel restrictions and had created an environment of social distancing. There were some disturbances in between which led to some setbacks. But from April 6 again, the doubling time started improving,"" he said.

The official said the growth curve of the infection has begun to flatten. ""The nationwide lockdown helped take us away from the exponential growth curve and, thereby, contain the growth of coronavirus cases,"" he said.

Officials, however, said these projections are based on the growth pattern at a particular time.

Paul also credited the testing strategy adopted by India saying volume of testing has been adequate. Despite there being an increase in testing, proportion of positive cases have not risen.

Singh said that surveillance has been the country's primary weapon in the fight against novel coronavirus.

""We started our surveillance mechanism even before the first case was reported in India. This played an important role in helping us contain the spread of the infection,"" Singh said explaining how the government initiates contact tracing once a person is found infected in a community.

""Starting from stopping of international flights to stop transmission of infection from abroad, graded steps including lockdown were taken to halt internal chain of transmission of the infection,"" he said.

Singh said the surveillance network has been set up at district level as well so that measures like household survey, quarantine and isolations are carried out as part of the cluster containment plan.

""During initial period of lockdown, doubling time of cases decreased since people infected already were being detected, later it improved as lockdown put a brake on the spread of the infection,"" Singh said.

According to Paul, surveillance has been a great tool in containing coronavirus infection cases. Besides containing spread, augmenting testing, improving preparedness, the nation has brought about a massive behaviour change through a Jan Andolan, he said.

Joint Secretary in the Health Ministry Lav Agarwal said that 15 districts in the country which earlier reported cases of the infection have not reported any fresh cases in the last 28 days.

Further, a total of 80 districts from 23 states and union territories have not reported any new cases since the last 14 days.

Talking about the feedback of the central teams which visited various states witnessing higher growth in positive cases, Agarwal said the teams took stock of the hospital settings, examined the containment plans around containment zones and discussed with states over strengthening the contact tracing system.

They had some observations which included increasing the mobility of the teams, deploying additional teams in area of containment zones for active house-to house survey.

They also examined how the clinical management of admitted patients can be strengthend.

The teams also highlighted that the healthcare workers and volunteers like NCC as well as retired professionals should be trained on prevention of the infection.

Agarwal also said that Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan interacted with all the state health ministers and health secretaries through a video conference to review the preparedness and actions taken for management of COVID-19 on Friday.

""He also asked them to focus on surveillance, house-to-house active case finding, early identification of cases and proper clinical management to ensure that the patients get timely treatment and mortality is reduced,"" Agarwal said.

""He urged the health ministers to personally review the measures being undertaken against stigma and discrimination of doctors and other frontline health workers, as also patients who have COVID-19 or those that have recovered,"" he added.

Officials said the number of active COVID-19 cases in the country stood at 17,915 as 4,813 people recovered from the infection.

About 20.52 per cent of the cases have recovered so far, a Health Ministry official said.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-records-biggest-single-day-spike-in-coronavirus-cases-2020-04-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/india-records-biggest-single-day-spike-in-coronavirus-cases.html
8,23-4-20,Oil wealth crisis,"The outbreak of Coronavirus is changing the nature of everything. What’s sure is that the energy industry will never be the same again. But why did this happen? Let’s take a quick primer

As West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices collapsed into the negative territory in an afternoon of frenetic trading, far too many assumptions were made about oil prices. Crude prices plunged below zero to touch a historic low of -$40.32 per barrel. Before anything else, one has to understand the basic nature of commodity trading, which is that, at the end of the day, a physical product has to be delivered and one has to accept this. The seller does not care what the trader or the buyer does with the finished product. Now, WTI crude, which is produced mainly in what we call the “Texas panhandle,” is unique in the sense that it is delivered in one location, which is the town of Cushing in the US state of Oklahoma. In pre-COVID-19 times, the crude was delivered, the buyer accepted it and he/she carted the crude away to a refinery for it to be processed. Cushing, with a crude oil storage capacity of around 70-80 million barrels, never saw storage fill up.

But these are not normal times, the storage capacity at Cushing is almost full today. And with the Coronavirus-imposed lockdown, oil consumption is minimal. According to one estimate, of the 100 million-odd barrels being used up daily before the COVID crisis, some 30 per cent is no longer needed. No planes are flying; there are hardly any cars on the road; there are fewer ships and less consumption of oil-derivative products such as plastics and other polymers. Global oil consumption, which was around 95-110 million barrels of crude oil almost every day before the virus hit, is now barely a third of previous consumption, if not less.

Here is the critical thing to understand about crude and its production: An oil well is not like a water tubewell. You cannot just “switch it off.” Moreover, the physical characteristic of crude oil is more akin to tar than petrol. While there are exceptions, Brent crude is particularly light and the most preferred one by oil refineries. Most crude oils are thick and if not kept at a certain temperature and pressure — which is why many oil wells use steam to force crude out — will quickly turn into a thick sludge and at lower temperatures, solidify.

Simply put, “switching off” an oil well will almost certainly make the crude useless. Even if it recovers, it will cost both money and time to do so. Most of the time, oil companies will need to spend months to redrill the same well. Thus, this limits the amount oil producers can drop. Most oil wells can only reduce production to maybe half, sometimes less, depending on the characteristics of the crude being extracted.

If Saudi Arabia and Russia could stop production, they would, but the fact is that they cannot. The same holds for shale fracking, which is popular in the US. Stop, and the hydraulic fracturing will close. So you cannot “turn off the taps” for any sort of oil and gas production. And right now, production, even at reduced numbers, is far exceeding demand. While there are no proper estimates, over-capacity is in the range of 50-60 million barrels per day, according to the most pessimistic numbers.

You cannot just burn the oil off, that would just give Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg an opportunity to make it back into the headlines. You store the oil but with the world going into the second month of reduced consumption, the fact is that we are running out of storage space.

Almost every country has filled their strategic oil reserves to the brim and oil traders are running around across the world, trying to find large storage tanks. So much so that old, dilapidated oil tankers are being brought out of mothballs and anchored just to store crude oil. Large fuel tank “farms,” as they are called near ports and refineries, are full. Farms are being rediscovered in the strangest of places. There have been requests to reopen storage facilities in Zimbabwe, for example.

So with nowhere to store the crude oil, what does a buyer do? He/she would obviously try to get rid of that oil, to the extent that they would pay someone to take

the oil. And yes, we could look at trading algorithms going crazy but in essence, that is exactly what happened with WTI.

Now, other types of crude, like Brent, allow you to take delivery anywhere. This is the reason why they were not hit by the lack of storage capacity in one town. But any oil trader will tell you that while you could find maybe a couple of million barrels of storage here and another five million there, the world is almost out of places to store crude oil — on land or offshore in supertankers.

The “delta”, which is the difference between the prices of WTI and other types of crude, is too high to be sustainable. Therefore, people feel that all types of crude oil prices will collapse, whether oil producers like it or not. Already, Brent crude, which fell 24 per cent in the previous session, touched $15.98 a barrel, its lowest since June 1999.

With nowhere to store the oil, the prices of Brent crude may also go in the negative, if not this week, definitely by the end of the month. No matter how you slice it or dice it, global demand is not going to recover anytime soon, maybe not until the middle of 2021. Oil prices have slumped by around 80 per cent this year as the pandemic has spread across the world. The viral outbreak has caused fuel demand to drop by roughly 30 per cent worldwide.

But is this a golden opportunity for India? No. Our country, too, is running out of storage space. There are no tankers left to store crude, our strategic reserves are full and current demand is abysmally low. Sure, there could be a slight decrease in pump prices even with far higher excise duties, but the oil business, as we have known it from the time of the 1973 oil crisis after the Arab-Israeli Yom Kippur war like so many other things, is never going to be the same again. What this means for the petrodollar economies of Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Arabian peninsula is something that will now have to be added to the geopolitical chaos that the virus has wrought on the world.

9,23-4-20,Robot with human touch,"As robots take over frontline duties for Covid-19 patients, it is time to look at AI’s potential in healthcare

As healthcare personnel on the frontline of humanity’s war against the Coronavirus fall prey to it daily, more and more countries around the world are beginning to bank upon Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI-powered robots to fight the pandemic. Even though the scientific community, technocrats and even techpreneurs like Elon Musk have time and again warned mankind against the possibility of AI and robots costing people their jobs going forward and creating mass unemployment, right now they are partnering with the human race and playing a major role in the fight against COVID-19. In fact, robots seem to be a good option in fighting any infectious disease in the future. Right from AI predicting the spread, interpreting and analysing data to robots replacing humans in hospital wards to save medical personnel from infection, we are living this science fiction scenario for real. For instance in the US, one of the major COVID-19 hotspots of the world, robots are replacing clinicians in hospitals, helping disinfect rooms, providing telehealth services and are processing and analysing test samples from patients. In fact, doctors even used a robot to treat the first person diagnosed with COVID-19 in Everett, Washington. The robot in question was equipped with a stethoscope to take the person’s vitals and a camera for the doctor to communicate with the patient through a large video screen. AI systems are also helping doctors identify COVID-19 cases through CT scans or X-rays at a rapid rate with high accuracy. Italy and China, too, have used robots to deliver healthcare and minimise contact with Corona positive cases. In India, hospitals in Kerala, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu have used robots for monitoring patients in isolation wards and for delivering food and medicines to minimise contact with doctors. AIIMS, whose healthcare professionals have borne the brunt of the virus during treatment, is now mulling using robots in its Delhi and Jhajjar facilities where COVID-19 patients are being treated. The Milagrow Humanoid ELF that AIIMS intends to use enables doctors to monitor and interact with COVID-19 patients remotely. Patients in isolation wards can also interact with their relatives from time to time through this robot. ELF can navigate around the ward independently and record the activities in high definition video and audio. The advanced humanoid features eyes with emotion and open application programming interface (API) for further development and customisation. There may not be the human touch but there is no lack of human emotion and intent. Milagrow iMap 9 is a floor disinfecting robot that can navigate and sanitise the floors without any human intervention. It can destroy virus spores on floor surfaces using sodium hypochlorite solution, as recommended by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The robot moves around autonomously without falling while planning its own path.

Globally, AI is at the forefront of Coronavirus vaccine and drug research, too, as it has the ability to scan billions of papers and researches in a short while and collate data, thus saving researchers and scientists a lot of grunt work and time taken to come out with a probable cure. Perhaps, that’s the reason why vaccine trials can take place sooner than estimated. However, the use of robots in healthcare is nothing new and has been around for over 30 years. Robots have been used to perform simple laboratory tests or highly complex surgeries, either independently or as an aid to a surgeon. They are also used in hospitals and labs for repetitive tasks, in rehabilitation, physical therapy and in support of those with long-term conditions. AI has been around in the diagnosis of diseases like cancer and heart ailments. In fact, its use is enabling review and translation of mammograms 30 times faster with 99 per cent accuracy, reducing the need for unnecessary biopsies. Plus, what about the health apps and wearable monitoring systems that we use? This is all AI-powered and we don’t even realise how deeply-entrenched it has become in our lives. As science makes rapid strides each day, more possibilities of the use of AI and robots in healthcare are opening up. AI and robots are even being used to provide end of life care to senior citizens and interact with those who live alone to sharpen their minds. The possibilities are endless; it only needs a real human mind to unlock them.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/robot-with-human-touch-2020-04-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/robot-with-human-touch.html
10,23-4-20,Jiobook,"Facebook’s investment of $6.5 billion into Reliance Jio in the middle of Corona crisis will boost confidence in the economy

It will be a huge deal for any large Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to come into India in times when the country is in the midst of a global public health emergency. This, while the economy itself is shuttered and has shred to tatters Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambition of turning the country into a $5 trillion economy by the end of his second term. But the Rs 43,574 crore ($5.7 billion) deal by American social media giant, Facebook, which has acquired 9.9 per cent stake in Reliance Jio, the country’s newest telecom operator, is the second-largest single investment after Reliance Industries’ $15 billion deal with Saudi oil major Aramco. The Saudi deal has now been put on hold, thanks to Indian authorities. Of course, with the collapse in global crude prices, it remains to be seen whether the Saudi deal will still go through.

The partnership between Jio and Facebook will not only allow the telecom operator to reduce its debt drastically, assuming that the funds will go to the company and huge investments are made into next-generation 5G networks. It will also transform other sectors such as retail, education, entertainment, media as well as the payments industries in the country. And while a deal like this, coming at a time when the world is facing a crisis it has never seen before, is welcome manna from heaven, it must be carefully scrutinised by the authorities concerned so that a monopolistic position is not acquired by Reliance in these sectors. This might make Mukesh Ambani bristle but it would also serve Reliance’s purpose if the deal is above board. The persistent accusations of favouritism, which have always dogged every move made by India’s leading industrial group, could be allowed to dissipate. This will also serve Facebook well. The American tech giant has been trying to get a piece of India’s huge payments market through its extremely popular Whatsapp messaging service. With anti-Chinese sentiment likely to hit the Alibaba-promoted leader PayTM, the expected Whatsapp payment service could get a leg-up on the competition. At the same time, with Reliance Retail using Whatsapp and its network of local kirana stores, this could transform the online retail space. Authorities as well as the Government need to ensure that a level-playing field is provided for all players. It must also be seen that the huge amount of money poured in by Messrs Ambani and Zuckerberg is not allowed to skew the market.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/jiobook-2020-04-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/jiobook.html
11,23-4-20,Livelihoods in the lurch,"In the weeks after the shutdown, only 285 million people were working in the country as against the 404 million employed before the pandemic struck

Globally, more than 25 million jobs would be threatened due to the spread of the Coronavirus. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimates that four out of five people (81 per cent) in the global workforce of 3.3 billion are currently affected by full or partial workplace closure. The US, UK, Canada and most of the European and Asian countries have begun to register huge job losses, leading to a significant rise in their unemployment rates. The ILO, in its report COVID-19 and the world of work: Updated estimates and analysis, describes COVID-19 as the “worst global crisis since World War-II.”

The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Kristalina Georgieva says the world is faced with the worst economic crisis since the “Great Depression” of the 1930s.

Most of the world’s informal workers, who account for 61 per cent of the global workforce or two billion people, are from developing countries and they would be the worst-affected in this scenario. There are severe concerns for low-paid and low-skilled informal workers in low and middle-income countries, where the industries and services have a high proportion of such workers as they lack any social protection or safety net. As per the ILO report, sectors such as food, retail, wholesale, business services, construction and manufacturing have experienced falling production and losses in employment hours and numbers. Combining 1.25 billion workers employed in these sectors, over one-third (37.5 per cent) of the global workers are at high risk.

The Indian economy, especially the informal or unorganised sector, has been witnessing an unprecedented slowdown in recent months. This scenario has been aggravated by the lockdowns imposed by the Government to stem the spread of the Coronavirus.

Such has been the impact of the shutdown on the employment scenario in the country that a report by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) says that in the weeks after the lockdown, only 28 per cent or 285 million people were working out of the total working-age population of 1,003 million, which was way lower than the corresponding figure of 40 per cent or 404 million workers before the pandemic struck.

This indicates that in the first two weeks of the lockdown, around 119 million workers lost their jobs in the country. The CMIE report also indicates a significant increase in the unemployment rate in March, which at 8.7 per cent is way higher than the Government’s unemployment estimate of 6.1 per cent in 2017-18. Understandably, these numbers indicate that the current nationwide lockdown has been the biggest job-destroyer ever in the history of the country. However, these estimates only reveal the impact on employment during the lockdown period and should not be considered a permanent loss of livelihoods. Many of them would be able to get back into the saddle after the lockdown is over and economic activity starts picking up again.

According to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), 2017-18, about 90 per cent or 419 million people are engaged in the informal sector, out of the total 465 million workers, in the country. The magnitude of informal workers in the rural areas at 95 per cent is much more than it is in urban areas at 80 per cent. This is primarily because 62 per cent of informal workers are engaged in agricultural activities in rural areas as against eight per cent in urban areas. This will have a lesser impact on their livelihood as against those 92 per cent informal workers who are engaged in urban areas in non-farm sectors. It is these estimated 419 million informal workers who are at the risk of losing their livelihood and falling into deeper poverty.

The analysis from the unit record data of the PLFS 2017-18 shows that in urban areas, about 93 million informal workers are involved in five sectors that are most affected, namely, manufacturing (28 million); trade, hotel and restaurant (32 million); construction (15 million); transport, storage and communications (11 million); and finance, business and real estate (seven million). As many as 50 per cent of these informal workers are engaged in self-employment, 20 per cent are casual workers or daily wagers and 30 per cent are salaried or contract workers without any social safety net. Due to the lockdown, all economic activities (with the exception of essential and emergency services) related to physical labour at workplaces are banned. Therefore, about 93 million urban informal workers in these five sectors have been most hit. This is the largest informal sector worker group next only to agriculture and allied activities and constitutes the size of populations greater than most of the countries in the world like the UK, Australia, Japan and so on.

Besides these informal workers, there are many people involved in the organised sector (unregistered firms) who may be not jobless at present but could find themselves without a job after the lockdown period is over if enterprises refuse to take them back. Many self-employed people like street vendors and other small entrepreneurs may not be left with the capital to restart their businesses and many may not return from their native places.

Of these, the casual workers are the most vulnerable due to the unpredictable nature of their work and daily-wage payments, which are highest in the construction sector. So, all these regular salaried or contractual employees, those who are currently not working, and skilled workers and petty shopkeepers, who may be sitting idle at home or have returned to their native places or staying in shelter homes, may not be able to recover their jobs once the lockdown period is over.

The only silver lining in this dark job scenario is the fact that the pandemic has created a boom for the gig economy, (such as online delivery services) and highly-skilled professionals and technology interface sectors. However, their contribution to the workforce is estimated to be too minimal to substantially offset the overall losses in jobs in the country. At the end of the lockdown, it is estimated that less than one-tenth of the workforce, those in regular salaried jobs, in essential services and businesses will continue to receive their regular income. There will be further lay-offs or trims in salaries or perks.

Going forward many Government employees’ salaries could be revised downwards and in the private sector, adjustments would be done owing to non-revenue generation. However, some sectors like essential commodities supplies, insurance, automobile and healthcare would actually see a rise in demand and revenue, resulting in hikes in remuneration.

So, the Government today has the dual challenge of providing immediate assistance to informal workers, who have lost their jobs and to those who are already unemployed and are looking for jobs. Apart from assisting informal workers, who are migrants, their families need to be considered, as they await the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana 2.0 to be rolled out soon. However, the big drawback is that there is no proper national level registry for people involved in informal jobs or sectors, such as vegetable vendors, construction workers, rickshaw pullers, auto-rickshaw drivers, temporary staff and so on. There is an urgent need for these registries to be instituted and updated, using latest digital technologies and innovations, along with a dynamic unemployment registry to provide direct economic (universal basic income), health (universal coverage) and other necessary contingency protection and security support. The Centre must fast-track the payment of delayed payments to each public and private enterprise in this time of crisis. Further, the utility bills of the most vulnerable must also be paid for by it.

Also, to ensure that each ward (84,420 in 4,378 cities) and each Gram Panchayat (2,62,734 in 6,975 blocks and 706 districts) are fully equipped to serve the populace, each of them must be provided with emergency funds from the existing schemes like the Swachh Bharat Mission and Jal Jeevan Mission. The Government must join forces with its resilient private sector, non-profits, citizens and faith institutions willing to steer through these turbulent times.

In totality, in the existing relief and monetary aid, the masses have been left out from the Government’s care, which is its primary duty. This shortcoming must be plugged as soon as possible and comprehensive, pan-sectoral reforms for the 21st Century must be undertaken to create the New India of our dreams.

12,23-4-20,Epic leadership lessons,"Like in any tough and challenging situation, COVID-19 will bring out great leaders in all spheres — the country, society, organisations and at home

As the Coronavirus continues to wreak havoc on the world, the West is adopting some age-old Indian traditions like greeting people with folded hands and the use of ayurveda. As we battle the biggest common enemy of mankind, it is crucial for us to go back to our roots and give the world the much-required leadership lessons that we have acquired from one of the greatest Hindu scriptures, the Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Arjuna and his guide and charioteer, Lord Krishna.

Walk the talk: Not only in the Bhagavad Gita but also in the great Indian epics, Mahabharata and Ramayana, leading by example is envisioned for a great leader. No matter how hard it is, a leader should walk the talk. This has been beautifully brought out in chapter three of Karma Yoga verse 21: “Whatever action is performed by a great man, common men follow in his footsteps. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.” India was one of the first nations to organise a countrywide 21-day lockdown which was later followed by many others. This was quite a feat given the size of the country and its population of 1.3 billion. Now, this lockdown has been extended till May 3. It is true that several sections of society, particularly migrant workers, had to undergo tremendous suffering due to the shutdown but this decision had to be taken for the benefit of the country, else the virus would have been uncontrollable. A good leader takes tough decisions when it is required. Indians collectively changed the global perception of being undisciplined and disorganised and by and large followed the directives of the Government. Several countries and global organisations like the World Health Organisation (WHO) have praised India’s response as comprehensive and robust and have lauded our huge efforts towards prevention and spreading of the virus through increased surveillance, testing protocols and isolation procedures.

Mutual association: One of the most important concepts of well-being is coexistence and interdependence and a great leader should incorporate the same in his governance style. Man cannot survive alone on this planet, so it is his responsibility to take care of the environment, plants and animals. The shanti (peace) mantra from Krishna Yajurveda Taittiriya Upanishad shows the importance of mutual association: “Om. May he protect us both together; may he nourish us both together. May we work conjointly with great energy, may our study be vigorous and effective. May we not mutually dispute. Om. Let there be peace in me. Let there be peace in my environment. Let there be peace in the forces that act on me.”

All countries have to work with each other to solve the greatest problem, the pandemic, which they are facing together. India has again taken a lead in this regard in its fight against the Coronavirus. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the first world leader who called for collective action against Covid-19 at the SAARC and G-20.

Developing a sense of equanimity: Chapter 2, verse 48 of the Bhagavad Gita throws light on samatva or equanimity. It teaches us that a true leader performs his duties keeping the best interests of society in mind. He might take some tough decisions, which may be successful or could fail. But in either situation, a leader keeps his cool. The lockdown was appreciated as a tough but necessary step to stop the spread of the pandemic. But the Government was also criticized for the hardship suffered by the migrant workers. According to a survey by Jan Sahas, a civil society organisation, most of the labourers are worried about lost jobs, lack of food, illness and the inability to return to their hometowns and villages. The recent suicide of a labourer in Gurugram, leaving behind four children, wife and parents, is a grim reality of how these daily wage labourers are becoming victims of the lockdown. In addition, many small businessmen and traders are also suffering as their establishments are closed, with no revenue coming in and bills, loans and salaries pending. Bigger businesses with huge costs are also grappling with the problem of liquidity. Professionals are worried as organisations lay off people. Leaders are faced with a catch-22 situation and having the virtue of samatva during these difficult times makes the difference between a great commander and a weak one.

“This, too, shall pass,” is a Persian adage that shows the temporary nature of everything. The eternal hope is that this mayhem caused by the Coronavirus will also become a thing of the past. We will go back to our normal lives but after learning very important lessons about respecting our freedom and responsibility towards nature and civil society alike. And like with any tough and challenging situation, COVID-19 will bring out great leaders in all spheres — the country, society, organisations and at home — who would work harder to stay on top of things, explore and pursue innovative solutions to problems and inspire other members to stay positive.

13,23-4-20,"Ganga, an enigma waiting to be deciphered","With a history of curing big diseases, research in Ganga’s water can unlock a door to the value of bacteriophage in our ancient river systems and spur fresh conservation efforts

Not even a hundred years ago, the water of the Ganga river contained the “Ninja virus.” Ninja, as we all know, means warrior. Scientists call them bacteriophages and the people of India call it Gangtva.

Gangtva is the main element of the Ganga due to which the water of the river never gets spoilt even if it is kept for months.

There was a time when this bacteriophage was found in four major rivers of the world but over the centuries, due to the material pursuits of mankind, the remaining three rivers and their civilisations vanished. Until about 20 years ago, this Ninja virus was present in the six tributaries of the Ganga. Then we built a dam named Tehri and diverted the confluence of two streams, the Bhagirathi and the Bhilangana, into the lake made for the dam.

The result was that the bacteriophage present here got destroyed in the still water of the lake. Significantly, Gangtva still exists in the Bhagirathi upstream.

This element is also found in the Alaknanda, Mandakini and Pinder rivers. But it has reduced so much in its strength that its capacity to clean the dirty water has become ineffective. And yet again, the reason for this change is the stagnation of the river water.

Nevertheless, some of the historical facts that still make us proud of the Ganga are that Mughal emperor Akbar used to drink Ganga water only and the British used to carry the Ganga water in vats during their voyages because it did not go bad for months. However, in an increasingly scientific world, the scientific aspects of this water have not been discussed too often.

In the shadow of the Coronavirus, we must try to understand its scientific side as well.

Over a hundred years ago, there was a major outbreak of the dreaded cholera in the States of Bihar and Bengal. Such was the fear of the disease at that time (because it was highly infectious and much like the COVID-19 of today, they did not have an effective cure for it), that people thought they would catch the disease if they touched the corpse.

People were throwing corpses by the thousands into the Ganga as no one was willing to cremate them out of fear of contracting cholera.

At that time, a British scientist Hakins, who was doing research in India, feared that cholera would spread everywhere along the banks of the Ganga river. But after a while he noticed that nothing of this sort had happened.

Intrigued by this phenomenon, he researched and found that cholera bacteria could not survive in the Ganga water and something was destroying it.

As this research progressed, it was found that even the bacteria of dysentery, meningitis, tuberculosis and severe diseases could not survive in the water of the Ganga.

This research was going on to reconstruct the medical importance of Ganga but before it ended, the world saw the invention of antibiotics, which turned out to be the cure for most diseases known to man at that time. This magical discovery pushed back the research work on the Ganga water. Ironically, over the ages, people developed antibiotic resistance due to its overuse and senseless self-medication by people. As a result, we increased the doses of antibiotic that we consume and accordingly the disease-causing bacteria also increased its strength. Consequently, scientists all around world are facing the biggest challenge of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Now scientists and doctors are once again looking towards the Ganga. But today’s sad truth is that the Ganga water around Kanpur, Allahabad, Varanasi, Patna and Kolkata has not been able to kill any bacteria. On the contrary, some new and dangerous findings are coming out from areas around Kanpur.

Scientists from the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, IITR, Lucknow, on the basis of their experiments on the Ganga water, claim that they have found a bad bacteria, which is responsible for producing diarrhoea, blood dysentery and typhoid. And this bacteria is rapidly growing in the water from Bithur to Shuklaganj in Kanpur.

But these findings are in areas where the water is most polluted and stagnant.

Devendra Swarup Bhargava, a scientist associated with IIT Roorkee, has researched that Ganga’s Gangtva still exists and is present in its foothills. He said that the Ganga has the ability to absorb oxygen. Some research has also found that bacteriophages are also effective on some viruses.

Dr Bhargava wanted to do research on the virus itself but he was not supported by the Government in this effort.

Regarding the Coronavirus, Dr Bhargava claims that chlorine is most capable of protecting humans against this virus. Therefore, its use should be increased at the Government level. The Institute of Microbial Studies, in its research on the Ganga water at Rudraprayag and Devprayag, found that 17 types of viruses were found in the water here, which are capable of killing bad bacteria. However, the water in these places is also not considered completely pure. The National Environmental Research Institute (NEERI) did huge research on the capabilities of Ganga water, which found that it has the potential to kill 20 diseases, but this report was not allowed to be published under pressure from antibiotic companies and the scientists who were involved in the research had to give it up.

The Corona crisis is a clear indication that in future, too, mankind could face many unknown bacteria and viruses. We would not even know what they are and how many would be deadly. Investment on virus research is needed today.

Nature has honoured us with the most magnificent river on Earth and we could not even handle it. All the scientists working in this field believe that the Ganga will enable us to fight every biological battle if we just let it flow.

14,23-4-20,CM to officials: Strictly enforce lockdown,"Directing district officials to enforce total lock- down wherever there were 10 or more COVID-19 patients, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that there should be no relaxation in the norms in these districts and lockdown should be enforced strictly.

“Lockdown means total lockdown. It should be followed strictly and the violators should be dealt with strictly,” Yogi said while addressing a high-level review meeting on lockdown at his office in Lok Bhawan in Lucknow on Wednesday.

The chief minister said that no one should suffer due to non-availability of foodgrain and the supply chain should be maintained during lockdown. “Any lapse in supply chain will not be tolerated,” he warned.

“Those involved in the supply chain should be medically examined and food quality of community kitchens should be checked regularly,” he said.

Stressing on the immediate need of increasing testing facilities, Yogi said that every divisional headquarters should have a testing lab. He also emphasised on extensive training of medical technicians to expedite sample testing so that people got quality treatment.

The chief minister directed the health officials to clear pending sample testing and seal those private hospitals which did not adhere to COVID-19 safety norms.

“A medical officer should be assigned to inspect facilities and other logistics in private hospitals and medical colleges,” he said.

Yogi was informed that 77 per cent of wheat crop had been harvested across the state and 30 lakh quintals of wheat had been purchased of which 62 per cent was purchased at the doorsteps of the farmers.

“There is no shortage of labourers for harvesting as migrant labourers, who have completed quarantine, are engaged for it,” the officials told the chief minister in the meeting.

Yogi was also informed that 6,980 industrial units were functional in the state, engaging over 1.25 lakh workers, while around 12,027 brick kilns were functional where 12-15 lakh labourers were working.

Besides, 96 of the 119 sugar mills are in the process of crushing cane and had engaged over 60,000 workers.

The chief minister ordered that there should be no restriction of movement of finished goods and raw materials for industrial units or MSMEs under Central government’s norms .

Yogi said that natives of other states residing in UP would be sent back to their respective states if they desired. He said that the administration should ensure there was no gathering of people during sehri and iftar during Ramzan and all facilities should be made available.

Meanwhile on the COVID-19 front, the chief minister directed that all hospitals should have oxygen facilities for patients at dedicated COVID hospitals while testing labs should be extended at divisional level.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-to-officials--strictly-enforce-lockdown.html

Singh said that the BJP is accusing Congress party of engaging in politics but the truth is that it is the BJP which is engaging in politics. “We are in opposition and only doing our duty of attracting attention of government on the problems faced by the government,’’ he said.

Infrastructural works for the Kumbh Mela to be held here in 2021 were stalled due to the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19. However, after issuance of necessary orders, the work has now been resumed.

Earlier, the Kumbh Mela officer Deepak Rawat held a meeting with officials concerned to review the situation. Later, orders were issued following which highway construction work has been resumed.

Additional Mela officer Harbir Singh said that basic highway works have been resumed while observing social distancing and other guidelines. No new works will be started until the situation gets better, he added.

It will be recalled that before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the nation, members of the religious fraternity had expressed concern at the slow pace of Kumbh Mela works. Considering this, the state government had started expediting the works but it was soon stalled due to the lockdown enforced to contain COVID-19.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/kumbh-mela-works-resume-in-controlled-manner.html
17,23-4-20,Property tax payment comes to a halt in MCD,"The number of people submitting the property tax online to the Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) is negligible during the second phase of lockdown period. According to officials, locals have almost stopped depositing the tax this month.

Last month, the MCD tax superintendent Dharmesh Painuly informed that in the initial days of the lockdown, online submission of property tax had increased by 10 per cent. However, in the recent past, only one or two people deposit the tax online on a daily basis. ""The property tax collection now is almost negligible. Mostly only one or two taxpayers submit the tax per day and for the last few days that has stopped too. No one has submitted property tax after April 18,"" said Painuly.

This year the municipal corporation set the target of collecting the property tax of Rs 50 crore but so far, according to Painuly, the MCD has collected about Rs 43 crore. In spite of extending the period of rebate of 20 per cent over six times, hundreds of locals have still not submitted the property tax. According to sources, only around 50,000 people have submitted the property tax so far.

Meanwhile, the personnel of MCD tax section are also assisting the district administration in the community surveillance of 1800 people in Dehradun. According to Painuly, the team of 14 people has been helping administration for more than a week on the directions of district magistrate Ashish Kumar Shrivastava.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/property-tax-payment-comes-to-a-halt-in-mcd.html
18,23-4-20,Ordinance brings relief to saviours victimised amid Covid-19 pandemic,"Currently as we battle the COVID-19 pandemic, none of the professions is under as much stress as the medical profession. In spite of taking considerable risk, working in odd conditions and at odd hours, some of them are facing verbal and physical violence. Verbal aggression or violence is so common that none of the doctors can claim that he has not encountered such behaviour from the patient and his acquaintance for no fault. In this scenario, the Central Government has brought an ordinance to end violence against health workers with provision for imprisonment of up to seven years for the guilty along with a fine.

Violence against doctors is not new, but manifold increase in is alarming in our country. A study conducted by the Indian Medical Association found that 75 per cent of the surveyed doctors had suffered some form of physical violence while being on hospital duty. Several such incidents have been reported from India in past.

The recent violence faced by a doctor during COVID-19 pandemic has again elicited the focus of the media and the political establishment.

The authors being orthopaedic surgeons having experience of dealing with patients after simple to life threatening accidents, have also faced such abuse. Most of the doctors nowadays are working under some sort of fear, be it legal or physical abuse.

How can you expect best services to be delivered to the society in such an atmosphere? It becomes difficult to understand how health workers are at fault while taking risks and performing their duties door to door amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

In one recent case, after reaching the suspected patient’s house, the situation escalated to such an extent that the health workers faced the risk of mob violence which could be potentially fatal.

It seems such people are prejudiced and hostile not only towards health workers but the entire government machinery trying to control the pandemic. It is a very dangerous trend for the nation.

We personally feel that the situation is pathetic as this kind of the street justice is commonly seen in medical practice nowadays. If the situation is still not controlled, it is and will be a serious threat to the medical profession.

No one can say for sure that he will not need medical advice during his life from womb to tomb. Violence against doctors is a heinous crime.

The perpetrators should be penalised and a strong message should to be sent to the society that anybody breaking the law will have to bear the consequences, so that others are discouraged from committing the crime.

The union health minister, Dr Harsh Vardhan, has taken quick action during his tenure to make a bill for violence against a doctor or healthcare personnel as a non-bailable offence with a minimum of 10 year jail term and Rs 10 lakh fine. Once it is implemented, it will be a milestone to control this menace.

The Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed the general public to appreciate the efforts of all the doctors, paramedical staff, policemen and media persons by Tali- Thali programme for five minutes on the day of Janata curfew.

This appeal was honoured by most of the people of the country irrespective of caste, creed, class, religion and region to show their gratitude to the frontline workers in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

Contrary to this there have been incidents of abuse against several health workers and frontline workers in India who are exposing themselves and doing their duties to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Though the incidents of violence against doctors and other health workers are few but they are eye opening.

At times, it seems the gratitude shown by the public on March 22 was to make Tik-Tok videos and use it as a photo-opportunity to be posted in the time of lockdown.

We can imagine, that had these violent outbreaks not been during the pandemic there would have been nationwide protest by the doctors and the other health workers but the medical fraternity has again shown restrain.

It should be mentioned that medical workers who were victimised forgave the abusers and also visited the same places the next day to help the same abusers.

In spite of all the hue and cry about the Indore incident another shameful incident happened in Moradabad, UP where a team of health workers and police personnel were attacked by a mob when they went to screen the COVID-19 suspects.

It is known that this viral infection can be fatal with the virulence of COVID-19 reported to be 10 times more than that of any viral infection. Here, one would like to re- emphasise that more than 20 lakh people are infected and around 1.4 lakh people have died all over the world since the emergence of COVID-19.

In spite of taking all precautions of personal safety including the use of personal protective equipment even in developed nations like Italy and Spain, 10 % of the health worker had contracted the COVID-19 infection and died. Considering the socio-economic and health infrastructure of India, one can imagine how difficult it would be for health workers directly involved with the COVID-19 patients to give them health care services.

In general the response from the society had been the same as our Prime Minister, Narendra Modi anticipated in his appeal to the nation to give all kind of support to all health workers and frontline workers to increase their morale in the fight against the fatal COVID-19 virus. But contrary to the PM’s appeal, things have gone in very different ways in various instances.

It was painful to learn from mass media about certain neighbours and landlords of the health workers misbehaving and evicting these medical professionals out from their rented apartments citing unscientific reasons. We can imagine how disgusted these hard working saviours must have felt when after sacrificing so much to save the life of fellow citizens, they were treated like modern day untouchables. It is pathetic and shameful that the saviours are being victimised during this unprecedented health emergency.

The authors hope that the ordinance brought by the Centre will facilitate the desired change in the situation being experienced by health workers. Strict legal provisions and their proper implementation are necessary to safeguard the life of the saviours who are fighting against the fatal virus.

19,23-4-20,Health department bans sale of tobacco products in State,"As a step against spread of Covid-19 pandemic, State health department on Wednesday banned sale of tobacco products across State on the assumption that their use would lead to a tendency to spit causing the spread of the virus.

An official of the department said that the decision has been taken in view of fear of spread of the virus due to spitting. Chewing and use of tobacco can lead to serious diseases like Covid-19, encephalitis, tuberculosis etc. In line with the Union home ministry directive dated April 15, 2020 for Covid-19 management making spitting in public places a punishable offence and as per the power enshrined under Disaster Management Act 2005 article 10 (2) sub clause (1), the government has decided to ban sale and use of tobacco products in public places till further order.

The directive issued on Wednesday to the deputy commissioners and police heads in the 24 districts cites that the use of tobacco is a global health concern and the spitting after use of tobacco products is a public health hazards in view of Covid-19 pandemic and sale of tobacco products like cigarette, bidis, pan masala, areca nuts, khaini, jarda etc and directs for strict compliance of the order with immediate effect.

The East Singhbhum district administration has decided to ensure prohibition of sale of tobacco products across the district.

38,23-4-20,"Plight of cobblers, barbers, tailors in lockdown","The plights of cobblers, barbers and tailors are simply incomprehensible in the second phase of the lockdown. Sources said these lots are just forgotten lot.

Sources said the Ministry of Home Affairs has given leeway to plumbers, electricians, fishmongers, mutton chicken sellers, now book sellers, electric fans sellers etc in this lockdown but is conspicuously silent on the hardships of cobblers barbers and tailors.Palamu MP V D Ram said, “It is time that smaller trade people like barbers, tailors and cobblers etc may also be given some freedom to start their earning but with all care and caution of social distancing and personal hygiene.”

A civil society activist Akhtar Zama said, “Few days back a DC of a district of Jharkhand was shown doing haircut of her hubby, which was most religiously carried by some esteemed newspapers as if it was the most essential of duties that the lady DC was performing.”

Zama said our heart goes out to daily wagers like road side shoe menders, barbers, tailors, khomcha wala whose sufferings just are not noticed either by State government or by MHA as well. He said milk & vegetable sellers are luckier tradesmen but not these as two of these trades cobblers and barbers come invariably from Dalit community.Zama has urged MHA to include self-employment tradesmen in ease of curbs like plumbers and electricians. He said the barbers must take all precautions like sanitized scissors, sanitized towels, sterilized shaving brush etc for hair cut or shaving as in USA if reports are to be believed than a large number of coronavirus infections spread from saloons of the barbers there in that country.

Sources said these people used to earn their living a day by working across the streets like the shoe menders who used to sit on the pavements repairing or polishing shoes etc but with the lock down a shoe maker is all without work, wages too.Similar is the fate of the barbers who in happier times used to do many works like hair cutting, shampooning, hair do, shaving, body massage etc. Village barbers have had their own way like asking customers to sit on a brick and then his head used to have hair cut or a total shaving etc. Sources said some rich people run saloons for men and women here where barbers used to work on contract. These saloons are equally shut.No less miserable is the life of the tailors who are more pathetic as assistants in their tailoring shops too are jobless.

Secretary, State Disaster Management department Amitabh Kaushal, when asked if thee tradesmen like cobblers, barbers and tailors can have ease of curbs to eke out their living a day, said, “The State government strictly follows the guidelines of Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and beyond this nothing doing. MHA guidelines are our only code of business.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/plight-of-cobblers--barbers--tailors-in-lockdown.html

41,23-4-20,HINDALCO encourages sustainable mining in State,"In a bid to encourage sustainable mining Hindalco has not only tried to improve the environmental conditions but also created an ambience with available natural resources which are helpful for creating livelihood for the villagers around.

It is the first time that the concept of ‘Bio Park’ has been developed at Hindalco’s Mining area, which is different from regular plantation, greening work and reclamation process. The concept is that all types of plants can be grown in mined out reclaimed land.

A Nakshatra Van or Garden depicts Indian calendar’s division of 6 seasons, 12 Months (astral signs) and 27 constellations ( Naxtras). The important plants planted in Nakshatra garden are Amla, Gular, Jamun, Khair, Jai Sita Ashok, Mango, Neem, etc. Also, a butterfly garden has been developed in this park area to prove that it is conducive for survival of such delicate species. The Garden has been conceptualised with all natural plants which helps these butterflies to breed and grow

A rose garden has been set up to enhance the beauty of the park. This garden contains various rose species such as double centre rose, crimson glory, salmon pink, peach coloured, fuchsia micro mini rose and maroon patio.

With the similar concept of growing other useful plants in mined out areas, plantation of medicinal plants, spices, strawberries and tea have also been tried at the bio park. Some of the medicinal plants and Spices plants at the garden are- Prickly chaff flower, Bael Tree, Indian aloe, Sweet basil, Long pepper, Sweet Chiirata, Night flowering jasmine, Thorn apple, Thatch grass, Mint, Lemongrass, All spices, ginger and cloves.

In continuation to the Naxtra garden at a lower elevation two mined pits were allowed to be filled up with rain water and two ponds were developed. These two ponds are now utilised to develop and established Pisciculture and Duck farming.

Earlier it was never possible to grow fish in these mined out pit water ponds. So the pond water was scientifically tested and treated with the experts and then pisciculture was developed. Ducklings also were grown in these ponds which has given a perfect synergy to the ecosystem.

A Bamboo Pavilion is designed keeping in mind to conduct various training programs of nearby communities and visualisation of this can promote bamboo farming. The farmers and artisans can make it their source of livelihood.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hindalco-encourages-sustainable-mining-in-state.html

Power Finance Corporation (PFC), Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) Limited and other Financial Institutions should provide loans to power sector at reduced rates of six percent per annum for bridging revenue gap, suggested Capt Amarinder.

He also recommended extension of RBI moratorium on repayment of outstanding loans and interest from the current three to at least six months. In addition, the applicable interest rate on deferred payment should be considered at concessional rate, he suggested.

Further, the advice issued by Union Ministry of Power to Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs), power generation companies (Gencos), or power transmission companies (Transcos) not to use coercive measures to recover dues and continue supply or transmission of electricity being an essential service should be extended to at least six months.

Among other suggestions made by the Chief Minister are reduction in coal prices, waiver of GST levied on coal cost and Railway freight for 2020-21 financial year, waiver of capacity or fixed charges payable on account of capacity not scheduled due to load crash as well as 50 percent reduction in Inter State Transmission Charges for 2020-21 financial year, or at least the next six months.

The Chief Minister further called for maximum limit of six percent per annum on late payment surcharge on delayed payments to Generators and Transmission licensees for the year 2020-21.

In a letter to the Prime Minister, he also sought reduction in renewable purchase obligation (RPO) for previous and current fiscal, and withdrawal of must-run status for Renewable Energy (RE) power projects for 2020-21 financial year, or at least the next six months, so that low-cost power from alternate sources can be supplied.

Alternatively, all renewable energy power generators may be given option to supply power at weighted average variable cost of power purchased from conventional sources of power during the month, he added.

Asserting that his Government was committed to providing uninterrupted 24x7 power supply to the people of Punjab, especially to all Healthcare Institutions, Captain Amarinder said the entire workforce of the power sector is currently mobilized round the clock.

However, due to restrictions imposed to control the spread of Covid-19 pandemic, the communities, business and consumers are facing economic hardship and unable to pay their dues to the State Discom Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL).

“This has led to cash deficit and financial hardship for the Discom, impairing its ability to meet daily expenses.

60,23-4-20,Wild animals roam free in UT as humans remain under lockdown,"They say “every dark cloud has a silver lining”. The last four weeks in the ‘City Beautiful’ has marked an unusual activity with wild animals venturing out into human habitations in broad daylight.

However, no incident of animal fatality or a man-animal conflict has been reported in Chandigarh.

With deserted roads and the near-silent ambience all around due to imposition of curfew in the city amid Coronavirus pandemic, the wild animals are becoming bolder, straying outside forests areas and going back without creating any conflict.

The curfew was imposed in the city on March 24 to ensure social distancing and stem the spread of coronavirus.

The Union Territory of Chandigarh, which is a joint capital of two neighboring States of Punjab and Haryana and also, shares borders with them, has a protected area—Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary, spreading over an area of 26 sq km of forest land spanning the plains at the foothills of Shivalik range. Among other forest areas in the city include Lake Reserve Forests and Patiala-Ki-Rao Forests.

Most recently, a leopard had strayed into a posh residential area in the city from Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary. The feline was captured and released back into the wild, with a relief that there was no untoward incident involving humans.

A day later, another leopard was spotted in a southern sector and is stated to have moved towards nearby Mohali district of Punjab.

Not only this, many astonishing videos of wild animals frolicking through empty roads in the city have surfaced in the past four weeks.

A herd of Sambars running on deserted city streets was never a common sight but with the residents locked inside due to curfew, mandate quarantines and social distancing, the animals have now got a bit more room to wander through the roads in Chandigarh, which boost of lush green trees on both sides.

In another video, a herd of Spotted Deers was seen walking freely on a road here. Peacocks with their features out, strolling the city streets is another common wonderful sight for the residents now.

Abdul Qayum, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Chandigarh while talking to The Pioneer says, “With curfew in the city keeping residents behind closed doors, the wild animals appear to have gotten a free reign on the otherwise busy roads of the bustling city. Interestingly, there has not been any complaint on UT Department’s widely publicized man-animal conflict helpline during curfew period.”

“We are spotting herds of Sambars, Spotted Deers, strolling on city roads since the curfew period began. But just two complaints related to a snake sighting and a bat dying due to electrocution was received, that too, a long time back, he adds.

Elaborating on the leopard sightings, Abdul says, “On March 30, a leopard that had strayed into a plush residential area was captured and later, released in the forest area. The next day, another complaint related to hearing of leopard growling and sighting was received from southern sectors but the leopard could not be trapped and seems to have moved towards Mohali area. After that no complaint has been received on our helpline.”

Earlier, the average number of calls received and responded to on the man-animal conflict helpline were three to six on a daily basis.

Sample this. 127 complaints were received on the helpline in April last year, 104 in March, 111 in February, 105 in January. During 2018, the number and trend of complaints remained almost similar with 137 complaints registered in January 2018, 99 in February, 126 in March, 141 in April, 129 in May, 136 in June, 181 in July, 159 in August, 160 in September, 168 in October, 128 in November and 108 in December.

The statistics shows complaints received were related to Sambars, Nilgai and Monkeys venturing into human habitations and also related to Snakes, Bats, Owls, Eagles, Peacocks, Pigeons among other species.

The wildlife experts say, while there is enough food in the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary here, the animals often venture close to human habitations due to the absence of fencing at some places to restrict their movement to the forests areas.

Before curfew, the mere presence of wild animals near human habitations was reported as conflict.

In November 2018, the shocking pictures of a Sambar, lying in a pool of blood and crying for help after being hit by a vehicle at Sector 3/4/9/10 roundabout in November 2018 had brought alive the debate on the issue of human-animal conflict in the city.

Sadly, more than 40 wild animals were killed on the city roads in the past one year. And, the fatalities included Nilgai, Sambars, Peacocks, Porcupines among other animals.

Nonetheless, the coronavirus pandemic has now altered the urban life with the secluded roads and eerie stillness of public spaces resulting in emboldened wildlife, appearing to reclaim their lost territory. Perhaps, one might now seek silver linings in the narrative of nature healing itself and wildlife having a gala time.

Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary, a home to Sambars and other deer species According to the data with the UT Forests and Wildlife Department, there are 9 species of mammals and 63 species of birds in the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary.

Sambars in the Sanctuary were estimated between 1000 to 1200 while peafowl were between 900-100 in a census exercise, conducted nearly a decade back.

Spotted Dear (Chittal), Pangolin (ant eater), Wild Boar, Jackal, Small Indian Civet, Jungle Cat, Porcupine, Langur, Rhesus Money, Indian Hare, Common Mongoose among other mammals are also the inhabitants of the Sanctuary.

Leopards are a frequent visitor to the Sanctuary from forest areas of neighboring Haryana.

The varieties of reptiles including Snakes like Cobra, Rat Snake, Common Krait, Russell’s Viper, Indian Python and Common Monitor (Gho), Freshwater Turtle also inhibits the Sanctuary.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/wild-animals-roam-free-in-ut-as-humans-remain-under-lockdown.html

It also focuses on practice of good habits like hand washing, hygiene, sanitation, social distancing etc. to prevent infection.

64,23-4-20,"Pay Rs 3K to each stranded migrant, CM urged","The Citizens’ Action Group on Corona has sought hassle-free repatriation of stranded migrant workers in different parts of the country to Odisha.

Notably, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs on April 19 has issued an order that lifted some restrictions on intra-State movement of stranded migrant workers, but kept the restrictions on inter-State movement unchanged. Also Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik announced that the State Government was initiating a process of registering workers from the State who are stranded outside and want to come back.

The forum said despite all this, there is little progress with respect to facilitating the return of stranded migrant workers to their native places. In fact, by reinforcing the ban on inter-State movement of the workers, the MHA has heightened the trauma and sense of uncertainty among millions of these suffering workers and their families.

It demanded constitution of a National Task Force that should be set up on priority to work with States, design and execute a plan for the return migrant workers.

It urged the Union Government as also the Governments of all States to desist from any action that might amount to forceful or invluntary confinement of these workers.

While welcoming the initiative taken by Chief Minister Patnaik to start enlisting migrant workers from the State who want to return home, it sought more clarity on this, especially with respect to a timeline for the return of the workers, the modalities of their return and, most importantly, their economic rehabilitation.

CM Patnaik should consider an immediate cash transfer of Rs 3,000 to each stranded worker, over and above the Rs 2,000 that he/she would get after returning home, it said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pay-rs-3k-to-each-stranded-migrant--cm-urged.html
65,23-4-20,Four districts in Punjab win battle against coronavirus,"In the battle against Covid-19, four districts of Punjab have emerged victorious even as the fight against the invisible enemy worsened in another part of the State.

With the State registering a spike of 26 cases in the past 24 hours taking the total tally to 277, three districts — Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar (Nawanshahr), Roopnagar (Ropar), Fatehgarh Sahib, and Moga — have succeeded in beating the coronavirus.

Shedding the Covid-19 affected tag, these districts have, as of now, no active cases, with all the patients, tested positive for the deadly virus, have fully recovered and discharged.

With this, total 15 districts, out of the 22, in the State are affected with the coronavirus.

Till date, State’s three districts — Bathinda, Fazilka, and Tarn Taran — have succeeded in keeping the coronavirus at bay, and fortunately remaining “green”.

The most commendable success story was of Nawanshahr, which had witnessed the state’s first Covid-19 casualty on March 18, and has reported a total of 19 cases. What is more, the district has not reported a corona case since March 26.

Other than the one death, all 18 patients in the district have been recovered and discharged with the latest being the 16-year-old boy. He was discharged from the SBS Nagar Civil Hospital on Wednesday after the report of his second sample came negative.

With 18 active cases at one point of time, SBS Nagar emerged as the coronavirus hotspot. The district’s first case was of 70-year-old granthi from Pathawala village Baldev Singh, who died of cardiac arrest on March 17, and tested positive a day later.

Till then, he had infected many others in his family, among his relatives and friends, spreading over the districts of Nawanshahr, Hoshiarpur, and Jalandhar.

Baldev Singh, who had travel history of Germany via Italy, had infected 27 people, of 14 are from his own family including his two-year-old grandson.

Nawanshahr Deputy Commissioner Vinay Bublani attributed the success in containing fresh cases and curing coronavirus patients to people’s support and proper implementation of the containment plan, contact listing and door-to-door surveillance of the district.

“People have been very supportive to our efforts, and they know whatever we are doing is in their interest only. Without their support, it would not have been possible for us,” said Bublani.

Bublani said that the containment plan was implemented effectively in the district, that has a population of about six lakh, and 15 villages were properly sealed to check the spread of coronavirus.

“With the support of the Civil Administration staff, health workers, police and the locals, the contact listing of positive cases was carried out extensively so that any patient would not remain unattended,” said Bublani, adding that at least 700 samples have been tested for coronavirus in the district so far.

Regarding recovery of the patients, he said: “Proper counseling of patients was done at the civil hospital so that they always remain in positive frame of mind. Our efforts have always been that they should not feel that they were acute patients. We always told them that they can be treated.”

Building the district’s case for being in ‘green zone’, the state’s Special Chief Secretary Karan Bir Singh Sidhu said: “No one has tested positive in the district since March 26. The 18th and the last Covid patient discharged today after recovery. A district is entitled to be labelled green, if there is no new positive case in the last 28 days….It is almost there.”

In Moga too, the four patients, originally hailing from Mumbai’s Andheri, have also tested negative for Covid-19 for the second time, and they would be discharged on Thursday. All of them were tested positive on April 7, after they returned to Moga from Andheri via Delhi.

Interestingly, the district has not seen a fresh corona case since past two weeks. Directions have been issued for launching intensive tracking, screening, testing and treatment drives to check spread of corona virus in the district. The last patient in Ropar, out of the total three reported in the district, has also tested as negative on Wednesday.

“The main core factor is the people’s willingness to follow the rules. The sooner they realized, the sooner is path to recovery. The stories of people recovering have lifted the spirits and willpower of patients under treatment,” Ropar Deputy Commissioner Sonali Giri told The Pioneer.

“But there was amazing synergy of civil administration, doctors, police and the civil society. People cast doubts on the government’s working. But this time, government is working on the forefront and people are trusting us,” she added.

Ropar, in all, recorded three cases, of which two have recovered and one succumbed to deadly virus. Joining the group is Fatehgarh Sahib district which is also “free from any Covid patient”. Sharing the information, Sidhu said: “The second Tablighi Jamat lady tested negative for the second time. She’s being discharged from the Gian Sagar Isolation faculty. The district thus has no Covid-19 positive case, as of now.”

In fact, Hoshiarpur district had also reported no positive case of coronavirus since the past 21 days.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/four-districts-in-punjab-win-battle-against-coronavirus.html

74,23-4-20,Frightening corona has civilised human race too,"For the first time in the history of mankind, an extremely fragisle, near-dead organism has shaken up the mighty human race with unprecedented fear of death. No wonder, the entire mankind has come together to fight the micro-size thing with whatever method that comes to mind. There have been several corona viruses ravaging mankind in the recent past. They invariably cause flue initially and eventually damage the respiratory system by affecting the lungs with acute pneumonia. The same type of Chinese SARS virus of 2002 was very deadly but much less infective. The RNA genetic material dupes the host human cell and gets itself re-replicated by the confused host very fast. Besides, infected humans may not show even the mildest symptoms until ten to fourteen days have passed by, which poses the biggest problem.

The virus gets destroyed easily with soap solution because its protective outer cover is only a thin layer that gets ruptured in the soap solution in about 15-20 seconds. The infected individuals can release the virus into air by sneezing and, unless protected with masklike covers, people nearby can get the pathogen on their bodies.

It is also true that twenty per cent of the infected persons get sick severely and out of these twenty, a mere five per cent seek intensive care with respiratory support. That’s where the panic occurs as the number of the infected people is so big that hospital beds, healthcare personnel are found badly inadequate. Sophisticated lifesaving ventilators have not been in place anywhere in the world, for which the elderly and the less immune left to die.

Humans have been exposed to more than two hundred types of flu viruses that are routinely ignored. But this crown-like virus has taken the human race by the tail and shockingly unawares.

Wise people and spiritual leaders say nature is taking strong steps to teach the human race a lesson for ravaging all its resources and creations without any effort to have these replenished. The planet has evolved systems that promote and support ‘trans-species democracy' which has sustained life forms equitably. The greedy humans have broken that divine equilibrium and, hence, the horrific wrath of nature on display.

The more frightening fact is the current corona virus is not the last one. There is more coming, one after the other. No virus has any life of its own and so never gets killed by any drug or medicine. The only way to remain safe is to keep the virus warded off or hide away from it. Further, ‘herd immunity' is difficult to attain in this case as at least 60-70 per cent of the population needs to be infected to develop that universal fighting power, which is not possible in the current crisis.

From now on, more hospital beds with support system to manage pneumonic conditions are the only way out. Lastly, vaccines that actually are the only answer cannot be developed overnight. At least one full year is required to come up with a fully-tested vaccine.

Though the greatest enemy of mankind in thousands of years, corona has also done a great deal of good to the planet. Excessive fear has now forced industries to reduce output of luxury items, combustion machines of all types to run at less than five-per cent capacity and human beings to eat simple home food thereby dissuading big food chains to close shops that consumed so much of natural resources indiscriminately. Consequently, carbon emissions have declined substantially. Amusingly, fossil fuel vehicles are literally locked. The air around the planet has now turned as clean as in the early 19th century.

Internationally-acclaimed virologist Dr Ian Lipkin says the Covid-19 pandemic is only a beginning. The humanity has more such crises coming. Only behaviour change can keep us alive and healthy. Much of unnecessary economic activity has to decrease to retard the rising rate of health crises. Deforestation, population migration, international trade and travel have all reduced to zero now and should remain low when minimal normalcy returns. People are back home and less sick as is evident from empty beds at hospitals. Since the Spanish Flu, there have been many epidemics such as AIDS, Nipah, Chikungunya, SARS-1, MERS, swine flu and more, but none of those could hammer fear into the arrogant and unruly human mind as much as corona has done. Human beings should not forget the way corona has civilised them to come together against one invisible enemy only to survive. They have to remain humble and give up the criminal way of devouring away all that has been so caringly created by nature across millions of years!",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/frightening-corona-has-civilised-human-race-too.html

Never before have we seen such outpouring of trust and affection for the police. You should indeed be proud of your police force.”

The signatories to the letter include Sarat Chandra Misra, Amiya Bhushan Tripathy, Nimai Charan Padhi, Bipin Bihari Mishra, Suchit Das, Gopala Chandra Nanda and Manmohan Praharaj.

Praising the CM for his ‘far-sighted’ leadership, ‘skillful handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and ‘timely decision’ the seven former DGPs have complimented the State police for enforcing the lockdown measures effectively ensuring smooth movement of emergency workers and essential goods without which the pain suffered by people would have multiplied many times over.

“We have even found that police teams have visited construction sites and bastis to map population most vulnerable to hunger and to ensure that no one is left out from the food-safety ring-fence, all these going beyond their normal call of duty. That extra and proactive efforts are one major reason why Bhubaneswar has not witnessed the heart-wrenching images that have emerged from other parts of the country of thousands of deprived souls revolting against the lockdown measures,” the letter read.

The former DGPs have made a particular mention of the empathy and sensitivity with which the situation is being managed by the police in Bhubaneswar-Cuttack.

They have suggested that the morale of the police force needs to be kept high since future course of events remain unknown and the police force must be well looked.

Primarily a coastal inhabitant, though the western reef-heron birds are found at some inland water bodies in southern Europe, Africa and parts of Asia and India, it was never found in Odisha.

This bird species is found in two plumage colour forms, all white morph and dark grey morph. The morphs can also occur with intermediate shades of grey as per the age. The white morph generally looks like little egret. However, the bird spotted at Chilika has a larger and curved beak, Behera said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rare-bird-species-spotted-first-time-in-chilika.html

He laid emphasis on the mental stress that students, who have appeared in the annual examinations like HSC, Plus Two and Graduation, are currently going through due to the COVID-19 outbreak and nationwide lockdown.

“This is the period during which the results of HSC, Higher Secondary and Graduation examinations usually come out.

While holding a meeting with specialist doctors and Chief Secretary Sukhdeo Singh, the CM said that the State government has taken all necessary steps for prevention of corona epidemic and better treatment of infected patients. Constant contact is being made with the specialist regarding what is the need of medicine and necessary equipment for the treatment of corona infected patients and how they can be maximized.

The specialist doctors, on the occasion, suggested initiation of storage of plasma from recovered Covid-19 patients for possible treatment of critically-ill Covid-19patients of Jharkhand.

They said that the treatment of patients suffering from Covid-19 by Plasma Therapy by using plasma procured from patients recovered from severe or life threatening COVID infection is already practiced successfully in many countries. Even USA FDA has recently approved this therapy.

The DCGI has also approved the clinical trial proposal for Convalescent Plasma Therapy submitted by ICMR on 17th April 2020, they added.

Considering the rapid increase in number of Covid-19 patients in Jharkhand, it is proposed by Blood Bank, Raj Hospitals, Ranchi that like other states of India viz. Maharashtra, Kerala and Delhi, Jharkhand should also initiate this Therapy in State by approaching ICMR for permission of same in Jharkhand State.

“Fortunately, COVID patients of our State have now started recovering and if we will start preserving plasma now, we will be able to cure critical patients of Covid-19 in coming days. As per today’s scenario, one unit of plasma will save at least two patients of Covid-19,” said the doctors.

For this the Blood Bank, Raj Hospitals has volunteered for social mobilization, counseling and convincing Covid-19 recovered patients for plasma donation, its collection, storage and distribution on honorary basis (free of cost) for public interest.

As this will need the support of RIMS, the team has requested the CM to discuss the above proposal with RIMS management and give a final shape to this project for the sake of people of Jharkhand.

Meanwhile, the CM said that despite having limited resources, we are fighting with full power and getting some success. “While we are increasing the number of screening centers to prevent infection, we will now do a large number of tests even faster through rapid test kits and pool testing. The encouraging news is that we are now increasingly making people infection free,” he said.

So, both together were pegged at Rs 6,850 crore. Nearly 70 per cent revenue is expected from industrial and commercial establishments.

With lockdown in force, industrial and commercial establishments are almost closed down and power utilisation has gone down badly.

Over the years, Odisha has developed installed capacity 7,070 MW power, which includes thermal power of 3,067 MW, hydro power of 2,085 MW, renewable power of 637 MW and Central sector power of 1,281 MW.

Out of the installed power capacity, the power available in the State has gone up to 3,285 MW. But the power demand has gone down to 2,405 MW, thanks to the corona crisis.

Industrial and commercial consumers were the major user of power and their demand has gone down drastically due to COVID-19 lockdown. So Odisha has 880 surplus power, which the authorities are surrendering to the Inter State Generation Stations (ISGS).

While revenue generation has gone down, working capital loans on both Gridco and Discoms are on rise.

As on March 31, 2020, the outstanding working capital loan on Gridco and Discoms was at Rs 6,033 crore. The Discoms are also facing problem in receiving the dues from the State Government and its various organisations.

Above all COVID-19 has come as a major blow for the Discoms and power utilities, which are providing 24x7 power supply to consumers.

Take for example, the Discoms are to receive Rs 480 crore from the Government departments. An amount of Rs 1 370 crore is payable to various generating companies like NTPC, OHPC, IPPs by Gridco which procures bulk power for the Discoms.

An amount of Rs 5,374 crore of Gridco is outstanding with various Discoms. Cesu, Nesco, Wesco and Southco owe an amount of Rs 2, 158 crore, Rs 997 crore, Rs 1,217 crore and Rs 1,002 crore respectively. Gridco owes Rs 48 crore to PGCIL.

Different industry associations have been representing to the Chief Minister for several concessions like waiver/ remission/ deferment of minimum charges, fixed charges and electricity duties etc. If any of the demands are met and if the Gridco were to resort to borrowings from financial institutions like REC/ PFC and in view of the falling revenue collection, it may be necessary to consider State subsidy, because passing of any additional burden by way of tariff will be objected by the consumers who are hard pressed otherwise. Even the borrowings will entail Government guarantee.

A judicious mix of market borrowing and State subsidy is required to tide over the situation in the State, states a former Chief Secretary.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/covid--power-sector-worst-hit.html

To inspire, reassure and educate people, especially migrant labourers on combating the deadly pathogen, the SHO not only provides two time meals to around 1300-1400 people but also makes sure that no toddler be deprived of milk.

Talking to The Pioneer, Kumar said, when the lockdown started, Delhi Police faced massive exodus of migrants from Anand vihar inter state bus terminal. Migrant laborers were faced with the very existence since they were jobless and penniless.

""So to develop a sense of security I involved beat staff of my area and identified and made the data of around 1300 daily wage labourers who were living in JJ clusters of Hasanpur, IP extensions district park, Allah colony, Majboor Nagar and Chander Vihar Colony,"" said the SHO.

112,23-4-20,Cong questions BJP on lack of Central assistance,"Differences between the Central Government and the State Government came to fore when Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee (JPCC) questioned the State Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on lack of Central assistance to fight against COVID-19.

Talking to media JPCC Chief and Food Supply Minister of the State, Rameshwar Oraon said that MPs, MLAs and other leaders of the BJP are busy in campaigning loudly that the help of crores of rupees is being given to Jharkhand by the Central Government, but the truth is that till now only Rs 284 crore have been made available to Jharkhand Government in the name of Covid-19 disaster relief.

""In this hour of crisis, extensive steps have been taken by the State Government to provide food grains to every family. The efforts are going on to provide help to migrant laborers, students, patients and their families trapped in other parts of the Country, besides efforts are being made to provide food grains and health facilities to the people in this hour of crisis. Apart from this, lakhs of people will return after the lockdown has to be arranged for them to stay in the quarantine centers, in such a situation, the assistance of only Rs 284 crores by the Central Government is insufficient,"" said Oraon.

JPCC Chief said that the drum is also being beaten loudly by the BJP leaders that free food grains are being provided to Jharkhand while the truth is that the lifting of food grains from Food Corporation of India and then its distribution through dealers in the State, the State Government has to spend around Rs 84 crore. In such a situation, the saying of BJP leaders that food grains are being provided completely free of charge is beyond the truth, he added.

Oraon said that he also does not want to say that no relief has been provided by the Central Government but it would be fairer to say that the assistance provided by the Central Government is very less and special package to backward states like Jharkhand must be given.

He added that the BJP leaders are fasting in their house from 10 am to 4 pm, they can understand how much truth is there in their claim but if they fasted in front of Raj Bhawan, then people could also see that they are fasting for so long.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-questions-bjp-on-lack-of-central-assistance.html

114,23-4-20,Bid to restart electric crematorium,"The nationwide lockdown that brought 1.3 billion people to standstill has apparently caused positive changes in the environment. In State Capital, what district administration and Ranchi Municipal Corporation had failed to do in 10 years, the COVID-19 crisis has made area around Ranchi Electric Crematorium in Harmu encroachment free. Few days back the area was encroached by khatals (cowshed) and those selling sugarcane juices, but in lockdown period most of the encroachers has left making the area encroachment free.

Now as the area is free from any type of encroachment, efforts are on to restart the electric crematorium at Harmu Mukti Dham, which has been lying defunct since 2010.

Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) Municipal Commissioner, Manoj Kumar said, “As the area around electric crematorium at Harmu Mukti Dham is now encroachment free we have decided to restart it again. On this issue we had discussion with Marwari Sahayak Samiti.”

The municipal commissioner further said that the Marwari Sahayak Samiti, which also manages the affairs of Mukti Dham in Harmu has come forward in running the electric crematorium and they have put forward three demands.

The Samiti had demanded to make the area encroachment free, construction of portion of broken boundary wall and payment of electric dues of Rs 24 lakh. The municipal commissioner claimed that they have assured the Marwari Sahayak Samiti that most of the demands will be met so that the crematorium becomes functional within 30 days.

Sources said that as the area is encroachment free, the RMC will soon issue a tender for construction of broken boundary wall also electric dues will be made by municipal body.

Sources said that the Marwari Sahayak Samiti has discussion with company for running the crematorium. Sources said that instead of electric, gas based machine will be installed in the crematorium. Sources said that gas based crematorium is fuel efficient and is much modern than electric based.

The crematorium was built in 2007 at a cost of Rs 3 crore and inaugurated the next year. But only 11 bodies could be cremated there since people stopped using it, some claiming they preferred the traditional way of lighting a funeral pyre. By 2010, it became completely defunct.

In absence of electric crematorium traditional way of lighting a funeral pyre is practiced. More than 300kg wood is required to cremate a body. Thus, keeping environmental aspects in mind, electric or gas based crematorium is worth welcoming.

Sources said that on earlier occasion too, the RMC had taken steps to restart electric crematorium, but due administrative hurdles the project failed to start.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bid-to-restart-electric-crematorium.html

Senior BJP leaders including State BJP president Deepak Prakash, BJP legislative party leader Babulal Marandi, former chief minister Raghubar Das, MLAs and MPs, Ranchi Mayor Asha Lakra among others sat on day long hunger at their residences.

Marandi said that the main aim of the day long hunger strike is make the State government aware of its responsibilities. Marandi said, “Today is 29th day of lockdown. The State government has failed in its attempts. The corona testing rate is very slow as compared to other states.” The BJP leader claimed that number of such people who don’t have ration card or bereft of any welfare schemes is large.

Targeting Soren government, Marandi said that despite adequate food grains provided by centre the State government has failed in reaching to these people. According to Marandi the number of such people is around nine lakh and they play a major role in State’s development. The BJP said that on several occasion he had given advices to government on how to tackle the situation but the state government has not paid heed to his advices.

The BJP leader also appreciated the efforts of doctors, nurses, para medics, police personnel, municipal workers who in such distress situation have come forward in rendering selfless service.

Moreover, Marandi on this issue had also written a letter to Chief Minister Soren asking him to take steps to bring back students struck in Kota and people at hospitals outside State. The BJP senior leader said that thousands of students are struck in Kota and other states and their problems have increased after the lockdown period has extended. Marandi in his letter had stated that after Uttar Pradesh Government brought back students from their state struck in Kota to their state it is expected from government that they too will take any such initiative.

Das said that the State Government is not bothered to take care of migrant laborers, workers, students and those who are stranded outside the state; the protest is against Soren government so that they awake from slumber.

BJP State president Deepak Prakash tweeted, “Our fast is against Jharkhand government’s indifferent attitude towards children, workers and their families trapped in other states due to lockdown.

City based 31- year old Sudipt Raj has secured the 14th position in the sixth JPSC exams.

Son of former IAS Officer Sunil Kumar Singh, Raj always wanted to follow his father’s footsteps and serve the people. “I had appeared for the BPSC exam in January 2019 where I secured the 63rd position but did not join the service as I wanted to work in Jharkhand and serve the people here. My father helped me prepare for the exam and has been my guiding light all along. With my parents blessings and God’s grace I cleared it in the first attempt itself,” said Raj

In the coming years Raj intends to guide the underprivileged children and help the civil services aspirants. “Apart from the department that I am allotted by the government, this is something I want to do at a personal level. Not everyone has access to good education and I would want to help them with whatever I can,” he added.

As a hobby Raj likes to maintain a regular diary which he feels helps him reflect upon himself and improve as a person. He is also very fond of reading motivational and inspirational books.

Born in Ranchi, Raj completed his schooling from Delhi Public School in 2007 and his graduation in History Honours from Ranchi University in 2012. He is also a trained commercial pilot from US Flight Academy, Texas, USA. He came back to India in 2014 and worked with Delhi based company called Imperial Air as a co- pilot.

“I switched careers from that of a pilot to a civil servant because working in different departments and getting posted in remote areas will give me an opportunity to work at the grass root level. My father has always been my ideal and source of inspiration. I have always seen him fulfilling his duties and also often working till late in the night. My sister and brother in- law who are IRS Officers based in Mumbai guided me all along. My mother also has always encouraged and pushed me to follow my dreams,” Raj said.

“He always aspired to be a civil servant and I feel he has achieved his ambition. I expect him to serve the people as best as he can while also keeping the interest of the state and the country as a priority. I hope he will work for the welfare of the poor and the done trodden,” said the proud father.

Meanwhile, students of Deoghar SDPO Vikas Chandra Shrivastava have also cleared the exam with flying colours.

122,23-4-20,India backs UN call for fair access to vaccine,"India has co-sponsored a UN General Assembly resolution that called for a fair, transparent and equitable access to essential medical supplies and any future vaccines developed to fight Covid-19 that has claimed over 177,000 lives and infected more than 2.5 million people.

The 193-Member General Assembly adopted the Mexico-drafted resolution ‘International cooperation to ensure global access to medicines, vaccines and medical equipment to face Covid-19’ by consensus on Monday. Pakistan was among the small minority of nations that did not sponsor the resolution.

India was among the 179 nations co-sponsoring the resolution that called for ensuring “ fair, transparent, equitable, efficient and timely access to and distribution of preventive tools, laboratory testing, reagents and supporting materials, essential medical supplies, new diagnostics, drugs and future Covid-19 vaccines” to all nations, particular developing countries.

“ India has proactively engaged in supporting global availability of medicines and drugs by means of international cooperation and development partnerships. Also, we are facilitating the sourcing of global supplies of multilateral agencies such as UNICEF in the face of Covid-19. We were therefore glad to co-sponsor this important initiative,” India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin told PTI.

India has been at the forefront of sending essential medical supplies and medicines such as anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine to several nations, with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres saying he “ salutes” nations like India that are helping other countries in their fight against the devastating pandemic.

A number of countries, including the US, Mauritius and Seychelles have already received the drug. In its neighborhood, India is sending the drug to Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, The Maldives, Mauritius, Sri Lanka and Myanmar.

Pakistan said it has some reservations on the resolution drafted by Mexico.

124,23-4-20,Cop accompanying medical survey team attacked in MP,"A police officer was allegedly attacked in Madhya Pradesh’s Sheopur district on Wednesday when he asked members of a family to produce a man so that he could be checked for coronavirus symptoms.

Assistant Sub-inspector Shreeram Awasthi (52) sustained a head injury when a stone hit him, the police said.

Four persons were arrested in the case and the stringent National Security Act would be invoked, said a senior official.

Sub Divisional Officer of Police Virendra Kushwaha said a medical team went to examine Gopal Shivhare (21) after it learnt that he had returned from Indore, one of the major pandemic hotspots in the country. Gopal’s father Gangaram told the team that his son was not at home and he was fine. He refused to summon his son.

Team leader Dr Pawan Upadhyaya then rang up Daswami police station for help, Kushwaha said.

ASI Shreeram Awasthi reached the spot with three policemen and asked Gangaram to bring his son for examination to Daswami, 140 km from the district headquarters, the SDOP said.

There was an altercation, and Gangaram, his wife Geeta and their elder son Ashish allegedly hurled stones at the police. Awasthi was hit in the head leaving him profusely bleeding, the officer said.

125,23-4-20,SC quashes order providing 100% quota in teaching job in scheduled areas,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday quashed the January 2000 order of the erstwhile State of Andhra Pradesh which provided 100 per cent reservation to the Scheduled Tribe candidates for the post of teachers in schools in the scheduled areas, saying it was “ arbitrary” and “ not permissible” under the Constitution.

A five-judge Constitution bench, headed by Justice Arun Mishra noted that providing 100 per cent reservation would be “ unfair” and “ unreasonable” and no law mandates that only tribal teachers can teach in the scheduled areas.

Referring to the 1992 Indra Sawhney judgement, popularly called the Mandal Commission verdict, the apex court said it was emphasised that the founding fathers never envisaged reservation of all seats and 50 per cent quota shall be the rule.

It noted that as per the 1992 verdict, extreme caution has to be exercised and special case has to be made out for exceeding 50 per cent reservation limit.

“ There were no such extraordinary circumstances to provide a 100 per cent reservation in scheduled areas. It is an obnoxious idea that tribals only should teach the tribals. When there are other local residents, why they cannot teach is not understandable,” said the bench, also comprising Justices Indira Banerjee, Vineet Saran, MR Shah and Aniruddha Bose.

“ The action defies logic and is arbitrary. Merit cannot be denied in toto by providing reservations,” the bench said, adding that the order providing 100 per cent reservation is “ arbitrary, illegal, impermissible, and unconstitutional” .

In its 152-page verdict, the top court said it is apparent that despite more than 72 years of attaining independence, “ we are not able to provide benefits to the bottom line, i.E., downtrodden and oppressed classes. Benefits meant to such classes are not reaching them” .

It said that those belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were making a struggle for freedom, various rights in the country and they have also suffered discrimination and remained an “ unequal and vulnerable section of the society” .

It said the basis for providing them reservation was to provide them upliftment and to eradicate their sufferings.

“ We have not been able to eradicate untouchability in the real sense so far and to provide safety and security to downtrodden class and to ensure that their rights are preserved and protected, and they equally enjoy frugal comforts of life,” it said.

The bench, while emphasising on the need to improve the system and ensure implementation of beneficial measures, observed that the right to information system has to be strengthened at the village level and people must know how money meant for development has been utilised.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sc-quashes-order-providing-100--quota-in-teaching-job-in-scheduled-areas.html

127,23-4-20,BJP DAY-DREAMING OF RETURNING TO POWER IN STATE: MAHA HM,"In his bid to “nail the lies” of the BJP about the Palghar lynching incident, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Wednesday released the list of 101 persons arrested in connection with the April 16 incident and charged that the principal Opposition party was seeing “Mungerilal ke haseen sapne” (day-dreaming) of returning to power in the state by politicising the Palghar incident.

On a day when the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) issued a notice to the State Director General of Police over the Palghar incident, the State Home Minister released a list of 101 persons arrested in connection with the Palghar lynching incident and said that there was not even one Muslim among the arrested accused.

Addressing the people across the state through Facebook, Deshmukh said: “In the list of 101 arrested accused in the Palghar incident that I am releasing today, there is not even one Muslim. When this incident was happening, some people were heard saying 'Oye Bas' ( enough stop it), people circulated the video of the incident online and misinterpreted the words as 'Shoeb Bas'. .....It is unfortunate that these words were misinterpreted and the same people tried to give a communal colour to the incident”.

“While giving communal colour, the same people also indulged in communal politics. All this is being done at a time when we are fighting a war against Coronavirus. Our entire police department, health and other departments are involved in the battle against Covid-19,” the minister said.

“This is not the time to indulge in politics. This is the time when all people should come together and fight the battle. It is unfortunate that even in this kind of a critical situation some people are trying to see Mungerilal ke haseen sapne. My request all the people is: please join us in our battle against coronavirus. We need to win this battle. I look forward to cooperation from all people,” Deshmukh said.

It may be recalled that on the night of April 16, three persons, including two Sadhus, were lynched by a 200-strong mob of villagers near Kasa town in Maharashtra’s Palghar district on suspicion that they were thieves.

The villagers first hurled stones at the van, prompting the driver to stop the vehicle. Later, they pulled three persons out of the vehicle and beat them to death in Gadhchinchale village on Dabhadi-Khanwel road, with sticks and rods.

The deceased ---identified as two Sadhus Chikne Maharaj Kalpavrukshagiri (70), Sushilgiri Maharaj (35) and driver Nilesh Telgade (30) were travelling from Mumbai to Surat, at the time of incident.

Deshmukh’s comments should be seen in the context of the efforts by several BJP leaders, including itsnational spokesperson Sambit Patra, to target the Maharashtra government and raise questions about the Palghar incident.

On Monday, Patra had put out two tweets – in one of which he had demanded answers from the NCP and CPI(M) on what were the leaders doing in the unruly crowd that indulged in inhumanly act at Palghar, alleged that the ruling alliance partners in Maharashtra were trying to put the sins of each other under the carpet and wanted to know if it was a murder or a conspiracy. He had also released the video of the incident and the people in Maharashtra could recoginise as to who were in the video.

In his response tweet, BJP’s national Secretary in-charge of Tripura and Andhra Pradesh Sunil Deodhar had said that the people in the video belonged to the NCP and CPM and he went on to identify them.

Meanwhile, acting on a complaint, the National Human Rights Commission ( NHRC) India has issued a notice to the DGP, Maharashtra over mob lynching of three persons in the presence of police in Palghar district on April 16. It has called for a detailed report within four weeks including action taken against the culprits and relief, if any, granted to the next of kin of the deceased.

In its notice, the NHRC has observed: “The incident is apparently indicative of negligence by the public servants. The death of three persons in such a cruel manner by the unruly mob that too during countrywide lockdown, under extra vigil by the administration and police, amounts to gross violation of the right to life of the victims”.

“According to the complaint as well as the media reports, the victims, Sushil Giri and Kalpavriksh Giri, belonging to a sect of Sadhus, were going to attend a funeral when they along with the driver of their car were attacked by an unruly mob on suspicion that they were thieves. The video of the attack on the deceased persons went viral, on April 19, 2020, which showed that police personnel were also present when the victims were being attacked,” a National Human Rights Commission ( NHRC) press release said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-day-dreaming-of-returning-to-power-in-state--maha-hm.html
128,23-4-20,Respite for TN as number of new patients come down to 33,"Number of persons tested positive for coronavirus in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday came down to 33 but the number of patients afflicted with the pandemic in the State reached 1,629. There were 76 new cases of coronavirus on Tuesday evening.

The State saw 27 persons getting discharged from various hospitals on Wednesday. This took the total number of persons cured of the pandemic all over Tamil Nadu to 662, a respite for the administration.

According to a media release issued by the Department of Health on Wednesday, 946 persons are undergoing treatment in various hospitals in the State for coronavirus. The number of causalities due to coronavirus in Tamil Nadu stood at 18 on Wednesday. The Government has set up Stae-level and district-level committees to audit all deaths due to covid 19 disease. An order issued by the Department of Health in this regard said the death audit would help in understanding and lapses if any in prevention and case management.

A disturbing feature in Tamil Nadu is the news that about 35 journalists (mostly TV journalists) have been tested positive for coronavirus. This has resulted in one of the news channels going off the air following the cancellation of transmission. R Rangaraj, president, Madras Reporters Guild, said that it was a matter of concern. “The TV news crew which include the reporter, cameraman and camera assistant travel together in the same vehicle and it is not possible for them to maintain the social distancing stipulated by the authorities. They have to travel to all nook and corners in the city/towns and they become easy targets for the virus,” Rangaraj told The Pioneer.

Another matter of concern is the news that the reporters tested positive for coronavirus had attended the media briefing addressed by Dr C Vijaya Baskar, health minister and Dr Beela Rajesh, secretary, health. There was no press briefing on Wednesday.

M K Stalin, the president of the DMK, warned the Tamil Nadu Government that he would not hesitate to launch an agitation against the State Government’s callous attitude in handling the pandemic. “The news that doctors treating the patients are getting afflicted with the virus and striking work for want of facilities show how unprepared this government is to tackle a pandemic like this,” said Stalin in a statement on Wednesday.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/respite-for-tn-as-number-of-new-patients-come-down-to-33.html

138,23-4-20,Sensex rallies 743 pts as Facebook dials Jio; RIL tops gainers’ chart,"Market benchmark Sensex jumped 743 points on Wednesday, propelled by index heavyweightRIL after Facebook announced it will pick up 10 per cent stake in Jio Platforms for USD 5.7 billion.

Positive cues from global markets and Brent crude oil dropping to over two decade-lows also worked in favour of the bourses here, traders said.

The 30-share BSE index ended 742.84 points or 2.42 per cent higher at 31,379.55. The wider NSE Nifty surged 205.85 points, or 2.29 per cent, to finish at 9,187.30.

Reliance Industries was the top performer in the Sensex pack, rallying 10.30 per cent and contributing over half of the index’s gains.

Asian Paints, IndusInd Bank, Maruti, Nestle India, Hero MotoCorp and HUL were among the other gainers, spurting up to 5.04 per cent.

Only four Sensex constituents ended in the red — ONGC, L&T, HDFC and PowerGrid, which shed up to 5.63 per cent.

“Market rose led by the Facebook deal with Reliance Jio as investors reposed faith in select large-caps amidst shrinkage of economic activity due to the lockdown.

“We witnessed further strength in afternoon trade as the US Senate approved the bill for a further package of $484bn,” said S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP Securities.

BSE energy index rallied 7.42 per cent, followed by auto, FMCG, oil and gas, bankex, IT and teck, which climbed up to 2.57 per cent.

139,23-4-20,"Stocks claw higher on Wall Street, oil prices regain ground","Stocks around the world are clawing higher on Wednesday, and the S&P 500 climbed toward its first gain of what’s been a dismal week.

Even the oil market gained ground. Prices for crude have been turned upside down because of how much extra oil is sloshing around following a collapse in demand. After zig zagging overnight, U.S. oil prices jumped more than 20% after President Donald Trump threatened the destruction of any Iranian gunboats that harass U.S. Navy ships, raising the possibility of a drop-off in oil supplies.

The S&P 500 was up 1.6% after the first half hour of trading, following milder gains in Europe and Asia. Treasury yields also inched higher in a sign of a bit less pessimism in the market.

U.S. stocks, though, are still down about 3% for the week as a rally that had been carrying the market since late March threatens to lose steam.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 367 points, or 1.6%, to 23,386, and the Nasdaq was up 1.9%.

Energy stocks led the market higher, riding the ripple of strengthening oil prices. Halliburton jumped 10% in early trading, while Schlumberger and Apache added more than 9%. All three, though, remain down more than 60% for the year so far

A barrel of U.S. oil to be delivered in June rose $2.86, or 24.7%, to $14.43. It had been close to flat earlier in the morning, before Trump’s tweet. The big gain, though, means it’s recovered just a fraction of its steep losses this year, particularly over the last week. It was at nearly $30 at the start of last week and $60 at the beginning of the year.

Other companies that have been big losers due to the coroanvirus pandemic also rose after offering some slight hints of hope. Chipotle Mexican Grill, for example, said that a key sales figure plunged 16% in March on widespread stay-at-home orders.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/stocks-claw-higher-on-wall-street--oil-prices-regain-ground.html

146,23-4-20,AgustaWestland case: SC dismisses interim bail plea of Christian Michel,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea of Christian Michel James, an alleged middleman arrested in connection with the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam cases, seeking interim bail on the grounds of risk of contracting coronavirus in Tihar jail.

A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and B R Gavai, which took up the interim bail plea through video conferencing, said that as per the criteria fixed by high powered committee constituted by government in pursuance of directions of apex court, the petitioner (Michel) cannot be granted bail.

Advocate Aljo K Joseph, appearing for Michel, said that because of his vulnerable age and overcrowding in jail, he is likely to contact COVID-19 which may be detrimental to his health.

He submitted that Delhi High Court was wrong in dismissing his interim bail plea on the ground that his apprehensions are unfounded.

When contacted about the proceedings, Joseph said, “The bench told me that as per the criteria fixed for release of prisoners in wake of coronavirus pandemic by the High Powered committee, the foreigners lodged in jails cannot be released.”

The High Court on April 7 had dismissed his bail plea saying that the apprehension of Michel that because of his vulnerable age and overcrowding in jail, he is likely to contact COVID-19 which may be detrimental to his health, is unfounded.

It had said, “As regards the apprehension of the petitioner (Michel) being infected by COVID-19 pandemic, it may be noted that the petitioner is lodged in a separate cell with only two other prisoners and thus, is not in a barrack or dormitory where there are a number of prisons.

It is not the case of the petitioner that any of the two inmates residing with him are suffering from COVID-19.

""Hence, the apprehension of the petitioner also because of the vulnerable age and overcrowding in jail that he is likely to contact COVID-19 which may be detrimental to his health, is unfounded.”

In his plea, the 59-year-old Michel has claimed that his health condition was critical and incompatible with the current prison status, especially to cope up with the risk of contracting the COVID-19 infection which could have a lethal effect on him as he is already suffering from serious pathologies.

Michel, extradited from Dubai, was arrested by the ED on December 22, 2018. On January 5 last year, he was sent to judicial custody in the ED case. He is also lodged in judicial custody in another case registered by the CBI in connection with the scam.

Michel is among the three alleged middlemen being probed in the case by the ED and the CBI. The other two are Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa.

On April 1, the apex court had asked Michel to first approach the high court with his plea.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/agustawestland-case--sc-dismisses-interim-bail-plea-of-christian-michel.html

Uber set up the Driver Fund with an initial commitment of Rs 25 crore to support drivers amid the ongoing pandemic.

In response to Uber's appeal to raise an additional Rs 25 crore, more than 23,000 Uber riders and employees contributed Rs 2.15 crore while NGOs and corporations have donated an additional Rs 4.28 crore.

The aim is to generate Rs 50 crore to benefit the driver-partners.

""We are continuing to disburse and we will reach close to Rs 20 crore by the end of this week,"" Pavan Vaish, Head of Central Operations, Uber India and South Asia, told IANS.

""Over the coming few days, we will continue to report fresh contributions and disbursements from the Uber Care Driver Fund,"" he added.

153,23-4-20,"Trump order to bar new green cards, not temporary visas","President Donald Trump announced what he described as a “temporary suspension of immigration into the United States.” But an executive order he is expected to sign Wednesday to implement the change would bar only those seeking permanent residency, not temporary workers.

“I will be signing my Executive Order prohibiting immigration into our Country today,” Trump tweeted Wednesday.

The president said on Tuesday he would put a 60-day pause on the issuance of green cards in an effort to limit competition for jobs in a US economy wrecked by the coronavirus. The order would include “certain exemptions,” he said, but he declined to outlined them, noting the order was still being crafted.

“By pausing immigration we’ll help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens, so important,” Trump said at the White House. “It would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labor flown in from abroad.”

An administration official familiar with the plans, however, said the order will apply to foreigners seeking employment-based green cards and relatives of green card holders who are not citizens. Americans wishing to bring immediate family will still be able to do so, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity before the plan was announced.

About 1 million green cards were granted in the 2019 fiscal year, about half to spouses, children and parents of US citizens.

By limiting his immigration measure to green cards, Trump was leaving untouched hundreds of thousands of foreign workers granted non-immigrant visas each year, including farm workers, health care workers and software programmers.

The Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, estimated that some 110,000 green cards could be delayed during a two-month pause. Trump said he would consider extending the restrictions, depending on economic conditions at the time.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump-order-to-bar-new-green-cards--not-temporary-visas.html
154,23-4-20,Global death crosses 1.8L,"Cases across world reached 2,603,987, out of which 7,12,254 have been recovered so far

The fate of a $484 billion stimulus package was in the hands of the US House on Wednesday as the nation’s death toll surpassed 46,000 and a top public health official warned that a second coronavirus wave could be worse than the current crisis.

It also now appears that the first US death took place in California, three weeks before what was believed to be the nation’s first fatality in Washington state.

The Senate approved the stimulus package Tuesday; a House vote is scheduled for Thursday. President Donald Trump has signaled he will sign it. A majority of the Paycheck Protection Program would direct more than $320 billion to small businesses with $60 billion being set aside for community-based lenders, smaller banks and credit unions to assist businesses that don’t have established relationships with banks.

The financial relief comes as Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned that a combination flu season and second round of the coronavirus next winter could overwhelm the health care system.

Spain: Spain on Wednesday said another 435 people died in the past 24 hours, a slight increase in the figures for a second day running and bringing the overall death toll to 21,717.

Spain has suffered the third-highest number of deaths in the world after the United States and Italy, with infections now hitting 208,000 cases, health ministry figures showed. Monday’s figure of 399 deaths was the lowest in four weeks, but a day later, it rose to 430 with officials explaining the numbers tend to go up slightly on Tuesdays following delays in receiving regional data on weekend deaths.

Italy: Deaths in Italy related to the coronavirus pandemic topped 25,000 on Wednesday. The number of dead and new positives continue to plateau for Italy, the first western country to be hit by the crisis. The civil protection agency reported 437 people had died with the virus in the last 25 hours, a 1.7% increase in the death toll to 25,085. The number of positive cases rose 1.5% to 1,83,857.

Pressure on health services continued to ease, with fewer people both hospitalized and in intensive care. Italy’s interior minister, meanwhile, confirmed that none of some 150 migrants rescued by an aid group and quarantined at sea have tested positive for the virus.

Italy’s Government is looking at ways to quickly legalize unregistered farm workers - both foreign migrants and Italians - so they can harvest fruit and vegetables in Italy’s upcoming spring and summer harvest seasons.

Greece: Greek health authorities say there have been no deaths and just seven new confirmed coronavirus infections in the country in the last 24 hours. The health ministry’s spokesman for the coronavirus, infectious diseases specialist Sotiris Tsiodras, says the total number of deaths in the country remained at 121, while there were 2,408 confirmed infections.

Tsiodras said 55 people were intubated in intensive care units in the country, down from 59 the previous day.

UK: The British Government said 759 more people with the coronavirus have died in UK hospitals, taking the total to 18,100.

The daily increase reported was lower than the 823 in the previous 24-hour period.

The UK’s death toll is the fourth highest in Europe, behind Italy, Spain and France, all of whom have reported more than 20,000 deaths.

However, there has been increasing scrutiny of the UK figures in recent days for understating the actual number of people having died of Covid-19. The numbers don’t include those who have died in care homes or elsewhere in the community.

Germany: Germany’s Health Minister has regulatory approval for the first trial in the country of a vaccine for the coronavirus. Jens Spahn said the trial will involve 200 people ages 18-55. He cautioned the process of fully testing the vaccine would take months.

Germany’s regulatory authority, the Paul Ehrlich Institute, approved the trial for an RNA-based vaccine being jointly developed by BioNTech and Pfizer. Regulatory approval for trials is also being sought in the United States and China. Numerous companies are racing to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus that has infected more than 2.5 million people worldwide and caused at least 178,000 deaths in the past four months.

Iran: Iran announced on Wednesday 94 new deaths from the novel coronavirus but said the cases of people infected in the country was on the way down. Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said the fatalities detected in the past 24 hours took Iran’s overall death toll to 5,391. The number of people infected with the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease rose by 1,194, bringing the total to 85,996. “The gradual downward trend in cases of infections has been maintained,” Jahanpour told a televised news conference.

155,23-4-20,Can dogs detect COVID-19? Canines in training to sniff out virus,"Can dogs detect COVID-19? A British charity believes so, and has begun training canines to sniff out the coronavirus following previous screening success with various illnesses.

Medical Detection Dogs, set up in 2008 to harness dogs’ sharp sense of smell to detect human diseases, started working on the project late last month.

In its training room in Milton Keynes, in central England, the dogs are being intensively trained to sniff out samples of the virus, and indicate when they have found it to receive a treat.

The approach is based on a belief that each disease triggers a distinct odour, which canines are uniquely well-placed to smell. The charity has previously worked with its dogs to detect cancers, Parkinson’s disease and bacterial infections using samples taken from patients.

“We believe dogs can detect COVID-19 and will be able to screen hundreds of people very, very rapidly so we know who needs to be tested and isolated,” Claire Guest, founder and chief executive of Medical Detection Dogs, told AFP. “We have evidence that dogs can detect bacterias and other diseases, so we believe that taking this project forward will make a huge difference to the ability to control COVID-19 spread.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/can-dogs-detect-covid-19--canines-in-training-to-sniff-out-virus.html

158,23-4-20,Report: Covid-19 has deal-making plunging 31 pc to $18.7 bn in Q1,"The Covid-19 pandemic has walloped inbound investments (down 64 per cent) in the first quarter of 2020, pulling down the overall deal-making activities by over 31 per cent to USD 18.7 billion despite a good show by domestic and outbound activities, says a report.

Despite the fall, India saw 87 deals in Q1, securing 15.4 per cent market share in the APAC region, almost on par with 2019 levels, according to the data collated by Mergermarket. The 31.1 per cent plunge in overall deal-making was driven by very low inbound deals which plunged 63.9 per cent, but both outbound and domestic deal spaces remained hectic, it added.

While the domestic deal market saw an 11.1 per cent growth, outbound deals grew by around USD 500 million.

“Deal-making might regain momentum in the second half thanks to steps taken by the Government to attract foreign investors. Medical and e-commerce firms may also become magnet for investment,” the report said.

According to the data, the overall deal-making has been recorded at USD 18.7 billion across 87 deals in Q1, a fall of 30.1 per cent in terms of value, but still securing 15.4 per cent market share in the APAC region deal chart, almost on par with 2019 levels.

Four of the top 10 deals were driven by the government selling state-owned assets, pushing domestic deal making up by 11.1 per cent to USD 13.4 billion and 54 in total, compared to the year-ago period when it stood at USD 12 billion across 57 deals.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/report--covid-19-has-deal-making-plunging-31-pc-to--18-7-bn-in-q1.html

“Considering that the entire country is facing unprecedented challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and that the exporters are facing genuine hardships due to the SB005 errors, it has now been decided to extend the facility of SB005 error correction in the Customs Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system for shipping bills with date up to December 31, 2019,” the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) said in a circular.

SB005 is an error shown for mismatch between invoice number in shipping bill and in GSTR-1, due to which the refund gets stuck. AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said online rectification of error is not always feasible due to which the department had given an alternative mechanism with a officer interface for temporary relief.

160,23-4-20,Facebook picks up 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms,"Facebook on Wednesday announced an investment of USD 5.7 billion to buy 9.99 per cent stake in the firm that houses Reliance Jio — a deal that will help billionaire Mukesh Ambani create an e-commerce giant that could rival Amazon and Walmart by linking local kirana stores and consumers over the highly popular chat service WhatsApp.

The largest foreign direct investment (FDI) in the technology sector in India will give the US social-networking giant a broader foothold in its biggest global market.

“Today we are announcing a USD 5.7 billion, or Rs 43,574 crore, investment in Jio Platforms, part of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), making Facebook its largest minority shareholder,” the company said in a statement.

Reliance Industries (RIL) in a separate statement said the investment by Facebook values Jio Platforms at Rs 4.62 lakh crore pre-money enterprise value (USD 65.95 billion).

Facebook will be issued fresh equity shares and will get a board position on Jio Platforms where Ambani’s twin children, Isha and Akash, are directors.

Jio Platforms, which was created in October last year to house all digital initiatives of Reliance, will retain Rs 15,000 crore and use the remaining amount to pare some of its about Rs 40,000 crore debt.

Transaction advisers to prepare term sheet for the deal were engaged sometime in November last year, implying commercial negotiations between the two groups would have started in July or August.

Ambani had in August last year told RIL shareholders about plans to sell stake in some of the businesses with the goal of making the firm free of net debt by 2021.

The deal was originally targeted for March 31, but the outbreak of Covid-19 pushed the negotiations into a virtual zone. The deal will bring together JioMart, the e-commerce venture of Ambani, and Facebook’s WhatsApp platform to connect consumers with neighbourhood kirana stores, he said.

WhatsApp has over 400 million users in India while Jio has 388 million-plus phone subscribers. Facebook has about 250 million users in India. This is Facebook’s biggest stake buy since its 2014 acquisition of WhatsApp. The US giant has typically been buying into media and online properties till now and the investment in Jio Platforms underscores the potential it sees in a country that is rapidly embracing online payment and e-commerce as more people get smartphones.

The deal would require the approval of the Competition Commission of India (CCI). No Government nod is needed as the FDI is within the permissible limits.

“In the very near future, JioMart and WhatsApp will empower nearly 3 crore small Indian Kirana shops to digitally transact with every customer in their neighbourhood,” Ambani, 63, said in a video message after the deal announcement.

“This means all of you can order and get faster delivery of day-to-day items, from nearby local shops. At the same time, small kiranas can grow their businesses and create new employment opportunities using digital technologies,” he said.

RIL spent almost USD 50 billion — mostly borrowed money, on Jio, whose entry in 2016 with free calls and cheap data pushed some rivals to exit or merge to stay afloat.

At the end of the December quarter, RIL had an outstanding debt of Rs 306,851 crore. It also had cash in hand of Rs 153,719 crore, bringing the net debt position to Rs 153,132 crore.

Facebook said the investment “underscores our commitment to India and our excitement for the dramatic transformation that Jio has spurred in the country”.

Together with WhatsApp and Instagram, Facebook overall is estimated to have more users in India than any other single country, and the numbers are expected to grow.

The number of internet users in India is projected to rise to about 850 million in 2022, according to consultancy PwC, up from 450 million in 2017. RIL has been seeking strategic partnerships across its businesses while targeting to deleverage its balance sheet.

It has been talking to Saudi Aramco for sale of a 20 per cent stake in its oil-to-chemical business for an asking of USD 15 billion. RIL has sold stake in its retail fuel venture to BP Plc for Rs 7,000 crore.

Both Facebook and Jio said the deal is non-exclusive, which essentially means that the US firm is free to partner with other Indian or foreign company as well. The deal would give Facebook deeper access to India, the second-largest internet market after China.

Facebook is looking to launch a payment offering. Having a local partner could help it in navigating various regulatory issues, including those related to privacy and local storage.

Also, having a good telecom partner could help Facebook improve its reach to masses. From RIL’s perspective, it could leverage on Facebook’s technology expertise and talent pool as well as help in its ambitions to make Jio a digital company. RIL said that concurrent with the investment, Jio Platforms, Reliance Retail Ltd and WhatsApp have also entered into a commercial partnership agreement.

This is to further accelerate Reliance Retail’s new commerce business on the JioMart platform using WhatsApp and to support small businesses on WhatsApp. The transaction, RIL said, is subject to regulatory and other customary approvals.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/facebook-picks-up-9-99--stake-in-jio-platforms-2020-04-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/facebook-picks-up-9-99--stake-in-jio-platforms.html

162,23-4-20,"Facebook deal to help Reliance monetise platforms, deleverage: Fitch","Facebook Inc's USD 5.7 billion investment in Jio Platforms, subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), will help to monetise the digital platforms of both companies and aid in deleveraging of RIL's balance sheet, Fitch Ratings said on Thursday.

Facebook's investment for a 9.99 per cent stake in Jio Platforms is the single-largest FDI in the Indian telecoms and technology sector.

Reliance Jio, the wireless market leader with around 390 million subscribers, is a subsidiary of Jio Platforms. At the same time, Reliance Retail, RIL's retail arm, has also partnered with Facebook's WhatsApp to allow RIL's e-commerce business users to use the WhatsApp platform.

Fitch said it had in August last year revised the outlook on RIL's 'BBB' rating to 'positive' and may upgrade to 'BBB+' if ""net adjusted debt/EBITDA ratio improves to below 1.5x on a sustained basis"".

""The deal is part of RIL's plan to strengthen its businesses and to achieve a net cash position - through partnerships and supported by organic growth and lowcapex,"" Fitch said in a statement. ""We expect the partnership with Facebook to bolster RIL's consumer business in the medium term.""

The rating agency said the proceeds from the transaction should help RIL maintain the pace of its deleveraging - counteracting the likely weakness in its refining and petrochemical segment during 2020-21.

Fitch expects RIL's oil-to-chemical segment to face volume and margins headwinds due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in line with the industry trend.

""We expect the pandemic to weaken demand for refined products and petrochemicals in Asia-Pacific during 2020, with a gradual recovery through 2021 to pre-COVID-19 levels. However, RIL should be less affected than peers, due to the high complexity of its refineries and integrated petrochemical operations with feedstock flexibility,"" it said.

The deal, it said, will allow both Facebook and Jio to monetise their digital platforms, engage customers online, and provide direct connectivity between users and merchants.

Usage of digital platforms is likely to grow significantly in the medium-term amid severe disruptions caused by lockdowns and social distancing measures.

Increasing reliance on digital platforms might also assist RIL in gaining market share in India's growing e-commerce segment, and soften the impact of lower footfalls in its physical retail stores.

""Jiomart, which is a market-place platform and built in partnership with small merchants and 'kirana' (small neighbourhood retail store) shops, will allow users to buy goods and services using WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Jio Platforms will focus on introducing digital solutions for 60 million micro, small and medium businesses; 120 million farmers; 30 million merchants; and millions of SMEs in the informal sector,"" Fitch said.

On its part, Facebook is likely to be able to expand its platforms - including Facebook Marketplace, Instagram Shopping and Facebook Pay - to help SMEs set up virtual shops on such platforms and sell goods and services.

Facebook plans to roll out WhatsApp Payments in India and other countries this year, after having tested this with a million people in India in 2018. WhatsApp Platform, which has started charging businesses, is still offered free to retail users globally, it said.

Facebook reported 641 million daily active users (DAU) in APAC in 4Q19, up by 14 per cent year-on-year and now contributing around 39 per cent of overall 1.7 million DAUs.

India is the single-largest market with about 330 million monthly users, and also one of the fastest-growing markets for Facebook. WhatsApp's messaging app also has the largest user base in India, with about 400 million users.

""We believe internet users in the country will rise to at least 800 million by 2022, up from around 600 million in 2019 as India overtook the US to become the world's second-largest smartphone market after China by unit shipments in 2019. DAUs represented around 66 per cent of 2.5 billion monthly active users in December 2019,"" Fitch added.

""However, your Excom (Executive Committee) members and SVPs (senior vice presidents) have volunteered to take pay cuts this month. For everyone else, you can expect your April salaries to be paid without the pay cuts,"" Dutta told employees through an email, which has been accessed by PTI.

India has been under lockdown since March 25 to curb the coronavirus pandemic. All domestic and international commercial passenger flights have been suspended for this period. As a result, revenues of the Indian aviation industry have been hit hard.

""In deference to our government's wishes of not reducing pay during the lockdown, we have decided not to implement the previously announced pay cuts during the month of April,"" Dutta added in the email.

He had announced on March 19 that the airline was instituting pay cuts for senior employees and he would himself take the highest cut of 25 per cent amid the COVID-19 pandemic that has hit the aviation industry hard.

""I am personally taking a 25 per cent pay cut, SVPs (senior vice presidents) and above are taking 20 per cent, VPs (vice presidents) and cockpit crew are taking a 15 per cent pay cut, AVPs (assistant vice presidents), Bands D along with cabin crew will take 10 per cent and Band Cs five per cent,"" Dutta had said on March 19.

164,23-4-20,China calls virus lawsuit brought by US state ‘very absurd’,"China on Wednesday slammed a lawsuit brought against it by the U.S. state of Missouri over the coronavirus pandemic as “very absurd.”

Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the legal action has “no factual and legal basis at all” and repeated China’s defense of its response to the outbreak, which has largely subsided in the country where it was first detected.

The ministry and other Chinese government departments have strenuously denied accusations that officials delayed reporting on the extent of the outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, despite reports that worries over political stability were placed above public health concerns. Medical staff who reported the outbreak were silenced under threat of legal retaliation and Wuhan went several days without reporting cases during the holding of an annual provincial government conference.

“This so-called lawsuit is very absurd and has no factual and legal basis at all,” Geng said at a daily briefing. Since the outbreak began, China has proceeded in an “open, transparent, and responsible manner” and the U.S. government should “dismiss such vexatious litigation,” he said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/china-calls-virus-lawsuit-brought-by-us-state----very-absurd---.html

167,23-4-20,A tale of perseverance,"Chhattisgarh has one of the best recovery rates from Coronavirus on account of the steps taken by the State government

COVID-19 is steadily spreading its wings in India with cases near 20,000 throughout the nation and 640 fatalities reported as of April 22. Chhattisgarh has made its own mark by setting up an inspirational model for other states to combat the virus. The state is receiving appreciation from the centre and world leaders for the way the situation was tackled and managed.

Chhattisgarh, a heavily forested state with a majority of tribal population, narrates a tale of perseverance and tactful management of the pandemic. Total of 36 cases reported in the state by now, out of which 23 recovered, zero fatalities and 13 active patients undergoing treatment in AIIMS, Raipur. The state accounts for as little than 0.266 per cent of share in COVID-19 cases across India and a recovery rate of 63.88 per cent as of April 17. The question is how did they prevent the spread in such an effective manner with speedy recovery rates and not even a single death? Was it due to the proactive measures formulated by the state government or the doctors at AIIMS, Raipur, who were working around the clock to treat their patients? Was it about the discipline exercised by the public or because of the public administration and police working endlessly to ensure and implement regulatory measures? Was it because of the sanitation workers ensuring hygiene and cleanliness every day or maybe the lab experts who were constantly engaged in collecting test samples, knocking from one door to the other? Well, the credit goes to joint efforts laid down by all of them.

The state worked recklessly with an agenda of early protection, early identification, early diagnosis and early isolation. Even before the identification of the first case in the state, continuous monitoring, strict social distancing norms, border sealing with other states were ensured. Chhattisgarh has successfully implemented a ruthless containment strategy by exercising a strict lockdown since March 20, with the identification of the first case of a 24-year-old woman who returned from the UK. A total of 5,519 samples have been tested by now, out of which 4,878 samples are negative, while testing of 208 samples is currently underway.

Of the 36 cases reported in C G, Katghora in Korba district emerged as a hotspot in the state and accounted for 27 cases, followed by five cases in Raipur. Rajnandgaon, Bilaspur, Durg and Korba each reporting just one case. Twenty three districts of Chhattisgarh have remained completely untouched. As soon as the first case of a 16-year-old boy from Purani Basti area in Katghora tested positive, the entire area was sealed immediately and tests were conducted for every person in the village. Contacts were traced and masks were made mandatory.

The health infrastructure was made stronger and capable enough to deal with the crisis. AIIMS was fully equipped and prepared to deal with any sort of emergency. Providing license to three distilleries for industrial manufacturing of alcohol based hand sanitiser, increasing the service period of 401 contract-based Ayurveda physicians, distribution of free masks were some early preventive measures undertaken by the state government.

Majority of cases in the state fall under the age group of 20 to 40. The major reason behind having a better recovery rate is also early detection of the cases. Most of the patients started receiving treatment in the early stages of their infection, which is why they responded well.

To control panic buying among people and to prevent over crowding in grocery stores, 70 kg lump sum rice for two months was distributed to 65.35 lakh families, ensuring no one sleeps empty stomach. Additionally, disinfectants were sprayed via drones and helpline number was established.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-tale-of-perseverance-2020-04-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-tale-of-perseverance.html

Narendra Bhushan, CEO of Greater Noida Authority, is taking utmost care of the citizens of the district and connecting with them amid lockdown due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Bhushan, a 1992-batch IAS officer and senior official in Gautam Budh Nagar district, has been in-charge of managing coordination among different departments. His recent efforts helped a man visit his father for his last time, which might not have been possible otherwise.

Bhushan then spoke to J&K Principal Secretary and asked him to arrange passes for Ashish. During his journey, Ashish was constantly in touch with the Police Commissioner’s control centre set up in the Greater Noida office for UP residents.

Previously, Bhushan also urged citizens and Corona warriors to help identify senior citizens in their localities, who live alone, so that they can keep in touch with authority officials in case of any emergencies. For those, who are not able to arrange food for themselves, the responsibility of arranging their food have been entrusted with the concerned RWA or donor.

Bhushan has also helped established National Institute of Biological (NIB), Noida, laboratory under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, for testing and screening of suspected Coronavirus patients in Greater Noida. The lab has been equipped with modern technology for the residents of the district as well as the districts falling under Meerut and Saharanpur divisions. The testing lab is proving to be helpful in the investigation of suspected Coronavirus patients.

Moreover, three community kitchens and food collection centres are being run by the Greater Noida Authority in its East and West areas each. According to the data, a total of 6,99,828 food packets have been delivered to the needy.

172,23-4-20,Many wary of virus reopenings as partisan divide grows in US,"One of the grimmest symbols of the coronavirus outbreak — a morgue set up in a Madrid skating rink — closed on Wednesday as stores and other businesses reopened in places across Europe, while the U.S. was beset with increasingly partisan disagreements over how and when to restart its economy.

As some governors in the U.S. — largely Republican ones — moved to reopen an ever-wider variety of businesses, others took a more cautious approach and came under mounting pressure from protesters complaining that their livelihoods are being destroyed and their freedom of movement is being infringed on.

With the crisis easing but far from over in Europe, small shops in Berlin reopened, and restrictions were also relaxed in Denmark and Austria. In France, long lines formed outside the few McDonald’s drive-thrus that started serving customers again. Still, many employees and customers were uneasy, suggesting that a return to normal is a long way off.

“Of course I’m happy that I can open again and we can keep our heads above water,” said Galina Hooge, who opened her small Berlin toy store for the first time in over a month. But she worried that some Germans still aren’t taking the outbreak seriously.

“Relaxing the rules doesn’t mean that everything is over. It’s not over by a long stretch,” she said. German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said “very careful steps” must be taken to keep the virus from making a resurgence. “What we want to avoid is falling back into the exponential spread of the virus that we had in the first phase of the pandemic,” he said.

Brian Kemp announced that gyms and salons can reopen this week, gym owner Mark Lebos said it would be professional negligence to do so right now.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/many-wary-of-virus-reopenings-as-partisan-divide-grows-in-us.html

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps broke the news of what it said was its own satellite launch, hailing it as a milestone for the country’s space programme.

“Today, we are looking at the Earth from the sky, and it is the beginning of the formation of a world power,” the Guards’ commander Hossein Salami said, quoted by Fars news agency.

Iran maintains it has no intention of acquiring nuclear weapons, and says its aerospace activities are peaceful and comply with a UN Security Council resolution.

Tensions between the arch foes again escalated last week with the US accusing Iran of harassing its ships in the Gulf.

177,23-4-20,Flawed but real,"Director Nupur Asthana tells Sakshi Sharma that her recently released series, Four More Shots Please 2, is not just eye candy but relatable and authentic

Four unapologetic flawed women living life on their own terms, dealing with misogyny and body shaming, comfortable with their imperfections while exploring their potential and relationships. The vision or thought is certainly a powerful one.

Director Nupur Asthana’s recent series Four More Shots Please 2 has four unapologetic women who live, love and discover their lives, friendships and more in Mumbai. Each of the experiences of Damini (Sayani Gupta), Anjana (Kirti Kulhari), Siddhi (Maanvi Gagroo) and Umang (Bani J) gives an insight into a different issue. There are several interlinked threads in their journey which unfold one by one.

We all have seen or experienced casual misogyny at work, men thinking that they know better, opportunities being given to a man even if a woman is more deserving or a joke being cracked about the driving abilities or the financial acumen of women. This is explored through Anjana’s character. Another topic that the show wanted to talk about was, how hard it is to speak in an environment that doesn’t want to hear your creative voice. And that is Damini’s journey. She writes a book on a judge and no one wants to publish it because it challenges the system. Nupur says that she wanted to put spotlight on this issue as we see so many journalists and writers who are constantly under threat because of their opinions and writings.

Love, with all its complications is explored through Umang. What does love really mean? How much can you give in? What is the power equation in a relationship? These are things that Umang goes through. She literally gives her everything to a relationship which doesn’t work because she is unable to find a balance. The whole exploration of ‘how can you be in a relationship which is not equal’ is heart wrenching.

The search for self and body-shaming is another topic explored. For Siddhi, it was very important to find her own voice. The whole search for self before she could call herself somebody’s girlfriend is thought provoking. In season 1, she was body-shamed initially but later found her way by accepting herself and moving ahead in life. And what better way to do it than by talking about it at her own stand-up, coming to terms with the issues and questioning the whole beauty industry. These are four big threads that the show explores through different story graphs.

The series starts in Istanbul giving the audience a visual tour, much-needed in these times when we can’t step out. For most of us, the show is a treat to the eyes due to its sartorial sensibilities and the travel involved. But Nupur, who is excited reading the reviews and is chained to her desk during quarantine, wanted it to be so much more than that. “I wanted it to be more real, relatable and authentic. I build Mumbai into the narrative so that the girls feel rooted. It has a lot of nuances and layering which is deep and cut close to the bone. My aim was to go into the emotional journeys of the girls, get into their minds and try to understand them better as they try to understand themselves,” says she.

The first season, directed by Anu Menon, was a hit. But Nupur didn’t feel pressurised as she had a clear vision for this one. But she does have her own share of challenges. She says, “Every show is challenging. Filmmaking itself is challenging because there are so many variables attached to it. You don’t want to come to the season 2 of a show that has already done well and not do justice to it. Having said that I didn’t feel any pressure. I work with my instincts. I just went with the flow.”

The director wanted it to be more realistic but it has missed the mark at some points. For instance, Damini is barely surviving and reeling under the loss of her website but her lavish lifestyle and home don’t gel with the crisis in her life. Nupur agrees but makes a point. “In season 1, we have seen that Damini comes from a well-settled family. Her father is an editor and publisher. So that might be her family’s home. Even though she’s living on her savings but her stylish outfits might be old. And if you are not paying rent, living in South Bombay is easy,” says she.

Though the situations in the second season are different from the first but it somehow deals with the same ideas and dilemmas. Nupur says that during season 1, the women’s relationship were not fully explored, so she wanted to delve more into them. “These days relationships are so complicated. When I read terms like hook-up, situationship, I find them insane. It is no longer about two people meeting, going out, having a relationship and getting married. There are so many levels of intimacy,” says she. This is why the show looks dramatic at some points. For instance, when things are on the verge of getting simpler and better, something goes wrong.

There is nothing black and white in the show because the director feels nobody wants to see such characters as they are too predictable. She says: “When you already know that s/he is good or bad, there’s no fun in exploring the character. You empathise and relate with grey characters. When you see things going wrong, your heart is in your mouth and you question ‘why is she doing it?’” We do things that are not necessarily right for us or are in relationships with people who are not appropriate. We make those mistakes and fall. But how you get up and learn from those and strive to be better is important. These are the grey areas that the series tries to understand through the journey of the characters.

The show caters to the urban and metropolitan crowd primarily. Does it exclude a mass audience for whom the definition of empowerment and feminism might be totally different? “You will be surprised to know that the show has a large audience in the Tier-II cities too. They might have different concerns but emotions are universal. You might be sitting in Mumbai with a beautiful closet and a lavish lifestyle but you can still feel abandoned, rejected and might have body issues or trouble at work. You can still be a subject of misogyny. A girl from small town might not be going through similar challenges but for her the guts to stand up and tell her family that she wants to pursue modeling can be difficult. Everyone faces various issues though at a different level. And that is what women across the board are connected with,” says Nupur.

The director’s first series was Hip Hip Hurray (1998). It dealt with the lives of 12th grade students who experienced adventures, fears, hopes and relationships as they enter adulthood. However, exploring the same genre and youth-oriented show after 22 years wasn’t much different for Nupur because the world of young people and their minds have always excited her. She says, “Though the world has changed during this time as everything has evolved for the better but feelings during adulting remain the same. In your mid 20s you think you know it all but you are actually a confused mess. On one hand, you are fearless but at the same time you are insecure and under confident about who you are as a person and what do you want in life?”

On their official page, Mumbai Police shared a meme featuring a smiling Alia in her Gully Boy look. “That face when he says he is going out for a walk during lockdown,” reads the meme.

This is not the first time Alia featured in a tweet by Mumbai Police. Recently, they had created a message using the names of her popular films while urging people to stay at home. “Mumbaikars, we hope you all are ‘Raazi’ with this advise of @aliaa08 to not venture out in any ‘Gully' unnecessarily and take care of ‘Dear Zindagi' for all!” was the tweet.

‘I made a video for Earth Day. While everyone is busy sharing videos and images of peacocks on roads, dolphins in the sea, clear blue skies, we shouldn’t forget that nature is healing and we must not get back to our old ways when the lockdown is over. We tend to forget that we can contribute and do our bit to save environment too.’

180,23-4-20,AICF seek Sports Ministry intervention in conducting elections,"Even during the corona crisis and lockdown, a faction feud is raging in the All India Chess Federation. In a show of strength, the faction led by Bharat Singh Chauhan conducted an extraordinary General Body meeting of the AICF through video conferencing on Wednesday where it was decided to approach the Union Sports Ministry to hold the elections of the Federation under its supervision.

The GB also set up a five-member committee of senior players and officials to look after day-to-day affair of the AICF. Members of the committee are: member committee of Vipnesh Bharadwaj, Naresh Sharma, Bhavesh Patel Neeraj Mishra and Bhagyshree Thipsay.

The General Body meeting was held on the request of as many 12 state units. It was attended by 44 members representing 22 affiliated units, who felt that the Sports ministry should step in to hold the AICF elections because of the ongoing legal battle within the two factions of the Federation. The Madras High Court had stayed the outcome of the February 10 election of new office-bearers.

The 12 state units took the imitative to convene the meeting in view of the ongoing faction fighting in the federation and several arbitrary and illegal decisions taken by PR Venketrama Raja and DV Sundar, who have ceased to be President and Vice-president of the Federation now. The meeting was conducted as per provision of Section 11 of AICF constitution and Section 28 of Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act 1975. Senior AICF officials. Member Mr Naresh Sharma chaired the meeting.

The Madras High Court had appointed retired Supreme Court Justice F M Ibrahim Kalifulla as returning officer to conduct the AICF elections. Justice F M Ibrahim Kalifulla duly conducted the elections and declared Ajay H Patel as president, Bharat Singh Chauhan as secretary, Naresh Sharma as treasurer, M Arun Singh as joint secretary, and Vipnesh Bharadwaj as vice president.

After the new office-bearers assumed office, the High Court set aside the election process on a plea of Raja and directed to Kalifulla to convene a Special General Body Meeting to conduct fresh polls. Since then AICF is in a mess and all its activities have come to a halt.

The fact that only 7 association and disputed officials like Mr Raja and Mr Vijay Deshpande opposed the meeting, showed that they don’t enjoy majority support and were trying to muddy the water for selfish gains.

The meeting decided to probe how without any approval of the AICF Central council or GB, Mr Raja and Mr. Vijay Deshpande tried to change the bank signatories , prompting the Indian bank, Chennai to freeze the Federation account. The members felt that the it must enquired as to how on March 31— within a day after illegal appointment of Vijay Deshpande as Secretary, Sundar visited the bank with signature of Deshpande, who is based in Maharashtra, when the country was under lockdown.

The GB also decided to restore the affiliation of Maharashtra and Rajasthan Chess Associations, and disaffiliated Andhra Pradesh chess association for not paying the prize of chess players despite several reminders b y the Federation.

The GB decided that the recently held election of the Bengal state chess association was illegal since it was not conducted as per the AICF bye laws and the country's sports code. The GB decided to disaffiliate the Bengal chess association for not making suitable amendment s to their bye laws as per the AICF constitution and for not paying back an outstanding sum of Rs 7.5 lakh to the Federation. The GB decided to form an ad-hoc committee to run the affairs of the associations.

181,23-4-20,Smith took blame for everyone else in ball-tampering scandal: Flintoff,"Former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff believes the entire Australian team was involved in the ball-tampering scandal that rocked world cricket in 2018 and then skipper Steve Smith just “took the blame” to save his side.

Smith was suspended for a year along with David Warner and Cameron Bancroft after being indicted in the sandpaper-gate during a Test match against South Africa in Cape Town.

“I can’t believe that the whole team isn’t in on it. As a bowler, if someone gives me a ball that’s been tampered with, I know initially. One of the things that Steve Smith did is take the blame for everyone else,” Flintoff told Talksport.

“Things like ball tampering have gone on for a long, long time and I think it’s just the degrees where you take it. We were accused of putting sweets on the ball. People put suncream on it, tried everything they can.”

Smith was also banned from taking any leadership roles for two years — a suspension which has now expired.

The England legend said it is difficult to believe that others in the team did not have a clue about what was going on.

“Sandpaper is wrong, but it’s stupid more than anything. But I can’t believe that everyone in the team wasn’t involved in some way or another,” said Flintoff, who took 400 wickets and scored over 7000 runs in his career.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/smith-took-blame-for-everyone-else-in-ball-tampering-scandal--flintoff.html
182,23-4-20,Shakib to auction 2019 WC bat,"Star Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan has decided to auction the bat he used during the 2019 ODI World Cup to help raise money for the fight against deadly coronavirus pandemic.

Shakib, who is currently serving a two-year ban for not reporting corrupt approaches, is the second Bangladeshi cricketer after wicket-keeper batsman Mushfiqur Rahim to auction a personal cricketing gear to raise money for the cause.

“I had said before that I want to put up a bat for auction. I have decided to auction the bat I used in the 2019 World Cup. It’s a favourite bat of mine,” Shakib said during a Facebook Live session.

The 33-year-old all-rounder had a hugely successful World Cup in England last year, scoring 606 runs in eight matches at an average of 86.57, besides picking up 11 wickets in the tournament and became the only cricketer to score 600 plus runs and scalp 10 wickets in a single edition of the World Cup.

“I had a good World cup with the bat and ball. There were some good performances especially with the bat. I had used a single bat throughout the World Cup and even used tapes on it to get through games,” Shakib said.

“It’s not that this bat has only been used at the World Cup. I have scored over 1500 runs with this bat and had used it prior to the tournament and after it as well.

“Although I like the bat a lot but I have decided to put it up for auction with the thought that maybe it can leave some contribution to forming a fund during the ongoing coronavirus crisis.”

The money raised from the auction will go to the Shakib Al Hasan foundation.

“This is a very special bat to me, but my people are even more special to me,” Shakib said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/shakib-to-auction-2019-wc-bat.html

“The professional football committee intends to not continue playing the 2019/20 competition. The KNVB will consult UEFA, after which a decision will be taken,” the federation said in a statement.

“The KNVB has not yet definitively cancelled competitions because of financial difficulties in the football industry due to the coronavirus crisis.”

Clubs and other stakeholders will meet on Friday to discuss the consequences of the decision.

There are eight rounds of matches left in the Eredivisie, with defending champions Ajax ahead of AZ Alkmaar on goal difference.

According to the KNVB, matches behind closed doors will not be possible as they are considered events which require a permit and police presence. “There will be no matches before September 1,” the statement added.

184,23-4-20,Klopp says Liverpool are not finished article,"Jurgen Klopp believes there is still room for improvement from Liverpool despite their incredible Premier League campaign, which is on hold due to pandemic.

The Reds were 25 points clear of second-placed Manchester City and on the verge of their first top-flight title since 1990 when football was halted last month.

But Klopp said Liverpool, who won the Champions League last year and have only lost one Premier League match all season, could get even better.

“We will not change, that’s the first thing, but whether we will be successful depends on what other clubs are doing as well because they have all the chance to improve things, do things better,” he told Sky Sports.

“So I have no clue what the future will hold for us. But we will not change, this team is not the finished article, and we have a lot of space for improvement, and we work on that.

“We have fresh blood internally coming through. We can improve with this team, which is great.”

Klopp does not believe football should be “forced back” after the COVID-19 shutdown but admitted it could have a positive impact on the mood of the country.

“If we come together and train in groups of two or five or six or eight, I’m not sure when that will be possible, we have to wait for the government on that. We cannot force that and will not, because we can’t, there’s absolutely nothing for that.

“But if football can help in some departments with lifting the mood, giving something to think about and to deal with in a different way, then we have to start training at one point, but I don’t know when that will be.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/klopp-says-liverpool-are-not-finished-article.html

186,23-4-20,Aus series will be different ball game this time: Rohit,"Swashbuckling India opener Rohit Sharma believes the presence of David Warner and Steve Smith will make the tour of Australia later this year a “different ball game” for his side, which is also at its best right now.

India won the 2018-19 Test series 2-1, their first in 71 years of touring Down Under, but it came against a depleted Australian team which didn’t have Warner and Smith, who were both serving a one year ball-tampering suspension.

“I was looking forward to the New Zealand series but unfortunately, injury (calf muscle) happened at the wrong time,” Rohit told India Today on Wednesday.

“I can’t wait to go to Australia and play the Test matches there. Australia in Australia with those two guys (Smith and Warner) will be a different ball game,” India’s white ball vice-captain said.

For him, opening is a challenge that he has relished and a testimony to that was his stupendous start against South Africa at home. However, he has been ready for the job since the 2018 Australia tour when the team management gave him enough hints.

“I was told you might be opening in Tests as well. It was two years ago. I was preparing myself from then onwards,” he said.

For him, watching the game from the dressing room is no fun.

“You wanted opportunity, everybody wants to be out there in the middle. I wanted to play and not watch the game.

“When the chance came along, I was ready. There were some technical aspects, I needed to be aware of,” he said.

Rohit said the Australia series will be an exciting one as this Indian team is currently playing its best cricket.

“As a team, we are playing best cricket right now, everybody wants to take the game back to the opposition. If it happens (amid the COVID-19 pandemic), it will be a great series to be part of,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/aus-series-will-be-different-ball-game-this-time--rohit-2020-04-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/aus-series-will-be-different-ball-game-this-time--rohit.html
187,23-4-20,Trace the ignored signs,"We might not have foreseen the approaching COVID-19 crisis but were aware of our medical unpreparedness, says Kandarp V Patel

India is under lockdown, just like many other countries across the globe. It is a step to flatten the curve to avoid large number of COVID-19 cases and resultant fatalities. In times of uncertainty, speculation is dominating many discussions in media while some experts have resorted to scenario-based planning.

Experts have argued how India’s healthcare system isn’t strong enough to cope in a worst-case scenario, which is if millions of people get infected from the virus. Prime Minister Narendra Modi too mentioned this issue in his recent address to the nation. Moreover, fault lines in our healthcare industry are already becoming visible with stories of shortage in supply of essential medical equipment like isolation beds and ICU beds, PPE, workforce and the list goes on.

Several audit reports have highlighted deficiencies in our healthcare system time and again. So what are these early warning signs ‘we’ (including executive government, healthcare workers, elected representatives, media and common public) ignored? It is obvious that a poor country like ours has to maximise its resources. One CAG report (2019) on public healthcare system of UP had following observations:

oICU services were available only in DHs Lucknow and Gorakhpur out of the 11 test-checked DHs/JHs.

oIn the absence of an ICU facility in the remaining DHs/JHs, patients approaching these hospitals in an emergent condition were likely to be referred and/or passed on to higher facility public or private hospitals.

oThe ICUs in DHs Lucknow and Gorakhpur also suffered from shortage of essential equipment such as ventilators, infusion pumps, ultrasound and arterial blood gas analysis machines.

Apart from public health, let’s now talk about it from the lens of accountability.

Public financial management relates to the way governments manage public resources — both revenue and expenditure. It is government’s responsibility to maintain prudent level of public debt and deficit. It involves elements like cash management, public procurement, expenditure management, internal and external audit.

As lockdown greatly impacts the economy, central government and many state governments have announced relief packages. To meet this sudden expenditure requirement, some state governments have started announcing deferment of salary payments to all classes of state government employees. This is taking place as the government has leveraged its balance sheets earlier by breaching FRBM targets and borrowing off-budget to the extent possible. Often other expenditures take precedence over things that do not seem urgent at that time. This can be seen in the CAG Report 20 of 2018 for the Central Government said:

“Government has increasingly resorted to off-budget financing for revenue as well as capital spending. In terms of revenue spending, off-budget financing was used for covering deferring fertiliser arrears/bills through special banking arrangements; food subsidy bills/arrears of FCI through borrowings and for implementation of irrigation scheme (AIBP) through borrowings by NABARD under the Long-Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF).”

It has been observed time and again that our public expenditure needs deep rationalisation. In a recent study on centrally-sponsored schemes by ICRIER, it was observed that 158 schemes out of 204 has just Rs 5.7 crore as average outlay per scheme per state. This is inadequate to run any meaningful scheme for Indian states. Such schemes, if rationalised, can help re-allocation of amount as high as Rs 27,000 crore to priority areas. This is just an example from the central government. Similar cases are widespread across state governments as well.

If governments were held accountable through the existing mechanism by raising right questions in the right forum, we would have been in a better fiscal position to support our poor migrants better in time of this crisis.

Some might also point out that this is not the right time to talk about accountability and past deficiencies. Well, I agree. But I hope when the crisis is over and we are making a list of lessons learnt for future, we remember and look at accountability enforcement as a governance-improving mechanism and not as a fault-finding one. We could look at the accountability mechanism as an early warning system for our public systems to handle such crises. COVID-19 was one crisis we didn’t see coming but medical unpreparedness was something we could.

A financially-weakened CA is desperate to host India to save the broadcast revenue from the contest.

“The bowlers and batters would probably be happy with that, it’s (Adelaide Oval) probably been the best cricket wicket the last four or five years,” Hazlewood was quoted as saying by the Australian media.

“It gives a bit to both batting and bowling, I wouldn’t mind it. It’s not ideal though. We want to get around to all parts of Australia and challenge ourselves on all those different wickets.”

India are scheduled to play four Tests, three ODIs and three T20Is on their tour.

The T20 series will be played ahead of the T20 World Cup, starting October.

The 29-year-old lanky pacer is currently out of the Australian team and was targeting the now-postponed Indian Premier League (IPL) to impress the national selectors and secure his place in Australia’s T20 World Cup squad.

“If we don’t play another game before the World Cup it’s going to be tough to get into,” Hazlewood said.

“If an opportunity opens up, through injury or whatever, I’d take that.

192,23-4-20,Kumble best captain I’ve played under: Gambhir,"The numbers are heavily in favour of Mahendra Singh Dhoni but former India batsman Gautam Gambhir says spin legend Anil Kumble was the best India captain he has ever played under.

Gambhir has high regards for Dhoni and Sourav Ganguly as India skippers, but believes Kumble would have been phenomenal as captain had he led the national team for a longer period.

“From the records point of view it obviously has to be MS Dhoni. He has won every ICC trophy possible. He has done fabulously well, he has handled the pressure for a very long time. Sourav (Ganguly) has also done well.

“But one person I would definitely, would have liked to captain India for a long time should have been Anil Kumble. I played 6 Test matches under him and had he captained India for a long time would have broken many records,” Gambhir said on Star Sports Cricket Connected show on the occasion of IPL’s 12th anniversary.

“From the records point of view Dhoni is right up there but for me the best captain I played under is Anil Kumble,” Gambhit, who is now a BJP MP, added.

Kumble was appointed as India captain after Rahul Dravid in 2007 and led the side in 14 Tests — winning three, losing six and drawing five.

But his stint as captain lasted little less than a year as he retired in November 2008, following which Dhoni was appointed as the skipper in all three formats.

Gambhir also picked Mumbai Indians skipper Rohit Sharma as the all-time great IPL captain.

“I think it’s Rohit Sharma . He has won the IPL four times and his captaincy is all about winning trophies,” he said.

“He will end up being the most successful IPL captains of all-time as well, probably he will finish with 6 or 7 titles under his belt.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kumble-best-captain-i---ve-played-under--gambhir.html
193,23-4-20,"‘Pak need consistency, patience to produce box-office players’","Pakistan Test opener Shan Masood on Wednesday called for patience and need to give players a long rope in order to produce box-office cricketers like Rohit Sharma, Jason Roy and David Warner.

Masood was part of Pakistan’s home series wins against Sri Lanka 1-0 and the one-off Test against Bangladesh after they lost in Australia 0-2 in the five-day format.

Asked how Pakistan can also produce box-office openers like India’s Rohit, England’s Roy and Australia’s Warner, he said: “There is fear of failure which is human nature. They got security over a long time. The England team started with a plan in 2015 and got result in 2019. They stuck to a core of players.

“Consistency is very important. We need to accept defeat if we have to set a goal like that. As a nation we focus on short-term goals. Instant results cannot be the way to groom players,” said the 30-year old in a video conference chat with reporters.

“Also these cricketers you named got advantage of home cricket. We never got that. This is for the first time we got. We don’t get to play that often also. For box office players you need consistency. We need to build players for a four-year period.”

Masood also said he is not worried about being labelled as Test player, saying he has the right kind of people around him to guide.

He also said this team under coach and chief selector Misbah-ul-Haq is going in the right direction and results will soon start showing.

“Misbah bhai is trying to bring in new culture. Fitness is being given a lot of importance. During this lockdown also players are being worked on. A lot of things is being done. Also culture is there...camaraderie is there among players and I hope as soon as cricket resumes we can carve out a legacy for ourselves.

194,23-4-20,"King, Federer, Nadal call for ATP, WTA merger","WTA founder Billie Jean King joined Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal in suggesting ""now is the time"" to merge the men's ATP and women's body into one umbrella organisation to oversee the two professional tennis tours.

Federer, holder of the men's record of 20 Grand Slams, was the first to raise the notion on his Twitter feed, triggering an overwhelmingly enthusiastic response from King and Nadal.

""Just wondering ... am I the only one thinking that now is the time for men's and women's tennis to be united and come together as one?"" Federer said.

""I am not talking about merging competition on the court, but merging the 2 governing bodies (ATP and WTA) that oversee the men's and women's professional tours.""

Trailblazer King, who was a part of establishing the WTA in 1973 and was one of the 'Original 9' on the tour, said her support for the idea dates back decades.

""I agree, and have been saying so since the early 1970s. One voice, women and men together, has long been my vision for tennis. The WTA on its own was always Plan B. I'm glad we are on the same page. Let's make it happen. #OneVoice,"" she tweeted.

Nadal, who has 19 Grand Slam titles, supported his long-time rival's proposition.

""Hey @rogerfederer as you know per our discussions I completely agree that it would be great to get out of this world crisis with the union of men's and women's tennis in one only organisation,"" he said.

Federer and Nadal argued by a merger tennis could emerge stronger from the coronavirus lockdown which has seen the sport shut down, with Wimbledon cancelled for the first time since World War II and the French Open pushed back to the end of September.

""It probably should have happened a long time ago, but maybe now is really the time. These are tough times in every sport and we can come out of this with 2 weakened bodies or 1 stronger body,"" Federer wrote.

He said the current system was ""too confusing for the fans when there are different ranking systems, different logos, different websites, different tournament categories"".

Later, three-time Grand Slam winner Stanislas Wawrinka claimed discussions are underway regarding the move with the ATP's chairman Andrea Gaudenzi.

""It was not just a comment like that, there is more talk behind that. Gaudenzi at the ATP was already talking about it,"" he said during an Instagram Live with 18-time Grand Slam champion Chris Evert.

Australian star Nick Kyrgios and two-time women's Grand Slam champion Simona Halep also said they were behind the idea.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/king--federer--nadal-call-for-atp--wta-merger-2020-04-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/king--federer--nadal-call-for-atp--wta-merger.html
195,23-4-20,Entire Muslim community cannot be held responsible for one group's 'crime': Naqvi on Tablighi Jamaat row,"The entire Muslim community cannot be held responsible for one group's ""crime"", Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said on Thursday while reacting to instances of Muslims being blamed for the spurt in COVID-19 cases after Tablighi Jamaat congregation here, and asserted that most of the minority community members have condemned the group's action.

In an interview to PTI, Naqvi also expressed confidence that Muslims will abide by lockdown guidelines during the holy month of Ramzan.

He said across the India, imams, Ulema and Muslim organizations have unanimously decided that during Ramzan (the Islamic holy month), Muslims will not congregate in mosques, religious places and perform all rituals like 'Iftaar' (breaking of fast) and 'taraweeh' (special prayers) at home keeping in mind social distancing norms.

Naqvi said he has spoken with state waqf board officials, social and religious leaders, imams on adherence to the lockdown and social distancing guidelines during the Ramzan month starting Friday or Saturday evening and they have begun creating awareness among the people.

Asked about some people blaming Muslims for the spread of the pandemic after a large number of cases were found linked to the Tablighi Jamaat event at Nizamudddin here, Naqvi said the whole community cannot be held responsible for the ""crime"" of one organisation or one person.

""Whatever that organisation did, criminal negligence or crime...most Muslims have strongly reacted to it, condemned it and called for action against it. Entire community cannot be held responsible for one person or one organisation's crime,"" he asserted, adding that this has always been India's culture.

Last week, the Union Health Ministry had said 29.8 per cent of the total COVID-19 cases --4,291 out of 14,378 COVID-19 infections-- in the country were linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in March at the group's headquarters here following which some sections of the society severely criticised Muslims, and blamed them for the spread of the pandemic in the country.

Naqvi's comments also assume significance in view of the 57-member prominent international Mulim grouping, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), asking India to take ""urgent steps"" to protect the rights of its minority Muslim community and stop the incidents of ""Islamophobia"" in the country.

Hitting out at the OIC, the minister had said the country is ""heaven for Muslims"" and those trying to vitiate the atmosphere of prosperity cannot be friends of Indian Muslims.

Naqvi said those targeting Muslims are few isolated people who are trying to spread ""misinformation"" and ""we should be united and isolate such elements"".

On the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions during Ramzan, Naqvi said no Muslim wants to stay away from mosques during the holy month, but everyone has resolved to win this battle against coronavirus.

During this month, everyone should pray to God that not only India but also the entire world is freed from this COVID-19 pandemic, he said.

Asked whether Muslims have followed lockdown and social distancing guidelines till now, Naqvi said, ""absolutely, the entire country is standing united in this fight against coronavirus.""

""When Prime Minister Narendra Modi had appealed to people with folded hands, he had appealed to 130 crore Indians, it was not based on caste or religion. And everybody responded to his appeal and acted on it,"" he said.

People have faith that whatever Prime Minister Modi does is for the health and safety of the people, Naqvi said.

Asked about the role of the Opposition in the fight against COVID-19 and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi's suggestions, Naqvi said,""some people have criticized, but that is their habit, we don't take any offence to it.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/entire-muslim-community-cannot-be-held-responsible-for-one-group-s--crime---naqvi-on-tablighi-jamaat-row-2020-04-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/entire-muslim-community-cannot-be-held-responsible-for-one-group-s--crime---naqvi-on-tablighi-jamaat-row.html
196,23-4-20,21 foreigners who had attended Tablighi meet arrested,"The crime branch of Thane police On Thursday arrested 25 persons including 21 foreign nationals who had allegedly attended a gathering of the Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi in March.

They were arrested after their quarantine period was over. A court later granted them bail, an official said.

The congregation in Delhi's Nizamuddin area turned out be a major coronavirus hotspot, following which police in every state began to track down those who had attended it.

Senior inspector Nitin Thakre said those arrested included 13 Bangladeshis and eight Malaysian nationals while four persons are local residents.

The foreign nationals violated the rules under their tourist visas and attended the Tablighi meet and later returned here, he said.

They were found to be living at Tanvir Ulum Madarsa Trust, Kausa, and Al Nadi Ul Falah, Kausa. On April 1 they were detained and quarantined at a shelter at Shil Daighar.

They were arrested after their quarantine period was over on Thursday, inspector Thakre said.

They are accused of living together in violation of the provisions of the Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act and not following social distancing.

198,23-4-20,7-yr jail for assault on medical staff,"Ordinance makes attacks non-bailable offence, probe within 30 days

Sending a clear message that there will be no compromise on safety of the health workers fighting corona pandemic, the Government on Wednesday brought an Ordinance by amending the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, which will allow imprisonment from 6 months to 7 years along with a fine of up to Rs 5 lakh for those found guilty of assaulting them.

Addressing a Press conference here, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said the Government would act “tough” against those who would attack doctors and frontline health workers.

The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi cleared the ordinance a day after the Indian Medical Association (IMA) demanded the Centre to bring in a law on urgent basis to protect medical professionals from attack on duty. This demand followed rising incidents of violence against healthcare workers on the frontline of the fight against Covid-19.

Javadekar said the crimes against health workers had been made a “non-bailable offense”. Under the new law, investigation in such cases will be completed in a time-bound manner. “Such crime will now be cognizable and non-bailable. Investigation will be done in 30 days. Accused can be sentenced from 3 months-5 years and penalised from Rs 50,000 up to Rs 2 lakh,” Javadekar said.

In extremely violent cases, accused may get six months to seven years in jail.

“Health workers who are trying to save the country from this epidemic are unfortunately facing attacks. No incident of violence or harassment, against them will be tolerated. An Ordinance has been brought in, it will be implemented after President’s sanction,” he said.

The Minister said if damage was done to vehicles or clinics of healthcare workers, a compensation amounting to twice the market value of the damaged property would be charged from the accused.

He also said health briefings would now be reduced to four days a week, while Press releases and Cabinet briefing would be held on alternate days.

Soon after the approval of the Ordinance, Modi tweeted, epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 manifests our commitment to protect each and every healthcare worker who is bravely battling Covid-19 on the frontline. “It will ensure safety of our professionals. There can be no compromise on their safety,” he said.

Home Minister Amit Shah and Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday interacted with doctors and senior representatives of the IMA through a video conference following which the IMA called off their silent protest planned for 9 pm on Wednesday against the spate of attack on their fraternity.

“He (the Home Minister has assured that the Government of India will take all necessary steps and come out shortly with relevant legislations to address the safety and dignity of doctors and healthcare givers,” the IMA said in a statement here. It said it is withdrawing the protest “to maintain the unity and integrity of our country.”

Allaying all concerns of the medical fraternity, Shah assured them that the Government would leave no stone unturned in ensuring their wellbeing and security, said a statement here.

199,23-4-20,"Cops attacked over lockdown, food delivery","Policemen came under attack at several places across the country in West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh and other places over enforcing the lockdown and improper distribution of food grain.

In Aligarh, vegetable vendors pelted stones at policemen at a market on Wednesday when they went there to impose the lockdown against coronavirus, injuring one of them. According to Aligarh District Magistrate Chandra Bhushan Singh, the trouble began when the policemen intervened in a tiff between two vegetable vendors just before the daily four-hour lockdown relaxation was to end.

Some people were trying to spread such rumours and the police have identified two such persons who will be prosecuted, Singh said. One policeman was injured in the stone pelting here.

Additional District Magistrate RK Maalpani said the incident took place in the Bhojpura locality in the old city areas when policemen were imposing the lockdown measures after the 6 am to 10 am relaxation. Despite the police order, the vegetable vendors continued to sell their items, and started pelting stones at the police team, which was outnumbered, he said.

Aligarh is not the only place where some locals are resisting the lockdown that is being enforced by the local police.

Another incidence of violence against the police was reported from West Bengal after the police objected to a road blockade put up the locals, who alleged improper distribution of food grains. The police, however, have claimed that the locals blocked a road and when they objected, they attacked them.

The incident took place in Baduria, North 24 Parganas. In a viral video, locals are seen attacking police personnel, while the police are also seen beating people.

In Ahmedabad, four policemen, including a senior inspector, were injured after locals threw stones at them for enforcing the lockdown. In a video of the incident, some policemen can be seen running for cover while the mob pelted stones at them. According to police, as many as 15 residents of Sardarnagar area were detained and case has been registered.

A police officer was allegedly attacked in Madhya Pradesh's Sheopur district on Wednesday when he asked members of a family to produce a man so that he could be checked up for coronavirus symptoms. The injured has been identified as Sub-inspector Shreeram Awasthi (52), who sustained a head injury when a stone hit him.

In a similar incident, clashes broke out outside PDS outlets in parts of West Bengal earlier this month as people jostled to get free ration being distributed by the State Government.

200,23-4-20,Infants mortally susceptible to coronavirus,"Contrary to the general perception that coronavirus is “rarely fatal” among young children and infants, a latest study by American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on more than 2,500 Covid-19 children suggested that these groups recorded a higher hospitalisation rate than any other child age group. Of 95 infants, 62 per cent were hospitalised, it said.

The study comes amid reports of deaths of two infants due to Covid-19. Last week a one-and-a-half-month-old baby died at Delhi’s Kalawati Saran Children’s Hospital, while on April 8, 2020 a 14-month-old child passed away in Gujarat’s Jamnagar.

In fact, according to the recent Government data as on April 8, 2020, at least 8.61 per cent cases were those of age between 0-20 years while 41.88 per cent cases fell between 21 to 40 years group, 32.82 per cent cases between 41 to 60 years, and 16.69 per cent cases above 60 years.

In the earlier stage of pandemic it was believed that the virus will not strike children as severely as the elderly or people suffering from co-morbidities such as heart disease, diabetes or respiratory problems.

In fact, the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) had claimed that newborns, babies and young children seemed to be mostly unaffected and any symptoms in children have only been mild.

However, the CDC’s latest study on more than 2,500 Covid-19 cases among under-18s suggested otherwise.

“The study authors recommended that doctors maintain a high index of suspicion for children who could have Covid-19, especially for infants and kids with underlying conditions,” according to the Science Alert.

The study did find, though, that children are less likely to develop coronavirus symptoms than adults. As on April 6, when the CDC published its last comprehensive report on the coronavirus and children, 2 per cent of confirmed Covid-19 cases had occurred in people under age 18. That mirrored data from China and Italy, which reported that children accounted for about 2 per cent of infections.

If the studies have talked about fatalities of kids due to the virus, the United Nations, in a grim assessment of the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on children, said that the looming global recession resulting from the outbreak could cause hundreds of thousands of additional child deaths this year, effectively reversing recent gains in reducing infant mortality, and push millions of children into extreme poverty.

It said an estimated 42-66 million children could fall into extreme poverty as a result of the crisis this year, adding to the estimated 386 million million children already in extreme poverty in 2019.

Children are not the face of this pandemic. But they are at risk of being among its biggest victims. While they have thankfully been largely spared from the direct health effects of Covid-19, at least to date, the crisis is having a profound effect on their wellbeing,” a new ‘Policy Brief: The impact of COVID-19 on children’ released on Thursday by the United Nations said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/infants-mortally-susceptible-to-coronavirus-2020-04-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/infants-mortally-susceptible-to-coronavirus.html
201,23-4-20,"Steady rise in cases, total 21,370; Gujarat races on","The coronavirus cases in the country reached 21,370 on Wednesday night with 1,270 fresh cases reported during the day. The death toll stood 681 with as many as 36 patients falling prey to the virus in the last 12 hours itself.

The Union Health Ministry said that with a total of 4,122 patients being recovered from the viral infection so far, the recovery rate stands at 19.36 per cent in the country.

Maharashtra continued to be the worst hit with 5,649 coronavirus cases and 269 deaths. The highest number of cases was reported from Mumbai with more than 3,400 positive Covid-19 patients. On Wednesday Maharashtra added 431 new cases.

Gujarat has reported 229 new cases to log a total of 2,407 cases and 95 deaths, followed by Delhi, which has reported 2,248 cases and 48 deaths. Rajasthan has reported 1,868 cases, Tamil Nadu 1,629, Uttar Pradesh 1,449, and Madhya Pradesh 1,587 cases.

However, as a good news, all positive cases in Goa and Manipur are now negative.

In the meantime, a day after asking the States to halt conducting tests from Rapid testing kits, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said that it has forwarded a protocol for using rapid antibody test to all States, and reiterated that antibody rapid tests are largely to be used as a tool for surveillance.

“Globally also, utility of this test is evolving and it is currently being used for detecting the formation of antibodies in individuals. These test results are also dependent on field conditions. As noted by ICMR, these tests cannot replace the RT-PCR test to diagnose Covid-19 cases,” it said in a statement.

ICMR has also assured assistance to collect data from various States to assess the scope and extent of utility of these rapid antibody tests in field conditions.

Meanwhile, following positive results from the convalescent plasma (CP) therapy in treatment of Covid-19 patients in some States, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has granted no objection for conduct of clinical trials for therapy as per protocol developed by ICMR.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/steady-rise-in-cases--total-21-370--gujarat-races-on-2020-04-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/steady-rise-in-cases--total-21-370--gujarat-races-on.html
202,23-4-20,"In hindsight, I probably didn't need to pull out of IPL: Chris Woakes","

London, Apr 23 (PTI) England all-rounder Chris Woakes has revealed that he pulled out of this year's IPL primarily to be with his pregnant wife but need not have officially announced his withdrawal from the event, which was suspended indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Woakes was bought for Rs 1.5 crore by Delhi Capitals at the IPL auction last year, but pulled out of the tournament saying that he wanted to stay fresh for England's home Test summer, which is also currently on hold due to the pandemic.

""In hindsight I probably didn't need to pull out. I didn't say it at the time but we're expecting another baby in September and that added to the decision,"" Woakes was quoted as saying by 'The Cricketer'.

""My wife wasn't well at home. The idea of being away from home for three months was going to be too much. Family had to come first,"" he said.

Woakes, who has not played a T20 since August 2018, and featured in a T20I for England in November 2015, insisted he is not finished playing the shortest format of the game.

""By no means do I feel like I'm finished in T20. I'd still love to play in the IPL,"" he said.

The 31-year-old, who has represented England in 33 Tests and 101 ODIs, insisted that national duty takes top priority but he is open to playing other tournaments.

""I want to play as much cricket as I can moving forward while looking after my body. My England career is No.1 but if opportunities come up, I'd still like to play in them.""

Talking about the T20 World Cup scheduled in October-November in Australia, Woakes said it was unlikely that he would make the squad.

""At the minute it doesn't quite look like I'm going to get a go in T20 unless something drastic happens in terms of injuries. I'd probably have to have had an unbelievable summer.""

The right-arm pacer said he would be open to playing in an empty stadium without fans to get the international game back up and running.

""At least give the public something to watch and hopefully entertain some who are missing it a lot,"" he said.

""We'd want a three-week block (of preparation) to get overs in your legs to be able to back up a 20-over day in a Test. But again that might not be possible either. So I think two weeks would probably be the minimum,"" he added.

England's Test tour of Sri Lanka was called off as the visiting team rushed back home due to the rapidly spreading pandemic.

""You saw during the early days of the Sri Lanka tour that we were trying our hardest not to make contact with each other and not shaking hands,"" he recalled.

Asked about the issue of using saliva to shine the ball, the Englishman said he prefers to use sweat.

""I try and use as much sweat as possible rather than putting your hands in your mouth just from a normal hygiene point of view.

""But I think it could potentially change the way things work with the ball,"" he explained.

203,23-4-20,Finch prepared for T20 World Cup postponement,"Australia's limited-overs captain Aaron Finch feels the dreaded COVID-19 pandemic might lead to a postponement of this year's T20 World Cup by up to three months.

The T20 World Cup is scheduled in Australia from October 18 to November 15. Finch doesn't see that holding up given the current health crises affecting lakhs of people worldwide.

""I think we might have to get our heads around a T20 World Cup that might be postponed for a month, two months, three months, whatever it has to be,"" Finch told 'SEN Radio'.

Finch said he wouldn't mind seeing the game resuming without fans once the pandemic is brought under control.

""But as long as we can get live sport up and running. Whether that's with crowds or not, I don't think that makes any difference to the players.

""We played one ODI against New Zealand with no crowd (and it) was really strange for first four or five overs, but then you got into your work,"" he said.

Apart from the T20 World Cup, Australia is also set to host India for a bilateral series which includes a four-Test rubber.

The ICC's Chief Executives Committee (CEC) is meeting on Thursday to discuss the financial implications of COVID-19 and also the contingency planning for all ICC global events, including the T20 World Cup, over a conference call.

Finch feels authorities will need to be ""creative"" while rejigging the international schedule.

""I think we might have to get a little bit creative with how we do that (as part of a new-look schedule). Whether that's setting up and playing two Test matches in one hub or something like that,"" he said.

Fast bowler Josh Hazlewood had suggested that the entire Border-Gavaskar Trophy be held at one venue -- the Adelaide Oval -- to ensure that the rubber does go ahead.

Cricket Australia is exploring options to save the series in the wake of the pandemic which has led to global travel restrictions as well.

204,23-4-20,"Sport in empty stadiums will be disappointing, feels Sachin Tendulkar","He revelled in the full-throated chants that accompanied his stay at the crease and Sachin Tendulkar says that's one reason why the very idea of sport inside an empty stadium disappoints him.

Made for television sport is being given a serious thought owing to the COVID-19 pandemic which has made social distancing a necessity. But sport without fans is not an option for one of India's greatest sportspersons.

""Empty stadiums would be so disappointing for players who are competing. There are lot of times when players respond to spectators. If I play a good shot and the manner in which crowd responds also brings in that energy,"" Tendulkar told PTI during an exclusive interview talking about the implications of the contagion that has infected millions.

""Similarly, if a bowler bowls a fiery spell and the crowd is responding to it, it builds a kind of pressure on the batsman and he needs to respond to it.

""Spectators are integral to any sport. Their encouragement, vociferous chants for or against you is a necessity in sport,"" said the batting icon, who turns 47 on Friday.

Considered an insightful student of the game, what is his assessment of how the cricket world will cope once normalcy returns?

""I think players will be wary for some time when it comes to using saliva (to shine the ball). It will play on their minds. Social distancing measures will be followed till the deadly virus is around.

""High fives and hugging your teammates will be avoided for some time. This is what I would like to believe. They will be conscious to begin with and may maintain social distancing,"" Tendulkar said.

And this is precisely the reason why he wants complete normalcy before one starts off with sporting activities, something his one-time opening partner and BCCI president Sourav Ganguly endorsed a couple of days back.

""...You would want to play in an environment which is safe and secure. I still believe one has to be careful and be aware of what we have been hit with. The importance of good hygiene, something I have promoted as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador,"" he said.

Tendulkar would obviously love to watch cricket, whatever be the format, but only when the BCCI and the government are fully confident that players and everyone associated with the game are safe.

""I have not given too much thought to it -- whether the World Cup should be held here or IPL should be held. I don't know,"" he said.

""Beating this virus is paramount and after that, a number of things can be simultaneously discussed. But they can only materialise if we overcome this challenge and if we are able to do so, then no harm in having those discussions,"" he added.

Tendulkar didn't want to comment on whether the IPL can happen in October this year although he did say that he has been hearing about a shortened IPL.

""I don't know how many days in this window are left and whether an IPL can be conducted during that period. I am sure government and the BCCI will take into account how safe spectators will be and how safe the players will be,"" he said.

""After that a decision will be made, and that's how it should be. But if it's safe, it will be nice to have cricket in whatever manner we can have,"" he added.

But does he think that winning and losing will have the same kind of impact in an athlete's mind once the mayhem of this pandemic is over?

""Once an athlete goes out to compete, that athlete wants to win. Not winning will still bring disappointment and that will continue I feel. That's what makes that event a terrific spectacle,"" he reasoned.

""If you think that I am playing for fun and losing doesn't hurt me, then the standard of competition will drop.

""Athletes will have to go out to win and that element has to stay alive and I know for sure that it will continue to stay alive. Yes, this is a challenge that brings in perspective but it won't mean that athletes would stop caring less about winning and losing,"" he was quote clear.

He believes that mental health is another important aspect that has been ignored for a long time but the ongoing crisis has brought it into focus.

""I think mental fitness is an important element which everyone consciously or unconsciously ignore. That needs to be addressed.

""If you are feeling mentally disturbed, you should have the right people around you to support you, encourage you and pull you out of that rut,"" he said.

Life coming to a standstill has been humbling and probably given everyone the time to reflect, feels Tendulkar.

205,23-4-20,Fitch Ratings sees India growth slipping to 0.8% in FY21,"Fitch Ratings on Thursday slashed India's economic growth projections to 0.8 per cent in the current 2020-21 fiscal saying an unparalleled global recession was underway due to disruptions caused by the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic and resultant lockdowns.

In its Global Economic Outlook, Fitch Ratings said India's gross domestic product (GDP) growth will slip to 0.8 per cent for the year April 2020 to March 2021 (FY21) as compared to an estimated 4.9 per cent growth in the previous fiscal.

Growth is, however, expected to rebound to 6.7 per cent in 2021-22.

The rating agency predicted two consecutive quarters of contraction or negative year-on-year growth in current fiscal -- (-)0.2 per cent in April-June and (-)0.1 per cent in July-September. This compares to 4.4 per cent estimated growth in January-March.

Growth is expected to rebound to 1.4 per cent in the last quarter of 2020 calendar year.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fitch-ratings-sees-india-growth-slipping-to-0-8--in-fy21-2020-04-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/fitch-ratings-sees-india-growth-slipping-to-0-8--in-fy21.html
206,23-4-20,Arnab Goswami's car allegedly attacked in Mumbai; two held,"Two motorcycle-borne persons allegedly attacked journalist Arnab Goswami's car in Mumbai and tried to break its glass window when he and his wife were on their way home in the early hours of Thursday, police said.

Both the attackers have been arrested, he said.

The incident took place on Ganpatrao Kadam Marg, when Goswami was returning from a studio located in Bombay Dyeing Complex in Lower Parel, a police official said.

The attackers overtook Goswami's car, stopped it and one of them allegedly tried to break the vehicle's glass window by repeatedly hitting it with his hands, the official said.

The attackers were carrying a bottle of ink which they threw on his car, the official said. Goswami's security guards, who were behind in another car, caught hold of the two persons and handed them over to the N M Joshi Marg Police, he added.

In a video posted after the alleged attack, Goswami said he was told by his security guards that the attackers were Youth Congress workers. There was no confirmation of the same by either police or the youth outfit.

Goswami has faced flak over his remarks aimed at Sonia Gandhi during a discussion on Palghar incident in which three persons, including two sadhus, were lynched.

Senior Congress leaders, including chief ministers, slammed Goswami, the editor-in-chief and owner of Republic TV, with the party's chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala alleging that it was ""deeply disgraceful that PM & BJP eulogize this brand of TV anchors"".

207,23-4-20,"Instead of tackling COVID-19, BJP spreading virus of communal prejudice, hatred: Sonia Gandhi","Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday accused the BJP of spreading the virus of communal prejudice and hatred in the country, asserting that ""grave damage"" is being done to social harmony.

Addressing a meeting of the Congress Working Committee, Gandhi said it should worry every Indian and her party will have to work hard to repair this damage.

""Let me also share with you something that should worry each and every one of us as Indians. When we should be tackling the coronavirus unitedly, the BJP continues to spread the virus of communal prejudice and hatred,"" she said.

""Grave damage is being done to our social harmony. Our party, we will have to work hard to repair that damage,"" the Congress president added.

Former prime minister Manmohan Singh, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and top Congress leaders attended the meeting through video conference.

This is the second time the CWC, the Congress' top decision-making body, is meeting through video-conferencing in the past three weeks ever since the lockdown was enforced to contain the coronavirus threat.

The Congress president said the coronavirus pandemic has increased disturbingly in the past three weeks and called upon the government to increase testing for it.

Gandhi said she has written several times to the prime minister since the lockdown was enforced and suggested several measures and constructive cooperation.

""Unfortunately, they have been acted upon only partially and in a miserly way. The compassion, large-heartedness and alacrity that should be forthcoming from the central government is conspicuous by its absence,"" she said.

The Congress chief said the focus of the party must continue to be on successfully engaging with health, food security and livelihood issues.

She claimed that around 12 crore people have lost jobs in the first phase of the lockdown and urged the government to provide a relief package for the MSME sector, which accounts for one-third of the GDP.

Gandhi called upon the government to provide food and financial security to migrants and jobless stranded at various places and were desperate to reach back home.

""We have repeatedly urged PM there is no alternative to testing, tracing and quarantine. Unfortunately, testing still remains low, testing kits still in short supply,"" she noted.

Gandhi said trade, commerce and industry have come to a virtual halt and crores of livelihoods have been destroyed.

""The central government does not appear to have a clear idea on how the situation will be managed after May 3rd. A lockdown of the present nature after that date would be even more devastating,"" she said.

Former prime minister Manmohan said the success of the lockdown will be judged finally on India's ability to tackle COVID-19.

He also said the cooperation between the Centre and states was key to success of the country's fight against coronavirus.

Singh said it is necessary to focus on a number of issues in the fight against coronavirus.

The fight against COVID-19 would very much depend upon the availability of resources, he noted.

Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said unless the central government comes forward to financially help states, the fight against COVID-19 will get weakened.

""Unless there is a big financial package for states, how will normalcy return to states post lockdown,"" he asked.

Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said unless the Centre rises to the occasion and provides financial assistance to states, how will the fight against COVID-19 be won.

Puducherry chief minister V Narayanasamy said the Union government has not given any assistance to the states.

""How will states survive in times of crisis. We are not enemies but have to act and work together,"" Narayanasamy said at the CWC meet.

208,23-4-20,"FinMin freezes increment on DA, DR for central govt employees, pensioners","The finance ministry on Thursday decided to put on hold increment in dearness allowance (DA) for 50 lakh central government employees and 61 lakh pensioners till July 2021 due to the COVID-19 crisis.

""In view of the crisis arising out of COVID-19, it has been decided that additional instalment of dearness allowance payable to central government employees and dearness relief (DR) to central government pensioners due from January 1, 2020, shall not be paid.

""The additional instalment of DA and DR due from July 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021, shall also not be paid,"" the Department of Expenditure said in an office memorandum.

However, DA and DR at current rates will continue to be paid.

According to sources, the combined savings on account of freezing of these instalments of DA and DR to central government employees and pensioners would be Rs 37,530 crore in the current financial year and 2021-22.

Generally, the states follow the Centre order on DA and DR.

It is estimated that the savings on suspension of these instalments of DA and DR of state government employees and pensioners will be Rs 82,566 crore, the sources said.

Thus, the combined savings of the Centre and states will be Rs 1.20 lakh crore, which will help in fighting the battle against COVID-19 and its fallout.

The last DA hike for central government employees was effected last month effective January 1. 2020.

The Union Cabinet had approved a 4 per cent increase in DA for government employees and pensioners to 21 per cent.

With Thursday's decision, this 4 per cent hike has been put on hold.

210,23-4-20,Trump signs executive order temporarily suspending immigration into US,"US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order pausing immigration for 60 days to protect the jobs of Americans laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The temporary suspension of immigration will affect those who are legally seeking entry into the United States for employment purposes but not the ones who are already living in the country, the order said.

Describing it as a very powerful order Trump told reporters during his daily news briefing at the White House on Wednesday that he signed the order before coming for the press briefing.

By pausing immigration, we'll help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens. It would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labour flown in from abroad, he said.

The executive order, a copy of which was released by the White House, said the new provisions apply to foreign nationals outside the US who do not have an immigrant visa that is valid on the effective date of proclamation.

It also applies to those foreign nationals who do not have an official travel document other than a visa that is valid on the effective date of proclamation or issued on any date thereafter that permits him or her to travel to the US and seek entry or admission.

The suspension, the executive order said, does not apply to those foreign nationals already inside the country on a green card. It provides exemptions to healthcare workers, or seeking to enter the US as a legal permanent resident under investment category.

Spouses of a US citizen, 21 years and younger kids of American nationals, or those who are under the process of being adopted are also exempted from this temporary suspension of immigration.

Trump said he was determined that, without this measure, the US faces a potentially protracted economic recovery with persistently high unemployment if labour supply outpaces labour demand.

Excess labour supply affects all workers and potential workers, but it is particularly harmful to workers at the margin between employment and unemployment, who are typically 'last in' during an economic expansion and 'first out' during an economic contraction, he said in his executive order.

In recent years, these workers have been disproportionately represented by historically disadvantaged groups, including African Americans and other minorities, those without a college degree, and the disabled.

These are the workers who, at the margin between employment and unemployment, are likely to bear the burden of excess labour supply disproportionately, he said.

The White House in a statement said that this is a temporary pause demanded by the crisis being faced as a nation.

The pause will be in effect for 60 days, and the administration will continue to monitor the labour market to amend or extend the proclamation if needed, it said.

There will be exemptions for medical and other essential workers to combat the outbreak, spouses and minor children of American citizens, and certain other aliens, it said.

Trump is also asking his administration to review guest worker programmes to assess whether additional measures should be taken to protect American workers.

The White House further said that mass migration of low-skilled labour into the US disproportionately harms historically disadvantaged Americans.

211,23-4-20,China's asymptomatic cases increase to over 980 with 27 new infections,"China has reported 27 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases, taking their total to 984, while a high-level committee headed by Premier Li Keqiang asked health officials to remain focussed on the targeted containment of the deadly virus.

Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested COVID-19 positive but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. However, they pose a risk of spreading the disease to others.

Besides the 27 asymptomatic patients, 10 new confirmed COVID cases, including six from Chinese returning from abroad, were reported in the country on Wednesday. The four other patients -- three from Heilongjiang province bordering Russia and one in Guangdong province -- were domestically transmitted, China's National Health Commission (NHC) said on Thursday.

No death was reported on Wednesday, the NHC said.

As of Wednesday, the overall confirmed COVID-19 cases in China increased to 82,798, including 4,632 fatalities and 1,616 imported cases, it said.

Of the total imported cases, 37 are in critical condition, the NHC said.

But more concerning factor for the Chinese authorities is the steady increase of asymptomatic cases among locals.

The 27 new asymptomatic cases, including one from abroad, were reported on the mainland, the NHC said, adding that 984 such asymptomatic patients, including 166 from abroad, were still under medical observation.

In a meeting on Wednesday, the Central Leading Group headed by Premier Li said considering the new circumstances and challenges at home and abroad, health official should stay focussed on targeted containment and detecting and reinforcing areas of weakness to forestall any resurgence of infection.

The Central Leading Group is supervising the COVID-19 containment efforts since January.

The meeting noted the recent occurrence of case clusters and cross infections in hospitals in a few Chinese cities, an official press release here said.

It directed competent authorities to promptly send a working group consisting of disease control and medical experts to cities concerned to supervise local efforts in ascertaining causes and releasing information.

The meeting also called for all-round progress in restarting work and full-capacity production and restoring normal life and work on the basis of regularized containment measures.

Meanwhile, as of Wednesday, 1,033 confirmed cases, including four deaths, were reported in Hong Kong. Macao registered 45 COVID-19 cases and Taiwan 426, including six fatalities.

A total of 678 patients in Hong Kong, 26 in Macao and 236 in Taiwan have been recovered.

212,23-4-20,Remittances to India likely to decline by 23 pc in 2020 due to COVID-19: World Bank,"As a result of the deadly coronavirus pandemic, which has resulted in a global recession, remittances to India are likely to drop by 23 per cent from USD 83 billion last year to USD 64 billion this year, the World Bank has said.

""In India, remittances are projected to fall by about 23 per cent in 2020, to USD 64 billion a striking contrast with the growth of 5.5 percent and receipts of USD 83 billion seen in 2019, the World Bank said in a report on impact of COVID-19 on migration and remittances released on Wednesday.

Globally remittances are projected to decline sharply by about 20 per cent this year due to the economic crisis induced by the COVID-19 pandemic and shutdown.

The projected fall, which would be the sharpest decline in recent history, is largely due to a fall in the wages and employment of migrant workers, who tend to be more vulnerable to loss of employment and wages during an economic crisis in a host country, the bank said.

Remittances are a vital source of income for developing countries. The ongoing economic recession caused by COVID-19 is taking a severe toll on the ability to send money home and makes it all the more vital that we shorten the time to recovery for advanced economies, said World Bank Group President David Malpass.

Remittances help families afford food, healthcare, and basic needs. As the World Bank Group implements fast, broad action to support countries, we are working to keep remittance channels open and safeguard the poorest communities' access to these most basic needs, he added.

Remittance flows are expected to fall across all World Bank Group regions, most notably in Europe and Central Asia (27.5 per cent), followed by Sub-Saharan Africa (23.1 per cent), South Asia (22.1 per cent), the Middle East and North Africa (19.6 per cent), Latin America and the Caribbean (19.3 per cent), and East Asia and the Pacific (13 per cent).

In Pakistan, the projected decline is also about 23 per cent, totalling about USD 17 billion, compared with a total of USD 22.5 billion last year, when remittances grew by 6.2 per cent.

In Bangladesh, remittances are projected at USD 14 billion this year, a likely fall of about 22 per cent.

Remittances to Nepal and Sri Lanka are expected to decline by 14 percent and 19 percent, respectively this year.

215,23-4-20,Pompeo presses China to allow lab inspections amid pandemic,"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday pressed China to allow inspectors into sensitive laboratories, voicing concern about their security amid the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Pompeo has refused to rule out that the deadly virus leaked out of a laboratory in the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan, a scenario strenuously denied by Beijing.

""You have to remember -- these labs are still open inside of China these labs that contain complex pathogens that were being studied. It's not just the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" Pompeo told reporters.

""It's important that those materials are being handled in a safe and secure way such that there isn't accidental release,"" Pompeo told reporters.

Pompeo cited the example of nuclear facilities, pointing to the rigorous global inspections to ensure safety.

He renewed concerns that China has not shared a sample of the initially detected virus, known scientifically as SARS-CoV-2.

""We still do not have a sample of the virus, nor has the world had access to the facilities or other locations where this virus may have originally originated inside of Wuhan,"" Pompeo said.

Chinese authorities initially suppressed news of the deadly virus, including detaining a prominent whistleblower.

Chinese scientists have since said that they suspect that the virus emerged late last year in a Wuhan meat market that butchered exotic animals.

But questions immediately arose because of the presence nearby of the maximum-security virology lab, with senior US officials bringing into the mainstream what was initially an online conspiracy theory.

Critics say President Donald Trump is eager to deflect from blame over his own handling of the pandemic, which has killed some 45,000 people in the United States, more than any other country.

The Cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi cleared the funds utilisation in three phases, mainly for creation of dedicated treatment facilities, setting up laboratories, research on the pandemic and purchase of medical equipment, including 13 lakh diagnostic kits. Rs 7,774 crore has been provisioned for Covid-19 Emergency Response and the rest for medium-term support, ranging from one to four years to be provided under mission-mode approach.

These interventions and initiatives would be implemented under the Health Ministry.

In the first phase, the Health Ministry with the support of all the other line ministries has already undertaken several activities.

“The key objectives of the package include mounting emergency response to slow and limit coronavirus infection in India through development of diagnostics and COV1D-dedicated treatment facilities, centralised procurement of essential medical equipment and drugs, strengthen and build resilient national and state health systems, setting up of laboratories and bolstering surveillance activities and pandemic research,” an official statement stated.

Mamata flayed the Centre for sending IMCTs to look into the alleged “dilution” of lockdown protocols instead of sending adequate number of testing kits to Kolkata.

While State Chief Secretary wrote a letter of compliance to the Centre saying the State Government was cooperating with the IMCT and he had personally met the Central officials to arrange for their visits to various places, Mamata blew hot saying how canards were being spread everyday about low number of tests in Bengal.

""This is absolutely false … they were not only sending inadequate number of kits but also sending faulty ones … and now they are blaming us,"" the Chief Minister said adding how ""they (the BJP Government) are talking and sending big teams everyday and issuing advisories but doing nothing worthwhile to help us out.""

Referring to a strongly worded letter from the Home Ministry she said, ""They are sending strong letters. That is their prerogative. I can also send strong letters but I am not doing that because we are fighting the virus at ground level.""

Mamata, who personally hit the streets for the second day on Wednesday asking the people over microphone to follow the lockdown protocols and remain indoors, said, ""There they (Centre) are sending faulty kits and then they are using the media to malign our State which is deplorable at a time when all the Governments should work together.""

Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha, on the other hand, wrote to Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla --- in reply to his strongly worded letter warning the former that Bengal needed to cooperate with the Central team --- that there had been ""no non-cooperation"" with the IMCTs.

Making it clear that since the Central teams arrived without prior consultation --- a grudge that the State had already made known to Delhi --- Sinha said that there was no opportunity to provide logistic support, nor did the teams seek such support.

In his letter denying reports that the Central team was not cooperated with, Sinha wrote, ""The teams had arrived without any prior consultation with us and therefore there was neither such opportunity to provide any logistic support... Nor did the teams ask for any help. They went to BSF guest house in Kolkata and the SSB guest house at Siliguri on their own.""

He then wrote giving ""highest assurance"" that the Central orders would be complied with.

The IMCT had alleged that it had been stopped from moving around and meeting the people and health officials by the State police. Later it brought the whole affair to the notice of the Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla who then wrote to the Chief Secretary warning him of action if orders were not complied with.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/mamata-blinks--but-raps-centre-for-lockdown-inspection.html

221,23-4-20,"Cabinet OK’s Rs 22,186-crore subsidies to Phosphatic and Potassic fertilisers for 20-21","The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved Rs 22, 186 crore subsidies to Phosphatic and Potassic (P&K) fertilizers for the year 2020-21. Under this Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS), the Cabinet also approved the inclusion of a complex fertilizer namely Ammonium Phosphate (NP 14:28:0:0), said Government in a statement.

“The approved rates of NBS are under - N : Rs 18.789 per kg, P : Rs.14.888/kg, K: Rs 10.116/kg and S : Rs 2.374/kg,” said the statement, adding that the subsidy on the P&K will be provided on the subsidy rates approved by the CCEA to the fertiliser companies.

The Cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi also approved extension of relaxation of mandatory requirement of Aadhaar seeding of data in respect of beneficiaries of the States of Assam and Meghalaya and UTs of J&K and Ladakh for one year with effect from April 1 under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme.

“The Pradhan MantriKisanSammanNidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme was launched by the Prime Minister on 24 February, 2019. The Scheme aims to provide income support to all landholder farmer families across the country with cultivable land, subject to certain exclusions. Under the Scheme, an amount of Rs 6,000/- per year is released in three 4-monthly instalments of Rs 2,000/- each directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. The Scheme is effective from 1st December, 2018.

From 1st December, 2019, release of benefits is done only through Aadhaar seeded data of beneficiaries uploaded by the State / UT Governments on the PM-KISAN portal, except in case of the States of Assam and Meghalaya and the UTs of J&K and Ladakh, which have been given exemption from this requirement till 31st March, 2020, as Aadhaar penetration there has been miniscule,” said the statement.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/cabinet-ok---s-rs-22-186-crore-subsidies-to-phosphatic-and-potassic-fertilisers-for-20-21.html

More than 100 COVID-19 cases have been reported in the neighbouring country, several of which are in the areas bordering India, officials said.

""The situation in neighbouring Myanmar has become alarming. Accordingly, more material has been dispatched for fencing the border along the Pakmual-Behiang sector in Churachandpur district.

""Additional police personnel have been deployed in the border areas,"" the chief minister said on Wednesday.

Myanmar shares more than 300-km border with Manipur.

The chief minister lauded the ""tireless efforts"" of the state police department for increasing their vigil in the border areas, accelerating fencing work and setting up more checkpoints to regulate the movement of people between India and Myanmar amid the coronavirus outbreak.

223,23-4-20,COVID-19 may not be sexually transmitted: Study,"COVID-19 is unlikely to be spread through sexual transmission, according to a study that found no evidence of the novel coronavirus in the semen or testes of men.

The study, published in the journal Fertility & Sterility, was not comprehensive enough to fully rule out the possibility that the disease could be sexually transmitted.

However, the chances of it occurring, based on this limited finding, appear to be remote, the researchers said.

""The fact that in this small, preliminary study that it appears the virus that causes COVID-19 doesn't show up in the testes or semen could be an important finding,"" said James M Hotaling, an associate professor at University of Utah in the US.

""If a disease like COVID-19 were sexually transmittable that would have major implications for disease prevention and could have serious consequences for a man's long-term reproductive health,"" said Hotaling.

The researchers from China and the US launched the study in response to concerns that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, could be sexually transmitted like Ebola, Zika and other emerging viral pathogens.

They collected semen samples from 34 Chinese men one month, on average, after they were diagnosed with mild to moderate cases of COVID-19.

Laboratory tests did not detect SARS-CoV-2 in any of the semen samples, the researchers found.

However, just because the virus wasn't present in the existing semen didn't necessary rule out that it hadn't entered the testes where sperm cells are formed, they said.

""If the virus is in the testes but not the sperm it can't be sexually transmitted,"" said Jingtao Guo, a postdoctoral scientist at the Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah.

""But if it is in the testes, it can cause long-term damage to semen and sperm production,"" Guo said.

To sort this part of the puzzle out, the researchers analysed a dataset generated from a single cell mRNA atlas from healthy young organ donors that was available from prior work.

This atlas allows them to examine mRNA, the genetic material used to make proteins, in any single testicular cell.

In this case, scientist used it to examine the expression of a pair of genes associated with SARS-CoV-2.

These two genes, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) act as receptors, allowing SARS-CoV2 to penetrate cells and replicate.

In order for the virus to access cells effectively, both receptors must be present in the same cell.

When the scientists examined the dataset, they found that genes encoding these two proteins were only found in four of the 6,500 testicular cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to invade human testicular cells, Guo said.

Despite these findings, the researchers acknowledge that their study has several important limitations including a small sample size and the fact that none of the donors had been severely ill with COVID-19.

""It could be that a man who is critically ill with COVID-19 might have a higher viral load, which could lead to a greater likelihood of infecting the semen. We just don't have the answer to that right now,"" Hotaling said.

""But knowing that we didn't find that kind of activity among the patients in this study who were recovering from mild to moderate forms of the disease is reassuring,"" he said.

However, Hotaling warns that intimate contact can still increase the risk of spreading the disease through coughing, sneezing and kissing.

Some infected people are asymptomatic and can appear healthy, even as they pass the virus along to others, he added.

224,23-4-20,Two cats in New York are first pets in US to test positive for COVID19,"Two cats in New York State have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, marking the first confirmed case of the COVID-19 infection in pets in the US, according to health authorities.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) said on Wednesday that the two cats, who live in separate areas of New York state, have become the first pets in the country to test positive for coronavirus.

""These are the first pets in the United States to test positive,"" the two agencies said in a joint statement.

The agencies said that both pets had mild respiratory illness and are expected to make a full recovery. COVID19 infections have been reported in very few animals worldwide and mostly in those that had close contact with a person with COVID-19.

Even as public health officials are still learning about the virus, there is no evidence that pets play a role in spreading coronavirus to humans in the United States.

Therefore, there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals that may compromise their welfare. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including pets, could be affected, the statement said.

Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, it said, adding that if other animals are confirmed positive for coronavirus in the country, the USDA will post the findings.

State animal health and public health officials will take the lead in making determinations about whether animals should be tested for SARS-CoV-2, the agencies said, using the virus's official name severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2'.

The two agencies said that in the New York cases, a veterinarian had tested the first cat after it showed mild respiratory signs even though no individuals in the household were confirmed to be ill with COVID-19.

It is likely that the virus may have been transmitted to the cat by mildly ill or asymptomatic household members or through contact with an infected person outside its home.

Samples from the second cat, whose owner had tested positive for COVID-19, were taken after it showed signs of respiratory illness. Another cat in the household has shown no signs of illness.

Both cats tested presumptive positive for coronavirus at a private veterinary laboratory, which then reported the results to state and federal officials.

The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) considers coronavirus an emerging disease, and therefore USDA must report confirmed US animal infections to the OIE.

The CDC has recommended that pets not be allowed to interact with people or other animals outside the household, cats should be kept indoors when possible to prevent interactions with other animals or people.

It is also recommended that pet owners avoid dog parks or public places where there is a large crowd. Owners should also wear a cloth face covering and wash hands before and after they interact with their pets.

The CDC also noted that while additional animals may test positive as infections continue in people, performing animal testing does not reduce the availability of tests for humans.

The United States has conducted more than four million COVID-19 tests, more than France, the UK, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria, Australia, Sweden, and Canada combined.

According to estimates by Johns Hopkins University, more than 842,000 people in the US are infected with the virus and over 46,000 people have died in the country due to COVID19.

226,23-4-20,Didn't know 'Money Heist' was so popular: Indian actor Ajay Jethi on Netflix show,"Barcelona-based Indian actor Ajay Jethi, who played a Pakistan-based hacker in Spanish drama ""Money Heist"", says he got know about the global popularity of the Netflix show when people started following and messaging him on social media.

Jethi says his life has taken a complete turn after the fourth season of the show dropped on April 4 with people reaching out to him but the most special call was from his father, who was initially against his acting career.

""I didn't know the series is famous worldwide, I thought it's popular only in Spain. People were praising the show on social media, I received messages from on Instagram, there was a hashtag about my character Shakir. That's when I realised the popularity is on different level, Jethi told PTI in an interview.

Jethi, 39, is not new to acting, having played supportive roles in over 20 Spanish movies and TV shows, besides roles in a few Punjabi movies but this one clicked in a big big way.

""One never knows when you will receive recognition and fame, this is my moment. It is a happy and emotional moment, he said, adding, ""the struggle will continue but I have an added responsibility to do my best. An artiste always works for recognition of his work. This seems like my turning point.""

The actor said last year his manager informed him about a casting call for a Spanish crime drama series, ""La casa de papel , popularly known as Money Heist .

""I thought it is a big in Spanish only. When I was given the script, I started doing bit of research, I binged watched two seasons of it to get an understanding the world of the series.

""When the local Indian and Pakistani distributor community here came to know that I am working on the show, they told me they want to talk to 'the Professor' (Alvaro Morte). I realised that there is a craze for this series even among our people. I wasn't aware that it is coming out as Money Heist' in dubbed English version.""

He said he shot for his portions alone and didn't get to meet anyone from the cast, not even Morte.

In the fourth season of Money Heist , it is Jethi's character - Shakir, who guides the Professor and his team during their mission inside the Bank of Spain.

Jethi said he was bitten by the acting bug during his graduation as one of his friends introduced him to a theatre group of well-known Hindi and Punjabi playwright Balraj Pandit.

But his father was completely against his acting career and decided to send him to Spain for work. Jethi arrived in Spain in 2005 on a work visa. He worked as a construction labourer for sometime and then shifted to a factory job.

""I had told my father I will not study and do theatre only as that is what I love the most but he was against this and in a way he was correct to show his objection because there wasn't work for actors in Punjabi cinema that time.

""In 2005 immigration was open in Spain, my father told his friend to take me there and get me some work. Whatever money I earned, I took Spanish language lessons and took acting classes later on.

But work was hard to come by and he even thought of returning to India but at the suggestion of his partner, he started giving auditions for ads.

""I continued working at factory and going for auditions. I did several ad films, did a mini-series titled 'Alakrana' (2010), which was my debut. I got a manager, who helped me get acting work. I got convinced that I will get work as an actor. I did several big films here like a Spanish film with Alex Pina (producer and creator of Money Heist') titled Kamikaze' (2014).

Jethi started distributing Hindi and Punjabi movies in Spain from 2014. He has distributed films such as Kesari , Bharat , War , Dabangg 3 among others.

I will continue to act in Spanish movies it is because of my work here in Spain that I have got this standing as an actor. I am hungry as an actor I want to do more work. My next goal is acting in Hindi movies, he said.

227,23-4-20,Shooting doesn't come to mind when you see what's happening around: Rahul Dev,"Actor Rahul Dev says while work has been affected due to the nationwide lockdown, worrying about shooting his next project is out of the question when he sees people battling with the coronavirus pandemic.

The lockdown has had an impact on people from all walks of life and all one can do at such a time is hope for normalcy, the actor said.

""Shooting doesn't come to mind when you see what's happening around. My help needed some money and reached out to us. When you look at their stories, struggles, the way people are walking back home... Your mind goes there a lot more than towards your work,"" Dev told PTI.

""At least we are privileged, being in our homes. This (pandemic) has made us realise that even more. Sure, the work has been affected, but everyone is going through that. I hope normalcy returns and we will return to work,"" he added.

The 51-year-old actor said the pandemic stands to change the way people will consume entertainment, with something as normal as watching a film in a theatre taking a hit.

""Going back to a theatre won't be so easy. People will be a bit apprehensive to step in. A lot of films will not only get delayed but will get a direct release on OTT platforms.

""Unless there is an urgent dubbing which can't be pushed because you have to release a film, the actual shooting will go slow.""

The actor, who is currently seen on ALTBalaji's web series ""Who's Your Daddy"", said some of his work, including a series he was featuring on, has come to a halt.

""We had shot 12 episodes for 'Who's Your Daddy' but released only six. There was some pending work left for the rest, so that will come as season two. The other series, 'Poison 2' has been pushed as well.""

""Who's Your Daddy"", Dev said, gave him the opportunity to step into a ""light-hearted"" universe after being known for playing mostly anti-hero on the big screen such as ""Champion"", ""Awara Paagal Deewana"", among others.

The actor said with the evolution of audience, there has been a change across platforms to come up with newer stories.

""In the last seven years, everything has changed because the audience has changed. They're expecting a lot more believable stuff. So goons flying will make sense within a Rohit Shetty universe, but even then it'll have to be entertaining...

""To make mindless isn't easy. It's more difficult to do comedy than a serious role,"" he added.

235,23-4-20,COVID-19: China announces additional USD 30 million grant for WHO,"Cash-rich China on Thursday announced an additional USD 30 million grant to the World Health Organization to support its global fight against the deadly coronavirus, days after Beijing expressed ""serious concern"" over President Donald Trump's decision to freeze US' funding for the UN health agency over its handling of the COVID-19 crisis.

Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang made the announcement at a media briefing here. The grant will be in addition to the USD 20 million provided by China, the world's second largest economy, earlier to the WHO.

""China has decided to donate another USD 30 million in cash to the WHO in addition to the USD 20 million cash donation to support the global fight against COVID-19 to help strengthen developing countries health systems,"" Geng said.

He clarified that the additional USD 30 million funding was ""aimed to COVID-19 response and supporting the health systems of developing countries"".

""This is a different thing from the membership dues paid by China,"" he said.

China hinted at stepping up its monetary contribution to the UN health agency on April 15. Beijing's response came a day after Trump announced to put a ""very powerful"" hold on US' funding to the WHO, accusing the UN agency of being ""very China-centric"" and criticising it for having ""missed the call"" in its response to the coronavirus pandemic.

The US is the largest donor to the Geneva-based WHO.

Trump also criticised the organisation's relationship with China.

""American taxpayers provide between USD 400m and USD 500 million per year to the WHO; in contrast China contributes roughly USD 40 million a year, even less. As the organisation's leading sponsor, the United States has a duty to insist on full accountability,"" he said.

While announcing the new funding, Geng without referring to Trump's criticism, expressed China's full backing for the WHO and its Director General Dr General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, whom Trump has termed as pro-China.

""Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the WHO and its Chief Dr Tedros have been actively fulfilling their duties in upholding scientific, objective and an impartial stance. It played an important role in helping the relevant countries strengthen their pandemic response and promote international cooperation,"" Geng said.

""As the global fight against COVID-19 is at a crucial stage supporting the WHO is defending the ideals and principles of multilateralism and upholding the status and authority of the UN,"" he said.

Terming the virus the ""common enemy of all"", Geng said solidarity was the only weapon to defeat it.

""Our donation is made out of support and trust of Chinese government and people for the WHO,"" Geng said, adding that ""this is also our way of contributing to global public health and global efforts against the pandemic"".

Earlier while responding to Trump's announcement to freeze US' funding for the WHO, another Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian had said: ""China expresses serious concern over the US announcement to halt its funding to WHO"".

He said China will always support the Geneva-based WHO in playing an important role in international public health and global anti-epidemic response.

Asked if China will step-up funding to the WHO to replace the US contributions, Zhao had said, ""China has provided USD 20 million to the WHO (to fight COVID-19) and we will study the relevant matter"", indicating that Beijing was considering to increase its contribution to the global health body.

Both China and the WHO faced serious criticism over lack of transparency especially about the discovery of the coronavirus in December last year and its silent spread in Wuhan until Beijing imposed a lockdown in the city on January 23.

By that time, over five million people from Wuhan were reported to have left for holiday destinations at home and abroad to celebrate the Chinese New Year, which many allege resulted in the spreading of the deadly virus worldwide.

China has denied the allegations of any cover-up, saying it was the first country to report the COVID-19 to the WHO.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/covid-19--china-announces-additional-usd-30-million-grant-for-who-2020-04-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/covid-19--china-announces-additional-usd-30-million-grant-for-who.html

Addressing a daily press conference on the COVID-19 situation in the country, C K Mishra, the chairman of Empowered Group Two, said, ""One crucial weapon we employed during the 30-day lockdown period is RT-PCR test to ascertain if one has contracted the disease or not.""

As on March 23, nearly 15,000 tests were done across the country and by April 22 more than 5 lakh tests were conducted, which is about ""33 times in 30 days"", he said, adding, ""But we are conscious of the fact that this is not enough and we have to continuously ramp up testing in the country and we will do that.""

Apple grabbed 27 per cent share of the India hearables market, followed by an upstart brand Noise at 12 per cent and JBL at 8 per cent. Samsung with 7 per cent market share was fourth.

The India TWS market posted a massive 700 per cent growth in 2019 and the top three brands contributed almost half of the total shipments, according to Counterpoint Research.

""The launch of many affordable devices by players like Realme, Xiaomi and Noise immediately caught consumers' attention with their audio quality and ease of use,"" said Research Analyst Shilpi Jain.

As the India market remains largely untapped for TWS, the segment holds huge growth potential and opportunities for new players, she added.

Although it faced stiff competition, factors like reputation as a pioneer, noise-cancelling feature, easy integration with its devices and quick charging helped Apple maintain its leadership position in India.

Realme, one of the fastest-growing brands in India, launched its first TWS- Buds Air in December 2019 and immediately jumped to the fifth-largest brand within the initial month of launch.

Similar form-factor to Apple's AirPods, good-enough sound quality and features such as low-latency gaming mode, at an affordable price point, raised the overall value proposition, said the report.

""The increasing audio content consumption, portability, and advancements like health and fitness tracking, smart assistants are making TWS popular among smartphone users and driving the demand,"" informed Jain.

The launch of JBL C100TWS in December with an amazing introductory offer of Rs 4,000 discount - together with good bass reproduction, fast charging and one-click access to Siri and Google - made it popular.

For Samsung, brand popularity, stylish design and comfortable fit of its Galaxy Buds attracted consumers' attention.

The raid was carried out at Kandhavli's farmhouse in Uttar Pradesh's Shamli district, they said.

The cleric was booked along with seven others on a complaint at the city's Nizamuddin police station for holding the congregation in alleged violation of the orders against large gatherings to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Indian Penal Code section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) is among the sections they have been booked, and the complaint was lodged by the Nizamuddin Station House Officer.

Several people who attended the event in March and travelled across the country tested positive for the coronavirus, and the Nizamuddin area where the gathering was held was declared a COVID-19 hotspot.

Kandhavli, currently under home quarantine, in a statement onn Monday, urged the followers of the organisation to pray at home in the month of Ramzan.

""I request all, both in India and abroad, to strictly follow the guidelines and instructions of the local or national governments and till the time restrictions are in place and please observe prayers at home. And even in this, we should not invite people from outside,"" he said in the statement.

256,23-4-20,Stigmatisation discouraging people from coming for COVID-19 testing: AIIMS director,"Stigmatization of coronavirus patients is discouraging people from coming forward for testing at an early stage and a delay in treatment may lead to higher mortality, AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria said on Thursday, stressing that early diagnosis is the key to fight the deadly virus.

Stating that the primary treatment for COVID-19 is supportive treatment in more than 80 per cent of the patients and oxygen therapy in around 15 per cent of patients along with other drugs, Guleria said convalescent plasma therapy is being used at various centres across the country in the treatment of coronavirus patients.

""At various centres, we've started using convalescent plasma that is the blood of COVID-19 patients who have recovered. It is heartening to see that a large number of individuals who have become alright have come forward and volunteered to donate their blood which shows the commitment of our citizens when it comes to fighting the disease,"" he said at a press briefing on Thursday.

The doctor, however, said that COVID-19 is not a very deadly disease and 90-95 per cent of those infected can recover but a delay in treatment could lead to higher mortality among patients.

He described that patients are currently facing a lot of challenges and stigma which is not justified.

Majority of the patients who have recovered from COVID-19 are ""symbols of hope and victory"", he said, adding that stigmatizaton was creating huge problems and panic in the society and these individuals and their families are facing hardships.

""This is not justified and it is actually causing increasing morbidity and mortality,"" he said.

""Because of the stigma what is happening is that many patients who have COVID-19 or flu like symptoms are not coming forward to healthcare facilities. They are coming very late when they are really breathless and this is leading to higher mortalities,"" he said.

Guleria said many of these patients can be saved by just one treatment that is by giving oxygen.

When these individuals have pneumonia or viral infection and the oxygen in the blood becomes low it can lead to cardiac or neurological problems.

""Our strategy of having more oxygen beds is based on this,"" he said.

According to Dr Guleria, 80 per cent of the individuals will have mild illness, remaining 15 per cent can become alright just with supportive and oxygen therapy and less than five per cent will need ventilator or critical care.

""We need to reach out to those patients who are right now scared to come out because of panic and stigma that we attached to the disease and are not getting proper treatment,"" he said.

He appealed to everyone not to create an environment of fear and panic for such individuals who for an unfortunate reason got this infection.

""Consider the stress and strain that the entire family goes through. They are isolated for 14 days in a quarantine facility and are unable to meet family members for several days. Instead of sympathising for them we have created an environment of fear and panic which is not justified.

""We have to encourage people to come out for testing. If one is tested early, the treatment will start early and this will save lives,"" he said, adding the government has ramped up testing to a large extent.

As far as newer drugs are concerned, Guleria said hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin arealready been looked along with various other repurposed drugs which are available in country. Also, newer drugs are undergoing clinical international trials under the WHO.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/stigmatisation-discouraging-people-from-coming-for-covid-19-testing--aiims-director-2020-04-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/stigmatisation-discouraging-people-from-coming-for-covid-19-testing--aiims-director.html

258,23-4-20,"UK rolls out plans to ramp up coronavirus tests as death toll hits 18,738","The UK government on Thursday laid out a series of measures to be put in place to ramp up testing for the novel coronavirus as the daily COVID-19 hospital death toll spiked by 616 to hit a total of 18,738.

UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that though the daily rise in the toll was lower than previous days, it was important not to forget any one of the victims of the deadly virus and continue to strictly follow the social distancing norms in place to control its spread.

“They will not be forgotten. We must retain our resolve and follow social distancing rules – they are working. To lift the measures too soon and to risk a second peak will be a mistake and undo all the hard work that has been done,"" Hancock said during the daily Downing Street briefing on Thursday.

The minister, who has set a 100,000 coronavirus tests to be carried out daily by the end of this month, said that testing capacity has increased to 51,000 a day as he laid out a “test, track and trace” formula to be applied as the lockdown measures are gradually eased across the country.

""From tomorrow (Friday), any essential workers who need a test will be able to book an appointment on Gov.Uk themselves, directly. This also applies for people in essential workers' households too who need a test. It's all part of getting Britain back on her feet,” said Hancock.

Results of these tests will be sent out by text, with people who cannot go online able to apply for the free of cost tests through their employer. There will be more than 30 test sites across the UK, with home tests kits also being introduced as well as 48 mobile testing sites for the more vulnerable such as care homes with the help of the Armed Forces.

Hancock said the government is putting the infrastructure in place to be prepared to roll out contact tracing, or someone's exposure to the virus, on a large scale when it is time and a new National Health Service (NHS) contact tracing smartphone app is also being tested for that purpose.

""If you become unwell, you'll be able to tell the NHS with this app and then this will send an alert to other users,"" said Hancock.

Professor John Newton, Director of Health Improvement at Public Health England, joined the Cabinet minister to explain the kinds of tests that are being put in place.

He said there are mainly two types of test – the swab test to assess someone for the novel coronavirus and the treatment they might require if they are positive, and an antibody blood test, which determines if someone has already had the virus and may be immune to it.

Newton said the current focus is on the swab test to try and control the spread of the virus until a proven antibody test is found.

""Testing capacity has been increased exponentially,” said Newton, who is the UK's national coronavirus testing coordinator.

Meanwhile, Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's Chief Scientific Adviser, said at the briefing that it is clear that transmission rates are down and social distancing measures are having a ""very big"" effect.

""I would just urge as we enter the phase where the plateau has been reached, slight decrease we can see, we continue to make sure that we enrol patients in clinical trials so we get the answers to the critical questions about which medicines may work,"" he said.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/uk-rolls-out-plans-to-ramp-up-coronavirus-tests-as-death-toll-hits-18-738-2020-04-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/uk-rolls-out-plans-to-ramp-up-coronavirus-tests-as-death-toll-hits-18-738.html
