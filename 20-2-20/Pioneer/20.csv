0,20-2-20,Bending backwards,"Over-the-top preps for Trump visit invite criticism. Do the poor need to be swept under the carpet?

At one end, there is the propagandist accusation that we do not own our Indianness enough as a people or aren’t proud of it. On the other end, there is this relic of a colonial obsession, rather subservience, to please the White world. What else explains our bending backwards to roll out the red carpet for US President Donald Trump? To begin with, the Yamuna will be flowing as it should, clean and swirling, for the day that Trump is going to be here. The Uttar Pradesh Government will be releasing 500 cusecs of water to clear the river of contaminants and toxic waste, making what usually is a smelly canal look like a river. On other days, Delhiites only deserve the sewage drain avatar. The one-day wonder is supposed to make us feel proud of living in a waterfront city. Poor monkeys are being chased off the Taj Mahal stretch. And in Ahmedabad, where the POTUS will be landing first, masons are hastily finishing a half-a-kilometre wall along the stretch between the Ahmedabad airport and Gandhinagar to shut off our putrid slums from the eyeline of a speeding limousine. While authorities defend the social barrier as one prompted by security concerns, the real intention is not lost, ensuring pleasing visuals of Indian exotica and a swachch Bharat to one of the most important men on the planet. As if that would soften his stand on trade ties with India. Apparently eviction notices have been served to 45 families living in another slum near the biggest cricket stadium that Trump is gushing about. Following the mantra of Atithi Devo Bhava is one thing but disowning our truths is quite the other. Yes, India as an emergent economy with a massive population has its own warts, inequities and dualities to live with. But why deny our composite existence or be insensitive to the lesser privileged? For in the end by walling off our imperfections into ghettos, we end up reinforcing old stereotypes instead of changing them and perpetuate Western biases. By acknowledging the existence of the underlings, we give them dignity, prize their contribution to society and mainstream them as a reality that has to be dealt with, not hidden away. Of course, other than the very Indian affliction of undervaluing ourselves while putting our best foot forward, there is the other problem of sustaining the myth of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s development work in his own State as Chief Minister. And a gaping slum certainly wouldn’t be a glorious ode to his helmsmanship in that capacity for 12 years. So the Modi Government is going all out to strengthen its leadership credentials even if possibilities of a trade deal with the US look remote, particularly over the thorny issue of dairy exports.

The Modi Government has gone to the extent of pulling out all stops to reinforce a crafted image of the country and promote its leadership credentials before Trump. Contracts worth Rs 85 crore, from the construction of the stadium, which supposedly has the maximum seating capacity, to the beautification of cities, have gone out to various agencies. The depreciation has already begun with Trump tweeting dissatisfaction over the way India-US ties have shaped up over trade, a clear indication that war on that front will be hard-nosed no matter what the trimmings. Questions are also being raised about Gujarat being chosen simply because it is the Prime Minister’s home State. Others are wondering if it wasn’t better for the makeover funds to have been diverted to slum cluster improvements instead. Simply on qualifiers, there were other “better-looking” States. Gujarat was ranked 22nd among Indian States in the human development index for 2018. The Maternal Mortality Rate was 91 per 1,00,000 live births in 2016 as compared to 66 in Tamil Nadu and 88 in Telangana in the same year. According to crime data, the suicide rates there due to poverty increased by 162 per cent in 2018. Last year, the UK, too, rolled out the red carpet for Trump for a formal State visit, provoking protests from none other than the London mayor who said that such treatment shouldn’t be extended to someone whose “behaviour flies in the face of the ideals America was founded upon — equality, liberty and religious freedom.” He had even highlighted Trump’s endorsement of far-Right nationalism, picking on minority groups and the marginalised to manufacture an enemy. Perhaps, there’s a commonality of perception here that doesn’t make Trump look like so much of an oddity in the first place. One would have understood if the “good friend” vibes resulted in friendly deals. But other than “feel good” vibes, which have been around anyway because of improved diplomatic ties of the last couple of years, this gush seems a tad too obsequious.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bending-backwards-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/bending-backwards.html
1,20-2-20,Gross indignity,"When teachers and spiritual leaders endorse myths around menstruation, policies don’t mean anything

For a Government which is prioritising menstrual health and hygiene as part of policy, its loyalist followers are harming it by perpetuating medieval myths around a biological process. And it comes as a huge shock when educators of a modern society — women at that — subject others to the cruellest form of mental and emotional trauma over something as natural as menstruation as was done recently in a college in Gujarat. Sixty eight students at a hostel in Bhuj were made to strip before teachers to prove that they were not menstruating. What led to this outrage was the fact that the girls, who are undergraduate students at the Shree Sahajanand Girls Institute (SSGI), run by the Swaminarayan sect, were flouting a set of preposterous rules set by the college for them to follow during their periods. The discriminatory and utterly humiliating diktat bars students from entering the college temple, kitchen or touching other girls. In the classroom, they are expected to sit on the last bench and at meal time they have to sit away from others like pariahs and clean their own dishes. Not just this, the hostel keeps a register on when the students get their periods over a two-month cycle. Quite understandably not one girl had entered her name in it. Ironically, after the traumatised students raised a hue and cry over this nightmarish incident, the Principal squarely blamed the students for not following the rules and thus bringing the outrage upon themselves. What made matters worse was the statement by Krushnaswarup Dasji, a religious leader, that menstruating women, who cooked for their husbands, would be reborn as dogs and men consuming such food would be reborn as bullocks! This beats all evolutionary theory and entrenches the worst superstition.

Such words, coming from people who wield influence over the minds of others, particularly in rural India, are disturbing due to the sheer lack of sensitivity and violation of human rights, apart from the fact that they perpetuate illogical beliefs. Myths and taboos surrounding menstruation have to be broken down and a scientific temper has to be developed before Government schemes, incentives, health workers and social organisations succeed in their efforts to improve the lot of women. Over 60,000 cases of cervical cancer deaths are reported every year, mostly due to poor menstrual hygiene. A whopping 23 million girls drop out of school annually. This in a country that has a temple dedicated to fertility.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/gross-indignity-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/gross-indignity.html

3,20-2-20,NHRC seeks report on malnutrition deaths in Basti,"Taking suo motu cognisance of reports of a family in Basti losing four members due to malnutrition in the last six years, the National Human Rights Commission issued notice to the chief secretary of UP and sought a report and data on effective implementation of social welfare schemes in Basti, mentioning about the family.

After losing four members due to malnutrition in the last six years, Harishchandra of Ojhaganj village in Basti urged the authorities to allow him to end his life as he was not being hired for work by anyone for the last three months and had no income to provide for his lone daughter, who was also struggling.

The NHRC observed that the content of the news report was a serious issue of human rights violation due to lack of nutritional diet, adequate medical care and proper livelihood and expressed serious concern terming the deaths as tragic.

It also sought details on the health status of Harishchandra’s lone surviving child and steps taken by the state to ensure income for him.

The district administration was also asked to furnish details of relief provided to the family. The response is expected within four weeks.

The NHRC further observed that media report indicated that there could be more such hapless families due to the lack of infrastructure and negligence by authorities.

The NHRC expressed concern that such incidents were happening despite numerous flagship programmes being announced and implemented by the Union and UP governments to ensure socio-economic protection to citizens, including their right to food, health, education, housing and adequate standard of living.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/nhrc-seeks-report-on-malnutrition-deaths-in-basti.html
4,20-2-20,BSP walkout over admission of OBCs in medical courses,"Bahujan Samaj Party members staged a noisy walkout from the Uttar Pradesh Assembly on Wednesday over lapses in admission of students in state medical colleges under Other Backward Classes reservation.

Even as Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna said that the government was admitting the students under the reservation system in a transparent manner, the BSP members led by its leader Lalji Verma walked out of the House during the Question Hour, alleging that the government adopted a partial attitude towards backwards classes.

The issue was raised by BSP member Sushma Verma through a question. She wanted to know the number of students who were admitted to the state medical colleges under OBC reservation.

The BSP members alleged that the government was not giving the due share to OBCs and was curtailing the number of seats reserved for them.

The minister said that the state run medical colleges had provision of reservation for the students but in private medical colleges there was no such system.

Khanna said that in 2017-18, the number of students admitted under OBC quota for the MBBS course was 403 and it was the same in 2018-19. But in 2019-20, the number rose to 537 after the number of seats were increased in the state.

Similarly, he said, in post-graduate courses of MD/MS, the number of students admitted under OBC quota was 112 in 2017-18, 111 in 2018-19 and 124 in 2019-20.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bsp-walkout-over-admission-of-obcs-in-medical-courses.html
5,20-2-20,BJP MLA among seven booked for raping woman,"After waiting for more than a week, Bhadohi police on Wednesday finally registered a case against local BJP legislator Ravindra Nath Tripathi and six others for raping a woman repeatedly for a month in 2017.

The 40-year-old victim, a widow, had lodged a complaint on February 10 but a case was only registered on Wednesday.

“The woman alleged that she was first raped by Tripathi’s nephew Sandeep Tiwari, who was also named in the FIR, in 2017. The woman said that she did not lodge a complaint back then as Tiwari had promised to marry her,” Bhadohi’s Superintendent of Police Ram Badan Singh said.

“She alleged that in the run-up to 2017 UP Assembly polls, she was kept at a hotel for a month by Tiwari. All the seven accused would visit the hotel and repeatedly rape her. She also claimed that she got pregnant and was forced to undergo abortion,” the officer said.

“A probe in this regard was handed over to ASP Ravindra Verma and on the basis of his report, an FIR was registered against the seven accused at City police station,” the SP said.

Singh said that the victim’s statement would be recorded before a magistrate and further action would be initiated as per law.

Earlier, BJP MLA from Bangarmau, Kuldeep Sengar, and even former BJP Union minister, Swami Chinmayanand were accused of sexual assault.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-mla-among-seven-booked-for-raping-woman.html
6,20-2-20,CM dismisses oppn charge on quota,"Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath dismissed the charge of opposition parties that quota for Scheduled Castes and Other Backward Classes were not being implemented by the state government in recruitment.

Yogi asserted that the BJP represented every section of society and was committed to protecting the interests of SCs and OBCs and ensuring their uplift in all spheres of life.

“Opposition parties are not willing for a logical debate based on facts and figures. In the last three years, as many as 2.5 lakh persons have been recruited in various government departments and rules of reservations for SCs, STs and OBCs have been implemented. The government has ensured that each social group get its due share. We have also implemented 10 per cent quota for economically weaker sections from upper caste,” the chief minister said.

Yogi said that on January 26, the government released funds for payment of scholarships to 56 lakh students, of which 28 lakh were from the OBCs. He said that during SP and BSP regimes, SC and OBC students were the worst sufferers as the SP government denied benefit to SC students and the BSP regime did the same against the OBCs.

“It will be very embarrassing for the SP and BSP (if it comes to light) as to what was done during their regimes so I do not want to reveal all details, so do not compel us. For us, national interest is above party interests and political power is a means and not an end in itself. The BJP represents each and every section of society,” he said.

Yogi further said, “Every political party had an opportunity to form government in UP. What did they do when they were in power. We are ready for a logical debate on all issues and it should be dignified and within framework of parliamentary decorum and tradition where there is no scope for name calling.”

Earlier, Speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit rejected an adjournment notice on the issue of reservation for SCs and OBCs, moved by Samajwadi Party and supported by the BSP and Congress.

Opposing the notice, Parliamentary Affairs minister Suresh Kumar Khanna said, “Opposition is in the habit of raising issue of reservation in every session of the House and creating disturbance.”

Khanna charged that the opposition as part of its malicious design, wanted to malign the BJP government that it was against reservation.

Not satisfied with the government’s reply, members of opposition parties staged a walkout from the House.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-dismisses-oppn-charge-on-quota.html
7,20-2-20,Sustainability is your business,"Sustained activity, both in words and actions, backed by strong leadership is the need of the hour to achieve the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050

Climate change is a grim reality faced not just by mankind but everyone who inhabits the Earth. The rising global temperatures are affecting seasons, so winters have become shorter and spring is early to arrive. These shifting seasons impact many life cycle events which in turn have a major impact on agriculture and global food production. What is challenging is that the changes are happening too fast and many species may not be able to adapt to these unprecedented fluctuations. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has reported a global warming of 1.5 °C, which is enough to put 20-30 per cent of species at the risk of extinction. Sadly, many of us are not even aware of it, let alone work towards mitigating them. And this goes for individuals, societies and businesses. Of the three, businesses all around the world are the biggest contributors to global warming since they are responsible for at least 70 per cent of all carbon emissions. So, on humanitarian grounds, there should be an extreme urgency by businesses to slow down and reverse climate change. Sustained activity, both in words and actions, backed by strong leadership is the need of the hour to achieve the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. This can only be done by being a part of the solution rather than a part of the problem. And this is how some companies are doing it:

Investments in renewable energy sources: Several big firms are investing in renewable energy sources to reduce their greenhouse gas targets. McDonald’s is leading the way with the large-scale purchase of virtual power that will support wind and solar energy. This renewable energy generation can be equated to taking 140,000 cars off the road for one year. In the furniture industry, IKEA has invested $2 billion into renewable energy projects and is planning to build 416 wind turbines. It has already installed around 750,000 solar panels on its stores. One of the most powerful corporations in the world and Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc, has also been named as one of the most eco-friendly firms. All offices and company buildings, including Google headquarters in Silicon Valley, are powered by 100 per cent renewable energy, which removes an estimated five million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year. By purchasing a 1.6-gigawatt renewable energy package, Google has made its clean energy portfolio large enough to power a country of the size of Uruguay. Similarly, Microsoft boosted its renewable energy portfolio to more than 1,900 MW, which is enough to power 1.5 million homes. Swiss fragrance and flavour manufacturer Firmenich is one of the most sustainable companies in the world, operating on 78 per cent renewable energy and working with other CEOs and politicians to help limit global warming to above pre-industrial levels. Apart from Firmenich, L’Oréal was the only other firm to receive an ‘A’ (the highest score) across all three areas of the CDP’s (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) rankings — climate change, deforestation and water security. It is committed to zero deforestation by this year-end and has revamped more than one-fifth of its entire product range to reduce dependence on petrochemicals and encourages the use of plant-based, renewable resources. Johnson & Johnson has taken several steps to ensure that all packaging is recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025. Its operations are currently powered by 31 per cent renewable energy and it plans to increase this to 100 per cent by 2050.

Collaborating for saving the environment: Earth cannot be saved without proper collaboration among different actors in society. One of the major efforts towards this is found in the collaboration between Walmart, several environmental groups and over 1,000 suppliers, known as project Gigaton, to overhaul the company’s supply chain worldwide by reducing greenhouse gas pollution by about a billion tonnes by 2030. Nearly 94 million metric tonnes of emissions have already been reduced since its launch. Another global corporate leader and a champion for environmental sustainability is Unilever that is collaborating with farmers worldwide to reduce harm to the environment. It is aiming to procure its agricultural materials from sustainable sources by the end of this year and eliminating single-use plastic packaging in the UK by 2025. It also plans to become carbon positive by 2030 by reducing or totally eliminating the use of fossil fuels and generating more renewable energy than it consumes. Several food companies have also collaborated with sustainable management consultants to assess the deforestation risk developed due to their operations and take steps to create a sustainable food system. Nestle, the largest food company on Earth, uses satellite technology to ensure that no deforestation is taking place in its supply chain. It has also committed to using 100 per cent responsibly-sourced palm oil by 2020. It has been severely criticised in the past for using palm oil that led to deforestation. Danone, a company producing yogurts, water and plant-based food and drinks, is working in collaboration with farmers to reduce soil degradation and water usage, in the process reducing the company’s carbon footprint by 25 per cent.

Say “no” to plastics: In India, the Philippines and Indonesia, Unilever has found itself under pressure over plastic packaging. Earlier this year, the company was named by the “Break Free From Plastic” campaign as one of the firms most responsible for plastic pollution in these countries. On its part, to help the environment, IKEA plans to ban single-use plastic products from its shops and restaurants by 2020. The company wants to purchase 100 per cent renewable energy by 2020 and use only renewable and recycled materials in its products by the same year. It plans to make its deliveries emission-free by 2025.

Innovation to save the environment: As it is rightly said, “Necessity is the mother of all invention.” Stopping and reversing climate change is the necessity to save our planet now. However, organisations lack awareness on specific technologies that can help them reduce emissions and boost sustainability. Several entrepreneurs globally are trying to bridge this gap and start-ups are being funded to help companies solve sustainability challenges and make progress toward the 2025 climate goals. Danish shipping company Maersk is using biofuels to help it achieve a carbon-neutral status by 2050. It pilot-tested biofuel made from cooking oil to run its cargo ship from Rotterdam to Shanghai and in the process reduce an estimated 1.5 million kg of carbon emissions. Tesla, the electric-car maker, has a holistic environment protection policy where they make sure that the suppliers work without harming the environment, responsibly manage all waste and efficiently use water and energy resources. Microsoft, on the other hand, is using new age technology like artificial intelligence for several sustainability initiatives, forecasting wildfires and risks related to them, minimising the environmental costs of farming, planting trees and protecting endangered species. The Nike Air range of trainers uses at least 50 per cent recycled materials and diverts more than 95 per cent of waste from landfills. Plus the company is soon to release a range of trainers coloured with plant-based dyes, which reduces pollution of waterways.

Accepting climate change at the policy level: Voluntary efforts are good but not enough to tackle the real threat of climate change. Businesses should be open to developing climate policies and governments should support companies in implementing the same. This trend had started now with CEOs of several companies like Dow Chemical, BASF and Lafarge Holcim stressing on bringing about new regulations that check and penalise higher carbon emissions and incentivise lower carbon footprints.

This brings us to the question whether trying to protect the planet is also economically viable? Data suggests so. Companies in 35 countries, including the US, have experienced growth in the last 15 years while reducing their emissions.

According to the New Climate Economy report, the decision to reduce emissions will be good for the job market as it will create 65 million new low carbon emission jobs while generating enterprise value worth $26 trillion till 2030. By reducing emissions, companies will witness two-pronged benefits — a higher economic value and a boost to reputation value, from the point of view of the entire stakeholder group, including employees, investors, suppliers and customers. It is a win-win for all.

8,20-2-20,Right to liberty reaffirmed,"The apex court in a recent decision said that anticipatory bail once granted cannot have an expiry date until specified by the court

The Supreme Court in its recent decision in the Sushila Aggarwal and Others vs. State (NCT of Delhi) case declared that anticipatory bail once granted to an accused under Section 438 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) cannot have an expiry date until explicitly specified by the court. This verdict is indeed a cornerstone in reaffirming the right to life and liberty of citizens as guaranteed by our Constitution. Authored by Justice MR Shah and Justice SR Bhat, this verdict has resolved the controversies created mainly by two judgments viz., Salauddin Abdulsamad Shaikh and Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre, with both of them taking completely opposite views. Salauddin narrowed the scope and jurisdiction of the courts under Section 438 by mandating imposition of strict conditions while granting anticipatory bail. However, Mhetre ruled that grant of bail for a limited period or with any such conditions is contrary to the legislative intention and settled tenets of criminal law. These seemingly incongruent strands of reasoning, stemming from the two distinct lines of precedents and spawning divergent approaches to the scope of jurisdiction under Section 438, impelled a reference to the larger Bench. Before going into the nuances of this verdict, we must understand the meaning and definition of anticipatory bail and its governing parameters. The CrPC, 1973 does not define anticipatory bail and rather provides only the mechanism for availing it through Section 438. However, the apex court defined anticipatory bail as “bail in anticipation of arrest” in the case of Balchand Jain for the very first time. Further, it was also laid down that the power to grant anticipatory bail rests only with the Sessions Court and the High Court. Here, it is interesting to note that the old code of criminal procedure, 1898 did not contain any provision for anticipatory bail and it was adopted only after the recommendations from the 41st Report of the Law Commission of India. Now coming back to the recent judgment in Sushila, the Constitution Bench decided upon a bunch of controversies, cleared some major confusions and passed some landmark orders, which are as follows:

Reiterated the law laid down by the Constitution Bench in Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia and others vs State of Punjab (Sibbia case): There is nothing in the CrPC to indicate that the grant of pre-arrest/anticipatory bail should be time-bound. However, the court concerned has the discretion to impose conditions for the grant of anticipatory bail, including a limited duration of protection, on a case-to-case basis, depending on the stage at which the application for anticipatory bail is moved. As a rule, there should be no time-limit imposed in granting pre-arrest protection. The duration of an anticipatory bail order does not normally end when the accused is summoned by the court. However, it is up to the court to impose additional restrictions if there are peculiar circumstances warranting the same.

The life of anticipatory bail does not end when the accused is summoned by court: The court found that ordinarily, the protection given through anticipatory bail would not automatically come to an end if the person is summoned as an accused in the case by a court. However, if there are special or peculiar circumstances necessitating the same, the court has the power to limit the tenure of anticipatory bail.

Time-limits may be imposed by courts but not as a rule: All the same, the court further noted as per the Sibbia case, the competent court still retains the discretion to impose time-limits or other conditions, on a case-to-case basis, if required. However, it added that such limits should not be ordinarily imposed. The Supreme Court, therefore, has answered the first issue in the following terms, “The protection granted to a person under Section 438 of the CrPC should not invariably be limited to a fixed period; it should inure in favour of the accused without any restriction on time. Normal conditions under Section 437(3) read with Section 438(2) should be imposed; if there are specific facts or features in regard to any offence, it is open for the court to impose any condition...”

Guidelines on grant of anticipatory bail: Before parting with the matter, the Bench also issued some more guidelines on the grant of anticipatory bail. It ruled that the anticipatory bail applications should be based on concrete facts, not vague or general allegations, relatable to a specific offence. It is advisable that the court, depending on the seriousness of the threat of arrest, issue notice to the public prosecutor to obtain facts. Nothing in the CrPC compels or obliges a court to impose conditions limiting the grant of anticipatory bail. The need to impose restrictions during grant of anticipatory bail would have to be judged on a case-to-case basis. Such special or other restrictive conditions may be imposed if the case or cases warrant but should not be imposed in a routine manner, in all cases. The gravity of the offence and the applicant’s role should guide the court in deciding whether or not to grant anticipatory bail in its discretion. Anticipatory bail granted can (depending on the conduct of the accused) continue after filing of the chargesheet till end of trial.

9,20-2-20,The huge human cost of stress in mining sector,"A survey observed a strong connection between unemployment due to mining closure and mental distress across States. Workers exposed to the negative labour demand shock are facing very low chances of re-entering the job market

Recently, we celebrated 71 years of India’s existence as a Republic and thus it would be pertinent to remember Article 21 of the Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights without which a republic would mean nothing. The fundamental right to life as enshrined in Article 21 includes the right to work. It is time for civil society to start talking collectively about livelihood which is recognised as a human right in many communities.

We need to get a more inclusive understanding of what we mean by livelihoods: Life engagement with land, water, forest, right to food, income, food security and the like. So, the first step in building up a narrative is building up a common understanding of what we mean by right to livelihoods.

As we know, livelihood encompasses issues of productive resources and access to resources and involves concerns in labour and goods markets. Work conditions in all sectors are central to the discourse and in particular recognition of work, generating employment, job security and wages.

The mining sector in India has witnessed largescale loss of livelihoods in recent times. On one hand India is aiming for a $5 trillion economy and on the other we are now finding it difficult to compete with emerging economies like Vietnam and Egypt. It is imperative to focus significantly on the mining sector with concerted efforts to regain its three per cent share and more in the GDP by 2024-25. The sector’s GDP share in 2018-19 was 2.6 per cent, down from three per cent in 2011-12. Ever since the Supreme Court cancelled 88 mining leases in Goa on February 7, 2018, life has come to a grinding halt for more than 3,00,000 mining dependents. The State, once the richest economy in India, is now sluggish and the complete closure of mining activities has devastated families and brought about unimaginable misery in the lives of people. In neighbouring Karnataka, too, the ban on ore exports, e-auctions and quota systems in ore production have led to a floundering economy, severely denting the State’s development and growth.

The recently-published sourcebook of FIDR, Mining: A Prudent Perspective, is based on a survey of 2,415 people from five major States whose economies are mainly mining- driven, namely Goa, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha and Karnataka. It would not be an exaggeration to say that this is the first-ever such report about the people’s perception and attitudes toward the mining industry. The study has clearly brought out the impact of the uncertainties due to the ban on mining in these States. The social set-up and the families of miners are in the doldrums due to joblessness and deprivation of livelihoods.

In Goa, the closure of mining has resulted in a State-wide economic crisis of sorts. Karnataka has witnessed similar economic plight in the wake of the curbs. The FIDR survey indicates that in the five States, mining contributes to over 12 per cent (on an average) of the State’s GDP. In Goa, stoppage of iron ore mining has impacted revenues worth Rs 34 billion and the livelihood of several dependent segments as it has left stakeholders without an alternate source of income. This repeated stoppage of mining in Goa, Odisha and Karnataka has also led to loss of investor confidence which would have a long-term impact on their economies.

Almost all the respondents (over 90 per cent) agree that the mining sector has brought significant economic benefits for their communities and generated fiscal revenue, export earnings, relieved constraints to investment, spurred economic growth and created jobs. It has also contributed to infrastructure building. However, they also opine that realising and enhancing these benefits require action, primarily from the Government, but also from mining companies, local communities, employers and businesses in the country. Fiscal revenues from the extractive industry — taxes, royalties and other payments — are the major reasons why governments seek to promote its growth in their States. However, revenues from mining and benefits from them do not flow in automatically. To translate fiscal revenues from the extractive industry into sustainable development benefits, governments need to design and institute fiscal regimes that ensure a fair share of benefits to the States/country, which are also attractive for investors.

About half of the respondents believe strongly that mining drives economic growth through its linkages with the rest of the economy, such as by buying goods and services from suppliers (backward linkages) and by supplying minerals (forward linkages). Barring about 13 per cent, a majority (about eight of 10 stakeholders) describe mining as beneficial as long as the industry works to mitigate its impacts or it is properly regulated. The findings from the survey suggest that the more the participants felt that mining created economic, employment and community benefits, the greater was their acceptance of it. This sounds obvious but should be viewed in relation to the unshakeable faith these communities repose in nature, the ecology and the environment. Like in Odisha, all the mines are located in the remote, low-income, tribal-inhabited geographies. The forest dwellers have deep faith in nature, the flora and fauna which they revere. Hence social licence to operate in these areas would directly relate to how community perceptions of mining associated impacts and benefits relate to its endorsement.

It is clear, that the closure of mines has spiked vulnerability of the community. The survey observed a strong connection between unemployment due to mining closure and mental distress across States. Workers exposed to the negative labour demand shock are facing very low chances of re-entering employment. Either they lack the required skill set appropriate for other industries and line of work or there are no available employment opportunities. This is leading to long unemployment spells resulting in spiralling of large-scale mental health problems. One in every five persons is suffering from depression and other forms of mental issues.

The survey also discovered that the psychological cost of parental unemployment has been higher on children, leading to general despondency, while teenagers are starting to feel pressured to take on more responsibility in the family. Many have become more aware of the social stigma associated with having jobless parents. It is imperative that the judiciary, legislature and the executive take cognisance of the grim livelihoods scenario threatening all of us. Necessary remedial measures need to be taken at the earliest to help these States, particularly Goa, tide over a catastrophe of inconceivable ramifications — social, economic and intergenerational.

10,20-2-20,New dawn for the military,"With the apex court ruling in favour of equality for women, the armed forces will have more candidates to choose from. In defensive engagements, they could well be superior to men

Women soldiers would be a serious problem if and when they happen to be taken prisoner. But as commanding officers, they would seldom be in the first line of infantry fighting. Nor are cavalry officers acutely vulnerable. This question of prisoner of war possibly confused the entire issue of command qualities. The question of strength and stamina has fortunately been resolved as infantry weapons have become light and fire-efficient. There is no comparison between the .303 and today’s assault rifles. Even this writer found the former heavy to lift and carry for long.

For the rest, the issue of women as jawans or officers was highly relevant, dominated by the bias of tradition and mindset. Until firearms came into existence, prospects for women were indeed not that bright as the “sword” or the “lance” was heavy and needed strong arms. Women were also weaker due to the quality of diet and the number of childbirths. Mumtaz Mahal, queen of Shah Jahan, who was possibly the wealthiest man in the world of his time, bore 14 children, of whom only seven survived. Imagine the waste of female stamina and strength; how could they be soldiers? She, who cannot be a soldier, cannot be an officer and in turn a commander. To add to this was the patriarchy that refused to see women as anything else, except as householders and mothers.

The invention of the musket in the 16th century sprouted the first ray of hope for the woman as a soldier. The gender of an individual pressing the trigger makes no difference to the target. Early models, however, were very heavy and were often operated by two soldiers resting the weapon on a portable table. This innovation by itself limited chances for women. As the weapon became better and lighter, the lesser was the muscle required. The better and stronger the vehicle, the lesser was the stamina needed. The lesser the child-bearing, the stronger the woman remained. We have arrived so far through four to five centuries.

There has been a new dawn for the military. The armed forces have many more potential candidates to choose from now. Women can make equally good fighting stock whether on land, air or sea. In fact, in defensive engagements, they could well be superior to men. For instance, a tigress or any female animal protects her young, quite ferociously. Arguably, the male may not be so determined while defending even his own house. When a woman defends her homeland, this writer believes, she would be equally committed to saving her progeny. A brave man would defend his country with equal zeal but when he finds his situation hopeless, he is likely to retreat or even surrender. A woman is less likely to give up on protecting her own people, like her own children. An order like “victory or death” is less difficult for a woman to obey than for a man. Apparently, the braver the commander, the more courageous should be the battalion.

The recent doubt, which the Supreme Court had to clear about whether women officers would make equally effective commanders, is unusual. The male ego fattened since the beginning of time, which, it is widely believed, could find it difficult to obey a woman in public. In private, it is different and even a stronger, wiser person has been listened to readily. Shorn of such mindsets, the issue is one of leadership. In the 1960s, who could have believed that former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi would have made a leader superior to say, Morarji Desai? This question is one of leadership and neither of statesmanship, nor prime ministership.

Indira Gandhi retained the leadership of her party, the Congress, until her death. True, she had the advantage of being former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s daughter, which gave her an enviable start. After that, she had to rely on her own wit and resources in order to survive and succeed.

The problem hitherto is that women do not get the exposure and opportunity to be able to perform on the right platform and at the right level; at least in most fields. Kanshi Ram, the founder of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), gave a start to Mayawati and she came up to be the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee has risen exclusively on her own initiative; she has demonstrated eloquently the qualities needed to make nine crore people of West Bengal to follow.

For some time, maybe some years, women commanders would have to develop superior qualities such as military knowledge, bold initiatives and quick decision-making. Leaders must be superior to their followers. Once that is demonstrated, there should be no difficulty. There is a phenomenon generally not remembered and at times not known. This writer can communicate it through his experience during physical training in college. The Elphinstone College in Mumbai had no ground and, hence, its physical training (PT) classes were occasionally held at the neighbouring Oval maidan. The entire class of 110 students would together move to this ground. There were less than 25 boys, the rest were girls. The latter were given light exercises, which could be done while wearing sarees (this is what most girls wore 65 years ago). However, boys had to sprint, do sit-ups, push-ups et al. This writer was neither strong nor practised and by himself, could do no more than 15 to 17 sit-ups and push-ups. At the Oval, however, in the presence of girls, he could go up to 50 of them. The only explanation for this was gender pride. How could he let his pride down? If this gender pride could percolate to the armed forces, we can expect extraordinary performance from our sailors, soldiers and airmen in an inclusive atmosphere.

When we move from the commander to the level of a senior general, the situation would change. The progress from tactics to strategy is a big leap. The former is adequate for a skirmish or a limited battle. Anything bigger or more on-going would call for greater military imagination to be able to visualise what is neither visible nor obvious. And women make for good strategists. A well thought-out strategy must ensure that the war plan is not upset even if the future brings forth enemy action that is surprisingly different. World War II German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel is probably the most famous General. But when compared with Field Marshal Erich von Manstein, Rommel is considered an exceptional tactician. Whereas Manstein, by his defence and in-depth strategy, delayed the Russian Army from reaching Germany by a whole year. The Manstein brilliance lay in retreating faster than the Russians could move, then wait on the sidelines until the Reds had arrived, only to be surrounded and taken prisoners in thousands.

France has six borders beginning with the North Sea in the west, then Belgium, then the German border, which was defended by a chain of fortresses called the Maginot line. The Ardennes forest was considered impassable as it would have led to Germany, then Switzerland and finally Italy. Berlin was in search of a point of utter surprise attack. Manstein suggested the presumably impassable Ardennes forest. France had left it undefended; his idea was accepted. It took only 40 days to compel France to surrender. That was gem of a strategy. An integration of genders would mean that many evolved minds are at play.

15,20-2-20,Punjab Assembly to be tumultuous,"After power made an electrifying effect during the Delhi elections, issues related to it are expected to make the nine-day Punjab Vidhan Sabha budget session tumultuous, starting from Thursday.

The budget session, with six actual working days, is all set to witness fiery discussion on the wide range of issues with power and state finances set to dominate. Both Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) have been demanding to extend the budget session to at least 25 and 15 days, respectively.

All charged up after party’s landslide victory in the recently-concluded Delhi polls, the principal opposition party —AAP — is all geared up to take on the ruling Congress on the issue of costly power and its failure to fulfill its promises, including cancelling the power purchase agreements (PPAs) with the private thermal plants.

Not wanting to be left behind, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has also chalked out its strategy to take on the Congress Government by raising the issue of power hike and power scams besides need to provide justice to victims of Behbal Kalan police firing case, coupled with the illegal mining and liquor smuggling.

On the other hand, the Congress Government may table the white paper on the state’s power scenario, which the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had announced to present before the House in the monsoon session to prove that the current situation is due to the prevous SAD-BJP regime that signed the PPAs.

High power rates, coupled with the PPAs, has put the State Government in dock with not only the opposition parties, but the Congress leaders too pointing fingers at their own government in the state.

Presently, the power is costing Rs 8.36 per unit in Punjab. Right from Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar, Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa and several other party leaders have openly demanded annulling the PPAs.

Already, Capt Amarinder had declared that the State Government would renegotiate power purchase agreements with private players. While warning the private firms against “messing with state finances”, the Chief Minister blamed the previous SAD-BJP government for the agreements, saying that these were signed by them to “defraud” the state and its people.

Ahead the session, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder, who is also the leader of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP), has convened the CLP meeting to devise the floor strategy on Thursday.

The session would commence with obituary references, followed by non-official business during which the discussion on challenges and opportunities in the promotion of Punjabi language will be held.

The state’s Tourism and Cultural Affairs Minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Wednesday announced that the State Government is “going to frame a law to ban songs and movies that promote drugs and weapons. The songs, which will promote the culture of Punjab, will be encouraged”.

Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal will present his fourth budget in the Congress Government on February 25, which is expected to aim at fulfilling the Congress’ pre-poll promises announcing some of the social security benefits.

SAD SEEKS 15-DAY SESSION

Demanding 15-day session to discuss burning issues like power hike and power scams besides need to provide justice to victims of Behbal Kalan police firing case, the SAD on Wednesday met Vidhan Sabha Speaker Rana KP Singh stating that the Congress should not run away from the debate and the opposition should be given appropriate time to take up people’s issues. Though a nine days session, there are only six working days.

After submitting a memorandum to the Speaker, SAD’s legislative wing leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon and former minister Bikram Singh Majithia said that the party had appealed to the Speaker to extend the forthcoming budget session to 15 days as presently, only one day had been kept to discuss the Governor’s Address.

“Congress Government should fulfill its promise to supply power to the people as well as industry at Rs five per unit. It should also hold an independent inquiry into Rs 4300 crore scam and action against the then Power Minister for indulging in corruption besides explaining why the Punjab Pollution Control Board had worked overtime to save private thermal plants from action for not installing anti-pollution devices,” they added.

Giving details of the memorandum, the SAD leaders said they had also demanded threadbare discussion into the pressure being put on witnesses of the Behbal Kalan police firing case to rescind from their statements.

Dhillon and Majithia accused the Chief Minster of uttering white lie by claiming that 11 lakh youth had been given jobs, while also questioning about the unemployment allowance of Rs 2,500 per month.

DEMANDING 25-DAY SESSION, AAP TO MOVE THREE PRIVATE BILLS

AAP, submitting the memorandum to the Speaker Rana KP Singh to extend the session for at least 25 days, on Thursday also proposed to move three private member bills — including ‘The Punjab State Liquor Corporation Bill-2019’ to rein in liquor mafia, ‘The Punjab Termination of Power Purchase Agreements with 3 IPPs Act, 2020’ to cancel the power agreements with power players, and ‘The Punjab unseating of members of Legislative Found Guilty of Conflict of Interest Bill 2020’ — during the budget session.

AAP delegation, comprising MLAs Aman Arora, Manjit Singh Bilaspur, Kulwant Singh Pandori, among others, stated that they raised three key issues with the Speaker, seeking his permission to introduce the three private member bills in the state’s interest during the budget session.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-assembly-to-be-tumultuous.html

18,20-2-20,Capt Amrinder meets Pargat Singh,"Hit by Congress MLA Pargat Singh’s letter bomb citing “Government’s failures”, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday held a detailed discussion with the sportsperson-turned-politician who made it clear that the party had to perform else it would perish in the State.

The former Indian hockey team captain, Pargat Singh maintained that he had healthy discussion with the Chief Minister during which he asked him to break free from the “perception” that the top Congress leadership has joined hands with the Badals.

“I have told him that people have high expectation from you and they voted for Congress in Capt Amarinder’s name as they have your image that of Capt Amarinder of 1984 when he resigned as MP in protest against Operation Bluestar, of 2005 when you cancelled all water agreements. I told him that he lead the state on a positive path by resolving cases like PPSC scam…so people have expectation from you and we must come up to that,” said the Olympian after the meeting.

In a word of caution to the Chief Minister, Pargat Singh said that if Congress failed to perform, the Hitler policy, that is being seen across the country presently, is ready to come to Punjab also which would ruin the State, and we have to save it from that.

“Being a sportsman, I have to always feel that we should do what we can, and if we cannot do something which we can do, it is our weakness. So we have to deal with it…No one can stop us from fulfilling our promises,” he said while stressing that the Government should save every single penny for the State.

He noted that major cases of corruption were collapsing and raised concern over sand and liquor mafia. He also mentioned the Bargari sacrilege case.

He also advised the Punjab Government to take steps to plug revenue leakages that started during the previous Badal regime, besides laying emphasis on the need for fresh round of thinking on corporation for sand and liquor.

19,20-2-20,‘95% of saplings planted in 2019 have survived’,"The Uttar Pradesh government announced in the Assembly on Wednesday that 95 per cent of the 22 crore saplings planted in one day last year, creating a record, have survived and arrangements have been made to ensure their proper growth.

Amused at the revelation, Bahujan Samaj Party member Vinay Shankar Tiwari, who had put forward the query during the Question Hour, reparteed that when 95 per cent of wheat does not survive, what to talk about trees.

On August 9, 2019, UP made its entry into the Guinness Book of World Record by planting 22 crore saplings in one day. This year, the target of plantation has been fixed at 25 crore.

Replying to a couple of questions in the House, Forest Minister Dara Singh Chauhan said the government had provided Rs 100 crore for the upkeep of these saplings while a third party checking was being done to get the real picture.

Alleging that the government was making incorrect statement, opposition members claimed that over 50 per cent of the saplings had withered and died.

But Singh refuted this by saying that the government had ensured full protection of the saplings.

In reply to another question of Mohammed Aslam Rainee (BSP), the forest minister said that around 3.83 crore saplings were planted during 2015-16 while around 5.08 crore saplings were planted in 2016-17. “Of these, around 75 per cent saplings survived,” he said.

20,20-2-20,CM slams oppn patronage to anti-CAA protesters,"Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday slammed the opposition parties for extending political patronage to anti-CAA protesters and sympathising with anti-national forces as conspiracy of funding of the protesters by Popular Front of India was unearthed by security agencies.

He was replying to the motion of thanks to the Governor’s address in the Assembly.

“Why have the opposition parties such sympathy with anti-CAA protests which are being carried out under the national tricolour and the Constitution. It’s a case of terror funding and threat to national security which has support of the organisations of Congress and Samajwadi Party,” Yogi charged.

Questioning the rationale for anti-CAA protests, the chief minister said that the protesters should at least spell out one objection against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

“The BJP did not make this law, it has been in existence since 1955, legislated after the Nehru-Liaquat pact was inked,” he charged.

Without naming SP chief Akhilesh Yadav for sending his teenage daughter to the anti-CAA protest site in Lucknow, Yogi said, “A criminal never aspires for his progeny to follow in his footsteps, but political leaders are encouraging their children to take part in anti-CAA protests. They will have to decide whether they want to realise the dreams of Gandhi or Jinnah.”

The chief minister also targeted those who have been protesting against the CAA across the state over the past weeks.

“Azaadi (freedom) slogans are being raised. What is azaadi? Do we have to work towards Jinnah’s dream or work towards Gandhi’s dream? The police should be praised for their work,” he said.

“I am not against protesters but would come down heavily against those indulging in violence. Anyone hiding behind democracy to vitiate the atmosphere will be taken to task. Those who try to undermine the law would be replied in their language,” he added.

Referring to Dr BR Ambedkar and Jogendra Nath Mandal (Dalit leader of Bengal who migrated to Pakistan and became law minister there), Yogi said, “Dr Ambedkar is the most celebrated national icon with maximum number of memorials built to cherish his memory. On the other hand, Jogendra Nath Mandal fled from Pakistan to India and lived the rest of his life in oblivion as he was a traitor.”

The chief minister added, “The opposition parties will have to decide whether they intend to follow the legacy of Dr Ambedkar or Jogendra Nath Mandal.”

Defending the UP Police for their action against anti-CAA protesters on December 19 and 20, Yogi said, “Those who ordered police firing on innocent karsewaks at Ayodhya in 1990 and made desperate efforts for releasing the accused in terror acts like serial blasts in district courts of Lucknow, Varanasi and Ayodhya and blast at Sankat Mochan temple in Varanasi are questioning the BJP government for its handling of anti CAA protests.”

Continuing his diatribe against SP patron Mulayam Singh Yadav, the chief minister, without taking names, said, “Those who defend rape convicts saying ‘boys are boys and sometime commit mistake’ are sermonising us on law and order and handling of anti-CAA protests.”

“Not one communal riot occurred after the anti-CAA protests in December and January in UP and Aligarh district administration conducted multi-layered dialogue with Aligarh Muslim University students and administration to prevent the situation from worsening and kept the situation under control.”

Yogi asserted that the police could not be mute spectators as public property was being destroyed and innocent people were being targeted by riotous mob.

The chief minister M said, “No one died from police bullets. All those who died have died of bullets from rioters. If someone goes to the street with the intent to shoot people, then either he dies or a cop dies.”.

Leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary later told reporters that the chief minister’s statement showed the government’s utter disregard for civil liberties.

“This attitude is amply reflected in the behaviour of UP Police. The chief minister’s statement that no deaths had taken place due to police firing was in contradiction to Bijnor district police chief’s acceptance that one person was killed in police firing during the protests,” Chaudhary said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-slams-oppn-patronage-to-anti-caa-protesters.html

For, the Chandigarh Administration has directed the Municipal Corporation of Chandigarh to replace the heritage manhole covers with concrete ones at the earliest and retrieve the heritage ones for preservation.

The city is stated to have around 2,224 cast iron manhole covers bearing an impression of Chandigarh map, which were designed by Franco-Swiss architect Le Corbusier in 1950s.

A survey conducted by UT Administration and the civic body in 2017 had revealed that the number of heritage drain covers in the city is nearly 2224. Such manhole covers were found in the premises of government schools, police stations, Secretariat buildings and other government buildings.

The highest number of 78 manhole covers was found in Sector 20 here while 77 heritage manhole covers were found in Sector 8 and 76 in Sector 35.

In the past, the higher authorities, while preparing heritage inventory in 2011 had stated that the number of heritage manhole covers across the city is nearly 2500.

Notably, Paris based auction house Artcurial had auctioned a city’s manhole cover for 17,851 Euros (Rs 10.87 lakh) in 2010 while in 2007, another manhole cover bearing the master plan of Chandigarh designed by Corbusier had fetched a whopping USD 21,000 (Rs 830,000) at a Christie’s auction in New York.

In the past few years, there has been a spate of theft of heritage manhole covers with one reportedly stolen from Sector 22, only few months back.

UT Adviser Manoj Parida said that the UT Administration has already directed the MCC to replace those heritage manhole covers, which are at the risk of theft due to location. These would be replaced with concrete ones, he said.

The civic body had recently also passed the proposal of replacing all the heritage manholes in the city.

Parida said while some of the heritage manholes would be displayed at the upcoming museum in Government Printing Press, Sector 18 here, others would be kept in store.

Apart from manholes, heritage chairs and other furniture will also be kept inside the museum, he added.

Following the auction of heritage manhole covers, the replica cum miniature model of the heritage models was launched at the souvenir shops depicting Le Corbusier’s innovative work in Chandigarh. The miniature model available in four sizes including 4 inch, 6 inch, 8 inch and 10-12 inch at the souvenir shops is quite famous among visitors.

Ajay Jagga, a city based lawyer and member of Heritage Protection Cell, said there is a need to protect the heritage manholes across the city.

In the cases of theft of such manholes, no FIRs were registered for investigation and the heritage items are still being smuggled and supplied from Chandigarh to foreign auction houses, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/heritage-manholes-of-chandigarh-to-be-displayed.html

He said for several days, the farmers were agitating for paddy procurement at minimum support price but no one heard their voice. They were continuing with their agitation in democratic mode.

Kaushik said the indifferent state government by cane charging wants to instill a sense of terror among the farmers but they will continue to stand against the government raising their demand.

Backing the farmers’ lawful demands, the BJP leader said across the state, justice will be sought and voice will continued to be raised. He added that had the demands of agitating farmers at Keshkal resolved on time, such a situation could have been avoided. State government sat over the issue as the agitations spread to other areas like Bijapur, Dantewada, Jagdalpur, Kondagaon and Keshkal. Now, February 20 being the last day of procurement, there would be extra-rush and centres do not have required requisite of gunny bags. This will lead to procurement of paddy lesser than the set target.

Kaushik demanded compensation for those injured in incident and extending free health services to them. All the demands of agitating farmers should also be fulfilled. He alleged that the situation is from Konta to Kota and from Mainpur to Mainpat, is volatile.

“Radios have always fascinated me. As my parents used to say I fell in love with radio when I was only four year old. My father was in air force and when he was posted in Burma, he brought a Japan made radio and I fell in love with it. I still vividly remember that people used to gather at house to listen radio,” recalled Mahto. Over the years, he started collecting radios and has preserved them with care.

A slight turn towards the right side of his room gives you a glimpse of an extraordinary collection of vintage radios starting from a Philips model of 1957 to transistors.

Through his journey of collecting radios right from childhood, he kept his passion alive during his professional life too. “People have different hobbies, but from childhood, radios have been my first love. Initially, I used to collect radios from my friends. They used to give it for repair, but with the TV hitting the market, many gave their sets to me,” he says. He made new friends, who extended their support in his endeavour of collecting vintage radios.

This strange passion for vintage radios led him to collect models of various brands though he is modest about his range. “ Old radios are like a treasure for me. Though I do not have all the vintage models and am focusing on collecting as many as possible,” he said.

Most of his collections are drawn from well-known brands such as Philips, Sanyo, Sony, Phillips, Siemens, Kaide, Elta besides a working model of a radiogram, which combines a radio with a record player. An advocate by profession he also runs a driving school.

Mahto, heads the Guide International Radio Listening Club (GIRLC) that he started with four other radio passionate in 1974. GIRLC still has about a 100 members today and regularly meets to discuss about radio programmes.

His life revolves around radio and various programmes that go on air every day. He starts listening to the radio from 5 am every day that continues till late night.

He is keen about programmes in Bengali, Hindi, English and Urdu that are aired from across the globe.

He added listening to the ear-friendly radio kindled creativity in listeners to visualise things as they emerged, unlike the television sets that just made one sit glued to the screen.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/tune-into-the-past-with-retro-radio-collector.html

56,20-2-20,‘Parichay’ screened at Bharat Bhavan with elan,"One of the classic films of seventies “Parichay” was screened at Bharat Bhavan. The film was screened on Wednesday as a part of the 38th Foundation Day anniversary.

Parichay is a 1972 Indian film directed by Gulzar. The film features Pran, Jeetendra, Asrani and Jaya Bacchan in the lead roles. Sanjeev Kumar and Vinod Khanna were seen in special appearance. It is based on a Bengali novel, Rangeen Uttarain by Raj Kumar Maitra.

The film is about misunderstandings between a grandfather and his five grandchildren and how Ravi (Jeetendra), tutor to the grandchildren succeeds in reforming them and marrying Rama (Jaya Bhaduri), eldest of them.

Ravi, being an unemployed young man immediately agrees to tutor the grandchildren of Rai Saheb (Pran), a job arranged by his uncle. His aunt tells him about how the children have made every previous tutor run away. The children led by the eldest, Rama, try to tease Ravi by using their standard tactics. To their surprise, Ravi not only takes them lightly, but also supports them in front of their great aunt, Sati Devi.

They gradually get closer and Ravi even takes them out regularly to play. Ravi and Rama grow close to each other. Ravi finds out the reason of misunderstanding between Rai Sahab and his grandchildren. Ravi somehow manages to sort out the problem.

60,20-2-20,Good bureaucrats motivate masses by own acts,"A study shows the All India Services (AIS) examinations are the toughest to crack. In 2016, 11,36,000 candidates appeared at the civil services examinations. Only 1,209 examinees could fit into the jobs. The IAS cadre never exceeds 180 posts ever.

The most elite Indian Civil Service (ICS) was instituted by the British masters, then called the Imperial Civil Service, which remained in force between 1858 and 1947. These top bureaucrats administered and oversaw 250 districts that comprised the British India. The ICS was headed by the Secretary of State for India, a member of the British Cabinet. Legendary VP Menon, who drafted the ‘Instrument of Accession', was the Secretary of State during Partition under Home Minister Sardar Patel. He had risen to the lofty position from an ordinary clerk. Those days, talent mattered the most. One could rise to highest positions of authority from the lowest rung in Government job cadres.

At the beginning, almost all the top thousand ICS members were British who had been educated in the best British schools. The All India Services were designated as Central Superior Services in 1924. After 1939, the number of Indians in the service increased because of non-availability of Europeans. By 1905, five per cent were from Bengal. By 1947, there were 322 Indians and 688 British members. After Independence, the ICS became the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) in 1950.

Over the years, particularly after the British left India, IAS officers turned rather arrogant due mainly to the illiteracy of politicians and their sharp knowledge of basic things. Most politicians, until recently, depended heavily on the skills and knowledge of the IAS officers. Even the other civil services, officers including the IPS and Allied cadres are literally controlled by the IAS community. The system is such as to make it irreversible today, and for good reasons. This situation turned some IAS officers very arrogant and insensitive to public sentiments. Absolute authority made some of them absolutely indifferent to public problems. But as time rolled by, literate people entered mainstream electoral politics; and the arrogant bureaucrats began mellowing down in their conduct. It is also true that politicians assumed enormous powers and started calling all last shots. Without much fear, the majority of them engaged in amassing ill-gotten wealth, mostly bribe. They forced fallible bureaucrats to connive with them to make benefits. So, unethical bureaucrats fell in line and guided the rogues so as never to get into trouble with law. This culture remained live for long.

Eventually God became kinder in good time; and now, Indians have a good number of compassionate and highly motivated IAS and other civil service officers who are making waves across the country. India is heading for better times than ever before. At least one in twenty IAS officers is making a huge difference in public service. He is unfailingly putting his foot down when political crooks happen to persuade him or her to abuse public office for private gain.

Some of these young officers are now models for the entire nation, especially youths:

A devoted pair of civil servants in Kolkata decided to get married in office to keep the wedding event ideally simple. IAS officer Tushar Singla and his partner IPS officer Navjot Simmi signed their marriage certificate at Singla’s office recently. This great thing happened at a time when public officials including Ministers splurge millions in feasting and show of glitter. Singla is a 2015-batch West Bengal-cadre officer currently SDO at Uluberia, and Simi, a 2017-batch Bihar-cadre IPS officer posted as DSP in Patna. The couple has promised friends a good dinner after the West Bengal elections are over.

When most people with money and authority shudder at the very idea of sending their children to Government schools considered poor in standards, in Chhattisgarh, Balrampur Collector Awanish Sharan got his daughter admitted into a Government school. While Sharan feels it was not at all newsworthy, he has in a way set a trend and attracted great attention from the media and other well-meaning bureaucrats. He is known for his commendable job in uplifting the education system in Balrampur district in last two years of his posting. Inspired by his act, a Parliamentarian, Shivshankar Paikra, has got his son admitted in a Government school in Jashpur district of Chhattisgarh.

A very dynamic lady IAS officer, R Lalitha, put her daughter in a Chennai Corporation primary school. Lalitha, Deputy Commissioner (Revenue and Finance), Greater Chennai Corporation, is proud that her daughter is enjoying her time at the school as she herself did at a Government school during her student days. Lalitha says the facilities in the corporation schools are absolutely at par with private schools in terms of joyful learning and other group activities. Lalitha’s husband E Sumanth, an aviation specialist, has wholeheartedly supported her initiative. Lalitha has made many people willing to send their kids to State-run schools to avoid blood-sucking private institutions.

A young Andhra Pradesh IAS officer, L Shiva Shankar, Project Officer of ITDA, sent his son to the local Anganwadi Centre at Seetampeta, a tribal hamlet. The toddler, he says, is enjoying his time at the humble school learning Telugu and English alphabets and rhymes while mingling freely with his classmates. He drops the boy on his bike at the centre. The teachers have been sincerely requested by him not to pamper the kid or give any special treatment. Shankar’s wife is also an IAS officer. The parents even celebrated Sohan’s birthday at the Anganwadi Centre rendering the entire region inspired. They believe the child should grow as an ordinary student so as to pick life skills faster.

Similarly, when Government-run healthcare facilities are perceived to be substandard, dirty and not fit to deliver quality service, an Odisha-cadre bureaucrat put his wife in a Government hospital when he could have got her admitted into a swanky corporate healthcare facility without difficulty. Malkangiri district Collector Manish Agarwal’s wife Sonam delivered a boy at the District Headquarters Hospital on July 4 in 2019. Doctors performed a caesarean section on her. Most senior officers go away to nearby Visakhapatnam for even having a sneeze problem fixed. Malkangiri is a remote Maoist-infested, tribal district. Manish, despite all the apparent odds, opted for the Government hospital only because he wanted to send out a strong message. He dispelled the common belief that Government things are all bad, unacceptable. Health facilities, especially SNCU, at the Malkangiri DHH are way better compared with the neighbouring districts. Manish, as the principal district administrator, has ensured that ordinary people get extraordinary service at Government facilities.

Times are changing. Corrupt bureaucrats are reforming themselves; and more significantly, highly sensitive young people are entering the top service. Besides, amazing technological developments have made everything so transparent! No one can do much by hiding. Erring crooks are visible anyway.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/good-bureaucrats-motivate-masses-by-own-acts.html

62,20-2-20,State focuses on structural transformation: Fin Secy,"State Finance Secretary Ashok K Meena during a discussion on the Odisha Budget 2020 said that the State aims at bringing out structural transformation and the 5T was a substantive step in that direction.

Meena said the State had introduced strategic budgeting to bring clarity in the resource allocation to each department. “Under the strategic budgeting each department will now have an idea regarding the possible ceiling in the allocation to the department in the coming year. Therefore, each department may undertake proper planning within the budget limit, instead of the Finance Department pruning down the demand for grants submitted by the departments,” he told.

He said the focus in the Budget has been health, mining and tourism sectors. The Government wants to upgrade the SCB Medical College Hospital to AIIMS plus status. Similarly, additional 2,000 posts of doctors, 6,000 posts of nurses and 2000 posts of other paramedics during the year 2019-20 have been created, the Finance Secretary informed.

Meena further told the debt of the State was well within limit of the target given by the Union Finance Commission. The State wants to keep the debt stock within 20 per cent of GSDP and needs to borrow to catch up with the national level of per capita income, he told.

Many of the panelists raised concern over the health sector allocation in the State which was low. In order to effectively implement the Biju Swasthya Kalayan Yojana (BSKY), the State needs to substantially increase the budgetary allocation, they opined.

Concerns were raised on relying on mining industry, which was causing huge environmental damage, to finance the budget. Revenue from mining industry involves notable uncertainty. This may pose problems before the Government in financing the budget, said the experts. However, the Finance Secretary allayed the fear and said that the State had accumulated huge amount of money in its sinking fund that could be used in the difficult times.

It was also discussed that Odisha had a very good pupil-to-teacher ratio. However, the quality of education remained very low. The pupil-teacher ratio of Odisha is much better than neighboring States and even neighboring countries of India, they said.

While the seminar was organised by the Department of A and A Economics, Utkal University and the Orissa Economics Association, eminent experts in the field who joined included Orissa Economics Association secretary Dr Amarendra Das, Prof Srijit Mishra, Prof Satyakam Mishra, Dr Satyapriya Rath, Prof Kishore Chandra Samal, Sourendra Kumar Sahu, Dr Chitta Ranjan Nayak, Dr Sarot Kumar Rout, Dr Shiba Shankar Mohanty, Rajesh Mohapatra, Prof Bhabesh Sen among others.

66,20-2-20,Unauthorised leave: ‘No work no pay’ for college teachers,"The Higher Education Department has introduced a ‘No work no pay’ principle for teachers and other staffs of Government and Aided colleges following reports of their unauthorised absence on multiple occasions.

The department has made it clear that the teaching and nonteaching employees can avail leave only after getting approval of the principals.

In a letter to the principals of the colleges, the department has mentioned, “It is seen during the visit of colleges that a number of teaching and nonteaching employees remain on leave without prior approval of the principals or without prior intimation to the principals. In this connection, it is hereby clarified that as per relevant Service Rule/Leave Rule, leave is not a matter of right. An employee can take leave only if the leave sanctioning authority permits him to take leave.”

The department further clarified that leave without the permission of the principal would be treated as unauthorised absence resulting in deduction of remuneration for the period of absence.

The principals have been directed not to sanction leave to the teachers and other staffs for participating in agitations. Participation in such agitation activities would be treated as unauthorised absence.

“Leave shall not be granted for participating in any agitation activity such as rally, dharna, demonstration, etc. If any employee participates in any such activity by remaining absent from duty, that should be treated as unauthorised absence from duty with ‘No work no pay’ principle. Participation in any agitation activity shall be viewed adversely which may lead to premature retirement in case of Government employees and withdrawal of Government Grant-in-Aid in case of employees of Aided colleges receiving Government GIA,” the letter said.

“Principals have to ensure that no employee of their respective college participates in any form of agitation. If any principal sanctions leave in favour of an employee thus helping him to participate in any agitation activity, the principal shall be held responsible for aiding and abetting such activity,” the letter

84,20-2-20,BJP president to meet Parkash Badal,"The saffron party, it seems, is not willing to let go the Akalis. Amidst demand within the party cadre to claim greater seat-share in Punjab besides resurfacing of differences between the two age old alliances in a run up to the Delhi Assembly polls, the Bharatiya Janta Party’s (BJP) national president JP Nadda is all set to hold meeting with the Akali veteran Parkash Singh Badal at his residence on Thursday.

Besides meeting the former Chief Minister in his first meeting to the State as the BJP chief, Nadda is also scheduled to hold meetings with the party leader and workers of Muktsar, Bathinda, Ferozepur, Fazilka and Faridkot, which are primarily the Akali dominated areas. The intention behind the entire process is being seen as an attempt by the BJP to narrow the gulf between the two parties, while it is also being seen as the party; attempt o widen its base in the State with an eye on 2022 State Assembly elections.

Nadda’s meeting with Punjab’s five-time Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal will be held at his native village Badal in Muktsar Sahib district. It is believed that the meeting will reduce the prevailing rift between the two collation partners. Notably, Punjab BJP leaders has been demanding to increase the party share in the seat allocation with several senior leaders stressing that the BJP should take over the role of “big brother” in the alliance which the Akali Dal has been playing since long.

On the other hand, the BJP wanted to gain support for the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) — a decision which has been under attack across the country. Only recently, the senior Badal had talked about including Muslims in the CAA while describing the country’s current environment as worrying. He had advised the BJP to carry the allied parties along.

Before that, the SAD had decided against contesting the Delhi Assembly polls in protest after the “BJP asked it to change its stand on the CAA”. After voting in favour of CAA in the Parliament, the SAD has been demanding to include the Muslims also.

Ahead Delhi polls, Nadda himself came forward to bridge the rift between the two parties. And it is believed that this meeting is also an attempt to appease the Akali Dal, as the BJP, at this point of time, could not afford to lose any support.

“This is just a courtesy call. Badal is senior leader, the eldest in the NDA. As the head, he is coming to seek his blessings,” said a senior BJP leader, downplaying the party chief’s visit.

As per the schedule, Nadda will arrive at Bathinda Airport on Thursday morning. From there, he will go to Amritsar by road and pay his obeisance at Golden Temple, Durgiana Mandir, and Ram Tirath.

Only a day before, Punjab BJP chief Ashwani Sharma reached out to the Akali patriarch at his Badal village residence, and reportedly discussed the political scenario.

At the same time, Nadda will also held meeting with the party leaders and workers of Muktsar, Bathinda rural and urban, Ferozepur, Fazilka and Faridkot areas. Interestingly, out of the six constituencies where Nadda would be meeting with the workers, the BJP has no seats as per the coalition seat sharing arrangement.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-president-to-meet-parkash-badal.html

Danish Zehen, the owner of a shop at International Market on Mahatma Gandhi Road in Ranchi, on Wednesday said that the outbreak of the deadly virus in China and its impact on the economy there has directly affected the business in Ranchi. “The price of Chinese smart phones has increased. Even accessories like mobile covers have become dearer by 10 to 20 per cent,” he said, adding that screen guards and micro SD cards have also become dearer.

Novel Coronavirus, which was declared a global public health emergency by the World Health Organisation (WHO) last month, has already claimed more than 2000 lives worldwide. While the virus has run the alarm bells for the health machinery across the globe, it has had a devastating impact on the second largest economy of the world, say reports. A special briefing issued by global data analytics firm Dun & Bradstreet has predicted that the virus outbreak is likely to have an impact on more than 5 million businesses across the world. Most of the companies crippled by the virus in China have units in the US, it added.

Shops in International Market — the go-to-place for tech-savvy smart phone enthusiasts for latest gadgets at an affordable price — have also started charging more for repairing phones and other electronic gadgets lately. This increase in the repairing cost, they said, is primarily due to the rise in the price of accessories and spare parts.

Besides electronic gadgets, the virus has also led to a fall in the supply of Chinese pichkari, which are quite popular among young children during Holi. The special pichkaris that come in different shapes and sizes are yet not being displayed at shops despite Holi being only 20 days away.

Coronavirus has also led to an increase of 40 per cent in the price of common drugs like paracetamol, which is used to treat flu and fever. The prices of many other analgesics have also increased across India, say medicine shop owners here.

Wuhan city in China is the epicenter of the Novel Coronavirus — a mysterious new virus that has killed more than 2,000 people across the world and infected at least 1.5 lakh. The virus has infected people in the USA, UK, Thailand, India and many other parts of the world. India has reported only three cases of the deadly virus so far, all from Kerala — a State that has declared Novel Coronavirus as a state emergency. No cases of Coronavirus have been detected in Jharkhand so far.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/coronavirus-impact--smart-phone-accessories-get-dearer.html

91,20-2-20,‘Odisha Govt not utilising Central schemes properly’,"The current Union Budget would be favourable for the country’s farmers. Especially in a State like Odisha, this Budget would be more beneficial for Dalits, tribals and OBCs, said BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav here on Wednesday.

Madhav said Odisha Government does not submit new proposals for Central schemes while it failed to utlise the funds sanctioned by the Central Government. In many cases, the State Government has only utilised four to six percent of the grants sanctioned by the Centre for various projects.

“We have given a boost to the infrastructure projects in the Union Budget this time. But, the Odisha Government should wake up from its slumber and take advantage of the initiatives,” he added.

The experience with the Odisha Government has not been pleasant. Instead of levelling false allegations of being ignored by the Central Government, it must make proper utilisation of the sanctioned funds. The Centre is ready to extend full cooperation to the State,” said Madhav.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---odisha-govt-not-utilising-central-schemes-properly---.html
92,20-2-20,Police raid Dhullu Mahto’s residence in Dhanbad,"Baghmara MLA Dhullu Mahto managed to escape from his residence in Dhanbad on Wednesday morning minutes before a police team raided his Chitahi-based bungalow to arrest the legislator. Mahto, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA, is accused of land grabbing and an arrest warrant was issued against him on Wednesday itself, police said.

“We could not arrest him (Mahto) today, but we have nabbed four of his aides. Three of them were accused in the land-grabbing case,” said Dhanbad Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Kishore Kaushal. The three accused in case are Ajay Gorai, Dimpi Mandal and Bittu Singh, he added.

Sources said that Mahto’s supporters on Wednesday tried to stop policemen from performing their duty and also raised a ruckus over the raid. Several local women carrying brooms in their hands blocked the way of the cops and created hurdles in the process of the raid. Mahto is a two-time legislator, and he managed to retain his Baghmara seat despite an anti-incumbency wave in Jharkhand during the 2019 Assembly polls.

Mahto’s political career has been riddled with controversies so far. While the arrest warrant on Wednesday was issued against him in connection with a land-grabbing case, the legislator is also an accused in cases of molestation and extortion, police said. “We will issue arrest warrants in all cases, in which he is an accused and arrest him at the earliest,” said the SSP.

Mahto’s wife, Savitri Devi told local reporters that Mahto was keeping unwell and he left home on Tuesday night for medical assistance. She also accused the police of ill-treating the legislator and misbehaving with him during the course of investigation earlier.

Dhanbad police on Sunday lodged a First Information Report (FIR) against Mahto in connection with an extortion case of June 2018. Earlier in November 2018, a member of the BJP women’s wing had accused Mahto of molestation. She even alleged that the MLA had tried to rape her. And, when she had resisted and didn’t give in to his sexual advance, she had been threatened, she said. Following which the woman had gone to Katras Police station to lodge an FIR against Mahto. However, the police did not act on her complaint.

Later, she lodged an online FIR. However, no action was taken on the online complaint, following which she moved to Jharkhand High Court, which on August 28, 2019, ordered Jharkhand police to lodge an FIR against Mahto.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/police-raid-dhullu-mahto---s-residence-in-dhanbad.html

In 2009, the then President Pratibha Devisingh Patil gave assent to the Central Universities Act, 2009 that envisages establishing and incorporating universities for teaching and research in the various states.

The Minister further informed that Government has simplified payment of installments to beneficiaries through mobile apps and to put boxes at block offices for receiving fresh proposals from people to get houses.

He said beneficiaries who had received an installment under the Indira Awas Yojan but failed to construct house would be re-allotted a house under the PMAY or BPGY if he returns the IAY installment money and applies for a fresh house.

The Government is giving priority on providing land and house to the landless, he said.

He said the State Government is putting the name of Biju Pucca Ghar Yojana on PMAY houses because it bears 40 per cent of the cost. If incentives are added, the State share would be 44 per cent, he said.

While BJP members had earlier alleged that figures of construed houses are not true, the Minister said, “The Centre has already awarded Odisha for securing first position in construction of highest number of houses.”

Earlier BJP Chief Whip Mohan Charan Majhi demanded that the Government provide a detailed list of houses constructed under different rural housing schemes. Mukesh Mahaling and Bhaskar Madhei had alleged that there has been irregularities in allotment of houses. Leader of Opposition Pradipta Kumar Nayak demanded that the Government soon exclude ineligible beneficiaries.

A division bench comprising justices Manojit Bhuyan and PJ Saikia dismissed Jabeda Begum’s plea as the documents submitted by her could not establish her linkage to her projected father or brother.

Begum submitted 14 documents, including her PAN card and ration card, two bank passbooks, the NRC details of her father Jabed Ali, voter lists where the names of her grandparents, parents and her along with her husband were published and several land revenue receipts.

The Foreigners Tribunal in Baksa district had earlier issued a notice to her on the basis of a reference made by the Superintendent of Police (Border) to prove her Indian citizenship.

She appeared before the tribunal and filed her written statement along with the 14 documents, claiming to be a citizen of India by birth.

The tribunal held that village headmen are not entitled to issue certificates supporting the citizenship of a person and also rejected the bank documents as these adequately do not prove to be her’s.

The tribunal held that the petitioner failed to file documents linking herself with her projected parents.

She appealed against the tribunal’s ruling in the high court, which observed that it has carefully gone through the direction of the tribunal and found that she could not file any documents to link herself with her projected parents.

The high court had already held in another case in 2016 that PAN card and bank documents are not proofs of citizenship, the division bench observed.

Certificates issued by a ‘Gaon Bura’ or village headman also cannot be the proof of citizenship as such a certificate can only be used by a married woman to prove that after her marriage she had shifted to her matrimonial village, the court ruled.

The court observed that the tribunal has correctly appreciated the evidence placed before it and there was no perversity in the decision of the tribunal.

The judges ruled that the petitioner has failed to prove her linkage with her projected father and her projected brother and as such this writ petition is devoid of merit and disposed of accordingly.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pan-card--land---bank-documents-no-proof-of-citizenship--gauhati-hc.html

146,20-2-20,"CAA, media freedom under scrutiny at Difficult Dialogues","From Citizenship Amendment Act to freedom of speech, from Uniform civil code to judicial accountability, a wide range of constitutional and legal issues, which have rocked the country for sometime, were debated by India’s best known legal experts, academicians and civil right activists at a three-day conference at International Centre , Goa between February 14 and 16. International legal experts also shared their insights and experiences so that the benefits of global best practices could be dovetailed into the proceedings.

The conference-the fifth edition of Difficult Dialogues-came out with series of recommendations for improving the State of the law in the country. The policy recommendations would be published in the form of actionable white papers that could make a difference.

The highlight of the engagements was a panel discussion on Free speech, censorship, and the media attended by Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan. Supreme Court advocate Geeta Luthra and two retired judges.

The panelists agreed that dissent was a key element of any democracy and diversity of opinion has to be respected. The Governor, who seemed to reluctantly endorse this view, insisted that right to dissent didn’t mean any one has the right to impose his views on others.

Later, in an interaction with the media persons when the Governor was asked for his reaction on tendency to brand traitors those dissenting against the Government’s policy, the Governor referred to a report by a Pakistani NGO that more than 1000 Hindu women were kidnapped and forcibly converted in that country. “ When such things happened across the border, these are bound to find an echo in India, too,” he said.

When asked what it has to do with the right of the citizen’s dissent against the Government , the governor virtually lost his cool and said most of those out on the streets are following “ fatwas’ issued by their masters.

While CAA remained a topic of discussion, both formally and informally, at the conference, the panelists also went at length into others issues such as: After the Aadhar judgment: Do individuals have right to privacy in India? Accountability vs independence of Judiciary: Is the balance right? Reforms in the administration of justice: What can help? Discrimination law and minorities: Is justice done? Making environmental laws effective: How to achieve sustainability?

Commenting at the conclusion of the three day summit, Surina Narula, Founder & CEO of Difficult Dialogues said, “In the fifth edition of Difficult Dialogues this year, we were able to discuss the State of Law in the country, identify the various issues and problems that exist, and come up with action points that could help in the speedy and equitable dispensation of justice to all. As an outcome of the Difficult Dialogues 2020, we will be documenting all the recommendations that were tabled in the form of actionable white papers for the benefit of all.”

This year the Knowledge Partners for Difficult Dialogues include the Centre for Socio-Legal Studies, University of Oxford, (CSLS, Oxford), Bar Association of India (BAI), O P Jindal Global University, Centre for the Study of Law and Governance, Jawaharlal Nehru University (CSLG, JNU), the Goa University (GU), and the International Centre Goa (ICG).

147,20-2-20,Border guards prepare action plan to reduce threat along frontiers,"Following the visit of Union Home Minister Amit Shah to the headquarters of various paramilitary forces, the border guarding forces are working on a proposal to conduct vulnerability mapping of the respective borders under their area of responsibility and prepare an action plan to reduce threat along the frontiers in the next five years.

As an outcome of Shah’s visit, vital installations in the border areas are proposed to be brought under the coverage of anti-drone technology.

The proposal for revamping the border security will also incorporate quality and number of manpower, technical requirements and budgetary provisions needed to securing the frontiers and reducing vulnerabilities.

The Ministry has also invited suggestions for recruiting 50 per cent of the personnel in the border guarding forces from the States along the borders.

The border guarding forces have also been advised to identify groups of young officers who will cover the frontiers on motor bikes and identify loopholes in the security paraphernalia along the frontiers.

The plan to strengthen the borders also includes a proposal to train jawans in the languages spoken by people across the borders. A training scheme is proposed to train the jawans in such languages.

The forces have also been asked to identify vacant land in the bordering areas to settle former paramilitary forces’ personnel to check migration of population from such areas. The forces have also been asked to seek suggestions from the jawans to check migration of population from bordering areas.

Officials said there is also a proposal to formulate a mechanism for reporting by the border guarding forces with their respective headquarters for holding institutional meeting by the forces with the district/state administration in the border areas.

The border guarding forces have been asked to tie up with the Border Security Force (BSF) to install Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS) on a trial basis along the frontiers with Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar.

Two pilot projects covering about 71 km on India-Pakistan Border (10 km) and India-Bangladesh Border (61 km) of CIBMS last year. The next phases of CIBMS seek to cover about 1,955 km of the border which cannot be physically fenced. The CIBMS project will vastly improve the capability of BSF in detecting and controlling the cross border crimes like illegal infiltration, smuggling of contraband goods, human trafficking BESIDES and cross border terrorism smart fencing comprising an array of technological gadgets.

While the BSF guards the Indo-Pakistan and Indo-Bangladesh borders, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) secures the frontier along China.

148,20-2-20,"Indian industry, students welcome it","Indian industry and students' groups in the UK have widely welcomed the new points-based visa system unveiled by Home Secretary Priti Patel on Wednesday to attract the “brightest and the best” from around the globe. The new post-Brexit policy is pitched as a “firm and fair” mechanism that will treat all migrants equally as the free movement of people from within the European Union (EU) comes to an end from January 1 next year.

The magic number of points required to apply under the new system will be 70, accrued in increments of 20 or 10 based on professional skills, English language proficiency, a job offer from an approved sponsor and salary levels between 20,480 pounds and 25,600 pounds or above.

Some of the categories will fall under tradable points, such as salary levels and jobs that fall within the shortage occupation list, giving applicants some options to make up a total of 70.

“We welcome the Home Office's proposed new system, which rightly recognises that immigration to the UK should be based on skills, salaries and knowledge of the English language,” said Jim Bligh, Chair of the Confederation of Indian Industry's (CII) UK-India Business Forum (IBF).

“For business, it's essential that the system retains flexibility for employers, particularly those bringing in highly-skilled workers on short-term assignments to support UK plc's growth and transformation. It will also be important to ensure salary thresholds are not a deterrent to finding staff with the right specialist skills from around the world,” he said.

The tradable aspect of the salary threshold is likely to prove beneficial for Indian professionals, who already make up the largest chunk of skilled worker visas issued by the UK to nationals outside the EU.

Baroness Usha Prashar, Chairperson of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), UK, said the changes meet a long-standing business demand. She said, “Majority of the Indian businesses in the UK require skilled manpower. The new point-based immigration system coupled with the lower salary threshold is a positive move. This has been a long-standing demand of FICCI members.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/indian-industry--students-welcome-it.html

“This particular decision of the Cabinet seeks a central database in the country through which details of all clinics and banks, including the nature, kind of services provided, outcome of the services provided will be obtained on a regular basis,” she said. “The data generated from the national registry will also be used for research purposes in this particular segment of health,” she added.

According to an official statement, the national board lays down code of conduct to be observed by persons working at clinics, to set the minimum standards of physical infrastructure, laboratory and diagnostic equipment and expert manpower to be employed by clinics and banks. The States and Union Territories will constitute the State boards and State authorities within three months of the notification by the Centre. The State board shall have the responsibility to follow the policies and plans laid by the national board for clinics and banks in the State, the statement said.

152,20-2-20,"Climate change, harmful products impacting children: Report","Ecological degradation, climate change and exploitative marketing practices that push heavily processed fast food, sugary drinks, alcohol and tobacco are fast taking a toll on the health and future of the children with no country taking adequate protecting measures.

Painting a gloomy picture on the status of the future of the children, the report, “ A Future for the World’s Children?” , released on Wednesday by a Commission of over 40 child and adolescent health experts from around the world notes with concern that every child worldwide now faces existential threats from climate change and commercial pressures.

The experts have called for a new global movement driven by and for the children.

While the poorest countries need to do more to support their children’s ability to live healthy lives, excessive carbon emissions — disproportionately from wealthier countries — threaten the future of all children, said the Commission convened by the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and The Lancet.

“Despite improvements in child and adolescent health over the past 20 years, progress has stalled, and is set to reverse,” said former Prime Minister of New Zealand and Co-Chair of the Commission, Helen Clark. “It has been estimated that around 250 million children under five years old in low- and middle-income countries are at risk of not reaching their developmental potential, based on proxy measures of stunting and poverty. But of even greater concern, every child worldwide now faces existential threats from climate change and commercial pressures.

“Countries need to overhaul their approach to child and adolescent health, to ensure that we not only look after our children today but protect the world they will inherit in the future,” she added.

The report includes a new global index of 180 countries, comparing performance on child flourishing, including measures of child survival and well-being, such as health, education, and nutrition; sustainability, with a proxy for greenhouse gas emissions, and equity, or income gaps.

According to the report, while the poorest countries need to do more to support their children’s ability to live healthy lives, excessive carbon emissions -disproportionately from wealthier countries - threaten the future of all children.

The only countries on track to beat carbon emission per capita targets by 2030, while also performing fairly (within the top 70) on child flourishing measures are Albania, Armenia, Grenada, Jordan, Moldova, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, Uruguay, and Vietnam, shows the analysis.

“From heads-of-state to local government, from UN leaders to children themselves, this Commission calls for the birth of a new era for child and adolescent health. It will take courage and commitment to deliver. It is the supreme test of our generation,” says Dr Richard Horton, Editor-in-Chief of The Lancet family of journals.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/climate-change--harmful-products-impacting-children--report.html

154,20-2-20,Didi likely to attend Shah’s Bhubaneshwar meet,"Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is likely to attend the Eastern Zonal Council meeting on February 28, on internal security to be chaired by Union Home Minister Amit Shah at Bhubaneshwar, State Government sources said.

The meeting will be attended by all the Chief Ministers of the eastern states.

Sources at State secretariat Nabanna said that the Chief Minister has been invited by the Union Home Ministry on February 28. “There will be a EZC meeting on internal security where Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has been invited,” sources said adding “the Chief Minister is likely to attend the meeting.”

Sources also said that if the Chief Minister got preoccupied in other engagements then State Finance Minister Amit Mitra could be sent to attend the meeting.

Apart from Banerjee Chief Ministers of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and Sikkim have also been invited and all the Chief Ministers are likely to remain present in the meeting.

With Banerjee taking the centre stage in her consistent anti-Narendra Modi and anti-BJP campaigns galvanizing the other parties in one place with particular reference to the ongoing struggle against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register for Citizens (NRC) all eyes are likely to be on the outcome of the Bhbaneshwar summit.

While the top TMC leaders refused to make open comment on any likelihood of Mamata-Shah parley in the sidelines of the main meeting critics said the Chief Minister might hold talks with Shah on a number of issues like the State’s financial dues.

“She even met Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the peak of anti-CAA movement when he came to Kolkata in January,” said BN Chakrabarty a professor of political science and political analyst.

After his meeting with the Prime Minister the Chief Minister told the media that she had met him as it was the tradition to welcome a guest adding how the talks between the two leaders remained confined to the financial demands of the State Government.

If the meeting between Shah and Banerjee takes place at Bhubaneshwar it will be the second such meeting in the past five months or so as the two leaders met in Delhi late last year when Banerjee went to the Capital to meet the Prime Minister and the Home Minister leading the opposition parties to attack the Chief Minister for her double standards.

Incidentally Banerjee’s Delhi visit had coincided with the CBI’s relentless pressure on the then ADG CID Rajiv Kumar who was allegedly gone underground with the Agency sleuths hot in pursuit.

Kumar was wanted by the CBI for his role in the investigation of the multi-crore Sharada chit fund case. Even as in subsequent hearing Kumar got reprieve in Calcutta High Court which provided shield to him from arrest the State Opposition cried foul alleging the CBI once again withdrew into its shell following Banerjee’s urgent visit toDelhi.

Reacting to the February 28 summit State Congress leader Manoj Chakrabarty said “whether this meeting in Bhubaneshwar is really on internal security or the TMC leaders’ security will only be revealed subsequently.”

Apart from other things inter-state relations particularly on boundary issues and trade and commerce are likely to come up in the meeting. An ongoing boundary dispute between Bengal and Jharkhand may also come up for discussion, sources said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/didi-likely-to-attend-shah---s-bhubaneshwar-meet.html

The arrests were made based on a complaint from a BJP functionary alleging that Siraj Bisaralli, a poet had recited an anti-CAA poem at ‘Anegundi Utsava’ in Gangavathi town of Koppal district in January and Rajabaxi, editor of an online news portal uploaded it on social media.

156,20-2-20,BJP’s defeat in Delhi signals beginning of change: Pawar,"NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Wednesday said the defeat of the BJP in the Delhi Assembly elections signals “beginning of the change”.

“The BJP is tasting defeats - be it in the elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan or Delhi. In Delhi, the BJP had put all its strength and even Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah campaigned there,” Pawar said at a party workers’ meeting here.

“UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and chief ministers of other BJP-ruled states also campaigned in Delhi. But people of Delhi showed that the beginning of change has started,” he said.

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) stormed back to power in Delhi by winning an impressive 62 seats, while the BJP could work its magic only in the remaining eight seats in the national capital.

On the Ram temple issue, Pawar said, “We accept the construction of Ram temple. The way in which a trust was set up for it, there should be a similar body for mosque. The country and the government belong to everyone and every religion”.

Noting that the atmosphere in the country was “different” now, the NCP leader lamented, “Those in power are ignoring problems of common man. Uttar Pradesh gave many leaders to the country, so the state has an important role in politics. The state has the capacity to bring the country on the right track”. Senior NCP leader Praful Patel said his party has decided to strengthen its organisation in Uttar Pradesh. “We have started establishing party organisation at every district and village level in the state,” he said, adding people were disappointed by the politics of SP and BSP in Uttar Pradesh, which was capitalised by the BJP and it came to power in the state with a majority.

Patel later told reporters that there was no difference of opinion among the NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp---s-defeat-in-delhi-signals-beginning-of-change--pawar.html
157,20-2-20,"GFP: Like Goa CM, Centre should remove anti-people policies","Goa Forward Party (GFP) chief Vijai Sardesai on Wednesday said the Centre should learn from Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant and withdraw its ‘anti-people’ policies.

He was referring to the Sawant-led Government’s recent decision of withdrawing section 144 of the CrPC in North Goa and the rollback of the order notifying 56 villages in the state as urban areas.

Speaking to reporters in Margao, Sardesai congratulated Sawant for withdrawing the notifications that had met with Opposition from various quarters.

“I appreciate the Chief Minister for rolling back anti-people decisions,” the Fatorda MLA said.

158,20-2-20,"Prashant Kishor defends ‘pichhlaggu’ jibe at Nitish, linking BJP with Godse","Defending his ‘pichhlaggu’ (underling) barb at Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, poll strategist-politician Prashant Kishor on Wednesday said he was upset with the JD(U) chief’s ‘surrender’ before the BJP just to cling to power without extracting any benefit for the State.

Facing flak for linking the BJP with (Nathuram) Godse, while having worked with the party in the past, Kishor asserted that public praise of Mahatma Gandhis assassin by a mainstream political outfit was “a recent phenomenon, seen in the last six to eight months”.

He said in the seven decades since Independence only fringe elements extolled Godse here and there.

“It has been only after the last Lok Sabha polls that we have seen workers of a mainstream party chanting slogans in his praise, even a Member of Parliament doing the same on the floor of the House,” he told a news channel here, referring to the incident involving Bhopal MP Sadhvi Pragya Thakur.

The expelled JD(U) vice president lamented the pity was that, “those aligned with the BJP, did not muster the courage to even condemn the outrageous act”.

Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi had on Tuesday taken a swipe at Kishor, saying the man who had cut his teeth as an election strategist for Narendra Modi in 2014, was now accusing the BJP of following “Godse”.

“As regards the controversy over picchlaggu remark, I have been expressing my reservations about people of the state accepting a leader who appears to be playing second fiddle (to the BJP). I might be wrong, but that is my view,” the election strategist said.

“However, I was ready to accept the surrender before the BJP had it been for extracting benefits for the state from the party in power at the Centre. If the capitulation is just to ensure continuance in power in the state, that might be detested by the people”, he added.

Former BJP president and Union Home minister Amit Shah has already announced that Kumar would be the face of the NDA in the Bihar assembly polls to be held later this year. During his press conference the previous day, Kishor had refered to denial of special status to Bihar by the Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi not entertaining Kumar’s request for grant of central status to Patna University.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/prashant-kishor-defends----pichhlaggu----jibe-at-nitish--linking-bjp-with-godse.html
159,20-2-20,Outbreak to hit drug supplies,"With no let-up in coronavirus cases in China, the Niti Aayog on Wednesday held a meeting with pharma industry to discuss the impact of disruption in supplies of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) while a Government panel has suggested a ban on export of the 12 APIs

and formulations, including antibiotics, such as Choramphenicol, Neomycin, Metronidazole and Vitamins B1, B12, B6 along with progesterone, among others.

India has a high dependence on China for fermentation-based APIs and intermediates.

In the meantime, the third and final batch of 406

inmates quarantined at the ITBP facility here after being evacuated from the coronavirus-hit Chinese city of Wuhan was discharged after being declared free of coronavirus by the doctors.

Sources said Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant had a meeting on Wednesday which was attended by Pharmaceutical Department Secretary PD Vaghela and Biocon Chairperson and Managing Director Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, among others to discuss hosts of measures aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing of APIs to reduce dependence on imports of the APIs from China.

“Fruitful, constructive & positive meeting with captains of industry in pharmaceutical sector to discuss the options for domestic manufacturing of critical APIs on which India is import dependent. Consensus arrived at on a range of policy measures for creating ecosystem in India,” Kant said in a tweet after the meeting.

According to the sources, Kant told industry captains that they should try to become globally competitive to beat China that accounted for 67.56 per cent of the total imports of bulk drugs and drug intermediates at USD 2,405.42 million to India in 2018-19.

Zydus Group Chairman Pankaj Patel had on Tuesday said that the prices of the key pharmaceutical ingredients could rise if the coronavirus situation in China does not improve soon.

The Government committee formed to monitor supply of raw materials for drugs from China has recommended restrictions on exports of 12 APIs and formulations in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, according to an official communication.

In a letter to the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), Deputy Secretary at Chemicals and Fertilisers Ministry MK Bhardwaj sought restricting exports of the 12 APIs and formulations.

The Department of Pharmaceuticals had formed a committee under the chairmanship of joint drug controller, Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) that has been closely monitoring supply of APIs and intermediates which are imported from China and effect of the coronavirus epidemic in the country on their supply to India.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had on Tuesday met the representatives of various sectors, including pharmaceuticals, textiles, chemicals, electronics and IT hardware, solar, auto, surgical equipments, and paints, to review the situation following the outbreak of the deadly virus in China.

She had said the Government would soon announce measures to deal with the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the domestic industry.

There has been no supply from the neighbouring country for the past 20-25 days, mainly due to Chinese New Year holidays, sources had said. Companies have been maintaining 2-3 months inventory of these APIs and intermediates, Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) Secretary General Sudarshan Jain had earlier said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/outbreak-to-hit-drug-supplies.html
160,20-2-20,UK’s points-based visa system to attract best from India,"UK Home Secretary Priti Patel on Wednesday unveiled a new points-based visa system to attract the 'brightest and the best' from the world, including from India, and to reduce the number of cheap and low-skilled workers coming to the country.

The new system will come into force from January 1, 2021 at the end of the transition period after the UK's exit from the European Union (EU) on January 31, which will formally end free movement of people within the economic bloc for the UK as a non-member.

The new post-Brexit system, which will apply equally to the EU and non-EU countries like India, is based on assigning points for specific skills, qualifications, salaries and professions, with visas only awarded to those who gain enough points.

“Today is a historic moment for the whole country. We're ending free movement, taking back control of our borders and delivering on the people's priorities by introducing a new UK points-based immigration system, which will bring overall migration numbers down,” said Patel, the senior-most Indian-origin Cabinet minister.

“We will attract the brightest and the best from around the globe, boosting the economy and our communities, and unleash this country's full potential,” Patel, in charge of the UK's visa and immigration system, said.

Under the scheme, foreign workers who wanted to come to the UK would have to speak English and have the offer of a skilled job with an 'approved sponsor'. They would be awarded 50 points if they fulfil these criteria.

In total, immigrants would have to reach 70 points to be able to work in the UK, with points also being awarded for qualifications, the salary on offer and working in a sector with shortages.

The UK Home Office said the new system is a direct response to the 2016 referendum in favour of Brexit, which was seen as a vote to end the country's reliance on cheap migrant labour and reduce overall levels of migration with tighter security.

“The new single global system will treat the EU and non-EU citizens equally. It will give top priority to those with the highest skills and the greatest talents, including scientists, engineers and academics,” it said.

In New Delhi, Acting British High Commissioner Jan Thompson said, “The new Points-Based Immigration System is great news for Indian nationals looking to work in the UK. It puts Indian applicants on a level playing field, and prioritises those with the greatest skills and talent— something which India has in abundance.”

The Global Talent Scheme, a fast-track visa to be in operation from Friday, will also apply to the EU citizens from next year to allow highly-skilled scientists and researchers to come to the UK without a job offer.

Changes to the system would be implemented through an immigration bill needing approval from MPs and peers to come into force, the BBC reported.

Opposition Labour Party said the “hostile environment” will make it hard to attract workers.

Liberal Democrat home affairs spokeswoman Christine Jardine said the proposals were based on “xenophobia”.

Professor Alice Gast, President of Imperial College London, said: “British science is global. The new post-study work and Global Talent visas will help us to attract the world's brightest students and researchers, wherever they come from.

“From the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine to clean energy, British science's international collaborations drive innovation and excellence.”

The government said the points threshold for the new system will be carefully set to attract the talent the UK needs. Skilled workers will need to meet a number of relevant criteria, including specific skills and the ability to speak English, to be able to work in the UK.

All applicants will be required to have a job offer and, in line with the Migration Advisory Committee's recommendations, the minimum salary threshold will be set at 25,600 pounds - lower than the previous 30,000 pounds level for Tier 2 work visas.

The new points-based system will also expand the skills threshold for skilled workers.

Those looking to live and work in the UK will need to be qualified up to A-level or equivalent, rather than degree-level under the current system.

This will provide greater flexibility and ensure UK business has access to a wide pool of skilled workers, the Home Office said.

In line with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's manifesto commitment in the December 2019 election, there will be no specific route for low-skilled workers.

“It is estimated 70 per cent of the existing EU workforce would not meet the requirements of the skilled worker route, which will help to bring overall numbers down in future,” the Home Office said.

Those wishing to study in the UK will need to demonstrate that they have an offer from an approved educational institution, that they can support themselves financially and that they speak English.

To address the specific labour concerns of the agricultural sector reliant on seasonal workers from the EU, the Seasonal Workers Pilot will be expanded in time for the 2020 harvest from 2,500 to 10,000 places.

EU citizens and other non-visa nationals will not require a visa to enter the UK when visiting the UK for up to six months.

However, the use of national identity cards will be phased out for travel to the UK and the Home Office highlighted that as part of its post-Brexit offer, those EU citizens resident in the UK by December 31, 2020 can still apply to settle in the UK through the EU Settlement Scheme until June 2021.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/uk---s-points-based-visa-system-to-attract-best-from-india.html
161,20-2-20,PM’s surprise visit to Hunar Haat,"The ongoing ‘Hunar Haat’ at Rajpath here had a special guest on Wednesday. It was none other than Prime Minister Narendra Modi who paid a surprise visit to ‘Hunar Haat’, where he relished ‘litti-chokha’ and ‘kulhad’ tea and interacted with artisans. Minority Affairs Minister MA Naqvi accompanied the PM who headed to the Haat soon after chairing the meeting of the Union Cabinet.

Later, Naqvi told The Pioneer that the ‘Hunar Haat’, which is making the rounds of several cities in the country with the next destination being Ranchi, Jharkhand, has already given employment to over three lakh artisans in three years. “It is a revolutionary event,” he insisted.

The Haat is organised by the Ministry of Minority Affairs. Works of artisans, food and music were in full play in different stalls as visitors streamed in and out, enjoying a balmy afternoon.

Officials of the Ministry at the event were surprised when they came to know about the Prime Minister’s visit. Modi tweeted several photographs from his visit to the Hunar Haat in which he is seen interacting with the artisans and appreciating the traditional handicrafts at various stalls.

Modi, who stayed in the venue for over 50 minutes sat in a woven cot and ‘mooda’ (cane chair) and ate litti-chokha, a dough ball made of whole wheat flour and stuffed with sattu, and paid Rs 120 for it. The dish is popular in Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand.

He also had tea served in kulhad with the Minority Affairs Minister and paid Rs 40 for two cups. The Prime Minister along with Naqvi went round the Haat and stopped at several stalls to interact with master craftsmen and artisans and made queries on various fine artifacts.

Master artisans, craftsmen and culinary experts, including more than 50 per cent women, from across the country are participating at the Haat.

“Spent a wonderful afternoon at Hunar Haat on India Gate. It showcases the best of products including handicrafts, carpets, textiles and of course, delicious food! Do visit it,” PM Modi tweeted. The participation of people from all across India makes ‘Hunar Haat’ a vibrant place, he said. “Had tasty Litti Chokha for lunch along with a hot cup of tea...,” he said in another tweet.

The Prime Minister also picked up a traditional musical instrument at a stall and tried playing it. Artisans participating in the event told Modi that traditional arts were dying,

but the ‘Hunar Haat’ initiative had given a new lease of life to them. Modi interacted with a specially-abled painter who benefited from the government’s Hunar Haat initiative.

The ‘Hunar Haat’, which will be open until February 23 in the national Capital, will move to Ranchi, Gurugram, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, Dehradun, Patna, Bhopal, Goa, Kochi, Guwahati and Bhubneshwar, among other places in coming months.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pm---s-surprise-visit-to-hunar-haat.html
162,20-2-20,Karate instructor gets 4 years RI for sexually harassing girl,"A special court here has sentenced a martial arts instructor to four years of rigorous imprisonment for sexually harassing his 13-year-old girl student during a camp in suburban Borivali in 2015.

Special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act court judge, S UBaghele, convicted the man and awarded the sentence on Monday.

The accused knew the victim and her family for eight years before the incident, the prosecution told the court. He used to run martial art classes, which the girl would attend.

In February, 2015, the man had organised a karate training camp at the Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Borivali, which was attended by the girl and five other students, the prosecution said.

After the camp got over, the accused asked other students to proceed to their homes. Thereafter, he asked the victim to accompany him on his motorcycle.

163,20-2-20,Congress says BJP using book to mislead people,"As they exchanged charges and counter charges over the revelations in Mumbai’s former Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria’s book “Let Me Say It Now”, the ruling Congress on Wednesday rubbished the BJP’s efforts to use contents of book to mislead the people and the BJP demanded re-investigation into the 26/11 terror attacks.

On a day when State BJP leader and senior MLA Atul Bhatkalkar shot off a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray demanding re-investigation into the 26/11 attacks, Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee Secretary Sachin Sawant said: “Here is a party (BJP) that has shielded accused in the terror acts like Malegaon blasts and Samjota Express blasts and put pressure on the public prosecutors to water down the charges and seek the release of the accused from the cases. Its demand for re-investigation into the 26/11 sounds like Ulta chor kotwal ko daante.”

“It was the Congress Government that caught 26/11 attack accused Abdul Ajmal Kasab alive and executed him after a proper judicial process due to which real face of Pakistan and its support for terrorism got exposed internationally, whereas the tacit support of the BJP helped the accused in Malegaon bomb-blast go scot-free,” Sawant said.

Reacting to the BJP leaders’ claim that the pharse 'Hindu terror' was coined post 26/11 attacks, Sawant tweeted: “The book of Rakesh Maria hypothetically discusses if Kasab was not found alive, media would have projected him a Hindu. It doesn't mention any conspiracy. #BJP can stoop to any level because of its dirty

mindset”.

“#PragyaThakur in failed attempt to pull wool over people's eyes is using Rakesh Maria's book with a false pretense. Book mentions nothing that's not included in Kasab's chargesheet. Crime of Kasab is same as to what she is charged for. Unfortunate that Anti-India BJP gave her ticket,” Sawant said in another tweet.

In his letter to the Chief Minister, BJP’s Bhatkalkar made a strong case for the re-investigation into the 26/11 attacks. “After the 26/11 attacks, the Congress leaders indulged in a false propaganda that it was not Kasab but the Hindu terrorists who killed like Hemant Karkare and Ashok Kamte who were among the senior police officers martyred in the 26/11 attacks”.

“In view of the revelation made by Maria who investigated the 26/11 attacks that Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI attempted to depict Kasab as the Hindu terrorist, it is essential for the Maharashtra Government to order a comprehensive re-investigation into the Mumbai terror attacks. The re-investigation is essential as it involves national security,” Bhatkalkar said.

Bhatkalkar claimed that former Union home secretary in the Rajiv Gandhi Government and former chief secretary of Maharashtra, Ram Pradhan, who headed a two-member committee appointed by the then Congress-led DF Government, had in a media interview said that there was “local connection” to the 26/11 attacks and that then Union Minister and senior Congress P Chidambar had asked Pradhan not to reveal the “local connection”.

Contesting Bhatkalkar’s claim, Sawant said: “Nowhere in the interview cited by Bhatkalkar, Ram Pradhan has said that Chidambaram told him to withhold information about the purported local connection. Hence, Bhatkalkar’s claim is baseless”.

Alluding to senior BJP leader and Union Minister Piyush Goyal’s claim about “Hindu terror” conspiracy hatched allegedly at the behest of Chidambaram, Maria’s statement in his book that LeT wanted to pass off the 26/11 attacks as a case of Hindu terrorism and reference to “red thread” around Kasab’s wrist, Sawant tweeted: “The confessional statement of Terrorist Ajmal Kasab mentions following clarification about his Identity card and red thread on his wrist. This exposes Anti-India #BJP”

In a series of tweets, Sawant said: “#BJP Govt swept many conspiracies under the carpet. Honest Investigation would have revealed it's dreadful face Swami Aseemanand links RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat to terror attacks”.

“What was your conspiracy @BJP4India* with #DavinderSingh ? Why did NIA take over the investigation of #DavinderSingh from J&K police that also suddenly?

“So taking the credit of #SurgicalStrike and #BalakotAttack by Modi was okay? Wasn't it an insult to our Jawans? Dichotomy of BJP #bjpsupportsterrorism #bjp supports terrorists #pragyathakur #DavinderSingh,” the Congress leader tweeted.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/congress-says-bjp-using-book-to-mislead-people.html

Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) said whale sharks, the largest living fish in the world, are vanishing from the face of the earth due to factors like climate change, rampant fishing and ocean pollution.

However, a senior official from the Union Environment Ministry said efforts were on to revive the number of whale sharks and if needed, the Government will spend around Rs 2-3 crores annually for its conservation.

Whale sharks have been classified as endangered in the red list of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and are also called 'Gentle Giants' with maximum aggregation off the Gujarat coast.

Sajan John, marine expert from WTI, said these giants are mainly targeted for their meat but ocean pollution and warming were also affecting them.

“India needs to have a stronger dialogue with countries to protect this mega fauna which migrates from one country's coast to another and gets killed on the way.

“The population of these large and vulnerable aquatic animals which are deliberately targeted for meat, has declined by 63 per cent in the last over seven decades, also due to other factors like climate change, ocean pollution and fishing pressure,” John said at the sidelines of The 13th Conference of Parties to the Convention on Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS COP 13) here.

WTI is working with the Gujarat government to rescue whale sharks which get stuck in fishing nets along its coast. John said fishing of whale sharks is also done to collect and trade its fins.

“Though government has banned export of shark fins, illegally it is still being done,” said the WTI official.

John also urged that the government should be proactive and intensify its steps to conserve the species.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/wti--whale-shark-population-declined-by-63--in-75-years.html

171,20-2-20,Three HM terrorists killed in Pulwama,"Three dreaded terrorists of pro-Pakistan Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) terror outfit were eliminated by the joint team of security forces in Sherabad area of Tral in South Kashmir’s Pulwama district early Wednesday morning.

Director General of Jammu &Kashmir Police, Dilbagh Singh, in Srinagar said, “in the ongoing anti-terrorist operations, three Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists were gunned down by the security forces in Sherabad area of Tral early Wednesday morning”.

He said since January 2020, a total number of 23 terrorists have been eliminated by the security forces in 10 operations across the State.

DGP said, “the three terrorists killed during the operation were identified as Jahangir Rafiq Wani, Raja Umer Maqbool and Uzair Bhat. He said two of them were residents of Tral and the third one was native of Bijbehara. He said, Jahangir had taken over the command of Hizbul Mujahideen in the area after the elimination of another top commander Hamad Khan in January 2020.”

“Jahangir along with Raja Maqbool were involved in at least eight terrorism related incidents and had spread reign of terror in the area. They were involved in civilian killings, torching religious places, chemist shop, trucks and targeting security personnel”, DGP added

Referring to the security measures to prevent any terror strike in the run up to the visit of US President Donald Trump to India, DGP said, “We are taking all necessary measures...we are hopeful that this visit (of the US president) will pass off peacefully,”

Singh said foreign dignitaries visited Jammu and Kashmir recently and their visits passed off without any incident. “Two groups (of ambassadors) visited Jammu & Kashmir and they left without any incident taking place here,” he said. The DGP said Pakistan was trying its best to keep the militancy going in Jammu & Kashmir by sending in militants from across the Line of Control (LoC) and the international border under the cover of ceasefire violations, especially after the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution, which gave a special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu & Kashmir, on August 5 last year.

“The number of ceasefire violations has increased after August 5, 2019. Pakistan is trying to keep the borders hot in order to push in as many terrorists as possible. While some attempts of infiltration have been successful, many have been foiled,” he said.

Singh said a Pakistani drone recently flew over a BSF picket in the Ghagwal area of the Jammu region for around 10 minutes, but was pulled back after the troops of the border-guarding force opened fire.

In response to a question, the DGP said he would not be able to give the exact number of militants waiting to infiltrate into Jammu and Kashmir from across the LoC, but maintained that terror launchpads were active during the winter months as well.

“Normally, there would not be much activity at the launchpads during the winter months as snow would cover the passes. This winter, however, the movement at the launchpads did not reduce,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/three-hm-terrorists-killed-in-pulwama.html

173,20-2-20,UP BJP MLA among seven booked for raping woman,"An FIR was lodged against local BJP MLA Ravindra Nath Tripathi and six others here on Wednesday for allegedly raping a woman repeatedly for a month in 2017, police said.

The 40-year-old woman, who is a widow, had lodged a complaint on February 10, they said.

The woman alleged that she was first raped by Tripathi's nephew Sandeep Tiwari, who has also been named in the FIR, in 2016. She said she did not lodge a complaint back then as Tiwari had promised to marry her, Superintendent of Police (SP) Ram Badan Singh said.

She has alleged that in the run-up to the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, she was kept at a hotel for a month by Tiwari. All the seven accused would visit the hotel and repeatedly rape her, the officer said.

She also claimed that she got pregnant and was forced to undergo abortion, he added.

A probe in this regard was handed over to Assistant Superintendent of Police Ravindra Verma.

174,20-2-20,Man gets death penalty for rape-murder of minor girl,"A court in Maharashtra's Parbhani district has awarded death sentence to a man for raping and brutally killing a five year-old girl, observing the crime was 'more cruel' than the act of the most dreaded animal.

Special Judge (POCSO cases) S G Inamdar in his order on Tuesday pronounced the accused, Vishnu Gore (30), guilty under Indian Penal Code Section 302 for murder and provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

According to the prosecution, the girl lived with her grandparents, who worked as farm labourers, at a village in Parbhani, located around 500 km from here.

On October 27, 2016, when the grandparents returned home from work, they did not find the girl at home.

After unsuccessful attempts to locate her, they filed a missing person's complaint at Sonpeth police station two days later.

During the course of investigation, the police found the girl's body in a well near a field in the village on October 31, 2016 following which they arrested the accused, who worked as a labourer and resided in the same district.

As per the prosecution, the accused kidnapped the victim from outside her house, sexually assaulted her and then strangulated her to death with a nylon rope. He then wrapped the body in a gunny bag and threw it into the well.

While there was no direct evidence, the prosecution relied on circumstantial evidence to prove its case.

They examined 23 witnesses, including the victim's grandfather and the person who had last seen the girl with the accused.

Additional Public Prosecutor S D Wakodkar told the court that the case was proved beyond all reasonable doubt, and sought death sentence for the accused.

“This falls under the ambit of the 'rarest of rare' case. It is a case of aggravated penetrative sexual assault on the minor girl and killing her,” Wakodkar told the court while praying for capital punishment.

Finding merit in the prosecution's arguments, the court awarded death sentence to the accused, observing that he acted in a manner “highly repugnant to the morals and committed diabolic, premeditated,brutal, pre-planned aggravated penetrative sexual assault and cold-blooded murder” .",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/man-gets-death-penalty-for-rape-murder-of-minor-girl.html

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday met representatives from various sectors, including pharmaceuticals, textiles, chemicals, electronics and IT hardware, solar, auto, surgical equipment, and paints, to review the situation following the outbreak of the deadly virus in China. She said the government would soon announce measures to deal with the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the domestic industry.

“Positive cues were witnessed in the market on hopes that the government is planning to consider some relief measures for the ailing telecom players.

178,20-2-20,India should capture apparel market ceded by China: Textile Secy,"The textiles ministry on Wednesday said the domestic industry should take advantage of the huge $20-billion space vacated in the global apparel market by China, which is going through a tough time following outbreak of the deadly coronavirus.

Addressing a symposium on emerging opportunities for Indian textiles, Textiles Secretary Ravi Capoor said domestic textile exports have plateaued during the past 5-7 years, which is a “very worrying proposition for the government”.

“India should step in at this stage to take the advantage although not a good way to project ourselves but every crisis has its own silver lining and I think while we are with China with all our emotions and financial, political and diplomatic help but still there appears to be a big economic opportunity which is coming up our way,” he said.

In this background, Capoor said it would be the right time to bring the industry together and have a small dialogue to “see how the industry associations are prepared for this opportunity”.

As the exports have plateaued, he said the government understood that one of the major issues is that “take up the space that has been vacated by China other than this present crisis (coronavirus)”.

The secretary said $20 billion worth of apparel space, mostly in the man-made fibre, has been vacated by China in the past three years and taken away by Vietnam.

“Now is a situation where we are in a position and the (textile) minister has just spoken to Finance Minister (Nirmala Sitharaman) also this morning. We are working towards seeing that the GST inversion on man-made fibre is also taken care of.

“With all the efforts, if we are able to succeed in the removal of the inversion, then man-made fibre itself becomes a huge opportunity wherever China cedes space. India should step in a very big way,” Capoor said.

Textile minister Smriti Irani was also present at the symposium.

179,20-2-20,No end in sight for auto slump: Fitch,"The slowing economy and weakening consumer sentiment will continue to weigh on auto sales and the marginal improvement seen in December quarter, driven by festive discounts, is unlikely to sustain, a report said on Wednesday.

The GDP growth slowed down to 6.1 per cent in 2018-19 and is projected to hit a 10-year low of about 5 per cent in 2019-20, primarily due to falling consumer demand and poor financing options for high-value items like automobiles.

“Slowing growth and weak consumer sentiment will continue to weigh on auto sales and the marginal improvement seen in the December quarter driven by festive discounts is unlikely to sustain,” Fitch said in a report, without stating when the volumes will begin to pick up or how long the slump will persist.

Vehicle sales have been hampered by weak consumer sentiment and still-weak availability of financing following tighter liquidity at non-banking lenders since the middle of 2018. The sector also faces additional challenges from the adoption of stricter emission standards from April 1, the report said.

Automakers could also face production disruptions if the novel coronavirus outbreak in China leads to a prolonged halt in supply of required auto components, as the industry sources as much as 27 per cent of its demand from China worth around $5 billion, according to many analysts.

Many auto original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like Mahindra have warned that if the Chinese epidemic lasts beyond February and if the supplies don’t normalise by early March, the transition to BS-VI will be a challenge and they may have to move the Supreme Court to get some concession to sell BS-IV models beyond April 1 deadline.

In fact, Mahindra was on record saying if the epidemic lasts beyond this month, as much as 4,000 BS-IV models will be hit as it sources two critical components from China.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/no-end-in-sight-for-auto-slump--fitch.html

181,20-2-20,"Mittal, Birla meet Finance Minister as AGR crisis looms over telecom sector","With the Supreme Court-mandated liability pushing telecom companies to the brink, industry honchos Sunil Bharti Mittal and Kumar Mangalam Birla on Wednesday met Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman as their firms scrambled to meet payment deadlines.

While the two refused to comment on discussions they had with Sitharaman, Mittal said the telecom sector has been under stress for the last three-and-a-half years and the government should focus on its sustainability.

Mittal, who heads mobile service major Bharti Airtel, first met Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash before going for the meeting with the finance minister. Birla, who is the chairman of Vodafone Idea Ltd, had met the telecom secretary on Tuesday.

It was not immediately clear if the two telecom tycoons met Sitharaman together or separately. Emerging out of the North Block after meeting Sitharaman, Mittal told reporters that the issue of pending dues arising out of the Supreme Court ruling on Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) was not discussed.

The telecom industry, he said, is vital to India’s digital agenda.

“This industry is very vital to the nation’s digital agenda, and many other industries that ride on it....Employment, government taxes...The only thing government needs to focus on is how to ensure sustainiability of the sector,” Mittal said.

Mittal -- whose company Bharti Airtel is confronted with over Rs 35,000 crore of statutory dues -- did not elaborate on the relief mechanism that the telco is pitching for.

182,20-2-20,DoT still working on final calculation of AGR dues,"The Department of Telecom is still working on final adjusted gross revenue dues that service providers have to pay as it has detected variation in accounting practices adopted by different circle offices, according to official sources.

The licence finance wing of the telecom department (DoT) on February 3 issued a letter with guidelines to all controller General of Communication Accounts to reconcile AGR dues and asked them to give 15 days time to operators for the submission of appeals and documents related to deductions they make in the final payment, sources said.

The letter was a follow up to a previous note sent by the licence finance wing on December 4 and a follow-up on December 13 to the circles for re-verification of debit voucher reports (DVR).

“The department has been facing a challenge in carrying out the revised assessments due to various issues related to DVRs. Telecom operators, including Airtel and Vodafone Idea, have challenged many DVRs.

“Also, circle offices have not adopted uniform practice in accounting. The DoT has asked them to re-verify DVRs at the earliest in the light of Supreme Court judgement,” an official source said.

Telecom operators have been submitting two separate audited details of deduction towards interconnection usage charges and roaming fee to the DoT. In one set, deductions have been claimed by telecom operators on a paid basis while on an accrual basis on the other.

“DoT noticed that many Controllers of Communication Accounts have been cherry picking the figures claimed by telecom operators in their final DVRs. In some cases, DoT guidelines regarding deduction verification issued in 2014, 2015 and 2016 have not been followed. There have been cases where one CCA has allowed one kind of deduction and another has disallowed,” the source said.

According to estimates prepared by the DoT, Airtel owes nearly Rs 35,586 crore, including licence fee and spectrum usage charges, to the government.

Vodafone Idea is staring at dues worth Rs 53,000 crore, which includes up to Rs 24,729 crore of spectrum dues and another Rs 28,309 crore in licence fee. Tata Teleservices owes around Rs 13,800 crore, BSNL Rs 4,989 crore and MTNL Rs 3,122 crore.

While the deadline to make AGR payment ended on January 23, 2020 as per Supreme Court order, the DoT has been following up with circle offices to verify DVRs of 10 years starting from 2006-2007 which involve around millions of entries in a quarter and then start verification for 2017-18 and 2018-19.

The DoT on December 13, 2019, gave 15 days time to submit the re-verified accounts but the same could not be done in absence of uniform guidelines.

“The headquarters will also need time to check DVRs once they are submitted by the circle office. Thereafter notice will be sent to telecom operators for submitting appeals and documents related to claims that are not admissible,” the source said.

The apex court on February 14 came down heavily on the telecom department for not taking steps to recover statutory dues, estimated to be around Rs 1.47 lakh crore, from operators including Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea, Tata Teleservices, among others.

Of Rs 1.47 lakh crore, around Rs 1.13 lakh crore is likely to be recovered, as other companies, which are liable to pay AGR dues, have shut down their businesses.

Reliance Communications and Aircel are going through insolvency proceedings.

Of the total demand raised, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Group have made part payment of about Rs 10,000 crore, Rs 2,500 crore and Rs 2,197 crore, respectively.

The next hearing of the case is listed for March 17.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/dot-still-working-on-final-calculation-of-agr-dues.html

On the National Stock Exchange (NSE), the scrip rose 48.33 per cent to touch a high of Rs 4.45. Later, after shedding some gains, it settled 40 per cent up at Rs 4.20.

The stock has ended the day in green after declining for seven consecutive sessions.

The NSE saw an exchange of more than 100 crore shares of Vodafone Idea, and over 14 crore units were traded on the BSE. In this regard, the BSE sought a clarification from the telecom service provider about the sudden movement in the stock price.

The company said all the information furnished by it is in public domain and there is no price-sensitive information pending which is to be disclosed to the stock exchanges.

“There is no such announcement or price-sensitive information, which is pending to be intimated by the company to the stock exchanges.

According to the latest media reports, the government is unlikely to invoke bank guarantees of Vodafone Idea as of now.

Encashing of the bank guarantees may sound the death knell for companies such as Vodafone Idea which has been struggling to garner the dues.

185,20-2-20,"ICRA: Indian auto industry to be negatively impacted, supply chain disrupted if coronavirus persists","India’s automobile industry is likely to be negatively impacted and supply chain disrupted if the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in China and South-East Asia persisted longer, according to ratings agency ICRA.

These countries play a critical role in automotive supply chain and domestic OEMs source critical components and sub-components including fuel injection pumps, EGR modules, electronic components, turbo chargers from these markets which in turn directly or indirectly depend on China.

China accounts for 27% of India’s auto component imports valued at USD 4.8 billion and, the impact is estimated to be higher for high value-add and customised components, while commoditised products could shift to alternative suppliers, ICRA said in a statement.

Commenting on the development, ICRA Ltd Vice-President (Corporate Sector Ratings) Shamsher Dewan said India’s automotive supply chain could get disrupted if the manufacturing activities in China continue to remain impacted owing to coronavirus outbreak.

Dewan further said, “Moreover, given that OEMs are currently in the period of transitioning to BS-VI production, disruption in supply of critical components required for the same has the potential to impact smooth transition to new emission norms.”

ICRA said disruption in supply of certain critical components sourced from China will have differential impact.

OEMs sourcing components such as electronic components, fuel injection pumps, turbo charger, meter sets, LEDs, magnets, airbag components, steering system components and electric vehicle components will be affected the most.

In particular, the impact will be more profound on commercial vehicle (CV), passenger vehicle (PV) and the two-wheeler (2W) segments, it added.

Tractor segment which has high localisation levels with limited dependence on imports will have much lesser impact.

In terms of sectoral outlook on domestic automotive industry, ICRA said it has a negative outlook on the CV segment due to surplus capacity in system, existing financing constraints, weak macro-economic scenario and industrial output which is likely to keep demand subdued.

For the PV segment too the outlook is negative and demand recovery is expected to be gradual.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/icra--indian-auto-industry-to-be-negatively-impacted--supply-chain-disrupted-if-coronavirus-persists.html
186,20-2-20,"Solar capacity addition down 12% to 7,346 MW in 2019: Report","India’s solar energy capacity addition dipped 12% to 7,346 megawatts (MW) in the calender year 2019 from 8,338 MW in 2018, according to a report by Mercom India Research.

While 2019 was a lost year for the country’s solar sector, Mercom India Research expects solar installations to rise by 17% year-on-year (y-o-y) to about 8,500 MW by the end of 2020.

“The country installed 7,346 MW of solar in 2019, a 12% decline year-over-year (YoY), compared to 8,338 MW installed in 2018,” according to the report titled ‘Q4 & Annual 2019 India Solar Market Update’.

It also estimates solar installations in the range of 65-70 gigawatt (GW) by 2022, based on the current market conditions. The government has set a solar installation target of 100 GW by 2022. The large-scale solar projects accounted for 85% of installations with 6,242 MW in 2019 and saw a 7% y-o-y fall, and rooftop solar made up the remaining 15% adding 1,104 MW, a 33% drop y-o-y.

Karnataka was the top state for solar in 2019 with 1.8 GW, followed by Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. Together, these three states accounted for almost 70% of solar installations in 2019.

“The demand outlook for 2020 looks better with a stronger project pipeline, and we should see the solar market resume y-o-y growth again,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group in a statement.

He also said that a lot would depend on the economy and lending situation getting back on track, the impact of coronavirus, and the outcome of the 20% basic customs duty announced in the recent Budget.

At the end of 2019, cumulative solar installations reached almost 35.7 GW. Large-scale projects accounted for 31.3 GW (87.6%), whereas rooftop solar installations accounted for 4.4 GW (12.4%). The large-scale solar project development pipeline stands at 23.7 GW, with 31.5 GW of projects tendered and pending auction at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019.

The Indian solar market added 1,897 MW in the October-December 2019 period, a 12.8% fall as compared with 2,177 MW installed in the preceding quarter. However, installations were up by 15.6% compared to 1,641 MW installed in the fourth quarter of 2018.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, large-scale solar projects came to 1,593 MW, while rooftop solar installations came to 304 MW, an increase of 24.1 per cent compared to 245 MW in the third quarter of 2019, it added .

Multiple reasons led to the fall in large-scale solar additions in 2019 including elections, a slowing economy, liquidity issues, tariff caps, lack of financing, curtailment, payment delays, and power purchase agreements renegotiations in Andhra Pradesh.

Rooftop installations declined for the first time in five years. The report pointed to the slowdown in the economy in 2019 as a significant factor, along with liquidity issues in the market following the NBFC crisis that made it difficult for installers to finance rooftop projects in a tough economy.

“There are several challenges facing the industry but a few fixes, that could immediately turn around the sector, would be to remove tariff caps in reverse auctions, getting government agencies to make timely payments and facilitate lending to get the solar market moving in the right direction again,” added Prabhu.

After five consecutive years of decline, coal accounted for a majority of the power installations with 7.8 GW and made up 44.1% of the installed capacity, followed by solar with 7.3 GW. Wind energy accounted for 2.4 GW followed by small hydro and other renewables with 154 MW and 82.5 MW, respectively.

India will join the select league of nations using petrol and diesel containing just 10 parts per million of sulphur as it looks to cut vehicular emissions that are said to be one of the reasons for the choking pollution in major cities.

Sanjiv Singh, Chairman of Indian Oil Corp (IOC) - the firm that controls roughly half of the country’s fuel market, said almost all refineries began producing ultra-low sulphur BS-VI (equivalent to Euro-VI grade) petrol and diesel by the end of 2019 and oil companies have now undertaken the tedious task of replacing every drop of fuel in the country with the new one.

A Boeing official said the debris was discovered in “several” planes but did not give a precise number. Boeing built about 400 undelivered Max jets before it temporarily halted production last month.

The fuel tank debris was discovered during maintenance on parked planes, and Boeing said it immediately made corrections in its production system to prevent a recurrence. Those steps include more inspections before fuel tanks are sealed.

A Boeing spokesman said that the issue would not change the company’s belief that the Federal Aviation Administration will certify the plane to fly again this summer.

An FAA spokesman said the agency knows that Boeing is conducting a voluntary inspection of undelivered Max planes.

The FAA “increased its surveillance based on initial inspection reports and will take further action based on the findings,” said spokesman Lynn Lunsford.

199,20-2-20,China cuts loan rate as it battles coronavirus impact,"China on Thursday announced it would cut interest rates in a bid to boost the economy, as it battles the economic fallout of the new coronavirus outbreak.

The reduction in the loan prime rate (LPR) -- one of the preferential rates commercial banks impose on their best customers and which serves as a reference for other lending rates -- is the latest measure to help companies struggling through the epidemic.

The one-year LPR was lowered to 4.05 per cent from 4.15 per cent, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) said in a statement.

The five-year LPR -- on which many lenders base their mortgage rates -- was also lowered to 4.75 per cent from 4.8 per cent.

The LPR, released on the 20th day of every month, is based on rates of the central bank's open market operations, especially medium-term lending facility rates.

The rate reduction comes as Beijing battles to control a virus epidemic that has infected over 74,500 people in the country.

The outbreak is threatening to put a dent in the global economy, with China paralysed by vast quarantine measures and major firms such as iPhone maker Apple and mining giant BHP warning it could damage bottom lines.

The central bank said earlier this month it would offer a 300-billion-yuan ($43-billion) boost to help businesses involved in fighting the epidemic.

Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said the rate cut would ""help companies weather the damage from the coronavirus at the margins"".

But he said the ability of firms to postpone loan repayments and access loans on preferential terms would be more important in the short-term.

""We expect the People's Bank to continue loosening monetary conditions in the coming weeks, especially given signs that the coronavirus disruptions have started to weigh on employment,"" he said.

""But rate cuts alone will provide limited relief to the millions of small private firms that are suffering the most from the epidemic and are poorly served by the formal banking (sector).""",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-cuts-loan-rate-as-it-battles-coronavirus-impact-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/china-cuts-loan-rate-as-it-battles-coronavirus-impact.html

208,20-2-20,Obey Vedic principles,"It is unfortunate that nowadays, humans are facing many diseases. The outbreak of coronavirus has been detected a few weeks ago. God being our real father gives us the knowledge of four Vedas to destroy illusion and solve all kinds of problems, including those of medical science. Many fatal infections can be destroyed if we simply perform daily Agnihotra in our homes.

When we obey the Vedic principles of God, diseases are either destroyed from its roots or do not even generate. Vedic mantra states that agnihotra purifies food grains, water, and bestows mental and physical strength so that people can enjoy prosperous life.

Everybody must offer aahutis in the fire of havan-kund. The nature of that fire is such that it purifies the entire atmosphere and prevents diseases. In shloks of Bhagwad Geeta, Yogeshwar Sri Krishna Maharaj states that Oh Arjun, when Yajyen is performed, the atmosphere is purified, which will in turn purify our food too.

Dr Kundanlal conducted an experiment taking twelve test tubes filled with food particles. He filled six of them with fresh air and rest with air generated from agnihotra. He found that food of the test tubes filled with air started decomposing much earlier than the food filled with the air of agnihotra. It proves that air generated by agnihotra is pure and further purifies the atmosphere.

According to Atharvaved mantra by performing Yajyen, the human beings protect themselves from all kinds of sufferings including diseases. Yajyen is basically performed by using wood of mango tree. A scientist named Trelle of France did experiments on Yajyen. He found that when the mango wood is burnt then a gas — formic aldehyde — is liberated, which destroys the harmful bacteria. Another scientist named Tautlik came to know that when Yajyen is performed with samagri containing raisins and black currants and if we stay inhale its smoke, the germs of typhoid and TB are destroyed.

Ingredients to prepare the samagri of Yajyen:

1. Honey, jaggery or raw sugar

2. Antibiotic herbs like gyol

3. Ghee and dry fruits

4. Fragrant materials like cardamom or dried petals of flowers

If people start performing agnihotra with Vedic mantras daily, he would surely protect himself, his family and the surroundings from all kinds of diseases and problems.

According to ICC’s proposed 2023-2031 Future Tours Programme (FTP) cycle, a proposed T20 Champions Cup is earmarked for 2024 and 2028 and an ODI Champions Cup in 2025 and 2029, alongside the T20 World Cups in 2026 and 2030, and the ODI World Cups in 2027 and 2031.

“I think World Test Championship as an ICC tournament should be right up there. All the other tournaments for me they start under that. This is probably the biggest of them all as every team wants to make it to the final at the Lord’s. We are no different.

“We are in that zone. We want to make sure that we qualify as soon as we can and be in that frame of mind to hopefully win that (championship),” said the Indian skipper ahead of first Test against New Zealand.

Kohli has no doubts that World Test Championship has added a context to the traditional format making the contests more exciting with points on offer.

“It has made Test cricket more exciting and that’s something we have experienced as a side although we haven’t had too many games away from home. Couple of games in the West Indies and we haven’t had a tour of Australia as a part of Test Championship. This is our first away tour since the start of home season,” said Kohli.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/test-c---ship-pinnacle-of-all-icc-tourneys.html
213,20-2-20,Ishant adds new dynamic to Indian bowling attack: Taylor,"A fit-again Ishant Sharma will add a fresh dimension to India’s bowling attack, says seasoned New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor, who foresees trouble for his team if it focusses only on tackling Jasprit Bumrah during the upcoming Test series.

Taylor is only two days away from becoming the first cricketer to play 100 games across formats. Less than three weeks away from his 36th birthday, he has already competed in 231 ODIs and 100 T20I.

“I think if we just look at Bumrah, we are in trouble. I think their whole bowling lineup is fantastic. Obviously, Sharma coming back will bring new dynamics to the team,” Taylor told reporters.

Ishant is returning to the Indian squad after recovering from an ankle injury sustained during a Ranji Trophy clash last month.

“They have got a world-class batting line-up as well and we have to get through that. But they are the No 1 team in the world for a reason and we know we have to be on our game to be successful against them,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ishant-adds-new-dynamic-to-indian-bowling-attack--taylor.html
214,20-2-20,When Vicky was tricked,"The actor tells Chahak Mittal that working for Bhoot: The Haunted Ship not only compelled him to face his worst fears but also taught him how a horror film requires an artiste to give a lot of calculated expressions

What would it be like to react to something that is not even present in front of you? Confused? Well, now you can imagine what actor Vicky Kaushal’s situation might have been when he was acting for Bhoot: The Haunted Ship. Be it romance, comedy, thriller or biopic, other drama genres hold a lot of facts from real life for actors to abide by. However, the expression of horror follows no grammar. Acting for a horror film is like acting for something that’s not even real. And for Vicky, this was the trickiest part.

He tells us, “I was purely following Bhanu’s (Pratap Singh, director) orders and vision. Everyday I would come on set and just ask him a number of questions. ‘What are we exactly doing?’ ‘What does he want and how?’ ‘How are we going to create that fear?’” The actor had very little to work with. There were no props on the set, neither was there any sound track which is overlaid later.

He says, “There were times when I would find myself looking at the monitor, which I don’t usually do. I would ask Bhanu what the background music would be like and what effects are going to be added in the post-production. It would require a lot of focus from all the departments together and then with myself to create that kind of atmosphere for the audience in the theatre. Hence, the grammar was very new to me. But there was a lot of conviction and clarity in Bhanu’s narration, which made me think and act the way he wanted me to. I think! (Laughs)”

Vicky explains how he worked on the process. He says, “When you’re doing a scene for a drama or comedy film, in your heart, you know that you’ve hit the right emotion. But with fear, it is always the planned emotion. It doesn’t come to you naturally, especially if there is nothing around you. I am walking in a haunted ship and there’s something I hear from the back. But that is only something that I have to imagine. It hasn’t happened in reality. It is going to be added later. Yet I have to react, imagine the intensity of it and then come to an intensity of fear that can be visible from my facial expressions and body language. All of that is a very calculated process. You know that you are going to react in this way. You don’t leave it to the moment. So this planning of reactions and still making it seem natural is very tricky!”

He accepted the film because Dharma Productions was in charge. “I was called by the production house when Raazi was going to be released. They wanted to have a discussion with me about doing another film with them, which was, surprisingly, a horror one. I was intrigued. I wondered ‘kuch toh baat hogi’. My mind was blown after I the script. I thoroughly enjoyed it.”

The film, also starring Bhumi Pednekar, revolves around the real-life haunted ship which was washed ashore on Mumbai’s coast. The strange part of it was that when it hit the sand barrier, there was nobody on it, including the crew members. The mystery was undetected and alarmed the people when it went aground off the coast one day. For Vicky, the script was written in a way that it stuck to the genre authentically. There wasn’t any Bollywoodisation of the theme. “It was fresh and had no unnecessary subplots or dance. I was very happy doing that. Aesthetically, it was rich. The geography, which plays a very important part in a horror film, was able to perfectly define the seriousness of the situation that was being created. There have been abandoned homes or a cemetery to showcase a horror element. But this one was a ship, which I thought was quite fresh and gave a lot of scope to explore the genre. In that container ship, there are about a hundreds rooms — engine room, pump room, staircases, lifts, which are all worn out because it’s a dilapidated, old ship. And there’s nobody inside. So I thought it became a great setup, which was properly exploited too.”

With films like Masaan, Love Per Square Foot, Raazi, Uri, and now Bhoot... there has been a whole range of genres that Vicky has explored — arthouse, romantic comedy, action, drama and horror. So how has such a variety of roles transformed him? He says, “Every film does that in some way or the other. Masaan just gave me a new perspective about life. Spending so much time in those ghats, where dead bodies are burnt, one realises the finality of life. Whatever you do or achieve, this is the real truth, where we all are going to end up one day. When I was shooting for Uri, it gave me such a new understanding about the lives of military personnel and their families. I realised what they go through. Aap kitna hi kitaabo mei padhle, but to actually live their stories, changes you.”

Vicky hasn’t been a fan of horror films himself and like most, also flinches at the thought of it. So how was it working for one? “When you do a horror film, being that person from the audience who is very scared to watch such films, you kind of overcome that fear. You face it while being a part of it directly. I am very afraid of water. And in this film, there were a lot of underwater sequences. I had to literally face my fear in a very genuine way. It hit me very personally. But yes, eventually, it also becomes a very liberating process. And that experience changes you, slightly.”

Horror as a genre hasn’t been explored in India much. Like The Conjuring, Annabelle, Paranormal Activities, there are no Hindi equivalent. Why? For Vicky, it’s because a horror film does not comply with the entertainment needs of the majority. He says, “There are people with nine to five jobs. They are not willing to watch a serious rather tension vaali film after a tiring day. Not everyone is able to enjoy a horror film. That’s why producers do not want to invest in such a film. And even when such films are made, they are made on such a low budget because of the fear of not earning enough. Eventually, it looks tacky. A horror film is an expensive one, which requires a lot of post-production work. We have tried to notch up the aesthetic sense of the film and given it elements to connect on an internal level so that the horror enthusiasts and non-horror enthusiasts can come and watch it together.”

Well, the film’s trailer looks promising and certainly makes one feel that this could be India’s The Conjuring. It is certainly no cliched ‘mehelon vaali bhootiya kahaani’ (haunted house story) anymore.” We are trying to give the audience a feel that it’s fresh. Give us a chance, the ship will sail! (Laughs).”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/when-vicky-was-tricked-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/when-vicky-was-tricked.html
215,20-2-20,Trend Blazer,"Deepika shares her first look of 83

Actor Deepika Padukone unveiled her look as Romi Dev, wife of cricket legend Kapil Dev, in the forthcoming film 83.

She says the film is an ode to every woman who puts her husband’s dream before her own.

She captioned it: “To be able to play a small but significant part in a film that captures one of the most iconic moments in sporting history has been an absolute honour. I’ve seen very closely the role a wife plays in the success of her husband’s professional and personal aspirations in my mother and 83 for me in many ways is an ode to every woman who puts her husband’s dream before her own.”

‘Portraying a young girl from Bombay who saved the lives of the 359 passengers was not only challenging but also a great honour. As the film completes its fourth anniversary, I would want people to recall how fear gave courage to the young Neerja Bhanot. She was the true icon of bravery, strength, and sacrifice for our country. She continues to be an inspiration to everyone.’

—Sonam Kapoor

Actor Dia Mirza loved playing the character of someone who makes choices on her own in the new film Thappad.

Sharing her experience on how she prepared for her role in the film, Dia said: “Playing any character is a combination of both, preparation as well as spontaneous emotions. Many years ago, one of my friends told me that one must meet opportunity with preparedness, one should understand the story from all the perspectives and not just the character’s side.”

Britney gets injured while dancing

Singer Britney Spears was hospitalised after a dance move went wrong.

The 38-year-old was left with a fractured metatarsal bone and her foot in plaster. Her boyfriend, Sam Ashghari, shared photos of the star in a hospital on his Instagram page. He revealed that the singer had fractured one of a group of five long bones in the foot, located between the tarsal bones of the hind and mid-foot and the phalanges of the toes.

216,20-2-20,The class satire,"Filmmaker Bong Joon-ho feels happy as Parasite succeeded despite exposing the brutality of disparity in modern society

Oscar-winning Parasite director, Bong Joon-ho said that the film’s “biggest pleasure and the most significant meaning” to him is that it succeeded even though the audience might feel uncomfortable with his explicit description of bitter wealth disparity in modern society.

Bong’s dark comic thriller about two families on the opposite ends of South Korea’s social spectrum is a history-making film. It won best picture at this month’s 92nd Academy Awards ceremony, becoming the first non-English-language film to get the top honor. Bong and his film clinched three other Oscars.

He told reporters that the film’s story has not only “funny, comic” elements but also “bitter, painful natures” of the disparity between the haves and have-nots in modern society.

“I didn’t want to avoid such a part even a little,” Bong told a nationally televised news conference. “Audience might hate that or feel uncomfortable to watch it ... but I thought the only option I can have for this film is depicting the world we live as frankly as possible, though that might be risky commercially.”

Noting that Parasite was already commercially successful in North America, France, Vietnam, Japan, the United Kingdom and his native South Korea even before his Oscar triumph, Bong said, “Regardless of the (Oscar) wins, the biggest pleasure and the most significant meaning was the fact that the audience around the world of our times responded to the film.”

The class satire tells the story of how a family of four poor, unemployed people living in a slum basement apartment comically infiltrates a wealthy family residing at a luxurious mansion before things unravel violently and tragically.

Bong already had commercial and critical success with his 2013 sci-fi film Snowpiercer, which starred Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton along with South Korean Parasite actor Song Kang-ho. But nothing that’s come before has been remotely as successful as Parasite, a profoundly South Korean film shot in the Korean language.

Along with the best picture award, Bong was also named best director and co-shared another Oscar title, best original screenplay, with Parasite co-writer Han Jin Won. The film won best international feature film as well.

The film, which is also the first South Korean film to win an Oscar, has made Bong a national hero. Ahead of April’s parliamentary elections in South Korea, some politicians even proposed setting up a Bong statue, establishing a street named after him and rebuilding the house where he was born. Asked about such proposals, Bong joked, “I hope people will talk about such things after I die.”

He said that he will leave it to critics, journalists and fans to analyse the film’s commercial appeal and that he’d fully focus on working on this next film.

At the same news conference, actor Lee Jeong-eun, who plays a live-in housekeeper for the wealthy family in Parasite, said the film portrayed universal problems such as unemployment “in a very interesting yet an in-depth manner.” Han said he believes audience sympathised with the film’s 10 main characters, who “have their own dramas and have their own reasons to live.”

Bong said he was ready for a break after a successful yet exhausting Oscars campaign. But he said prominent American director Martin Scorsese pleaded that he get back to work quickly. “I just read his letter a few hours ago and it was an honour,” Bong said. “He said I did a good job and should rest but only a little because he and everyone else was eagerly waiting for my next film.”

He had mentioned his admiration of Scorsese while receiving the directing Oscar, inspiring an impromptu standing ovation from the crowd. He said he was discussing with HBO making a TV adaptation of Parasite, with American director and screenwriter Adam aMcKay greeing to be a writer on the series, which could run five or six episodes. “We have smoothly taken the first step with HBO,” said Bong, while denying reports that Mark Ruffalo and Swinton have been finalised as cast members.

“The TV adaptation of Snowpiercer is planned to air in May, but since we started talking about it in 2014 or 2015, it took about five years. (The TV version of) Parasite might take quite a while too,” he said.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-class-satire-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-class-satire.html

Guilty is led by women in all departments — be it in acting, direction, writing and production — and Johar declares he will continue collaborating with female talent in future, too.

At the trailer launch, Johar was accompanied by the film’s director Ruchi Narain, writers Kanika Dhillion and Atika Chohan, and cast members Kiara Advani, Gurfateh Singh Pirzada, Akansha Ranjan Kapoor and Taher Shabbir.

We feel proud to tell this story.”

In Guilty, Kiara essays a musician’s girlfriend. The story explores the different versions of truth that emerge when a small town girl accuses her college heartthrob of rape.

“The film has a strong narrative and storytelling along with terrific performances,” said Johar. After her grand web debut with Karan Johar’s segment in the anthology Lust Stories (2018), Kiara returns to the digital space with this one.

Talking about his collaboration with Netflix, Johar said, “This is the first time that Dharmatic and Netflix has come together.

The world’s premier batsman is looking at the “bigger picture” in Indian cricket with two T20 and one 50-over World Cup in the next three years after which he might decide on playing two of the three formats.

“My mindset is on the bigger picture as I prepare myself for a rigorous three years from now and after that we might have a different conversation,” Kohli replied when asked if he is having second thoughts about quitting at least one format after the 2021 World T20 in India.

“It’s not a conversation you can hide away from in any manner. It is around eight years now that I have been playing 300 days a year, which includes travelling and practice sessions. And intensity is right up there all the time. It does take a toll on you,” the Indian captain was forthright in his reply.

The skipper understands his presence and peak performance is crucial till the 2023 World Cup after which he understands that the next phase of transition will set in.

“I can keep going on with the same intensity and also understand that the team wants a lot of my contribution in the next two to three years, so that I can ease into another transition that we faced five-six years ago,” he said referring to the retirements of Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/will-play-all-formats-for-at-least-3-more-years--kohli.html
222,20-2-20,Better call Saul,"Ñíguez’s early strike punish Liverpool on return to Wanda Metropolitano

Liverpool were the victims of an old-fashioned Atletico Madrid masterclass on Tuesday as Diego Simeone’s side ground out a 1-0 win in Madrid to give themselves hope of reaching the Champions League quarter-finals.

Saul Niguez raised the roof at a bouncing Wanda Metropolitano by scoring in the fourth minute before Atletico’s defence kicked in, suffocating the European champions and denying them a single shot on target.

“Tonight is one of those nights you don’t forget,” said Simeone. “We haven’t gone through but we have beaten the best team in the world.”

If Alvaro Morata had not slipped at the crucial moment, Atleti might even have taken a two-goal lead to Anfield, where they can expect an onslaught next month.

“We are not 5-0 down,” said Jurgen Klopp. “We don’t think it will be easy but as long as we can get 11 players in Liverpool shirts we will give everything we have. And for all the Liverpool fans that can get a ticket — welcome to Anfield.”

If Liverpool remain favourites to go through, the roar from the Atleti fans at the final whistle, aimed at their fist-pumping players on the pitch, suggested Simeone’s team now have belief.

Few had tipped them to keep this tie even alive for the second leg given their own stuttering form, in contrast to Liverpool, unbeaten in the Premier League, and gunning for a treble.

Jurgen Klopp said on Monday Atletico were a “results machine” but the temptation was to see his words as platitudes, not an accurate reflection of a side that sits 13 points behind La Liga leaders Real Madrid and had already lost six times this season.

Yet Atletico under Simeone have also become synonymous with upsetting the odds, just as they did when winning the Spanish title in 2014 and then twice reaching the Champions League final.

For all their failings this season, they summoned that spirit here to produce a throwback performance full of tenacity, resilience and guts that was always going to be needed to give them any chance of success.

He sprung a surprise by starting Thomas Lemar for the first time this year while Alvaro Morata and Diego Costa both returned from injury, the former from the start and the latter off the bench in the second half.

Liverpool, who began with their expected eleven, have blitzed numerous opponents with explosive starts but they were the ones rocking early on as Atletico snapped at their heels, pressed hard and relished being first to every loose ball.

They took the lead, aided by a hint of fortune as Liverpool failed to clear the corner and the ball cannoned back off the foot of Fabinho for Saul to stab in from three yards.

On the sideline, Simeone beckoned his players to stay calm but they were celebrating in the corner while in the stands, the fans were delirious and given hope. Atletico were given a lead to defend and the rest of the game was largely a picture of Liverpool dominating the ball but failing to break down the 10 red and white shirts in front of them.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/better-call-saul-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/better-call-saul.html

224,20-2-20,Australia favourites but India no pushovers: Mithali,"The seasoned Mithali Raj has declared Australia as favourites to win Friday's Women's T20 World Cup opener against India in what she expects to be a high-scoring and ""very close"" game.

""Australia go in as favourites, but India will be no pushover. They have some very talented players and I think it will be a very close, high-scoring game,"" Mithali wrote in a column for ICC.

""Both teams have exciting players, particular in the batting units, and it will be a case of whoever can score the runs that their country need on the day.

""I do think Australia have the advantage because of their T20 record and have a slightly better chance of winning the first game against India,"" she added.

Female stars emerging as role models has been the ""biggest change"" in women's cricket's journey from near-anonymity to stardom, feels Mithali, who grew up idolising her male counterparts.

When Mithali started out in 1999, women's cricket was almost an unknown entity, a far cry from what it is on the eve of the T20 World Cup in Australia where the opening contest between India and the hosts is expected to witness sellout crowds.

""Back in my day, we only had male players as inspiration because that's all we used to see on the television. Today a young girl can have a role model in the form of a female cricketer and I think that's the biggest change I have seen,"" Mithali wrote.

She recalled the changes the women's game has seen since she played her first ODI more than 20 years ago.

""The biggest difference is people are now aware of what's going on with their national team. When I broke the world record for the highest individual Test score in 2002, people didn't know about it unless they were going out to buy the newspapers.""

The veteran added, ""We used to travel to different places all over the world to play but barely got any time to acclimatise.

""There was no travel or daily allowance, nor a physio or strength and conditioning trainer to look out for a fitness. We travelled to matches with just our head coach and manager and just didn't have any form of cushioning.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/australia-favourites-but-india-no-pushovers--mithali-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/australia-favourites-but-india-no-pushovers--mithali.html

The Enforcement Directorate told Special Judge Ajay Kumar Kuhar that Letters Rogatory (LRs) have been sent to four countries and their response were awaited in connection with the case.

LR is issued by courts on the request of an investigation agency when it wants information from another country.

The court had on January 28 ""revived"" the Aircel-Maxis cases filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate against Chidambaram and his son that were earlier adjourned 'sine die'.

The case was adjourned 'sine die' -- without fixing any date for hearing -- on September 5 last year with the court noting that the two probe agencies were seeking ""adjournment after adjournment"".

The probe agencies were investigating how Karti Chidambaram received clearance from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) for the Aircel-Maxis deal in 2006 when his father was the Union finance minister.

The CBI and the ED had alleged that P Chidambaram, as finance minister during the United Progressive Alliance rule, granted approval to the deal beyond his capacity benefitting certain persons, and received kickbacks.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/aircel-maxis--delhi-court-grants-time-till-may-4-to-cbi--ed-to-complete-probe-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/aircel-maxis--delhi-court-grants-time-till-may-4-to-cbi--ed-to-complete-probe.html

227,20-2-20,Uphaar tragedy: SC dismisses curative plea by victims; no further jail term for Ansal brothers,"The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed the curative petition filed by an association of the victims of the 1997 Uphaar cinema fire tragedy case, sparing the Ansal brothers further jail term.

A three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde, and justices N V Ramana and Arun Mishra considered the curative plea by the Association for Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (AVUT) in-chamber and dismissed it.

""We have gone through the curative petitions and the relevant documents. In our opinion, no case is made out.... Hence, the curative petition is dismissed,"" the bench said in its order.

On February 9, 2017, the apex court had by a 2:1 majority verdict given relief to 78-year-old Sushil Ansal considering his ""advanced age-related complications"" by awarding him the jail term which he had already served.

It had, however, asked his younger sibling Gopal Ansal to serve the remaining one year jail term in the case.

The AVUT, through its president Neelam Krishnamoorthy, had sought reconsideration of the verdict by filing the curative plea.

The apex court had in August 2015 allowed the Ansals to walk free and asked them to pay a fine of Rs 30 crore each.

On June 13, 1997, halfway through the screening of Hindi film ""Border"", a fire broke out in Uphaar Cinema, situated in Green Park area here.

228,20-2-20,Pant needs to accept that he is going through a rough patch: Rahane,"Rishabh Pant needs to accept that he is going through a rough patch and remain focussed on improving as a cricketer, said India vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane here on Thursday.

The 22-year-old Pant, who till five months ago was India's first choice wicketkeeper-batsman across formats, has lost his spot in limited overs cricket to KL Rahul and red ball place to a much accomplished Wriddhiman Saha.

For Rahane, who too has also endured rough end of the stick as far selection matters go, had a word of advice for his young colleague.

""It's important to accept whatever you are going through. Be positive, try and learn as many things as possible from any of the players. Not saying it has to be senior or junior,"" Rahane said on the eve of the first Test against New Zealand.

Asked how one can internalize rejection or failure, Rahane said introspection becomes key and that starts with acceptance.

""See no one likes to sit outside but whatever your team needs on a particular game, you have got to accept that. I think acceptance is really important talking about that particular individual. Focus on controllables, keeping working hard and improve as a cricketer.""

Rahane, who was dropped from the Test playing XI during the 2018 tour of South Africa, wants Pant to visualise that an opportunity could come his way anytime.

""You should try and focus on what he can control as player and keep visualizing that you will get an opportunity. You know what your role is. For Rishabh, he bats at No 6 or 7, so keep visualising about what if he gets an opportunity and what his role is. Keep it simple,"" said Rahane.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pant-needs-to-accept-that-he-is-going-through-a-rough-patch--rahane-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/pant-needs-to-accept-that-he-is-going-through-a-rough-patch--rahane.html
229,20-2-20,"Ishant, Shaw to play in 1st Test","India captain Virat Kohli on Wednesday dropped enough hints to indicate that seniormost pacer Ishant Sharma and young opener Prithvi Shaw will be in the playing XI for the first Test against New Zealand at Basin Reserve.

If India’s net session on Wednesday is taken into consideration, Wriddhiman Saha is starting as the wicketkeeper ahead of Rishabh Pant for the series opener beginning tomorrow.

Hanuma Vihari, team’s designated No 6 batsman for away Tests, will be the fifth bowling option with Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami and Ishant being three specialist pacers.

Ravichandran Ashwin is in the mix for the lone specialist spinner’s spot though Ravindra Jadeja’s all-round skills can’t be ignored either.

Ishant, who was out for three weeks with ankle injury sustained during the Ranji Trophy game, bowled full tilt at the nets and even earned appreciation for troubling batsmen with his pace and bounce.

“He (Ishant) looked pretty normal and pretty similar to what he was bowling before the ankle injury. He is hitting good areas again and he has played (Test cricket) in New Zealand couple of times, so his experience will be useful to us. It was really good to see him bowling with pace and in good areas,” Kohli said during media interaction.

The skipper also said in as many words that the team wouldn’t like to change Shaw’s natural stroke-play which was a good enough hint that Shubman Gill will have to warm the benches for now.

“Prithvi is a talented player and he has his own game and we want him to follow his instincts and play the way he does. Look, these guys have no baggage and are not desperate to perform in any manner,” the skipper said.

The skipper wants Shaw to take a leaf out of Mayank Agarwal’s performance in Australia back in 2018-19 when he hit back to back half-centuries in Melbourne and Sydney.

“They don’t have any nerves to do well overseas. Like a clear head with which Mayank played in Australia, Prithvi can do the same in New Zealand.

“A bunch of guys playing with fearlessness, something that can motivate the whole team, gives us start that the team wants and not get intimidated by the opposition in any way.”

The skipper downplayed India’s below-par show in the three-match ODI series, especially that of Agarwal.

“Prithvi, I think you can call him relatively inexperienced and Mayank, I wouldn’t call him that inexperienced because he has scored a lot of runs last year. So he understands what his game is like in Test cricket.

“I think sometimes in white ball cricket we try to do too much but once you come into red ball cricket, you fall into that disciplined mode of batting, which obviously suits him much more at this stage.”

While he didn’t give an answer on the Saha-Pant debate, the burly Delhi keeper had precious little to do at the main nets and was seen spending more time doing his keeping drills and only got an opportunity to bat when the first team completed its routines.

New Zealand are likely to go with an all-pace attack but the Indian captain wants to stick to his team’s strengths which is play with one spinner in the four-pronged bowling attack.

“If it had been a Johannesburg pitch, I could have said it’s a possibility (to play four pacers) but our team has that skill that we can bowl out other teams with only three fast bowlers,” he sounded confident.

“But you need one world class skillful spinner, who can take wickets on any pitch. We won’t copy the home team. We would rather figure out what is the most lethal combination, which gives us balance,” he added.

“As a bowling group it’s better than the one that came to NZ last time and that is why we have got so many teams all out in last two and half years. We would like to repeat that here also,” Kohli added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ishant--shaw-to-play-in-1st-test.html
230,20-2-20,Poker majorly is game of skill,"The game of poker is majorly a game of skill which decides the winner says India Poker Championship 2020 winner Rubin Labroo, who won this year’s championship which took place at Big Daddy Casino in Goa last month.

“Technically Poker is a mind game played with a lot of strategies. Obviously, luck is involved but a lot of it can be beaten by your skills and how good you understand how the game is. It’s a very strategically motivated game”, says Ruben who was introduced to the sport during his college days back in 2006.

Talking about the skills involved, he said: “It’s a long term game and the result doesn’t depend on what happens in one game.

“On a given day one might beat me but on the long term you will not be able to do so, that’s the idea of a game. It’s long term strategy you put in volume, numbers and over a period of time. If your math is strong and you are strategically better you will definitely beat the odds.”

“In terms of skills edge, there is a lot of maths involved, selling and buying courses. There’s a lot of studies involved, people study online, live and books written on this and it’s basically a statistical probability game. And also there is a lot of live tells that you can pick up on the table. Different kind of people drop hints via hand movements and this all understanding will come with experience.

The 2020 edition was his second appearance in the IPC and speaking about the experience of playing in it, he said: “I was playing in some other tournament before the IPC and was not in good touch, so I booked my ticket back home and decided to skip the event. But then on my friends’ insistence, I decided to play and I am glad that I stayed back and won the tournament,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/poker-majorly-is-game-of-skill.html
231,20-2-20,Usual suspects need to be wary of lesser opponents,"The Ranji Trophy quarterfinals begin across four venues today with usual suspects such as Saurashtra and Karnataka taking on the lesser teams capable of springing a surprise.

On paper, the most well contested quarterfinals should be between Saurashtra and Andhra in Ongole, Andhra Pradesh as both teams go into the knockouts from the elite cross pool.

Last year’s runners-up Saurashtra are expected to go past Andhra, having shown solid form in the league stage to finish with three wins, four draws and a loss from eight games.

Seasoned pacer Jaydev Unadkat will be expected to fire once again, having taken 51 wickets this season at an average off 11.90, continuing his stellar form from last season. In the batting department, Sheldon Jackson has stepped up in the absence of Cheteswar Pujara and is the leading scorer of the team with 605 runs at an average of 55.

Andhra go into the game after back-to-back losses towards the end of the league stage. However, their rampaging run in the first half of the season, when they were leading the table, helped them advance in the competition. They will rely a lot on in-form medium-pacer K V Sasikanth and batsman Ricky Bhui in the must-win game.

In Jammu, the mighty Karnataka take on the spirited bunch of J&K players.

Karnataka finished third in the elite pool behind Gujarat and Bengal and scripted important wins over Tamil Nadu and Mumbai.

They play Group C toppers J&K, who lost only to Haryana in the league stage. Captain Parvez Rasool has led from the front scoring 403 runs at 44.77 and 25 wickets at 14.56. Another player who has contributed massively to the success of the team is batsman Abdul Samad who has amassed 547 runs.

In Cuttack, a comfortable win is expected from Bengal against Odisha. Their confidence must be sky high following memorable victories over Rajasthan and Punjab in the last two games. They chased down 320 against Rajasthan before beating Punjab in a low-scoring game on a difficult track in Patiala.

Manoj Tiwary has been their go-to batsman and left-arm spinner Shahbah Ahmed their stand out bowler.

At the Sardar Patel in Valsad, hosts Gujarat would be overwhelming favourites against Goa who advanced from plate group having suffered relegation last year.

Gujarat made it to the last eight after topping the elite cross pool with five wins from eight matches and three draws.

Goa will have their hopes pinned on their leading run-scorer Amit Verma (791 runs) and S K Patel (751 runs) and would want them to play another crucial knocks in the marqee clash. But the quarterfinal will be a different ball game as they face a formidable Gujarat attack led by Roosh Kalaria, who has taken 30 wickets so far.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/usual-suspects-need-to-be-wary-of-lesser-opponents.html

While Ashu won a Bronze in in 67kg category, Aditya and Hardeep also bagged the medals of same colour in the 72kg and 97kg respectively on the second day of the competitions.

Ashu beat Syria’s Abdulkarim Mohammad Al-Hasan 8-1 while Kundu defeated Nao Kusaka of Japan 8-0 inside one and a half minutes in a lop-sided 72kg Bronze medal bout at KD Jadhav Hall in Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium.

Later in the evening, Hardeep beat Kyrgyzstan’s Beksultan Makhamad zhanovich Makhmudov 3-1 to register India’s third podium finish of the day.

India has so far five medals in the championships, after Sunil Kumar’s historic Gold in 87kg and Arjun Halakurki’s Bronze in 55kg Greco-Roman category on Tuesday.

Gyanender, however, lost 0-6 in the 60kg Greco-Roman Bronze medal bout. The Gold was won by Kenichiro Fumita of Japan, who beat Kyrgyzstan’s Zholaman Sharshenkov 4-0.

The other Bronze in 60kg was won by Mehdi Seifollah Mohsen Nejad who beat Kazakhstan’s Aidos Sultangali 4-3.

The other Bronze in the 67kg category was won by Iran’s Hossein Nasrollah Assadi Kolmati, who beat Japan’s Tsuchika Shimoyamada 5-3, while the Gold medal went to Korea’s Hansu Ryu, who defeated Uzbekistan’s Makhmud Bakhshilloev 4-1.

In the 72kg category, besides Aditya, Ruslan Tsare of Kyrgyzstan won another Bronze, beating Chinese Taipe’s Yan Kai Chen 8-0. The Gold in this weight division was won by Amin Yavar Kaviyaninejad of Iran with a 8-0 win over Ibragim Magomadoc of Kazakhstan.

Ashu’s victory over Muhammad Alhasan was redemption of the loss that he faced in the semi-final, which he lost against the Uzbek Makhmud Bakhshilloev due to a technical win awarded to the latter.

“It feels great to earn a Bronze medal in my first-ever senior championship. I lost my semi-final bout as I invested a lot of time on attacking, which I worked upon in this bout with more emphasis on defence. I am happy that things panned out as planned,” said an elated Ashu after his win.

On the other hand, this was Aditya’s first Asian Championship and his second ever international tournament.

Aditya who will now focus on his Olympics qualification will aim to reduce his weight to 67kg to be able to compete at the Tokyo Olympics later this year.

235,20-2-20,Ha la land,"Teenage record-breaker Erling Braut Haaland scored twice as Borussia Dortmund sealed a 2-1 win over Paris Saint-Germain, for whom Neymar scored on his return to action, in Tuesday’s Champions League last 16, first leg in Germany.

Forward Haaland took his tally to 11 goals in seven games since Dortmund paid Salzburg 20 million euros ($22 million) for the 19-year-old with second-half goals either side of Neymar’s equaliser.

Having also scored eight times for Salzburg in the group stage, Haaland now has 10 goals in just seven Champions League games this season.

“These are the moments you play football for. I really enjoyed it,” beamed the Norwegian.

His performance left Kylian Mbappe and Neymar in the shade, with the latter struggling to truly make his mark having been kept on the sidelines for the last two weeks ahead of this game due to a rib injury.

However, the Brazilian superstar’s away goal means PSG remain very much in contention to reach the quarter-finals after three consecutive exits in the last 16.

The presence of the world’s most expensive player was a major boost for his team, after he missed last season’s surprise last-16 loss to Manchester United with a foot injury.

He also sat out the second leg of their defeat by Real Madrid at the same stage in 2018.

However, Dortmund deserved the win as PSG’s star-studded attack, with Angel Di Maria supporting Mbappe and Neymar, was repeatedly frustrated by the home side, for whom the midfield duo of Axel Witsel and Emre Can regularly helped snuff out attacks.

There was little to separate the teams in the first half although Dortmund’s English winger Jadon Sancho squandered one chance on the counter-attack and then forced a fine save from Keylor Navas just before the half-hour mark.

After the goalless first half, Dortmund poured forward and kept finding spaces to exploit down the flanks.

Dortmund’s Swiss coach Lucien Favre then brought on Giovanni Reyna, who only turned 17 last November, for his Champions League debut midway through the second half.

Moments later Haaland got the breakthrough when he stabbed past Navas from close range after Thiago Silva had blocked a Raphael Guerreiro shot.

The game had now come to life, and with their German coach Thomas Tuchel frantically urging them on, PSG drew level six minutes later when Mbappe unpicked the Dortmund defence and presented Neymar with a straightforward finish.

However, the scene was set for Haaland to continue his phenomenal scoring run with a stunning finish from the edge of the area following a Reyna pass.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ha-la-land.html
236,20-2-20,SC to consider hearing plea against bail granted to Chinmayanand,"The Supreme Court Thursday said it would consider hearing next week a plea against the bail granted to former BJP lawmaker Swami Chinmayanand by the Allahabad High Court in a rape case.

A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde was told by senior advocate Colin Gonsalves that the plea challenged the Allahabad HC order granting bail to Chinmayanand earlier this month.

The bench said it may consider listing the plea of the victim next week.

Chinmayanand, whose trust runs the Shahjahanpur law college where the woman who has alleged rape by him studied, was arrested on September 20 last year.

The apex court had stepped in after the 23-year-old law student went missing for a few days in August last year after posting a video clip on social media, alleging sexual abuse.

A special investigation team of the Uttar Pradesh Police, formed on the directions of the apex court, arrested Chinmayanand.

The Allahabad High Court had on February 3 granted bail to him.

The SIT had also arrested the student after a complaint that she and her friends had allegedly tried to extort Rs 5 crore from Chinmayanand, threatening to make public videos showing her giving massages to the former minister.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-to-consider-hearing-plea-against-bail-granted-to-chinmayanand-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sc-to-consider-hearing-plea-against-bail-granted-to-chinmayanand.html

Ahead of his India visit on February 24-25, Trump said that India has not treated his country ""very well"" on the trade front and indicated that a ""very big"" bilateral deal with New Delhi may not be signed before the American presidential election in November.

Asked about the US President's comments, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said it is important to understand the context in which the remarks were made.

The context was balance of trade and efforts have been made to address concerns, he said.

India is eagerly awaiting President Trump's visit and it will strengthen the bilateral global strategic ties, Kumar said.

On how many agreements will be signed during Trump's India visit, Kumar said around five MoUs were under discussion.

Asked whether the issues relating to H1B visa will figure in Modi-Trump talks, Kumar said they could come up.

On the issue of eight Indians testing positive for the novel coronavirus on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship near Tokyo, Kumar said, ""We are in touch with Japanese authorities.""

He also asserted that there is no ban on travel to or from China in view of the coronavirus outbreak.

Asked about China's objection to Home Minister Amit Shah's visit to Arunachal Pradesh, Kumar said India's consistent position has been that the state is its integral and inalienable part.

""Our position on Arunachal Pradesh is clear and consistent. Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India. Indian leaders routinely travel to the state of Arunachal Pradesh as they do to any other state of India. Objecting to the visit of Indian leaders to a state of India does not stand to reason and understanding of the Indian people,"" spokesperson of Ministry of External Affairs Raveesh Kumar said at a press briefing here.

Even as it is bogged down by the coronavirus epidemic, China on Thursday reopened a hostile front with India as Beijing ""firmly opposed"" Shah's visit to Arunachal Pradesh on its statehood day and warned India against ""complicating"" the border issue.

Arunachal Pradesh became a full state from a Union Territory, 34 years ago on February 20. The region was part of British India in 1913-14 and formally included when the McMohan Line was established as the border between India and Tibet in 1938.

Disputing India's sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told the media in Beijing that ""The Chinese government has never recognised the so-called 'Arunachal Pradesh' and is firmly opposed to Shah's visit.""

China considers Arunachal Pradesh a part of southern Tibet region which it occupied in 1951. Geng said, ""China's position on the eastern sector of the India-China, or the southern part of China's Tibet region, is consistent and clear.""

Geng said the visit ""violated China's territorial sovereignty, undermined the stability of the border area, sabotaged political mutual trust, and violated relevant bilateral agreement.""

He asked New Delhi not to take any actions which can ""further complicate the border issue"".

""The Chinese side urges the Indian side to take concrete actions to uphold peace and tranquillity of the border area,"" Geng said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-hits-back-at-china-over-shah-s-arunachal-visit-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/india-hits-back-at-china-over-shah-s-arunachal-visit.html

In his interaction with reporters, he said: ""We have had a very good discussion this afternoon. I think if my memory serves me right, this is the fifth time in the last six months we are meeting, in New York, in Paris, in India, in Munich and now out here"".

Speaking about the Munich Security Conference earlier in the week, Jaishankar said it was the first time that an Indian foreign minister participated.

""Today we had an opportunity really to sit down and review our bilateral relations, regional issues, global issues.

""And apart from the meeting today, yesterday I also had a meeting with the Minister of Defence, Kramp-Karrenbauer, and with the minister of the Economy and Energy Minister Altmaier and a lot of these discussions are about taking forward our strategic partnership and building on the discussions which our Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) and (German) Chancellor (Angela) Merkel had at the fifth India-Germany intergovernmental consultations in India last year,"" he said.

253,20-2-20,People eating big breakfast meals may burn twice as many calories: Study,"Eating a big breakfast rather than a large dinner may prevent obesity and high blood sugar, according to study which may lead to better clinical dietary recommendations to reduce body weight and prevent metabolic diseases.

The study, published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, assessed 16 men who consumed a low-calorie breakfast and high-calorie dinner -- and vice versa in a second round -- over the course of three days.

""Our results show that a meal eaten for breakfast, regardless of the amount of calories it contains, creates twice as high diet-induced thermogenesis as the same meal consumed for dinner,"" said the study's corresponding author, Juliane Richter from the University of Lubeck in Germany.

""This finding is significant for all people as it underlines the value of eating enough at breakfast,"" Richter said.

According to the researchers, the human body expends energy when it digests food for the absorption, digestion, transport, and storage of nutrients -- a process, known as diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT).

They said DIT is a measure of how well our metabolism is working, and can differ depending on mealtime.

In the study, they found that identical calorie consumption led to 2.5 times higher DIT in the morning than in the evening after high-calorie and low-calorie meals.

The food-induced increase of blood sugar and insulin concentrations was diminished after breakfast compared with dinner, the scientists said.

Eating a low-calorie breakfast increased appetite, specifically for sweets, they added.

""We recommend that patients with obesity as well as healthy people eat a large breakfast rather than a large dinner to reduce body weight and prevent metabolic diseases,"" Richter said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/people-eating-big-breakfast-meals-may-burn-twice-as-many-calories--study-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/people-eating-big-breakfast-meals-may-burn-twice-as-many-calories--study.html
254,20-2-20,"Death toll in China's coronavirus climbs to 2,118; Confirmed cases on decline","The death toll from the coronavirus epidemic in China has climbed to 2,118 with the death of 114 more people, while the overall confirmed cases increased to 74,576, Chinese officials said on Thursday.

China's National Health Commission (NHC) said the new confirmed cases declined to 394, registering the biggest drop since December when the first case was reported in Wuhan city in the central Hubei Province.

The NHC said on Thursday that it received reports of 114 deaths on Wednesday from 31 provincial-level regions. The overall confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland reached 74,576 and 2,118 people died of the deadly disease.

The commission added that 4,922 people were still suspected of being infected with the virus.

Among the deaths, 108 were in Hubei Province, the epicentre of the virus and one each from Hebei, Shanghai, Fujian, Shandong, Yunnan and Shaanxi, it said.

The worst-hit Hubei Province and its provincial capital Wuhan which were the ground zero of the virus reported 349 new confirmed cases and 108 new deaths on Wednesday.

The latest report brought the total confirmed cases in the Hubei province to 62,031, the NHC said.

It said, China's daily new confirmed cases of the virus also known as COVID-19 outside Hubei province have dropped for 16 consecutive days indicating that the epidemic is largely confined to Hubei province and Wuhan city.

A total of 45 new confirmed cases were reported on Wednesday outside Hubei, down from 890 on February 3, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

In Hubei too the cases are coming down, it said.

Significantly, China's daily number of newly cured and discharged novel coronavirus patients has surpassed that of new confirmed infections for a second consecutive day, the NHC said.

On Wednesday, 1,779 people were discharged from the hospitals after recovery, much higher than the number of the same day's new confirmed infections, which stands at 394, it said.

So far, a total of 16,155 patients infected with the novel coronavirus have been discharged from the hospitals after recovery by the end of Wednesday, it said.

In Hong Kong, 65 confirmed cases, including two deaths have been reported by the end of Wednesday. Macau reported 10 confirmed cases followed by 24 in Taiwan, including one death.

Also over 100 cities in China have adopted QR codes to facilitate the control of the novel coronavirus and work resumption, fintech firm Ant Financial said on Wednesday.

The QR codes, produced with the mobile app Alipay, are based on the users' movements over the previous two weeks and tell whether users have been to virus-hit areas.

Instead of filling in health report forms, residents can now show the QR codes at community or expressway checkpoints. Thus, no-contact checks can be carried out to reduce virus transmission risks.

According to Ant Financial, all cities in the provinces of Zhejiang, Sichuan and Hainan have adopted health QR codes, with 15 million people registered for the QR codes in Zhejiang alone.

Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province, adopted the QR codes on February 11.

The QR codes show how the Internet is being used in China's fight against the epidemic, and provide strong support for prevention and control of the epidemic and work resumption, Pan Helin, an expert in economics at Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, Xinhua reported.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/death-toll-in-china-s-coronavirus-climbs-to-2-118--confirmed-cases-on-decline-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/death-toll-in-china-s-coronavirus-climbs-to-2-118--confirmed-cases-on-decline.html
255,20-2-20,US condemns expulsion of WSJ journalists by China,"The US on Wednesday condemned China's decision expelling three Wall Street Journal correspondents, saying mature and responsible countries understand that a free press reports facts and expresses opinion.

The move is seen by many as a retaliation by Beijing after the Trump administration designated five Chinese state-run media organisations as foreign missions.

The Chinese media outlets designated as foreign agents are Xinhua News Agency; China Global Television Network which falls under China Central Television, CCTV; China Radio International; China Daily Distribution Corporation; and Hai Tian Development USA, which is the distributor for the People's Daily in the United States.

Hours later, China announced the expulsion of three correspondents of The Wall Street Journal.

""The United States condemns China's expulsion of three Wall Street Journal foreign correspondents. Mature, responsible countries understand that a free press reports facts and expresses opinions,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.

Pompeo said that the correct response is to present counter arguments, not restrict speech.

""The United States hopes that the Chinese people will enjoy the same access to accurate information and freedom of speech that Americans enjoy,"" he said.

Defending its decision to designate five Chinese state media as foreign agents, a senior State Department official told reporters that the Chinese Communist Party has always had a pretty tight rein on media in general and state-run media in particular, but that has only further tightened since President Xi Jinping came to power.

Since he became the general secretary, China's Communist Party has reorganised China's state news agencies and asserted even more direct control over them, both in terms of content, editorial among others.

""Xi Jinping's got a number of quotes on this score that are – there's many of them. One of them is that, 'Managing China's media messaging is crucial for the future and fate of the Chinese Communist Party and the state'. There are many others of a similar ilk that demonstrate exactly how much of a function of the state Xi Jinping considers the media to be,"" the official said.

In addition to the very clear state control of these media organizations, the Chinese government has also expanded its overseas media operations in recent years, including here in the United States, the official added.

Xinhua, the official said, is an institution directly reporting to China's State Council, which is the chief administrative authority of the Chinese Government. China Global Television Network is part of the China Media Group, which is a media company run by the PRC (Peoples Republic of China) Government, the official said who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The same goes for China Radio International; that's also part of the China Media Group. China Daily Distribution Corporation acts on behalf of the China Daily, which is an English-language daily newspaper owned by the Publicity Department of the CCP. And Hai Tian Development USA acts on behalf of the People's Daily, which is the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the official said.

The Senior State Department official reiterated that each one of these entities meets the definition of foreign mission under the Foreign Mission Act, which is to say they are either substantially owned or effectively controlled by a foreign government.

""And that's why we have now determined that we will be treating them as foreign missions,” the official added.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-condemns-expulsion-of-wsj-journalists-by-china-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/us-condemns-expulsion-of-wsj-journalists-by-china.html
256,20-2-20,Two former Japan cruise ship passengers die: media,"Two former passengers of the coronavirus-wracked Diamond Princess have died, local media reported Thursday, as fears mount about those who have left the ship after testing negative for the virus.

A man and a woman in their 80s who had been infected have died, public broadcaster NHK and others reported, which would be the first fatal cases among the more than 600 on board the cruise ship.

Both had underlying conditions and had been taken off the ship on February 11 and 12 before being treated in hospital, NHK said.

The huge vessel moored in Yokohama near Tokyo is easily the biggest coronavirus cluster outside the Chinese epicentre, with 621 positive cases confirmed among the passengers and crew.

On Wednesday, 443 passengers disembarked from the ship after testing negative for the COVID-19 virus and not showing symptoms during a 14-day quarantine period. The complete removal of the passengers was expected to take at least three days.

More passengers left the ship on Thursday, packing into yellow buses and leaving for stations and airports for home.

But questions are increasingly being asked as to the wisdom of allowing former Diamond Princess passengers to roam freely around Japan's famously crowded cities, even if they have tested negative.

""Is it really safe to get off?"" screamed a headline in the Nikkan Sports tabloid. The paper quoted a passenger who said he was tested on February 15 and left four days later.

""I thought I could be infected during the four days. I thought 'Is it really ok'?"" The Diamond Princess was placed into quarantine on February 5 when a passenger who left in Hong Kong was found infected with the virus.

Passengers were confined to cabins except for brief trips on deck wearing masks and gloves, when they were told to keep their distance from others.

But a specialist in infectious diseases at Kobe University rocked the boat with a video slamming ""completely chaotic"" quarantine procedures onboard, in rare criticism from a Japanese official.

""The cruise ship was completely inadequate in terms of infection control,"" said Kentaro Iwata in videos he has since deleted, saying ""there is no need to discuss this further"".

The videos had been viewed more than a million times in Japanese and hundreds of thousands of times in English.

Japan's health ministry lashed out in defence, saying it had conducted ""consultations on appropriate infection control in the ship"" with experts and taken a range of measures.

It also released a video showing passengers how to wash and disinfect their hands properly and had ""proper hygiene management"" for medical workers entering and coming off the ship.

In addition, risky and safe areas were strictly divided and there was a station installed for safely removing contaminated gear, the ministry said.

""We've been doing our best in the circumstances,"" Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told MPs on Thursday morning.

""I want you to understand that not only our officials at the health ministry but also Self-Defense Forces officials and medical officials are working desperately hard,"" he added.

Iwata, who spent several hours on the ship, had alleged: ""There was no distinction between the green zone, which is free of infection, and the red zone, which is potentially contaminated by the virus."" He said he was so concerned at what he saw on the ship during a brief visit on Tuesday that he has placed himself in a 14-day quarantine to avoid infecting his family.

""I was in Africa dealing with the Ebola outbreak. I was in other countries dealing with the cholera outbreak. I was in China in 2003 to deal with SARS... I never had a fear of getting infection myself,"" he said in the video in English and Japanese.

""But inside Diamond Princess, I was so scared... Because there was no way to tell where the virus is."" Several countries have evacuated their citizens from the ship and insisted they endure a further 14-day quarantine when they arrive on home soil.

Outside the Diamond Princess, Japan has seen 84 cases.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/two-former-japan-cruise-ship-passengers-die--media-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/two-former-japan-cruise-ship-passengers-die--media.html
257,20-2-20,9 killed in suspected far-right attack in Germany,"A 43-year-old German man shot and killed nine people at several locations in a Frankfurt suburb overnight in attacks that appear to have been motivated by far-right beliefs, officials said Thursday.

The gunman first attacked a hookah bar in central Hanau at about 10 p.M. Wednesday, killing several people before heading about 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) west and opening fire again, claiming more victims.

Witnesses and surveillance videos of the suspect's getaway car led authorities quickly to his home, near the scene of the second attack, where he was found dead near his 72-year-old mother, said Peter Beuth, the interior minister for the state of Hesse.

A website believed to be the suspect's is being evaluated, Beuth said.

“Initial analysis of the webpage of the suspect indicate a xenophobic motivation,” he said.

He said federal prosecutors have taken over the investigation of the crime and are treating it as an act of domestic terrorism.

“This is an attack on our free and peaceful society,"" he said.

Some of the victims are believed to be Turkish, and Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the consulate in Frankfurt and the embassy in Berlin were trying to obtain information on the attack.

“According to the initial information, it was an attack with a racist motive, but we would need to wait for the (official) statement,” he told state television TRT.

German news agency dpa reported that police are examining a video the suspect may have posted online several days earlier in which he details a conspiracy theory about child abuse in the United States. The authenticity of the video couldn't immediately be verified.

On a website registered by someone with the same name as the man in the video, Tobias R., the owner says he was born in Hanau in 1977 and grew up in the city, later training with a bank and completing a business degree in 2007.

The attack comes amid growing concerns about far-right violence in Germany.

Chancellor Angela Merkel called off a planned visit Thursday to a university in Halle.

Her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said she was ""being constantly kept abreast of the state of the investigations in Hanau."" Halle was the site of a deadly anti-Semitic attack last year. A man expressing anti-Jewish views tried to shoot his way into a synagogue, failed and killed two passers-by before being arrested.

The shooting in Halle came months after the killing of a regional politician from Merkel's party. The suspect had a long history of neo-Nazi activity and convictions for violent crime.

“Thoughts this morning are with the people of Hanau, in whose midst this terrible crime was committed,” Seibert said on Twitter.

“Deep sympathy for the affected families, who are grieving for their dead. We hope with those wounded that they will soon recover.” In addition to those killed, Beuth said one person was seriously wounded and multiple other people suffered less serious injuries.

Police officers swarmed central Hanau, cordoning off the area of one of the shootings as a helicopter hovered overhead. A car covered in thermal foil also could be seen, with shattered glass next to it. Forensic experts in white overalls collected evidence.

Hookah lounges are places where people gather to smoke flavored tobacco from Middle Eastern water pipes.

""This was a terrible evening that will certainly occupy us for a long, long time and we will remember with sadness,"" Hanau Mayor Claus Kaminsky told the Bild newspaper. Lawmaker Katja Leikert, a member of Merkel's center-right party who represents Hanau in the German parliament, tweeted that it was “a real horror scenario for us all.” Hanau is about 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of Frankfurt. It has about 100,000 inhabitants and is in Hesse state.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/police-say-8-killed-in-shootings-in-the-german-city-of-hanau-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/9-killed-in-suspected-far-right-attack-in-germany.html
258,20-2-20,"India ranks 77th on sustainability, 131st in child flourishing index rankings: UN report","India ranked 77th on a sustainability index that takes into account per capita carbon emissions and ability of children in a nation to live healthy lives and secures 131st spot on a flourishing ranking that measures the best chance at survival and well-being for children, according to a UN-backed report.

The report was released on Wednesday by a commission of over 40 child and adolescent health experts from around the world. It was commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO), UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and The Lancet medical journal.

In the report assessing the capacity of 180 countries to ensure that their youngsters can survive and thrive, India ranks 77th on the Sustainability Index and 131 on the Flourishing Index, it said.

Flourishing is the geometric mean of Surviving and Thriving. For Surviving, the authors selected maternal survival, survival in children younger than 5 years old, suicide, access to maternal and child health services, basic hygiene and sanitation, and lack of extreme poverty.

For Thriving, the domains were educational achievement, growth and nutrition, reproductive freedom, and protection from violence.

Under the Sustainability Index, the authors noted that promoting today's national conditions for children to survive and thrive must not come at the cost of eroding future global conditions for children's ability to flourish.

The Sustainability Index ranks countries on excess carbon emissions compared with the 2030 target. This provides a convenient and available proxy for a country's contribution to sustainability in future.

The report noted that under realistic assumptions about possible trajectories towards sustainable greenhouse gas emissions, models predict that global carbon emissions need to be reduced from 39·7 giga­ tonnes to 22·8 gigatonnes per year by 2030 to maintain even a 66 per cent chance of keeping global warming below 1·5°C.

It said that the world's survival depended on children being able to flourish, but no country is doing enough to give them a sustainable future.

""No country in the world is currently providing the conditions we need to support every child to grow up and have a healthy future,"" said Anthony Costello, Professor of Global Health and Sustainability at University College London, one of the lead authors of the report.

""Especially, they're under immediate threat from climate change and from commercial marketing, which has grown hugely in the last decade,"" said Costello – former WHO Director of Mother, Child and Adolescent health.

Norway leads the table for survival, health, education and nutrition rates - followed by South Korea and the Netherlands. Central African Republic, Chad and Somalia come at the bottom.

However, when taking into account per capita CO2 emissions, these top countries trail behind, with Norway 156th, the Republic of Korea 166th and the Netherlands 160th.

Each of the three emits 210 per cent more CO2 per capita than their 2030 target, the data shows, while the US, Australia, and Saudi Arabia are among the 10 worst emitters. The lowest emitters are Burundi, Chad and Somalia.

According to the report, the only countries on track to beat CO2 emission per capita targets by 2030, while also performing fairly – within the top 70 – on child flourishing measures are: Albania, Armenia, Grenada, Jordan, Moldova, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, Uruguay and Vietnam.

""More than 2 billion people live in countries where development is hampered by humanitarian crises, conflicts, and natural disasters, problems increasingly linked with climate change,"" said Minister Awa Coll-Seck from Senegal, Co-Chair of the commission.

The report also highlights the distinct threat posed to children from harmful marketing.

Evidence suggests that children in some countries see as many as 30,000 advertisements on television alone in a single year, while youth exposure to vaping (e-cigarettes) advertisements increased by more than 250 per cent in the US over two years, reaching more than 24 million young people.

Studies in Australia, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and the US – among many others – have shown that self-regulation has not hampered commercial ability to advertise to children.

Children's exposure to commercial marketing of junk food and sugary beverages is associated with purchase of unhealthy foods and overweight and obesity, linking predatory marketing to the alarming rise in childhood obesity, it said.

The number of obese children and adolescents increased from 11 million in 1975 to 124 million in 2016 – an 11-fold increase, with dire individual and societal costs, the report said.

To protect children, the authors call for a new global movement driven by and for children.

Specific recommendations include stopping CO2 emissions with the utmost urgency, to ensure children have a future on this planet; placing children and adolescents at the centre of global efforts to achieve sustainable development, the report said.

New policies and investment in all sectors to work towards child health and rights; incorporating children's voices into policy decisions and tightening national regulation of harmful commercial marketing, supported by a new Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, it said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-ranks-77th-on-sustainability--131st-in-child-flourishing-index-rankings--un-report-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/india-ranks-77th-on-sustainability--131st-in-child-flourishing-index-rankings--un-report.html
259,20-2-20,Sheena Bora case: CBI opposes Indrani''s bail plea,"The CBI on Thursday opposed the Bail plea of Indrani Mukerjea, the prime accused in the Sheena Bora murder case, saying that the court cannot look into the ""credibility or reliability"" of the witnesses at this stage.

Indrani had moved the bail plea last month, claiming that the prosecution's case was ""inconsistent"" and witnesses (examined so for) were not ""reliable"".

Countering her claims, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) informed special judge J C Jagdale that the court can ""only see if there is reasonable ground"" while deciding her bail plea.

""It cannot look into the credibility or reliability of the case. At this stage, if the court considers that a witness is not reliable then the entire case would be vitiated,"" special public prosecutor Manoj Chaladan said.

Indrani has also sought bail on the grounds of parity, as another accused Peter Mukerjea was granted the same by the high court.

The investigating agency submitted to the court that Indrani's role in the crime is different from that of Peter Mukherjea's.

It is to be noted that Peter Mukerjea is still in jail, as the high court stayed the bail order for six weeks.

This is Indrani's fifth attempt at getting bail.

Sheena (24) was allegedly strangled to death by her mother Indrani, the accused's former husband Sanjeev Khanna and driver Shyamvar Rai in April 2012. Peter Mukerjea is accused of being part of the conspiracy.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sheena-bora-case--cbi-opposes-indrani--s-bail-plea-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sheena-bora-case--cbi-opposes-indrani--s-bail-plea.html
260,20-2-20,"Vajpayee, Advani were unhappy over filing of match-fixing case: Delhi Police ex-chief","The then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Home Minister L.K. Advani were unhappy over registration of cricket match-fixing case in 2000 against then South African team captain Hansie Cronje and others but it was Cronje's confession that pacified them, former Delhi Police Commissioner Ajay Raj Sharma has revealed.

In his book ""Biting the Bullet - Memories of a Police Officer"" released on Thursday, Sharma highlighted how the confession of Cronje before journalist was a big relief to him. He said that when the registration of FIR was done, ""the Home Minister at the time was out of Delhi and so was the Prime Minister"".

""When the Prime Minister returned, the High Commissioner of South Africa showed her great resentment and protested that a case had been registered against the Captain and some of the other members of South African team, who were celebrities and had a great fan following in South Africa,"" he writes.

He then said that it was disturbing for the Prime Minister who, in turn, spoke to the Home Minister and expressed his displeasure about the decision of the Delhi Police to register a case.

Sharma said he and the then Lt Governor were summoned. ""The Home Minister summoned the Lieutenant Governor and me to his office the next day. On the way, something fortuitous happened. A South African journalist called me to ask about my reaction to the confession made by Hansie Cronje hardly an hour ago!""

He said that the journalist told him that Cronje has confessed that he and some of his teammates had cheated and indulged in the match fixing for monetary gains.

Sharma then narrates about what happened at Home Minister's office. ""When the Home Minister asked me why a criminal case was registered against members of the South African team, I requested him to allow me to switch on the television in his office. As soon I switched on the TV, the Home Minister witnessed the Hansie Cronje kneeling before a priest and making confession.""

A ""relieved"" Sharma explained that he thereafter was not asked anything.

But he said that had the biggest challenge to interrogate the accused in the case, but could not do so due to which the entire probe was stuck.

The probe into cricket match fixing came to standstill after efforts to interrogate alleged bookie Sanjeev Chawla, Cronje and others remained unsuccessful, Sharma said.

""Efforts made via the Foreign Ministry and through the Interpol were not successful. Without being able to interrogate the key players, the Delhi Police investigation could not progress further. A non-bailable warrant issued against Sanjeev Chawla by the court was sent to the UK for execution through Interpol which also issued a red corner notice against him,"" Sharma said.

He explains that no reply of letter rogatory sent to the UK and South Africa was received during his remaining tenure as Commissioner of Police.

The case was registered in April 2000 and it was only last week in February 2020, Delhi police managed to extradite key accused Chawla from the UK.

261,20-2-20,Shaheen Bagh sticks to its guns,"Protesters refuse to lift blockade until CAA goes; mediation to continue

Supreme Court-appointed interlocutors advocates Sanjay Hegde and Sadhana Ramachandran visited the Shaheen Bagh protest site on Wednesday and held talks with the protesters for almost three hours but could not persuade them to shift from the spot. Ex-CIC Wajahat Habibullah, asked to assist the interlocutors, later visited the site.

Refusing to budge from the their earlier stand of continuing their sit-in until the CAA is scrapped and NPR and NRC process stopped, protesters told the interlocutors that hey are open to further talks. Hegde and Ramachandran said they will visit the protest site again on Thursday to resume the dialogue with the protesters.

Protesters have blocked an important arterial road connecting Delhi and Noida since December 15 last year, causing trouble to commuters and schoolchildren.

First, Hegde explained in detail the SC order to the protesters, who had turned up in large number. It was translated into Hindi by Ramachandran. Later addressing protesters, Ramachandran said, “The SC has upheld your right to protest but then other citizens also have their rights and it should also be maintained. We want to find a solution to the problem. We will listen to everyone.”

During the talks, women, young and old, tried to explain their point of view to the interlocutors. There were tears and defiance too as they poured their hearts out to the two interlocutors on Wednesday, the first attempt to reach out to those sitting in protest against the citizenship amendment legislation for more than two months.

Responding to the concerns raised by the women, Ramachandran said all the points will be put forward before the SC and discussed in detail. “However, I want to say one thing. A country that has daughters like you can never face any threats,” she said.

A woman broke down while talking to the mediators. She said they are protesting to save the Constitution but people see only the inconvenience of commuters who have the option of taking so many other roads. “Aren’t we facing inconvenience sitting here in cold nights taking our children to the protest. We are ourselves so troubled, what trouble will we cause to citizens?” she said

She scotched the allegations that they are not letting ambulances and vehicles pass. “The road hasn’t been blocked by us. In fact, it is the Centre that has blocked freedom in this country,” she added.

Bilkis, an elderly woman, said they wouldn’t move an inch even if someone fires a bullet. She said the main tent where the podium has been erected covers only 100 to 150 metres of the road.

She claimed, “We have not blocked the whole stretch. It is the Delhi Police which barricaded the whole road in the name of security. Why don’t you get that removed first? We never asked police or any authority to block the roads for us. It is they who did it and are now blaming us.”

“We are being called traitors. When we pushed Britishers out of the country, who is Narendra Modi and Amit Shah? You remove NRC and CAA, we will clear the site in no time,” she added.

Another woman described their ongoing protest as mental trauma. She said they jump up even at the slightest noise at night, fearing police action.

On Monday, the SC observed that the blockade of the road at Shaheen Bagh was troubling and suggested the protesters go to another site where no public place would be blocked. It, however, upheld their right to protest.

The SC asked Hegde to play a constructive role as an interlocutor to persuade the protesters to move to an alternative site.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shaheen-bagh-sticks-to-its-guns-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/shaheen-bagh-sticks-to-its-guns.html
262,20-2-20,Mahant Nritya Das picked as Ram Mandir trust prez,"Modi’s ex-aide Nripendra Misra heads construction committee of trust

Mahant Nritya Gopal Das was elected president and VHP leader Champat Rai general secretary of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirth Kshetra Trust at its first meeting here on Wednesday.

The meeting, held at the residence of senior lawyer K Parasaran, also elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s former principal secretary Nripendra Misra as the head of the temple construction committee of the trust.

The meeting was aimed at working out modalities to speed up the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. It was also decided to open an account in Ayodhya’s State Bank of India branch for donations for the Ram temple construction, Champat Rai told reporters after the meeting.

Swami Govind Dev Giri of Pune was appointed as treasurer of the trust.

Among those present at the meeting were the Central Government representative, Additional Secretary in Home Ministry Gyanesh Kumar, UP Government’s representative Avinash Awasthy and Ayodhya District Magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha.

After the Supreme Court verdict, Modi had announced the formation of the 15-member trust in Parliament on February 5. The Trust has seven members, five nominated members and three trustees.

Senior lawyer Parasaran was named as the head of the trust and its other members include Jagatguru Shankracharya, Jyothishpeethadheeshwar Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati Ji Maharaj from Allahabad, Jagatguru Madhavacharya Swami Vishwa Prasannatheerth Ji Maharaj, Pejawar Math in Udupi, Yugpurush Paramanand Ji Maharaj from Haridwar, Swami Govinddev Giri Ji Maharaj from Pune and Vimlendra Mohan Pratap Mishra from Ayodhya.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mahant-nritya-das-picked-as-ram-mandir-trust-prez-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/mahant-nritya-das-picked-as-ram-mandir-trust-prez.html
263,20-2-20,Trump relishes prospect of 70L welcoming his Ahmedabad rally,"POTUS for ‘big deal’, but raises concern ‘India not treating US’ well in trade

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump will hold extensive talks here on February 25 on a whole range of bilateral issues, including defence and trade. Trump is scheduled to arrive in India on a two-day visit starting February 24. While looking forward to his visit, Trump said he is saving the “big deal” in trade for later and voiced concerned over “India not treating US” well in trade.

Explaining the contours of the high-profile visit, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shrigla said on Wednesday Modi and Trump will hold talks to deepen cooperation in a range of key sectors, including defence and trade.

The US President will be accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump and a high-level delegation, he said, adding India and the US have an unprecedented level of convergence.

Though Trump is not happy with the bilateral trade ties, he praised Modi and said he is looking forward to his visit to India. “I happen to like Prime Minister Modi a lot,” Trump said.

“He (Modi) told me we’ll have seven million people between the airport and the event. And the stadium, I understand, is sort of semi under construction, but it’s going to be the largest stadium in the world. So it’s going to be very exciting... I hope you all enjoy it,” he told reporters in Washington on Tuesday. He was referring to a scheduled joint public rally with Modi at the newly-built Motera Stadium in Ahmedabad.

Shringla said the ‘Namaste Trump’ event in Ahmedabad on February 24 will be similar to the ‘Howdy Modi’ event that was held in Houston last year. The couple will visit Agra later the same day.

Meanwhile, Trump said he is “saving the big deal” with India for later and does not know if it will be signed before the presidential election in November, signalling that a bilateral trade pact may not materialise during his maiden visit to New Delhi.

Trump, forcefully pursuing his ‘America first” policy, has previously described India as a “tariff king” for imposing “tremendously high” tariffs on American products, also expressed dissatisfaction over the US-India trade ties. “Well, we can have a trade deal with India, but I’m really saving the big deal for later on,” Trump told reporters at the Joint Base Andrews outside Washington on Tuesday when asked whether he expects a trade deal with India before the visit.

During his interaction with journalists, Trump once again voiced his concern over US-India trade relations. “We’re not treated very well by India,” the US president said. The US and India could sign a “trade package” during Trump’s visit, according to media reports.

US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, the point-person for trade negotiations with India, may not accompany Trump to India, sources said. However, officials have not ruled it out altogether.

Multiple rounds of talks have taken place between Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and Lighthizer in the past few weeks over telephone. India is demanding exemption from high duties imposed by the US on certain steel and aluminium products, resumption of export benefits to certain domestic products under their Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), greater market access for its products from sectors including agriculture, automobile, auto components and engineering.

On the other hand, the US wants greater market access for its farm and manufacturing products, dairy items and medical devices, and cut on import duties on some ICT products. The US has also raised concerns over high trade deficit with India which was USD 16.9 billion in 2018-19.

In New Delhi, sources said India and US do not want to rush in finalising a trade deal and both sides will take a decision on it considering a long-term view.

They also said some defence deals may fructify during Trump’s visit.

Listing out the schedule in New Delhi, Shringla said Modi will host a lunch for Trump, while President Ram Nath Kovind will host a banquet in honour of the visiting dignitary.

Underlining the importance of the visit, Shringla said this will be Trump’s 5th meeting with Modi in eight months (after Osaka, Biarritz, Houston, New York) --- reflecting the renewed intensity of high-level bilateral engagement since the NDA Government returned to power.

He said relationship with the US has evolved to one of our most consequential relationships today. It is a strategic partnership based on shared values and geared towards the 21st century. Both the countries have unprecedented convergence of interests in countering terrorism or in ensuring a peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific.

As regards defence ties, the Foreign Secretary said India has procured over US$18 billion worth of defence items from the US, enhancing our defence preparedness significantly. “We conduct more bilateral exercises with each other than we do with any other country,” he added.

The US is India’s largest trading partner in goods and services combined, and the overall bilateral trade increased by over 10 per cent per annum over the past two years to reach US$ 142 billion in 2018; it is expected to cross US$ 150 billion for the first time this year. It is now also our 6th largest source of crude oil imports, with hydrocarbon imports rising to US$ 7 billion in the last two years, he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-relishes-prospect-of-70l-welcoming-his-ahmedabad-rally-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/trump-relishes-prospect-of-70l-welcoming-his-ahmedabad-rally.html
264,20-2-20,CCS OK’s $2.6 bn deal for 24 US naval copters,"Ahead of US President Donald Trump’s maiden visit to India, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday approved a $2.6-billion deal for buying 24 multi-role Naval helicopters. The deal is likely to be announced during Trump’s visit to India.

The helicopters manufactured by Lockheed Martin will be procured through the Foreign Military Sale (FMS) wherein the US Government will stand guarantee for all issues, including meeting time lines, spare parts and other contractual obligations. Incidentally, India and US defence trade has crossed the $18 billion mark in the last few years.

The 24 MH-60R Seahawks will replace the ageing Seaking and Kamov helicopters flown by the Indian Navy. The approval for buying new helicopters was given by Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) in 2018. At present, the Navy has 12 British made Seakings and ten odd Russian manufactured Kamovs.

These fourth-generation MH-60Rs “Romeos” helicopters will come loaded with both torpedoes and missiles which can be used to target submarines. A 30 per cent offset clause could be a part of the deal. The deal could include training, support, spares and air-to-ground weapons also.

From the day of signing the contract, these helicopters will be delivered in five years. India will pay an initial 15 per cent installment for the helicopters. The first lot of helicopters will be delivered in two years, sources said.

MH-60 was earlier selected through a competitive process for 16 helicopters with an optional clause for eight more, but the deal fell through due to pricing issues and other development leading to tender’s cancellation.

A tender for 24 MH-60 helicopters was floated again later and processed through the FMS route of the US Government.

India desperately needed the advanced helicopters to guard the strategically important Indian Ocean region where the Chinese maritime prowess is growing over the years with its submarines also posing a threat.

Another deal close to conclusion is of six additional AH-64E Apache attack helicopters for the Army to cost around $930 million. The IAF has already bought 22 Apache helicopters.

As regards the anti-missile shield, sources said, negotiations with the US are in advanced stage. The US Department of State has approved the potential sale of a $1.867 billion Integrated Air Defence Weapon System (IADWS) to India.

The potential sale, which is being processed via the FMS route, is now before the U.S. Congress for consideration, with a 30-day window for Congress to raise any objections to the sale.

The Integrated Air Defence Weapon System, also known as the National Advanced Surface to Air Missile System (NASAMS), provides integrated air missile defence and is currently deployed around Washington. A similar shield will protect New Delhi.

The IADWS system includes radar, launchers, targeting, and guidance systems, advanced medium-range air-to-air missile (AMRAAM) and Stinger missiles, and related equipment and support.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/ccs-ok---s--2-6-bn-deal-for-24-us-naval-copters.html
265,20-2-20,"Priyanka, Scindia lined up for RS","Opp strength to fall, Cong may lose 9 of its 19 seats in House

The Congress may induct bigwigs like Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Randeep Surjewala into the Rajya Sabha amid reports that the Opposition strength in the Upper House could reduce further and the Congress may lose 9 or 10 seats — of its 19 seats falling vacant — in the elections slated later this year to fill up 68 vacancies.

The ruling NDA does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha and the Government has to seek the support of friendly parties such as the AIADMK and the BJD to get crucial legislations passed in the Upper House.

The BJP has the maximum of 82 members and the Congress 46 in the Rajya Sabha, which has a total strength of 245. There are 12 nominated members in the Upper House, eight of whom have aligned with the BJP.

Sources in the Congress said the party is confident of retaining nine seats on its own and winning one or two more with the help of its allies. It is likely to gain seats in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra, where it is in power.

“The Opposition strength will fall after elections are held to fill up 68 vacancies in April, June and November, that may lead to the ruling NDA slowly inching towards the majority mark in the Rajya Sabha. While 51 seats in the Rajya Sabha are falling vacant in April, five more in June, one in July and 11 in November this year,” sources in Congress explained.

Top Congress leaders Motilal Vora, Madhusudan Mistry, Kumari Selja, Digvijaya Singh, BK Hariprasad and MV Rajeev Gowda are among the top Congress leaders whose tenures are ending in April and June.

Vora, Selja and Digvijaya Singh may be renominated by the party, indicated the sources.

However, Raj Babbar and PL Punia are unlikely to get renomination from Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, where the ruling BJP is set to make major gains. One Rajya Sabha seat in Uttarakhand and 10 seats in Uttar Pradesh are falling vacant in November this year.

Uttar Pradesh has the maximum representation of 31 members in the Council of States, followed by 19 MPs from Maharashtra, 18 members from Tamil Nadu and 16 MPs from West Bengal.

A large number of Congress leaders are vying to get a Rajya Sabha berth from the party. Speculation is doing the rounds that the party may bring Priyanka Gandhi, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Randeep Surjewala and RPN Singh, among others, to the Upper House.

There are six vacancies coming up in Maharashtra, including that of NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, and the same number in Tamil Nadu. Five seats each will fall vacant in West Bengal and Bihar, four each in Gujarat, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.

Congress is likely to bag two of the three seats in Rajasthan, two of three in Madhya Pradesh, two in Chhattisgarh, one in Maharashtra and one in Karnataka. The party will lose seats in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Meghalaya and Assam.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/priyanka--scindia-lined-up-for-rs-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/priyanka--scindia-lined-up-for-rs.html
266,20-2-20,"Prince Harry, Meghan Markle fix March 31 for royal exit","Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have announced that they will formally exit as Britain's frontline royals on March 31 following discussions with Buckingham Palace on formalising their new financially independent roles.

Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will no longer have an office at Buckingham Palace in London as they stop carrying out formal royal duties for Queen Elizabeth II from April 1, with the formal arrangements of the split to be assessed after 12 months.

""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will formally step down as senior royals from March 31,"" a spokesperson for the couple said on Wednesday.

Harry, 35, will retain his military ranks of Major, Lieutenant Commander and Squadron Leader and will not use his honorary military positions or perform any official duties associated with these roles.

The couple will retain their His and Her Royal Highness (HRH) titles but would not be permitted to use them. The use of the word ""Royal"" as part of their Sussex Royal brand is reportedly still under discussion with palace officials.

The spokesperson for the couple, who are expected to settle down in Canada and spend some time in the UK ""regularly"", said that they will unveil further details of their non-profit charitable foundation later in the year.

Meanwhile, the duo will be back in the UK in the next few weeks to complete around six formal engagements, including Harry's attendance at an Invictus Games event with singer Jon Bon Jovi.

Markle, 38, is set to attend an International Women's Day event in early March, with the couple joining other senior royals for a Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster Abbey on March 9.

Last month, in a royal family first, the couple had signed up to a formal exit deal, which saw them give up their UK taxpayer funding.

The deal, which now comes into effect from April 1, means the couple will no longer be representing the Queen in an official capacity.

Queen Elizabeth II said the agreement followed months of discussions and was a ""constructive and supportive"" way forward for her grandson and his family after Harry and Meghan had announced plans to step back as senior royals.

""Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family,"" the 93-year-old monarch's personal statement read at the time.

""I recognise the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life,"" she said, as she thanked the couple for their work for the UK and across the Commonwealth.

The couple have been in Canada since the agreement was clinched with their nine-month-old son Archie.

They had a particularly difficult year in 2019 when they spoke out about the media glare on their role in a television documentary and decided to take legal action against British tabloids over breach of privacy.

""The decision that I have made for my wife and I to step back is not one I made lightly,"" Harry said in a speech last month.

""The UK is my home and a place that I love. That will never change,"" he added.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/prince-harry--meghan-markle-fix-march-31-for-royal-exit-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/prince-harry--meghan-markle-fix-march-31-for-royal-exit.html

272,20-2-20,Me and Virat have similar views on the game: Williamson,"Chalk and cheese they might be when it comes to their on-field personas but that has not come in the way of Virat Kohli and Kane Williamson forming a mutual admiration club.

The fierce Kohli and the mostly calm Williamson admire and respect each other as cricketers and more importantly as human beings.

""If we had to share no.1 spot, it would be New Zealand,"" skipper Kohli said during a dinner hosted by the Indian High Commissioner on Wednesday.

""Every team wants to beat us but I can tell you there would be no spite and that's why I could sit with Kane Williamson mid-game and have a conversation on life and not cricket,"" Kohli had said.

Williamson couldn't agree more about the conversation beyond the boundary during a recent T20 game from which both sat out.

""It was really interesting the other day to sit down and have a quiet chat on the outfield and share a lot of thoughts that we had and a lot of similar views on the game,"" the New Zealand skipper said.

While their approach might be different but Kohli's outlook on the game earns nothing but respect from one of his peers.

""We have slightly different approaches which was really refreshing but that is very inspiring from a guy that's leading the way in his tenacious and competitive attitude but his outlook on the game and what he does in and around it,"" Williamson said.

Kohli and Williamson first played against each other in an U-19 bilateral series and then in the 2008 Junior World Cup semi-final which the former won.

Eleven years later, both were part of another semi-final, this time in the main event where Williamson had the last laugh.

""We go quite a long way back really, to our under-19s, and played against each other in different competitions as well, the international arena and the IPL.

""I have always admired Virat in a lot of ways for setting benchmarks in the international game,"" Williamson said.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/me-and-virat-have-similar-views-on-the-game--williamson-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/me-and-virat-have-similar-views-on-the-game--williamson.html
273,20-2-20,India ready to 'taste' Kiwi flavoured pace in opening Test,"India's battle-hardened cricketers are ready for their toughest challenge of the World Test Championship till date as they face formidable hosts New Zealand on a spicy Basin Reserve track in the series-opener beginning here on Friday.

Virat Kohli's top-ranked team, with 360 points in its kitty, is certainly the favourite on paper but the Black Caps under Kane Williamson are experts at wearing down opposition with their patience on pitches which turn flat as the game progresses.

The last time New Zealand lost a series at home was back in March 2017 and since then have won five (10 Tests) in familiar conditions.

For New Zealand, it is time to pick up pieces after their 0-3 drubbing in Australia while the current Indian team would love to reassert that they are the best when it comes to winning in adverse conditions like they did in Australia last year.

The open Basin Reserve ground has always been challenging for both batsmen and bowlers due to cross winds.

And the new opening pair of Prithvi Shaw and Mayank Agarwal will have its task cut out against a top class seam attack comprising Trent Boult, Tim Southee, and Kyle Jamieson, who in all likelihood will make his debut.

However, the absence of left arm speedster Neil Wagner, who could have created awkward angles with his short balls, will provide some respite for the Indian middle-order. Wagner is on a break to welcome his first child.

New Zealand named their 12 on the day and it will be a choice between seamer all-rounder Daryl Mitchell or slow left-arm orthodox Ajaz Patel.

In an open ground with overcast conditions expected, captain Kohli will not mind winning the toss and unleash Jasprit Bumrah, Ishant Sharma and Mohammed Shami on the home team.

Even Kohli admitted that his men would need to have tons of patience once the track eases out as Williamson's team is known to the play waiting game.

""It doesn't matter how much patience opposition has, we have to show more patience. We can't really prepare in a manner where New Zealand show more patience and put pressure on us,"" skipper Kohli made his intentions clear during a media interaction.

While New Zealand are expected to go with four frontline pacers and may be a fifth seamer in all-rounder Colin de Grandhomme, the Indian team management might be tempted to try out Ravichandran Ashwin, who purely as a spinner, has more variety compared to left-arm orthodox of Ravindra Jadeja.

The wind factor in Wellington is an issue that captains need to deal with and Kohli is no different as he will have to judiciously choose ends for his bowlers.

""If breeze is blowing across the ground, who is more effective with inswinger or outswingers, these things you think as a captain,"" said Kohli.

The return of Trent Boult for New Zealand and Ishant for India, from their respective injuries will certainly bolster both the sides.

For India, Cheteshwar Pujara, Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane will have to be the foil around Shaw, Agarwal and Vihari with their techniques being tested.

""As a batsman, you need to think that ball might not travel in the air a lot more when you are hitting against the wind. So you need to be prepared to run a lot more which we experienced last time and if you have a light bat, you are in trouble.

""You need to be firm with your stance and where your bat is as it can really swing around,"" added Kohli, who is India's best batsman by a mile.

Teams:

India (First 12): Virat Kohli (captain), Mayank Agarwal, Prithvi Shaw, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajnkya Rahane, Hanuma Vihari, Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja.

New Zealand (12): Kane Williamson (c), Tom Blundell, Trent Boult, Colin de Grandhomme, Kyle Jamieson, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Henry Nicholls, Ajaz Patel, Tim Southee, Ross Taylor, BJ Watling.

274,20-2-20,Merkel slams 'poison' of racism after nine killed in Germany shootings,"Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the ""poison"" of racism Thursday after a shooter with suspected far-right beliefs killed nine people at a shisha bar and a cafe in the German city of Hanau.

The suspect, identified as 43-year-old German Tobias R., was found dead at his home following an hours-long manhunt.

The body of his 72-year-old mother was also found at the flat in what appeared to be a murder-suicide.

Federal counter-terror prosecutors investigating the case said they saw ""a xenophobic motive"" behind the shootings, the latest deadly attack blamed on the far right in Germany.

""Racism is a poison, hatred is a poison and this poison exists in our society and it is already to blame for far too many crimes,"" Merkel said in Berlin.

The suspect left behind online a ""manifesto"" and video material that suggested a terror attack motivated by ""a hostile attitude to foreigners"", said Peter Beuth, the interior minister of the state of Hesse.

Among the dead were ""several victims of Kurdish origin"", the Kon-Med association of Kurds in Germany said in a statement, adding that it was ""furious"" that authorities weren't doing more to combat rising extremism.

The rampage started at around 10:00 pm (2100 GMT) on Wednesday at a shisha bar in the Heumarkt area of central Hanau, a city some 20 kilometres (12 miles) east of Frankfurt.

The gunman reportedly rang the doorbell and shot at people in the smoking section, mass-market daily Bild said.

He then fled the scene by car before opening fire at the ""Arena Bar & Cafe"", with witnesses reporting hearing a dozen shots.

A total of nine people were killed, police said. Several others were injured, including one who is in serious condition.

The bloodshed plunged Germany into mourning, and rallies are scheduled in Berlin, Hanau and other cities on Thursday to honour the victims.

Relatives and friends of the victims gathered at the Arena bar around midday Thursday, an AFP reporter said, embracing one another in tears.

Police hurried to cover up the address of the perpetrator's website with a blue plastic sheet after it was spray-painted on the wall of a nearby building.

""I couldn't be any more upset,"" said Inge Bank, 82, who lives near the bar.

""We have to nip it in the bud if the Nazi party is coming back,"" Bank said, adding that she had lived through World War II and seen her mother imprisoned in a concentration camp.

The bar shootings sparked a massive manhunt, with armed officers fanning out across the city and police helicopters roaming the night sky.

Hesse interior minister Beuth said witness reports helped track the suspect's vehicle back to his home.

Special forces then stormed the suspect's apartment where they found him and his mother dead, killed by gunshot.

In a rambling 24-page document seen by AFP, the alleged gunman wrote that people from over two dozen countries should be ""destroyed"".

He also said he had never been with a woman, which he blamed on being ""watched"" by unspecified secret services.

King's College London counter-terrorism expert Peter Neumann tweeted of the text that it contained ""various, but mostly extreme right views, with a do-it-yourself ideology cobbled together out of parts found on the internet"".

""The pattern is clear, and not at all new,"" he added. Neumann described the suspect as ""an incel"", short for someone who is ""involuntarily celibate"".

Several ""incels"" have been linked to violent attacks, including a man in Toronto who stands accused of killing 10 people by ploughing a van into pedestrians in 2018.

Leaders were quick to condemn the killings.

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier echoed Merkel in denouncing the ""terrorist violence"" in Hanau.

""I stand with all those who are threatened by racist hatred. You are not alone,"" he said.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, a former German government minister, said she was ""deeply shocked by the tragedy"".

French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that he supported Merkel ""in the fight for our values and the protection of our democracies"".

Merkel pledged to fight back against ""all those who try to divide Germany"".

She cited the murders carried out by the neo-Nazi ""NSU"" cell between 2000-2007 as well as last June's killing of pro-migrant politician Walter Luebcke, and the deadly anti-Semitic attack in Halle in October as examples of the threat posed by the far right.

German police have identified around 50 extreme right adherents as ""dangerous"" individuals capable of carrying out a violent attack.

Last Friday, they arrested 12 members of a German extreme right group believed to have been plotting ""shocking"" large-scale attacks on mosques, similar to the ones carried out in New Zealand last year.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/merkel-slams--poison--of-racism-after-nine-killed-in-germany-shootings-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/merkel-slams--poison--of-racism-after-nine-killed-in-germany-shootings.html
275,20-2-20,Trump ally Roger Stone to be sentenced as case roils DOJ,"Roger Stone, a staunch ally of President Donald Trump, faces sentencing Thursday on his convictions for witness tampering and lying to Congress.

The action in federal court comes amid Trump's unrelenting defense of his longtime confidant that has led to a mini-revolt inside the Justice Department and allegations the president has interfered in the case.

Trump took to Twitter to denounce as a “miscarriage of justice” the initial recommendation by Justice Department prosecutors that Stone receive at least seven years in prison.

Attorney General William Barr then backed off that recommendation, prompting four prosecutors to quit Stone's case.

Stone was convicted in November on a seven-count indictment that accused him of lying to Congress, tampering with a witness and obstructing the House investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to tip the 2016 election.

He was the sixth Trump aide or adviser to be convicted of charges brought as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.

Any jail sentence seems likely to draw a public rebuke from Trump, who maintains that Stone's entire case is just an aspect of the ongoing “witch hunt” against him and his allies by bitter Democrats and the “deep state” inside the FBI and the Justice Department.

Given Trump's recent clemency spree that saw him commute the sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, — there has also been speculation that Trump could eventually pardon Stone.

“I haven't given it any thought ... But I think he's been treated very unfairly,” Trump said this week.

In Stone's initial sentencing memorandum filed February 10, prosecutors said Stone deserved a prison term lasting seven to nine years, in accordance with federal sentencing guidelines.

Such a sentence would send a message to deter others who might consider lying or obstructing a congressional probe or tampering with witnesses, the prosecutors said.

Stone, 67, has denied wrongdoing and consistently criticised the case against him as politically motivated.

He did not take the stand during his trial and his lawyers did not call any witnesses in his defense.

Stone's defense team requested a new trial and had asked Judge Amy Berman Jackson to delay sentencing until she rules on that motion. Earlier this week she refused.

Prosecutors had charged in the filing that Stone “decided to double- and triple-down on his criminal conduct by tampering with a witness for months in order to make sure his obstruction would be successful.” “Stone's actions were not a one-off mistake in judgment. Nor were his false statements made in the heat of the moment. They were nowhere close to that,” prosecutors wrote in the court papers.

But Justice Department officials said they were caught off guard by the recommendation, even though the acting US Attorney in Washington, DC, Timothy Shea, is a former top aide to Barr.

The attorney general ordered a new memorandum with a less harsh punishment, though it left provided no specifics and left the details to the judge.

Barr's decision became public just hours after Trump, in an overnight tweet, called the situation “horrible and very unfair.”

He added: “Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!” Barr later said in an ABC News interview that he had not been asked by Trump to look into the case.

In a stunning public rebuke, he said the president's tweets were making it “impossible” for him to do his job.

Meanwhile, Barr's actions on the sentencing for Stone prompted the entire trial team to quit.

The public debacle also prompted a rare statement from the Chief Judge of the DC District Court, Beryl A. Howell, who said “public criticism or pressure is not a factor” in judges' sentencing decisions.

The evidence presented in the trial didn't directly address Mueller's conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to prove a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to tip the outcome of the 2016 presidential election in Trump's favour.

But it provided new insight into the scramble inside the Trump campaign when it was revealed in July 2016 that the anti-secrecy site WikiLeaks was in possession of more than 19,000 emails hacked from the servers of the Democratic National Committee.

Witnesses testified that Trump's campaign viewed Stone as an “access point” to WikiLeaks and tried to use him to get advance word about hacked emails damaging to Hillary Clinton.

Prosecutors argued that Stone had lied to Congress about his conversations about WikiLeaks with New York radio host and comedian Randy Credico.

During the 2016 campaign, Stone had mentioned in interviews and public appearances that he was in contact with founder Julian Assange through a trusted intermediary and hinted at inside knowledge of WikiLeaks' plans.

Testimony revealed that Stone, while appearing before the House Intelligence Committee, named Credico as his intermediary to Assange and pressured Credico not to contradict him.

After Credico was contacted by Congress, he reached out to Stone, who told him he should “stonewall it” and “plead the fifth,” he testified.

Credico also testified during Stone's trial that Stone repeatedly told him to “do a 'Frank Pentangeli,'” a reference to a character in “The Godfather: Part II” who lies before Congress.

Prosecutors also charged that Stone had threatened Credico's therapy dog, Bianca, saying he was “going to take that dog away from you.”",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-ally-roger-stone-to-be-sentenced-as-case-roils-doj-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-ally-roger-stone-to-be-sentenced-as-case-roils-doj.html
276,20-2-20,"Fasal Bima Yojana tweaked for farmers’ benefit, voluntary now","The Modi Government on Wednesday approved major changes in the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) making it voluntary for farmers with existing crop loans or those willing to take new ones, as it seeks to address the concerns raised by farmers’ body and States in implementation of these programmes.

After the Cabinet meeting, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the Government has decided to revamp PMFBY and Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS).

The Cabinet approved modification of certain parameters/provisions of ongoing PMFBY and RWBCIS schemes. “Enrolment under the scheme to be made voluntary for all farmers (both PMFBY/ RWBCIS),” the Agriculture Minister said. He said currently 58 per cent of total farmers are loanee and the remaining 42 per cent are non-loanee. The number of farmers opting for these crop insurance schemes may drop immediately but the enrolment would eventually pick up, Tomar said. These modifications will help in addressing the concerns raised about the PMFBY scheme by farmers organisations and States, he said.

Among other modification, Tomar said the allocation of business to insurance firms through tender process would be done for three years as against the current policy of one to three years.

The Minister said insurance claims worth `60,000 crore have been cleared, and `13,000 crore premiums collected. As per modification, States will not be allowed to implement these schemes in subsequent seasons in case of considerable delay in release of requisite premium subsidy to insurance companies beyond a prescribed time limit.

Cut-off dates for invoking this provision for kharif and rabi seasons will be 31st March and 30th September of successive years, respectively.

The Cabinet also approved provisioning of at least 3 per cent of the total allocation for the scheme to be made by the Centre and implementing State Governments for administrative expenses.

For estimation of crop losses/admissible claims in the PMFBY, two-step process will be adopted based on defined deviation matrix using specific triggers like weather indicators, satellite indicators, etc, for each area along with normal ranges and deviation ranges. Only areas with deviations will be subject to crop cutting experiments (CCEs) for assessment of yield loss.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fasal-bima-yojana-tweaked-for-farmers----benefit--voluntary-now-2020-02-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/fasal-bima-yojana-tweaked-for-farmers----benefit--voluntary-now.html
