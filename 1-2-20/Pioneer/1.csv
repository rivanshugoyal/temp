0,01-2-20,Can invisible hand work?,"Seen from an economist’s perspective, the Economic Survey looks eloquent. But execution could run into a logjam as politicians are prone to controlling the consumer

The Economic Survey for 2019-20 has been prepared by the Chief Economic Advisor, Dr K Subramanian, keeping the ambitious target of achieving the $ 5 trillion economy status by 2024-25, set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at its centre. The rigorous analysis (a lot of it involves running of “regression equations” — a euphemism in econometric analysis to bring out correlation between various economic parameters) done by the CEA has to be seen in the backdrop of deceleration in the GDP (gross domestic product) growth to its 11-year-low of five per cent during the current year (first advance estimate) and the dire need to resurrect it without losing much time. Indeed, he projects the growth for 2020-21 at 6.5 per cent (pertinently, this is significantly higher than the projection of the International Monetary Fund [IMF] at 5.5 per cent).

In sync with this pretty ambitious rebound and keeping the economy on a high growth trajectory for the next four years, the dominant focus of the survey is on “wealth creation” with better distribution, which in a way also reflects Modi’s assertion time and again that “unless wealth is created, it won’t get distributed.” These prognostications though need to consider a piece of research released by rights group Oxfam ahead of the just concluded 50th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. According to the study, India’s richest one per cent holds more than four-times the wealth held by 953 million people who make up for the bottom 70 per cent of the country’s population. Further, the combined total wealth of 63 Indian billionaires is higher than the total Union Budget of India for the fiscal year 2018-19 (Rs 24,42,200 crore). Between 2014-15 and 2018-19, the average growth in GDP was about 7.5 per cent, which demonstrates that wealth was generated at a fast pace but its distribution was highly inequitable. So, by restoring growth to a higher level 2020-21 onward won’t assure better distribution.

The survey gives an indication of decline in growth having already bottomed out (during the second quarter, it was 4.5 per cent) and that during the second half, the pick-up is anticipated in view of increase in FDI, building demand pressure and increase in GST (Goods and Services Tax) collections. The reference here may be to GST collection during November/December, 2019 crossing Rs 100,000 crore each (this is likely to touch Rs 115,000 crore). But this is more due to intensified efforts to rein in tax evasion, increasing compliance and checking fraudulent claims of input tax credit (ITC) rather than being indicative of any significant revival in economic activity.

In any case, in view of the survey itself talking of five per cent growth for the whole year, it is abundantly clear that there is not going to be any dramatic turnaround during the second half.

To see resurrection of growth during 2020-21, Dr Subramanian has alluded to the need for deviating from the fiscal deficit target of three per cent set by the Modi government for the year. This in itself is a substantial slippage from the three per cent glide path recommended by the Dr NK Singh committee on review of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act to be achieved by 2018-19. Any reference to the three per cent benchmark is laughable when seen in the backdrop of the current year (2019-20), which is expected to end with a slippage to at least four per cent (against a target of 3.3 per cent), that too when off-budget liabilities and extra-budgetary resources (EBRs) are not included. If EBRs are included (there are some reports pointing to the Finance Minister’s intent to making these transparent in this budget), then the year may end up with a deficit close to six per cent.

Therefore, for boosting demand and investment (these are the two overarching constraints on growth), to expect the government to achieve this merely by deviating from the so-called prudential fiscal norms (read FRBM) is tantamount to “missing the wood for the trees.” Here, it may be pertinent to recap that already, through a number of mini-budgets presented by the Finance Minister (a spate of policy announcements and support measures made during August/September 2019 subsequent to the main budget presented in July 2019), the Government had already injected a number of demand boosters.

Indeed, a number of those measures had meant huge loss of revenue. For instance, the steep reduction in the corporate tax (from 30 per cent to 22 per cent for existing firms and from 25 per cent to 15 per cent for new companies to be set up after October 1, 2019) meant a loss of about Rs 1,45,000 crore; even after considering many firms not availing of the lower rates, the actual is still high at about Rs 1,00,000 crore. Taking into account other sops like tax refund to exporters, special dispensation for real estate sector, support to housing finance companies and so on, the total support would work out to well above Rs 2,50,000 crore.

As stated by the Prime Minister ad infinitum, the survey, too, reiterates the dire need for a whopping investment of Rs 100 lakh crore in infrastructure over the next five years. This is to be funded by 39 per cent contribution from the Union Government and States each and 22 per cent by the private sector. This will translate to Rs 8 lakh crore annually by the Centre and State each. For the Centre, this amount is even higher than its budget fiscal deficit [or total borrowings] for the current year. Likewise for the States, the numbers look theoretical to say the least. The official think tank will really have to look for innovative ways, including much greater participation of private sector (foreign investment included) of financing the mammoth investment in infrastructure. It is not as if the task is not doable. This requires a complete overhauling of the Indian banking sector as also the non-bank finance companies (NBFCs). In this context, the CEA needs to be commended for undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the reforms undertaken in the banking sector since 2015-16, viz cleaning up of the balance sheets of public sector banks (PSBs), the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and its use for recovery of NPAs (non-performing assets), improvement in the quality of lending and so on.

He has visibly demonstrated as to how indiscriminate lending during 2008-2013 negatively affected investment and increase in the quality of lending from 2014 onward will positively impact investment and growth. But one wonders whether the “bad loan” syndrome has really bottomed out or more skeletons are yet to come out. The NBFC crisis in particular raises serious concern, especially when one looks at two behemoths in this segment, the Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) and Dewan Housing and Finance Company (DFCL) going bust. Considering that a sizeable chunk of the funds has reportedly been siphoned off by dubious promoters/management, the concern only gets aggravated.

With the government now being forced to consider and sanction special dispensation/packages even for NBFC (as the stakeholders consider their revival as crucial to revival of credit flows, investment and demand), one wonders we may not be landing in a situation of the exchequer pouring water (read funds) in a bottomless pit. One can only hope that we don’t see more cases of willful default or misappropriation of funds or else any revival attempt using tax payers money is bound to fail.

The survey rightly emphasises the need for expediting reforms particularly in the area of banking (the recommendation for reducing the government’s shareholding below the majority mark is pending for long), land acquisition, enforcement of contracts, elimination of bureaucratic red-tape, removing bottlenecks in transportation and clearances at the ports (this is particularly relevant for boosting exports) and so on as these major bottlenecks come in the way of ease of doing business and attracting investment. It has also guarded the Government against too much of intervention and micro-management of activities (including implementation of welfare schemes) which, if left to the market forces, would deliver much better results. Dr Subramanian has aptly articulated the role of what he euphemistically describes as the role of “invisible hand” juxtaposed with “public trust” in stimulating wealth creation.

Both are crucial pillars in galvanising Indian economy on to a high growth trajectory, yielding better distribution effects. Seen from an economist’s perspective, this looks eloquent. But, when it comes to execution which has to be done by the political class, one gets into a logjam as it is prone to controlling most of the things; in fact, almost all of the essential items in the consumer’s basket.

1,01-2-20,"Iran’s loss, ISIS’ gain","The terror group stands to gain much from the assassination of Iranian General Soleimani, who was the face of armed resistance against it in Iraq and Syria

Not very long ago, December 2017 to be precise, the world was celebrating the defeat of the Islamic State (ISIS), the deadly face of terror that had compelled the world powers with differing strategic interests to come together to defeat it and along with it the idea of a medieval Islamic Caliphate. The ISIS had succeeded in recreating it by capturing swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria, including oil fields, refineries and mine fields of strategic minerals.

The aura of the ISIS was such that it not only attracted thousands of jihadists from different parts of the world, including Europe, but also dared to challenge the might of the United States (US) by executing and beheading American citizens. The menace of ISIS grew so fast and rapidly that the entire world was unanimous in countering the threat posed by it. Qaseem Soleimani, an Iranian General, was the face of armed resistance against the ISIS in Iraq and Syria along with the USA, Russia, Turkey and its European allies. Soleimani contributed in a big way in the defeat of the ISIS. The US and Iran, adversaries in the Middle East, identified a common enemy in the ISIS and effectively fought together against it to eliminate the terror group’s de facto state in Iraq and Syria. However, realpolitik soon overtook the strategic convergence of interests with Iran and the US almost at the verge of a war with a renewed Middle East crisis.

The ongoing US-Iran crisis reached the peak last month with US President Trump authorising the killing of General Qaseem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard’s elite Quds Force and an American ally in the fight against ISIS while he was on a visit to Iraq. This raised the tensions between the US and Iran to a new level with the future of the US forces in Iraq in the doldrums.

It also let loose many Shia militias which Soleimani had carefully raised and groomed to counter and challenge the ISIS. Their focus all of a sudden shifted from combatting ISIS to their newly-emerged enemy, the US assets and troops in the Middle East. Under the threat of Iranian retaliation, even the focus of Americans and others has been diverted from the ISIS and other radical Islamist jihadi terror groups for the time being. If at all there was a clear winner of the ongoing US-Iran conflict, it was undoubtedly the terror organisation. It has provided the ISIS with the much-needed oxygen as well as time and space to reorganise and regroup.

As a result, the US and its allies now face the dual threat of Shia militias and the Sunni radical Islamist jihadi terror groups led by the ISIS. The fall of Soleimani has provided them a new opening. The growing demand of ejecting US forces from Iraq has further complicated the security scenario in the region and in the process hurt the efforts to counter ISIS which have suffered a serious blow.

My assessment when Iraq’s Prime Minister declared a final victory over Islamic State in December 2017 was that the “ISIS may have been defeated but it was not destroyed. It may have been disseminated but was not dissolved.”

According to Goldenberg, an American diplomat who had served as Special Advisor in the Middle East between 2009-12, “The ISIS retains an underground presence and could take advantage of the chaos of an American withdrawal or a US-Iranian conflict to improve its position in Iraq.”

The assessments are seeming to be proving true with increased frequencies of terror attacks by the ISIS after the elimination of General Soleimani. The upheaval created by his killing has given rise to such conditions in Iraq that the ISIS is ever-willing to exploit.

The weakening of the Shia militias as a consequence to absence of Soleimani’s charisma as well as sterling leadership qualities will definitely weaken the Iraqi Government which would create a space for the ISIS and other Sunni terror groups to stage a comeback in the region.

Moreover, the US focus shifting towards defending its bases in Iraq and the security of green zone, will allow the terror group to manoeuvre more freely. The ISIS fighters, who had dispersed and gone underground are now rebuilding and re-emerging fully recuperated as a potent threat in form of insurgency, Improvised Explosive Devices, bombings, targetted killings suicide attacks, sniper attacks and lone wolf attacks. It is too early to assess if they would continue with this tactics or attempt once again to establish an Islamic Caliphate.

The US is trying to put up a brave front by denying any surge in the activities of the terrorist organisation due to its own activities. It is also obstinately claiming that most of the recent attacks by the group may have been planned well before the killing of Soleimani (because of the time and resources required to plan and execute such operations, more so when the ISIS is suffering from a unified command crisis and dispersion of its fighters). But the fact remains that with a divided focus it has become increasingly difficult for the US to contain the terror group.

The flare-up in the US-Iran crisis has certainly provided opportunity to Abu Ibrahim al Qurayshi — the newly- appointed successor of the assassinated long-time ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi — to strengthen his grip and revitalise the terror outfit to intensify its attacks in the region.

Under Qurayshi’s leadership, the group may also attempt to regain lost territories in Syria and Iraq depending on the resistance it faces, as this would give the new chief an opportunity to establish his hold more firmly over the group and prove his mettle.

The ISIS attacks on US-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have also intensified during the last month. The group is also trying to restore and rejuvenate its social media wing, its main source of funding and recruitment. Disturbingly, the terrorist group’s propaganda sites are on the rise on various social media platforms and apps.

The re-emergence of ISIS would have a definite impact on the Afghanistan-Pakistan region (Af-Pak region) with its consequential fallout for India and regional peace and stability in South Asia.

Soleimani’s successor, Brigadier General Ismail Qaani, is an old hand at fomenting trouble in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Solemani himself had played an active role in Afghanistan by cooperating with the Northern Alliance to fight the growing might of the Taliban. In a later turn of events after the American invasion of Afghanistan, Iran courted Taliban to fight the Americans and other Western troops in Afghanistan. General Qaani, who till as late as 2018 was the Iranian deputy Ambassador to Afghanistan, was instrumental in managing Iran’s Afghan policy.

Pakistan has also been accused of cross-border terror in Sistan- Baluchistan by Iran. Tehran is opposed to the rise of any Sunni-fundamentalist regime on its eastern border and with Pakistan now assisting the US to forge a deal with the Taliban, Iran has further been angered.

Shia-Sunni violence in Pakistan and persecution of Shias remains a constant point of friction between Iran and Pakistan. Thus a US-Iran conflict may have an impact in the situation in Afghanistan with Iran turning a blind eye to the rise of ISIS in the Af-Pak region as a complimentary threat to the US. In the process, Iran will try its best to derail the Afghan peace process. While Iran may have its own axe to grind in Afghanistan and sort out Pakistan as well for promoting the American interest in the region, rise of ISIS will have adverse impact on India’s security.

ISIS may well use Pakistan and Bangladesh as launch pads to renew its threat of Ghazwa-e-Hind. India will have to be cautious and watchful and at the same time strengthen its intelligence apparatus to counter the emerging challenges.

2,01-2-20,Address farm sector woes,"If the Government wishes to grow the economy, then it needs to make an all-out effort to turn agriculture into a profitable business

As India plans to become a $5 trillion economy by 2024, it cannot ignore the importance of the farm sector in helping it achieve this target. This is because we are an agriculture-based economy and more than 50 per cent of the population depends on the agri sector for its livelihood. However, the poor state of the rural economy is an area of concern for everyone and is affecting the country’s fiscal health too. The Government would do well to pay attention to some of the predominant problems hampering the growth of this key sector in its pursuit of the $5 trillion dream.

Subsidise inputs: India is a consumption-driven market and not an export-driven one like China and Singapore. As per the report of the National Statistical Office (NSO), half of the country’s population lives in rural India. Hence, it becomes a critical consumption market for the fertiliser industry, seed industry, tractor producing companies, other items essential for farm production and a host of consumer goods. The Government needs to provide farmers essential inputs on subsidised rates, especially for those growers who have holdings that are smaller than five acres.

Small and marginal farmers’ issues: The Government must focus on the problems plaguing small and marginal farmers. According to a report by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) small and marginal farm holdings generate meagre incomes and result in farmers accruing major debts and then committing suicide due to the inability to pay off those loans. If the Indian economy has to be resurgent, the agriculture sector needs more subsidy and easy agri-credit for small and marginal farmers.

Develop the dairy sector: Dairy farmers can earn as much as 75-85 per cent of the market price by selling the milk produced on their farms to cooperative societies like AMUL and other major milk marketing companies. India also has the largest bovine population in the world. However, the milk production per animal is significantly low as compared to the other major dairy producers of the world. Moreover, nearly all of the dairy produce in India is consumed domestically, with the majority of it being sold as milk. On account of this, the dairy industry holds tremendous potential for value-addition and overall development and the Government must focus on this to better the lot of farmers.

Need to develop vegetable and fruit markets: Indian farmers earn scarcely 10 per cent of the market price for their perishable produces like vegetables and fruits. Since a market is the primary medium for farmers to exchange their produce for money, lack of connectivity to ensure that their harvest reaches buyers in time, results in lowering the farmers’ ability to monetise their produce. The Government needs to plug these gaps and provide farmers a way to get their produce to the markets at the earliest and provide cold storages and freezer trucks, better road and rail connectivity so that the 40 per cent of the produce that is lost now can be saved and this in turn improves the monetary gains of the growers.

Reduce imports: As we all know, agricultural imports cause domestic prices to fall and this directly hurts the farmers. The Government needs to focus on increasing agricultural production in the country and review its policy on bumper production. The Minimum Support Price should be reconsidered for the development of the farm sector as farmers are producers and their interests must also be protected by policymakers, just like that of any citizen of the country.

Need for more agri-NBFCs: Adequate availability of finance is a prerequisite for the growth of any sector and the farm sector is no exception to this rule. However, the difficulties faced by growers in accessing loans when they need them the most have hampered the growth of the sector. Many farmers are either left un-served or underserved due to the lack of timely access to institutional finance via agri-loans. Without access to credit, most farmers with small holdings are restricted to farming, trading, processing practices that result in low levels of productivity. Although various financial institutions have come up and have set shops in rural India, the majority of agri stakeholders still have limited or no access to them. For the inclusive development of agriculture sector, financing is an important element and the Government must focus on developing this on a war footing.

Irrigation facilities: Farmers suffer due to floods in one part of the nation and drought in another area. The Government needs to focus on water management through river linkages and also provide subsidy for water conservation in rural areas for agrarian purposes.

If the Government wishes to stem the crisis plaguing the farm sector and grow the economy, then it needs to make an all-out effort to turn agriculture into a profitable business and make major policy decisions to achieve that goal.

3,01-2-20,Global scare,"No nation can handle epidemics alone. So there is a need to mount a united campaign on surveillance and sharing R&D

The contagion of the coronavirus has been instantaneous and intense, enough for us to act pronto rather than waiting for the World Health Organisation (WHO) to declare it as a global health emergency. Although early studies indicate this strain is less fatal than the respiratory syndromes caused by earlier two variants — SARS and MERS — its spread despite containment protocols shows that the virus, which mutates during species jumps and probably originated in a market legally trading wild animals, has already infected a large number of people. As it incubates in its host for around 10 or more days before manifesting symptoms, the deaths are just the tip of the iceberg. Experts say that any flu virus can extend its reach by not killing its host too rapidly and/or making the host sick enough to pass it on. Therefore, the outbreak is hardly a measure of the carriers in circulation. No amount of blocking information, which China is known to resort to, will help. For just like climate change, the world is under greater threat from such epidemics than other major diseases. Coronavirus has sickened citizens from every nation in a globalised world that cannot do without engaging with each other. Which is why the fightback must also be a coordinated effort beyond borders with a common mechanism set up along the lines of world bodies that monitor climate threats and solutions. Every nation should be involved in sharing a disease control protocol and pool research for an antidote. As of now, the Chinese are working on one with Alibaba founder Jack Ma promising funds for a rollout. But this is still a post-onset initiative, what we need is a threat preparedness. This will particularly help countries like India where the challenges are many. These include a density of population, low awareness levels, a weak public health delivery mechanism and a compromised infrastructure that is not geared to emergency responses. In fact, even the Chinese public health system has crumbled in the face of such an attack, exposing the chinks in its “great power” armour. Besides, the current outbreak has had many infected people displaying no symptoms. If this is more common than an exception, then chances are that this virus, too, will become endemic with year on year reprisals and mutations. This is why the world needs to wage a united war on pestilence or face an evolutionary culling of human lives. What we must also guard ourselves against is using xenophobia to characterise diseases. Just like ebola and the AIDS virus before it was ascribed to Africa, there’s a perception about the flu virus spreading out of lab leaks in China and the nation is being wrongfully proscribed as a giant germ factory. The fear and speculation about a new disease tend to get magnified if it originates in the Orient and strengthen prevalent biases. What we must understand is that whatever be the origin of viruses, in an open world, they become as much of an immediate threat for everybody. No matter how advanced the medical facilities, they always fall short in handling epidemics. We could do without the misinformation and mount a united campaign based on surveillance, sharing information and R&D.

It’s early days yet but India is not immune to the coronavirus either as it is trying to contain returnees from China. Pharmaceutical companies are bracing up for a hit as India sources about 70 per cent of bulk drugs and ingredients from China, Wuhan being one of the many source suppliers. Antibiotics like penicillin G, tetracycline and supportive pills like vitamins C and D use ingredients made using the fermentation-based process, which is dominated by China in the pharma market. We are heavily dependent on our eastern neighbour for chemicals-based ingredients that are used for cardiovascular drugs, particularly statins. India also sources components for its own tech products, a secondary sector which might be hit with containment protocols. Besides, the fear psychosis is such that anything coming out of China is being feared to be smeared with the coronavirus from factory floor workers there. So there might be a temporary freeze on these supplies. If anything at all, the virus has been a lesson for India. It has taught us the need to be in continuous deployment mode, something that helped us combat the deadly Nipah virus in Kerala. It has also awakened us to the need of monitoring the health of farm animals and wildlife. But most importantly, it is also warning bells for us to focus on drug manufacturing, reduce dependence on China and keep prices in check. For the inter-connectedness of the South Asian region as a whole, thanks to China’s Belt and Road Initiative in the neighbourhood, means that we have to learn to live with threats.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/global-scare-2020-02-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/global-scare.html
4,01-2-20,It is possible to fix the economy,"When faced with a prolonged slowdown, a prescription of fiscal stimulus is normal. When the private sector is not forthcoming in terms of consumption and investment expenditure, the Government has to step up

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present her second Union Budget today at a time when the Indian economy is grappling with the lowest growth in six and a half years, with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) dipping to 4.5 per cent in the July-September quarter. Economists are now more or less in agreement that the current slowdown has cyclical as well as structural features.

Also, most economists believe that it is more of a demand side problem that needs to be tackled by providing more disposable incomes in the hands of the people. The fiscal space available to the Government to leverage the fiscal policy is limited owing to lower than expected tax revenues and the corporate tax cut announced in September 2019 that have constrained income.

The Government has already committed an economic stimulus through the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), the proposed expenditure for which in the Financial Year 2021 (FY) is Rs 19.5 trillion. Providing such funds (the Centre and States are required to pitch in 39 per cent each) at a time when the resources of the Government have hit rock bottom is a challenge.

Taxes, which are a major source of Government revenue, have reached only 45.5 per cent of the FY 2020 Budget estimates as per the Controller General of Accounts.

Clearly, the tax collections have not matched the seven per cent growth of the economy in the first half of this fiscal. It is highly unlikely that the Government will be able to reach its target tax collection of Rs 24.61 trillion by the end of March 2020. Therefore, a larger fiscal hole is expected in this Budget. The higher oil prices amid US-Iran tensions have not helped ease the Government’s fiscal deficit worries.

When faced with a prolonged slowdown a prescription of fiscal stimulus is normal. When the private sector is not forthcoming in terms of consumption and investment expenditure, the Government has to step up. The Centre must stretch itself without worrying too much about missing the deficit target. When the fiscal stimulus shows its impact, the corporate earnings increase along with that of retail investors. Also, it directly impacts the jobs and incomes generated in the process.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has done its bit by changing its stance on the monetary policy from “neutral” to “accommodative” and reducing the repo rate by 135 basis points in 2019. Thereafter, it adopted a wait-and-watch approach and kept the repo rate unchanged to a nine-year low of 5.15 per cent. This was necessitated by rising inflationary pressures in the economy. The RBI has revised its estimate of retail inflation for the second half to 5.1-4.7 per cent from 3.5-3.7 per cent. Under the given circumstances, when pursuing an expansionary monetary policy looks dangerous and the Government finds its hands tied for fiscal stimulus, the question arises what approach should be adopted that can be successful in bringing the economy back on track?

Here are some ways through which the Finance Minister can steer the economy on the path to recovery.

Boost demand: Economists agree that a slowdown in consumption through a lack of demand has been a major contributor in the current deceleration as consumption is the “engine” of the economy. Hence, the Finance Minister should ensure an increase in disposable income in the hands of people who have the high marginal propensity to consume and low marginal propensity to save. Schemes like the Kisan Samman Nidhi, increasing allocations under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, giving income tax relief to the lower middle class and even schemes having the character of the Universal Basic Income (UBI) like Universal Pension can go a long way in boosting demand, especially rural demand.

Allow States to borrow more: States can help the Central Government in providing a fiscal stimulus and distribution of resources. The Centre should in fact raise the borrowing limits of States so that more money flows into all regions, thereby boosting demand.

Fill Government posts: If the Centre and State Governments decide to fill vacant posts in their offices on a priority basis, it will not only create purchasing power but also give a fillip to the youth who are living through the worst employment crisis the country has seen in decades.

Private investment revival: Private investment has not picked up till now due to stress in the banking sector, especially in the non-bank financial company sector, a weakening demand and falling business sentiment. The early December quarter earnings indicate that the stimulus through rate cuts and lower corporate taxes has not been able to boost business growth. Net sales of many BSE-listed companies show a lower year on year growth of 4.07 per cent from 4.81 per cent in the preceding September quarter.

Faster revenue generation: The Government’s tax revenue for April-November 2019 was just Rs 11.7 trillion, just 0.8 per cent more than collected last year. Through disinvestment also, the Government generated revenue of Rs 18,099 crore, which is way below the target of Rs 1.05 trillion that it set for itself. In order to meet its expenditure, the Government will have to step up revenue generated through the disinvestment route while not giving any further rebates in income tax rates. A major relief in personal income tax rates may also not help in boosting consumption. Given the present circumstances of low business sentiment, uncertainty in the global business environment and deceleration in private investment — any increases in disposable income will not convert into spending entirely — it is likely that most of it will be saved for emergencies. Instead the Government should bring more of high income earners into the tax net.

Control wasteful expenditure for fiscal consolidation: During hard times, no one, including the Government can afford wastages and leakages. The Government needs to seriously plug in leakages from the system and plan its expenditure in a better way.

A cautious monetary policy: At present the RBI has to worry about infusing capital into banks that need it, ensure smooth mergers and takeovers and prevent any further bank frauds that have proven detrimental to the health of the banking sector in the past. Some relief announcements for the non-banking sector for purchase of bad assets should be there. The transmission of rates must be ensured and at a quicker pace, while further reductions can only be done if inflation allows that. Since the fears of “stagflation” gripping the Indian economy are already there, the RBI can do nothing more than just wait and watch.

5,01-2-20,Indians at the fore,"Another Indian leads a global tech company. We must not forget that he, too, had to leave India to achieve success

Arvind Krishna, an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, has been chosen to lead IBM Corporation, one of the oldest names in American technology. This is yet another feather in the cap of engineers from India who have taken over the reins at leading American corporations after Satya Nadella at Microsoft and Sundar Pichai at Google. It is a matter of immense pride to see India-educated engineers and managers take leading roles at global corporate behemoths. But there are a couple of points that must be raised. First is the inability of India to create leading global companies and the opportunities that follow, which effectively forced thousands of young Indian men and now increasingly, women, to go to the US to make their fame and fortune. None of the three men mentioned above holds an Indian passport anymore, having sworn allegiance to the US.

There is, however, another problem right now, which is India’s declining standards of higher education. While the Indian Institutes of Technology and the Indian Institutes of Management, at least the older ones, might still make some global rankings, the plain and simple fact is that most Indian institutes of higher education are not ranked in the top 1000 universities of the world. One of the surprising facts that has emerged from the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan is that there are thousands of Indian students studying in China despite medical and engineering seats going abegging in India. Most likely that is because the education imparted in India has drastically declined, evident in the number of people who blindly believe WhatsApp posts. China has made it a point of pride to lift its colleges into the global rankings. This particularly hurts given that India has one of the youngest populations in the world. If we are to take advantage of our demographic dividend, we need to ensure we have top-notch centres of education. We must not forget that quality matters just as much as quantity. So while we must celebrate the success of these three men and the countless other Indians who have become successful in the US and elsewhere, we must ask what we are doing to ensure that Indians keep climbing to the top across the world and how we are going to create success inside our shores.

7,01-2-20,Chain snatching captured on CCTV,"Unidentified miscreants on Thursday snatched a gold chain from a woman in broad daylight near a private school under the Pahala police outpost on the outskirts of the city.

The victim was identified as former teacher Pushpabati Mahapatra (62).

The incident has been captured by a CCTV installed in the area. The incident occurred while the woman was returning from a primary school to her home.

The CCTV footage showed that one out of the two bike-borne miscreants pushed the woman on the road and snatched the chain from her neck. The woman suffered head injury, following which she was admitted to a nearby hospital.

Based on a complaint by the victim’s son Satyajit Mahapatra with the Pahala police, primary investigation was initiated into the incident.

Reports said the motorcycle owned by one Sanjay Behera of Johala village was stolen a few days ago.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/chain-snatching-captured-on-cctv.html
8,01-2-20,Let Govt handle water crisis more proactively,"Amid the buzz around the daily spice in news, we lose sight of something rudimentary and crucial to our existence and survival, that is, ‘water crisis’. Last year, a BBC report claimed around 600 million Indians living in the brink of acute water crisis. The agency substantiated the claim by quoting a NITI Ayog report which asserted that the crisis was to further worsen.

The report says as cities and towns grow, the pressure on urban water resources is expected to increase. The report estimates that demand will be twice as much as available supply by 2030. Water scarcity would also account for a 6 per cent loss in India's gross domestic product (GDP), it adds. An argument is gaining grounds to put forth a legislation asserting and ensuring right to safe drinking water with adequate tentacles of enforcement, so that this basic human right is in the platter of the poorest of the poor.

However, there is an inherent but robust constitutional mandate and a series of official proclamations to this effect, but unfortunately, we have not succeeded in making safe drinking water accessible to everyone as a matter of right, which is yet a distant dream.

On July 28, 2010, through Resolution 64/292, the United Nations General Assembly explicitly recognized the human right to water and sanitation and acknowledged that clean drinking water and sanitation are essential to the realisation of all human rights. During the adoption of this resolution, it also voiced deep concern about around 900 million people having no access to safe drinking water. In November, 2002, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted General Comment No. 15 on the right to water. Article I.1 of the General Comment states that, ""The human right to water is indispensable for leading a life in human dignity. It is a prerequisite for the realization of other human rights"". Comment No. 15 also defined the right to water as the right of everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable and physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses.

Right to safe drinking water is an inalienable right of man. In Subhas Kumar v. State of Bihar, it has been held that right to safe drinking water has constitutional mandate and comes under right to life. Further, in 2002, the Supreme Court validated the Sardar Sarovar dam project on Narmada in 2000 interpreting the Right to Life article as Right to Water. It said, “Water is the basic need for the survival of human beings and is part of the Right to Life and human right as enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution of India and can be served only by providing source of water where there is none.” Besides, in 2004, while giving a verdict on a PIL on fast depletion of groundwater in Delhi, the apex court ruled that groundwater is a social asset. It further said that people have the right to use air, water and earth interpreting the Article 21. It even observed that in ground water use, domestic and irrigation needs must be prioritized. Apart from expanding the content of the Right to Life as including the Right to Water, the court has, in the context of water pollution, mandated the cleaning up of water sources including rivers (as held in MC Mehta v. Union of India), the coastline ( as held in S Jagannath v. Union of India and even tanks and wells (as held in Hinch Lal Tiwari v. Kamala Devi.

The concern over pollution of groundwater by unregulated discharge of effluents has led the court to issue mandatory directions for clean up by the polluter and restitution of the soil and groundwater. The court in AP Pollution Control Board v. Prof MV Nayudu has also applied the ‘precautionary principle’ to prevent the potential pollution of drinking water sources consequent upon the setting up industries in their vicinity. Various judicial pronouncements have recognized that, water is a community source which is to be held by the State in public trust in recognition of its duty to respect the principle of inter-generational equity.

In MC Mehta v. Kamal Nath, the court declared that ‘our legal system is based on English common law, which includes the public trust doctrine as part of its jurisprudence. The State is the trustee of all natural resources which are by nature meant for public use and enjoyment. Public at large is the beneficiary of the seashore, running waters, air, forests and ecologically fragile lands. The State as a trustee is under a legal duty to protect the natural resources. These resources meant for public use cannot be converted into private ownership.’

It is apt quoting Henri Smets of French Water Academy as, ‘When disasters strike, victims receive medical care, drinking water, food, and shelter in priority. Everyone agrees that medical care, food, and housing are economic and social rights that everyone should have, yet many still question the nature of access to water. Can one doubt the existence of a right to water today? Can one reasonably exclude water from the list of essential goods and services? The right to water reflects an undeniable reality; without water, there is no life. If the right to food exists, the right to water must also exist.’

It is a hard-felt demand that right to safe drinking water should be put in as a separate fundamental right and, accountability of State as trustee of water resources should lead to implementation of a stringent constitutional order so as to make access to safe and clean drinking water a reality across economic and social barriers.

Kejriwal hit out at Union Minister for calling him an “outsider”, saying the people from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana settled in Delhi can be outsiders for the saffron party but the city has “adopted” them.

Responding to Vardhan’s tweet in which he questioned the CM for calling himself as ‘Delhi’s son’, Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi, “Doctor Sahib, you hate me. You can abuse me. How can you call all those born in UP and Haryana who are settled in Delhi outsiders? They may be outsiders to the BJP. But they are part of our Delhi family. We Delhiites adopted them all, made them our family.”

The Union Minister said while Kejriwal was born in Hisar, Haryana, he was settled in Kaushambi in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. “How can he be Delhi’s son?” Vardhan asked.

In another tweet, Kejriwal responded to the recent “sting” of the BJP on mohalla clinics, saying the party has again “mocked” the people of Delhi by issuing “fake” videos.

“The BJP once again mocked the people of Delhi by issuing fake videos. Delhiites worked hard to build 450 world class mohalla clinics. Mohalla clinics have brightened the name of Delhi all over the world. Today, BJP’s lie was caught in media investigation. People of Delhi are very happy with mohalla clinic,” he said, tagging a news report.

Referring Ganga in Paryagraj, Shah dared AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal to take a dip in Yamuna. “Go and take a dip in Prayagraj, you will learn work done by Modiji and Yogiji in cleaning the river,” Shah lauded, “Kejriwal promised to clean Yamuna!”

Shah bordered Kejriwal in his for not fulfilling AAP’s promises in Delhi. “Where is free WiFi, jobs for youth?”

Citing report of Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), the BJP leader said out of 21 samples of waters collected from 21 cities across India, Delhi’s water report was poor. “Delhi people are drinking polluted water,” Shah added.

Quoting BJP national president JP Nadda’s tweet in which he uploaded a video of Mohalla clinic, Shah said there are no facilities in the clinic.

Accusing the AAP for depriving Delhi people from Centre-run Ayushman Health Scheme, the Union Home Minister said for the sake of your (Kejriwal’s) selfish politics, you played with lives of poor’s in Delhi.

Attacking both the AAP and the Congress, Shah said on one side the BJP is contesting election which is dedicated and committed for the security of the country while on other side, the Congress and the AAP says “We are with Shaheen Bagh”.

Taking a jibe on the AAP, Shah said the State Governments compete for various development works, but Delhi Government is nowhere at number one, where are new 50 colleges.

Citing an audit report of Delhi Jal Board (DJB), he said earlier the civic body was in profit of Rs 178 crore and today is in a loss of Rs 800 crore whereas Kejriwal himself is the chairman of the DJB.

While attacking the opposition on CAA, Shah said that the Congress party had divided the country on the basis of religion, with millions of Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Parsis and Christians left in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan,” “Today the BJP Government is giving citizenship to them, both the Congress and the AAP have a problem. Communist, SP, BSP and Mamata are all the same, so they could not abolish Article 370 because they only care for their own vote bank.”

Lauding Prime Minister Narendra Modi on resolving Ram Mandir issue, Shah said, “Modiii resolved all the 70-year-old issues within just eight months, the decision of Ram Mandir came and now where Sri Ram was born, the grand temple construction will start there itself within four months. The BJP is the only party which follows the ideology of nationalism and is always moving forward to make successful the works of national interest,” he added.

Raising the slogan of “Modi hai to Mumkin hai”, Shah said Modiji has dreamed of grooming Delhi, and also working for it continuously, under which regularisation of 1731 colonies.

With few days left for Delhi Assembly elections, the BJP has made a major shift in its strategy while it entered into the last leg of campaigning for the high voltage Delhi Assembly elections to be held on February 8, 2020.

24,01-2-20,BJP’s Sankalp a jumla patra: AAP,"AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said the BJP’s manifesto has proved that it will stop facilities like free electricity and water given by the Delhi Government.

“Manifesto of the BJP proved that if you vote for them then your free electricity, free water and free bus journey will be stopped. Think and vote,” he said in a tweet.

Senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh termed BJP manifesto a “Jumla Patra”. He said it clearly showed the BJP aims to end all the welfare schemes given by the Delhi government.

Singh said, “It is clear from this manifesto of the BJP that it has no intention of continuing any of the welfare schemes which the AAP Government started such as free electricity up to 200 units, water, and bus travel for women among others. This manifesto clearly says that all the welfare schemes being run for common people today will be closed down if BJP comes to power. So, basically, it’s not a manifesto, but a scheme to completely ruin the lives of the people of Delhi”.

Accusing the BJP of anti-women party, he said the manifesto has not addressed issues like safety of women, education and health as they are not in position to say anything on these issues.

He also said the BJP has not made any strategy to deal with pollution precisely. “One of the causes of pollution in Delhi is crop burning in the States of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, both ruled by the BJP and Punjab ruled by the Congress,” he said.

Singh said they promise to do away with tanker mafia, a system they themselves had facilitated in the first place, whereas it was Kejriwal who demolished this devious system in Delhi and rescued people from its vicious clutch. When we came to power, only 58 per cent of Delhi received piped water but now this number reached at 93 per cent.

Targeting the BJP over promises to halt sealing in Delhi, he said “It is the BJP that spread the fear of sealing and ruined lives and livelihood of traders. None of their leaders stood with the traders at that time, while we fought for them coming on the streets and raised the matter even in the Parliament. Who is going to believe these blatant lies of the BJP,” he said.

“The BJP will stop ‘Farishtey Yojana’, free surgeries, medicines, MRI, Ultrasound tests - and all these will be replaced by the Ayushman Yojana if it comes to power,” he said.

The promise to regularise the safai karamcharis is ridiculous, he said, adding as of now, the subject matter of ‘services’ is under their jurisdiction and Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari had said on record that the dues for all safai karamcharis will be paid. What happened to that promise? Now again, they have brought this up during the Assembly elections — it is nothing but a jumla, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp---s-sankalp-a-jumla-patra--aap.html
25,01-2-20,"BJP's manifesto deception, says Cong","Delhi Congress termed BJP’s ‘Sankalp Patra’ as yet another ‘Jhansa Patra’ (deception paper) to throw dust into the eyes of the people of Delhi to get their votes.

Delhi Congress president Subhash Chopra said the promises like bringing back the black money stashed away in foreign banks, and depositing Rs 15 lakh to each account holder in the country made by the BJP in 2014 Lok Sabha elections is yet to be fulfilled.

Chopra said that the manifesto has promised to provide 10 lakh jobs for the youth of Delhi, though it has woefully failed to fulfill its promise of giving two crore jobs to the youth of the country every year, made in the 2014 Lok Sabha election manifesto. “The country was now staring at the highest unemployment rate in 45 years and several lakhs have been rendered jobless in Delhi due to the sealing drive. The BJP has not only failed to generate fresh jobs but the existing jobs were also snatched away from the youth following demonetisation and the wrong implementation of GST during its six year rule at the Centre.

“The economic slump, wrong economic policies and GST have resulted in the closure of small and medium industries, and even big companies were forced to retrench their employees,” he added.

Chopra said that the sealing drive in the Capital led to the closure of small and medium shops and businesses, leaving lakhs of people jobless. “Despite BJP being in power both at the Centre and in the Municipal Corporations of Delhi, it did not take any step to stop the sealing drive,” it added.

DPCC spokesperson Anil Bhardwaj said that the BJP manifesto only rubs salts into the wounds of the unemployed youth of Delhi. “The condition in Delhi was far worse as the unemployment rate in the Capital was 12 per cent. All the seven MPs from Delhi belong to the BJP, and the party is also in power at the MCDs, they could not bring any new law to stop the sealing drive in Delhi. The BJP and the AAP Government are responsible for the sealing of shops and industrial units, robbing lakhs of people their jobs,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-s-manifesto-deception--says-cong.html
26,01-2-20,BJP’s Vats aims to wrest seat from Jain,"nShakur Basti constituency appears to be locked into a straight fight between the ruling AAP and the BJP. The AAP has fielded sitting MLA Satyendar Jain who won the seat defeating BJP candidate by 3133 votes in Assembly election held in 2015.

BJP candidate SC Vats, who represented the constituency two times on Congress symbol, is well known for development carried out during his tenure as an MLA. The Congress has fielded Dev Raj Arora.

Shakur Basti Assembly seat has witnessed an interesting battle since the first election held in 1993 in which BJP’s Gauri Shankar Bhardwaj won the seat by huge margin, securing more than 51 per cent of vote share.

Dr SC Vats won the seat consecutively in 1998 and 2003 on Congress ticket. In 2008 assembly election, BJP’s regained the seat as its candidate Shyam Lal Garg defeated SC Vats of the Congress by a margin of 4,000 votes.

The voting percentage for the BJP has been constant on this seat as it got on average 42 per cent in last five assembly elections. Interestingly, the BJP gained 10.84 per cent vote share in 2015 compared to 34.87 of total votes polled in 2013. While the Congress vote share has seen a declining trend in last five Assembly elections as the party secured 56.14 per cent in 1998, 56.21 per cent in 2003, 45.20 in 2008, 19.76 in 2013 and reduced to just 4.54 per cent in 2015.

The share of Congress votes has come down to 14.42 per cent on average in last two years as the voters were shifted to AAP. If political experts are to believed the BJP candidate may win the seat comfortably after Congress managed to reach its average vote share which is 36.37 per cent.

When asked about pace of development in the area, most of the residents expressed satisfaction but also denied that freebies have any role to impact polls. People praised AAP Government for providing free electricity and ensuring 24 hours water supply, saying that it has provided a great relief to poor and middle class.

Puneet Bansal, a businessman and a resident of Rani Bagh said that undoubtedly Kejriwal has done some good work such as providing free electricity, water and transport and people are being benefited from it but there is not even a single infrastructural works are undertaken in the area.

“Vats is our favorite here. He transformed the area by completing many infrastructural projects. Besides, constructing roads and developing educational institution, the credit of 200 bedded multi specialty Hospital with a state of art equipments, operation theatres and staff quarters is also goes to him,” said

Gurpreet Singh, a resident of Paschim Vihar.

“A state of art flyover with sound absorbers (to reduce vehicle noise pollution up to 50 decibels) was constructed with a total cost of seven crores, was also constructed during his tenure as an MLA which has reduced traffic congestion considerably at Britania Chowk,” he said.

There are about 1, 05,077 eligible voters in this constituency. The voting in the Delhi Assembly Election will be held on February 8 and the counting of votes will take place on February 11.

30,01-2-20,Uttarahana Panchu Pandav Peeth lies neglected,"One of the prominent religious spots in Puri district, the Panchu Pandav Peeth in Uttarahana village has remained a mystery backed by folk tales and beliefs as proofs.

Of thousands of years old, the shrine of six holy siblings such as Yudhisthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadev along with Draupadi, located in Uttarhana, is 7-km from the pilgrim town of Puri. The shrine is believed to be of Mahabharata age, when Panchu Pandav had a night halt in the village before leaving for Brahamagiri.

According to the villagers, the shrine dates back to the Mahabharat period, when the Panchu Pandavs during their 14-year jungle exile had spent a night in the Uttarahana. The siblings in shape of a Siva Linga with a rock idol of goddess Draupadi have been staying in four separate shrines within a boundary, said villagers adding that the deities are nature's gift where there exists no record of them being made by human beings.

Their pristine status could clearly be judged from the fountains flowing from Siva Lingas, said the villagers. When Ajrun, Nakula and Sahadev are living deep in water in a temple, Yudhistira and Bhima are exposed to devotees in two temples. And rock idol of Draupadi is also natural. But villagers rued that the Government had no attention towards popularization of the spot.

Kumar Biswal, a village in- charge of a temple informed that after spending days in Puri, the Panchu Pandavs moved to west direction and halted a night in Ketaki Bana here which later became Uttarhana village. Next morning Panchu Pandavs left for Khandab Bana in Brahmagiri and resided in six separate places during their forest exile. In six temples, they are presently worshipped as Siva Lingas with Draupadi as goddess Harachandi in a shrine near the sea shore.

Biswal, who has been organising ‘Ramacharita Manasa’ in the temple for last nine years, has urged the Government to undertake development of the spot so as to make it a tourist destination.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/uttarahana-panchu-pandav-peeth-lies-neglected.html

Condemning the attack on their fellow students, the protesting students carried posters and placard with slogans written it saying, ‘Stop Hate Speech, Safety really?, What’s in the name’ and ‘Tamache Pe Disco, Jamia se Khisko’.

The students said they were shocked when they saw the man emerge from the crowd and open fire in full public view amidst heavy police presence.

“I am protesting here for the last two months and it was a peaceful protest till yesterday but witnessing the firing incident, it feels like there is no safety at all inside and outside the campus and in this area. All we wanted was a peaceful protest to Rajghat on the death anniversary of the father of our nation. The police were standing still talking on phone and hands inside the pocket. They could have done something during the incident,” said a protesting student on condition of anonymity.

Thousands of people and police personnel faced off against each other near the university on Thursday after a man fired a pistol at a group of anti-CAA protesters.

36,01-2-20,DRUG-FREE PANCHAYATS TO BE REWARDED,"Taking the fight against narcotics to a different level, the Punjab Government on Friday made clear its intention to reward the drug-free village panchayats.

“The Government is mulling over a proposal to reward the panchayats which have declared the villages under it 100 percent drug free by giving them special grants for their development,” said the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh.Capt Amarinder said that some sarpanches have told me that they have declared their villages drug-free. “We would encourage them by giving special grants for development,” he added.

However, this is not for the first time that the State Government has announced to reward the villages for declaring themselves completely free from the grip of the drugs.

Capt Amarinder, in 2018, had made similar announcement, while SAD’s Surjit Singh Rakhra had also announced to give special grants to the panchayats in 2012 under the previous SAD-BJP regime.

In fact, the government, at one point of time, was also considering the proposal to give a grant of Rs 5 lakh to each village to purchase gym and sports equipment for youth to help keep them away from drugs.

The state Panchayats and Rural Development Minister Tripat Rajinder Singh Bajwa, in July 2018, had declared that every village, that turns drug-free, would get a grant of Rs five lakh to purchase gym and sports goods for youth.

37,01-2-20,Liquor may be delivered straight to your door in Mohali,"Liquor may go the pizza way in Mohali. In a bid to give a new high to the tipplers, the Punjab Government is mulling to introduce a policy that will see liquor being delivered home in Mohali.

The State Government is planning to introduce a platform for online home delivery in Mohali city on an experimental basis.

“The online home delivery of liquor in Mohali will be done in consultation with all the retail licensees of the city,” said a Government spokesperson on Friday following the Cabinet meeting during which the new Excise Policy for 2020-21 was approved.

The spokesperson made it clear that the experiment would not, however, be undertaken even if a single licensee objects to it.

As of now, the online home delivery system has been introduced in Maharashtra. If implemented, Punjab would be the second State in the Country.

“The decision to introduce online liquor home delivery system would, in a way, help in checking the drunken driving and accidents due to that besides adding to the state’s revenue, giving a boost to the liquor business,” a senior government official told The Pioneer.

The official said that under this system, the alcohol would be delivered at customers’ homes through platforms just like the e-commerce web portal. “Presently, this is just a proposal…It needs to be discussed in detail at various levels and with all the stakeholders involved,” added the official.

The State Cabinet, in its meeting, approved the new excise policy with a continued focus on maintaining stability in the liquor trade while protecting the state’s excise revenue.

Under the new policy, the existing licensees, who attain 12 percent excess revenue over the Minimum Guaranteed Revenue (MGR), will be allowed renewal for the year 2020-21.

A target of Rs 6,250 crore has been fixed as against anticipated collection of Rs 5,676 crore of 2019-20, as per the new policy.

The excise revenue is expected to go up to Rs 5,676 crore in 2019-20 from Rs 5,150 crore in 2018-19 as a result of the sweeping reforms initiated by Capt Amarinder Government in its previous pro-trade and pro-retail excise policy, said an official spokesperson.

In the new policy, the number of groups had been retained at last year’s level of 756. The MGR from retail vends during 2020-21 is to be realized at Rs 4,850 crores, as against Rs 4,529.40 crores during 2019-20. The MGR of each group or zone during 2020-21 has been increased by 8 percent over 2019-20.

The Government can offer renewal to existing licensees if they pay 12 percent excess revenue over the MGR fixed, for the year 2021-22, and the renewal fee will vary from one to four percent, depending on the response of application in the previous year.

Spokesperson pointed out that the Department would invite applications for renewal of groups or zones of 2019-20 for the year 2020-21 through a public notice. The MGR of each group or zone will be fixed at eight percent higher than the MGR of last year, 2019-20.

After the approval of Deputy Excise and Taxation Commissioners (DETCs)-cum-Collectors of Divisions, the details would be displayed on the notice boards of the concerned districts and also be put on the website of the Department.

The licensee will submit an application to the Assistant Excise and Taxation Commissioner (AETC) concerned, along with renewal fee at Rs 10 lakhs, along with details of payments made till date and an undertaking that he would deposit 12 percent excess revenue of the MGR fixed for his group for the year 2019-20 by March 20, 2020.

The licensee would also be required to submit an Affidavit under order 7 of the Punjab Intoxicants License and Sale Order, 1956, besides depositing prescribed Fixed License Fee and Additional Fixed License Fee on the dates prescribed in the Excise Policy 2020-21, that is Rs 10 lakhs by February 28, 2020, and the balance amount by March 23, 2020.

License fee of distilleries was rationalized last year on the basis of installed capacity. On similar lines, the license fee of bottling plants will be rationalized on the basis of bottling lines and of Breweries on the basis of capacity.

Cow cess is to be charged as per provisions of 2019-20, in the shape of Special License Fee, whereas quarterly assessed fee to be charged from bars has been marginally increased.

Further, the State Government is contemplating imposition of minimum excise duty on the basis of installed manufacturing capacity of various manufacturers (distilleries and bottling plants). This may require an amendment in law or rules, which can be done during the year. Flow meters would be made mandatory for bottling plants.

LIQUOR PRICES LIKELY TO GO UP

With the Government enhancing the license fee and excise duty, the liquor prices is expected to go up.

Giving details, the spokesperson said that Fixed License Fee of Rs 600 crores during 2019-20 is to be increased to Rs 625 crores while the Additional Fixed License Fee of Rs 120 crores during 2019-20 is also to be increased to Rs 385 crores under the new policy.

“Instead of any significant increase in the quota of different kinds of liquor, the increase has only been in the additional license fee, because the licensees can lift quota of liquor as per their choice, out of this Additional Fixed License Fee,” said the spokesperson adding that generally, the fees for licenses has been modestly increased or kept at the existing level.

The excise duty at retail is to be increased nominally (Rs five for PML, Rs four for IMFL and Rs 2 for beer). At wholesale stage, there is no increase in excise duty rates at PML, in the case of IMFL, the increase is approximately five percent and in the case of Beer, while the duty has been enhanced from Rs 62 per BL to Rs 68 for strong beer.

As per the new policy, the Ex-Distillery Price (EDP) for fixed quota of PML has been fixed at Rs 271.11 per case. Now, the retail licensee will be allowed to interchange his quota of PML, IMFL and Beer up to 15 percent.

The VAT paid on imported (BIO) liquor is also to be adjusted in additional fixed license fee and additional 12 percent revenue requirement for renewal of licenses next year. The L-2B license is to be issued to the retail licensees only in his area for sale of BIO brands in partnership with General Stores whose GST taxable turnover is Rs one crore during last year.

The number of retail vends have been retained at last year’s level of 5835. Bottling Fee on IMFL has been increased from Re one per bulk litre to Re one per BL (for EDP up to Rs 650 per case), Rs 1.25 per BL (for EDP 651-2000 per case) and Rs 1.50 per BL (for EDP above 2000).

The licensee can carry forward unsold quota of 2019-20 to next year, that is 2020-21 at nominal transfer fee of Rs 25 per PL (for PML), Rs 40 per PL (for IMFL), Rs 45 per PL for Imported Foreign Liquor, Rs 12 per BL for Imported Fee and Rs 10 per BL for Beer.

MARRIAGE PALACES TO FACE PENALTY FOR UNAUTHORISED CONSUMPTION

Under the new policy, the marriage palaces would be held responsible for unauthorized consumption of liquor on their premises. On first offence, penalty of Rs 25,000, on second offence Rs 50,000, and on third offence, a penalty of Rs one lakh would be charged.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/liquor-may-be-delivered-straight-to-your-door-in-mohali.html

40,01-2-20,‘Ensure minimum public inconvenience due to works’,"It should be ensured that the public experiences as little inconvenience as possible due to the works being executed as part of the Dehradun smart city project.

This was one of the suggestions made by the Dehradun smart city advisory forum in its ninth meeting held here on Friday. Presentations about the works started and proposed as part of the smart city plan were also made in the meeting.

The forum was informed about the progress made in works including establishment of water ATMs, smart toilet, smart school, smart road, Paltan Bazaar development, Parade Ground renovation and the ICCC project.

Members of the forum suggested that in addition to focusing on the quality of works underway, care should also be taken to ensure that the public faces as little inconvenience as possible due to the smart city works. It was also stated that works on smart drinking water meter, green building, Doon library, electric buses, storm water drainage and other tasks will also be started soon.

Officials also informed members of the forum that the ranking of Dehradun smart city had reached the 19th position.

41,01-2-20,Doonites express mixed reactions to Swachh Survekshan 2020,"While the Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) attempted to raise public awareness about giving positive feedback on the Swacchata app to improve the city’s ranking in Swachh Survekshan 2020, many people are still not entirely aware about the survey and have mixed reactions about it.

Kaulagarh resident Seema Saini said, “I came to deposit the house tax in MCD and one of the girls who was sitting near the counter asked for my number and then the One Time Password (OTP). She told me that it is regarding some survey of our city but she did not ask me any question regarding the survey.

They also did the same procedure with other people too. I understood it properly after checking it online. Rating the services of the city on behalf of others is unfair. At least the people should be asked about how they want to rate the services of the city. It is like cheating the people as well as the organisers of Swachh Survekshan 2020,” she said.

“Random people from MCD are asking for our phone numbers and OTP but when we told them that we can give feedback on our own, they insisted on doing it on their own.

It felt like a scam to get good marks,” opined a retired army officer Pranav Sharma.

“I learnt about the survey through Facebook, and I did rate the services of our city as I find them.

What deserves the rating of two got two and what is worthy of seven got seven. Moreover, rather than focusing on ratings and feedback, MCD could have actually done something to improve the level of sanitation in Dehradun because the litter and garbage in the open fields are still a common sight in various parts of the city,” said Karnpur resident Pritam Rana.

Balawala resident Babita Mehra said, “One of my friends told me to rate ten on the Swacchata app so I did it because it will help to raise our ranking in the country in terms of sanitation and hygiene.

I know everything around here does not justify the rating of ten but at least it would be better to be in top 100 cities of the country.”

It is pertinent to mention here that Swacch Survekshan is done in the whole country by Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) since 2016 to survey the sanitation conditions of the cities in which Dehradun ranked 267th and 384th in the year 2018 and 2019 respectively. This Friday was the last day of the survey and its result will be announced in March.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/doonites-express-mixed-reactions-to-swachh-survekshan-2020.html
42,01-2-20,Doctors save life of two-year-old child in Doon,"A private Super Speciality hospital here has claimed to save life of a two year old child whose air passage was blocked by a peanut. The parents of the child took him to the hospital in a critical state after which an operation was planed which was successful.

The Consultant, Department of Pulmonology of the hospital, Dr Vaibhav Chachra, informed, “The child was playing while eating due to which the peanut got stuck in the airway making him unable to breathe.”

“The foreign body had already done a lot of damage as the treatment was already delayed due to non-expertise in the state. The foreign body was initially tried to be removed with a flexible bronchoscope however it failed. We followed it up by performing rigid bronchoscopy which involves passing a rigid scope into the airway and then using special forceps, to remove the peanut, side by side maintaining the oxygen saturation of the child,’’ he said. Dr Chachra said that a foreign body in the airway constitutes a medical emergency and requires immediate attention. The foreign body can get stuck in many different places within the airway.

Most commonly being the right lung. The most common objects are toys, vegetative food materials such as corn, rajma, peanut, almond, metallic toys, thumb pins and safety pins. He added that parents should be educated to keep a close eye on their kids and not to distract children, or scare them when they are eating, or not to feed them in lying down position.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/doctors-save-life-of-two-year-old-child-in-doon.html
43,01-2-20,75% quota in jobs in Haryana proposed by Dushyant Chautala,"During Friday’s Cabinet meeting, Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala pushed the proposal for implementation of 75 per cent reservation in jobs in private sector for people with Haryana domicile.

A discussion on this issue took place at the Cabinet meeting held under Chief Minister Manohar Lal in New Delhi.

After Cabinet’s meeting, Dushyant, in a statement issued said, the issue of 75 per cent reservation for Haryana youth in industries’ jobs in the State was discussed.

The Chief Minister has given his approval and the proposal will be put up in upcoming Budget Session of Haryana Vidhan Sabha. To frame a policy in this regard, legal opinion will be taken on this, Dushyant said.

The suggestions from industrialists will be taken regarding this policy, he said.

Dushyant assured that all necessary procedures to implement 75 per cent will be completed soon and the BJP-JJP Government is committed to implement it.

During State Assembly polls held last year, Dushyant -led Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), had promised 75 per cent reservation for Haryana

residents in private jobs in

the State.

BJP-JJP had formed a coalition Government last year after the State Assembly elections. While the BJP had made more than 260 promises,

the JJP had made over 160

election promises.

Notably, Haryana, which has a population of more than 40 lakh in the 20-29 years age bracket, has witnessed a steep rise in unemployment over last five years. A report by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy for May-August 2019 had pegged unemployment in the state at 28.7 per cent, the highest in the country.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/75--quota-in-jobs-in-haryana-proposed-by-dushyant-chautala.html
44,01-2-20,PUNJAB BANS SALE OF ALL TYPES OF ONLINE LOTTERY SCHEMES,"To check sale of illegal lottery sales in the guise of online lottery, Punjab Government has banned the sale of all types of online lottery schemes in the State. The decision to ban the ‘Online Lottery Schemes’ was taken during the Cabinet meeting chaired by the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday.

The ban, under Section 5 of the Lotteries (Regulation) Act, 1998, would not only check the spread of illegal lottery business, which was proliferating under the guise of online lotteries, but also give a boost to the state’s tax and non-tax revenue, said an official spokesperson after the Cabinet meeting.

The decision was prompted by the fact that lottery agents now seemed to be more interested in the sale of other states’ lotteries in Punjab.

As a result, illegal lottery schemes were mushrooming under the garb of online lottery ticket sale in the State at the cost of Punjab lottery schemes.

Punjab Government is of the firm view that in order to conduct the draws of paper lottery scheme properly and enhance the state’s revenue on this account, the Online Lottery Schemes draws must be completely banned to control the menace of illegal lotteries.

The Directorate of Lotteries has been asked to liaise with the police authorities to curb the illegal lotteries in the State of Punjab, and ADGP (Law and Order) has been appointed as nodal officer to initiate action against these illegal lotteries.

The Cabinet also gave approval to the prohibition of sale of computerized and online lotteries marketed and operated through vending machines, terminals and electronic machines, as well as online scheme tickets sold, organized, conducted or promoted through internet by any State within the Indian Territory or by a foreign country.

INDUSTRIES, COMMERCE DEPT, CONTROLLER OF STORES TO BE RESTRUCTURED

To streamline and make the functioning of state Industries and Commerce Department and its separate Controller of Stores wing more efficacious, the Cabinet has decided to restructure the same by creating 38 new posts in place of 683 old ones that were either obsolete or non-essential and had been lying vacant for long — leading to savings of about Rs 24.90 crore annually and enabling greater efficiency.

The Department of Industries and Commerce had 1644 sanctioned posts, of which 650 were lying vacant while the office of Controller of Stores had 84 sanctioned ones, with 33 being unfilled since long. The 38 new posts will be created in lieu of the 683 obsolete posts.

Spokesperson said that the initiative would go a long way in improving the business environment to spur growth and employment generation in the State.

With the changing industrial landscape, the need was felt to redefine the role, mandate and scope of services to be provided by the Department of Industries and Commerce and Controller of Stores.

Accordingly, detailed deliberations were held on restructuring the Department, keeping in view its aims and objectives.

DEPTS DIRECTED TO FILL CRITICAL POSTS

The Cabinet has directed all departments to expedite the process of filling up all critical vacant posts to ensure time-bound and effective implementation of important projects. This was imperative for the holistic and speedy development of the state in all its vital aspects, felt the Cabinet.

APPROVES RESTRUCTURING OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT DEPT’S ENGINEERING WING

Cabinet also approved restructuring of the Rural Development and Panchayats Department’s engineering wing to ensure holistic rural development across the State.

Under its restructuring plan, the Cabinet also gave nod for recruitment of vacant feeding cadre posts and the vacancies that would result from restructuring.

The move would be instrumental in smooth and effective implementation of government policies and schemes in the rural sector, said the spokesperson.

PUNJAB TO GIVE PREFERENCE IN RESERVATION TO ESM, THEIR WARDS, GRANDCHILDREN OF GALLANTRY AWARDEES ON LINEAL HIERARCHY PRINCIPLE

In compliance with the observations made by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, Punjab Cabinet on Friday decided to fix preference in reservation to ex-servicemen, wards of ex-servicemen or the grandchildren of gallantry award winners according to the widely prevalent Lineal Hierarchy principle.

Accepting the proposal mooted by the Department of Defence Services Welfare, the Cabinet gave its nod to amend Proviso 3 of Rule 4 of Punjab Recruitment of Ex-Servicemen Rules-1982.

The amended proviso envisages that when an ex-serviceman is not available for recruitment against a reserved vacancy, and further no wife or dependent child of an ex-serviceman is available for recruitment against a reserved vacancy, such a vacancy shall be reserved to be filled in by recruitment of the grandchild of a Gallantry Award

Winner.This will, however, only apply in case the benefit of reservation has not been availed of by any of the children or dependents of such winner or by the winner himself, subject to the conditions specified in the second proviso.

It may be recalled that the Punjab Government has already decided to give benefit of the reservation to the grandchildren of the gallantry award winners.

Meanwhile, the Cabinet approved a job to the next of kin of Major Ravi Inder Singh Sandhu of the Indian Armed Forces in recognition of his outstanding services. Major Sandhu had died while serving in United Nations Mission in Sudan.The Cabinet also decided to extend to the next of kin benefits equivalent to those permitted under the policy of ‘Appointment of Honor and Gratitude’.

Notably, Major Sandhu of Signals Corps was serving in UN Mission in Sudan and died on November 6, 2019, during mission due to cardio pulmonary failure. As the officer has not been declared a Battle Casualty, his next of kin cannot be provided a Government job under any existing policy and therefore Cabinet’s approval was warranted for the same, said an official spokesperson.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-bans-sale-of-all-types-of-online-lottery-schemes.html

49,01-2-20,Massive amount of heroin seized: Capt warns drug peddlers,"With the Punjab Police busting a major narco-terror racket having alleged links to one of India’s biggest drug smuggling kingpins, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday asserted that he would not spare anyone found implicated in the case, irrespective of their political affiliations.

Capt Amarinder made it clear that the State Government would not allow drug smugglers, narco gangsters and narco-terrorists to spread their wings in the State, which had witnessed massive decline in the number of deaths due to drug abuse as a result of the efforts of the government and the police.

The deaths come down from 114 in 2018 to 47 in 2019, said Capt Amarinder while addressing a press conference along with the state police chief Dinkar Gupta, adding that his Government would not give up the fight against drugs till the problem is rooted out completely.

Giving details of Thursday night’s arrests and seizures, the Chief Minister said that the house in Sultanwind village, from which the police seized nearly 195 kilograms of heroin along with chemicals last night in the Amritsar border region, allegedly belonged to Anwar Masih, who was a member of the Subordinate Services Board (SSB) – an appointee of the previous SAD-BJP government.

“Investigations are in progress to ascertain Masih’s involvement, who claims to have rented out the house to the accused arrested last night by the STF Border Range,” said Capt Amarinder.

However, Masih had, so far, failed to produce any written rent agreement and the people of the area were also unaware of any tenants living there, he said adding that preliminary investigations had revealed that the accused had been using the premises for the past one month.

Congratulating the police on the seizure and arrests, Capt Amarinder said that initial investigations suggested that the drug network was linked with Simranjit Singh Sandhu, one of the biggest drug mafiosi of the country, who has recently been detained in Italy.“We would seek remand of Sandhu, who holds an Australian passport and was detained in Italy on an Interpol police from the Gujarat authorities,” he said.

The Chief Minister said that the seizure appeared to be a part of the consignment of 300 kgs of drugs that arrived in Mandavi in Gujarat last year, and of which 200 kg was smuggled into Punjab. The consignment had been traced to Sandhu, while efforts were also on to trace the other big fish involved in the case.

Giving further details of last night’s seizure and arrests, the Chief Minister said that six persons, including an Afghan national identified as Armaan Basharmal, have so far been arrested, with 194.15 kgs of heroin and several kgs of chemicals seized from their possession.

A lot of equipment used for refining of heroin and mixing it with other products has also been seized from Armaan, who had come to Punjab a week ago.

Interrogation of Sandhu and further investigations in the case would lead to others involved in the case and would also reveal whether the drugs were meant for Punjab or for distribution outside the state, he said.

Patting the Government and Special Task Force’s back for their “success in combating the drug problem”, the Chief Minister said that 35500 cases have been registered under the NDPS Act between March 2017 and January 2020 (before the present case).

In this period, 44,500 smugglers or peddlers have been arrested and 11000 are currently in prison, said the Chief Minister, adding that these efforts had led to a dramatic increase in the seizure of heroin (1100 kg from March 2017 to Jan 2020, in addition to 194.15 kgs seized last night).

As far as rehabilitation was concerned, the Buddy and DAPO programmes were working well and so far around 3.5 lakh drug victims had visited the rehabilitation, OOAT and de-addiction centres.

Unfortunately, Punjab, along with Delhi, had over the years emerged as a lucrative market for drugs, encouraging smugglers from other states and narco terrorists from Pakistan to push narcotics into the State.

“Punjab Government is working closely with other northern states, sharing regular information, to combat the problem,” said Capt Amarinder.

With the DGPs of these states meeting every month, there was significant progress in cracking down on the drug smugglers, he said, pointing out that the Chief Ministers had also agreed to meet every six months.

He recalled that his government had given a list of drug dealers to Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which had led to some change for the positive, with the Canadian authorities taking action against the smugglers.

In response to a question, the Chief Minister emphasized that industrial development and employment generation were the key to weaning youth away from the drugs menace, which was affecting the whole world, including the advanced nations.

Replying to another question, the Chief Minister said that he would look into the need to revise and add more chapters about drug abuse awareness in school curriculum.

HAVE SOUGHT ANTI-DRONE DEVICES FROM CENTRE

Admitting that use of drones by Pakistan in recent months to smuggle weapons and drugs into Punjab was a matter of serious concern for the State, the Chief Minister said that the State Government had sought anti-drone devices from the Centre to tackle the problem.

The Chief Minister said that he had taken up the issue with the Centre when the first case of drones came to light in August last year. “We are trying to get the anti-drone devices to check this problem…I think Israel has the technology and Centre is working on that,” he added.

“Punjab has become a hub of drug trafficking because of the money involved…The drugs are coming into Punjab basically from Afghanistan. But now, cases have come into light with drugs coming in from Uri, Chamba, Delhi, which could be from Nepal, and south western side,” said Capt Amarinder.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/massive-amount-of-heroin-seized--capt-warns-drug-peddlers.html

These 5034 candidates were selected by the department in the year 2018 but the legal tangles prevented the department to give them appointment.The secretary education, R Meenakshi Sundaram gave the order to the director education for appointment of these candidates waiting for job for almost two years now. In the order the secretary has directed that the orders of the SC dated January 14 should be followed while giving appointment to these teachers.

He said that in accordance to the order of SC, the guest teachers appointed in the year 2015 and removed from service on March 2018 should be considered for appointment in the posts which fall vacant in future.

Sundaram said the department has also competed the process of promotion on 1949 posts of Lecturers and Licensed Teachers (LT) but since the issue of promotion is pending in High Court (HC), this list is placed before the court in a sealed envelope.

The issue-

In an attempt to provide teachers on more than 5000 posts the education department initiated the fill these posts by guest teachers since the process of permanent appointments is long.

However some of the former guest teachers challenged the drive in the SC which issued a stay on the appointment of guest teachers. The issue was pending before the SC since then.

However the case could not come up for hearing as the constitutional bench of SC consisting of five judges headed CJI was engaged in a day to day hearing of the politically sensitive Ramjanambhoomi- Babri Masjid land dispute case. The case came up for hearing in another bench of SC on January 14 which gave its verdict in favour of government.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-orders-guest-teachers----appointment-at-vacant-posts.html

She stated that innovative ideas and new technologies should be adopted to ensure safety of women in public places. Pointing that the number of women constable is very less in police, she said, “When, we are here to review Beijing +25 declaration and discuss gender equality.

69,01-2-20,Expectations soar high from Union Budget 2020-21,"With the Union Budget of India being presented by the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1 for the financial year 2020-2021, Ranchiites have high hopes for the coming year. Income tax concessions, reduced prices of basic commodities, improvement in the education sector are what the people of Ranchi are looking for.

Kunal Ajmani, President Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI) said, “I feel there should be a reduction in personal income just the way it has been done in the corporate tax. The MSME’s which give employment to a major part should be given incentives for exports.

As exports would increase, the expansion, income, production and employment will also simultaneously increase. As for the E-commerce there should have some strict laws so that the local traders, retailers can have a boost in their business.”

“In the education sector, changes need to be made regarding higher education. There is a lack of teachers and qualified lecturers should be appointed on a permanent basis instead of contractual basis and this should also be a continuous process. At the Ranchi Veterinary College, where there are about 125 posts and apart from 15- 20 posts all are lying vacant. Appointments have not been made for past 13 to 14 years now.

Appointment of teaching and non- teaching staff needs to be done to maintain the standard of education. For rural development, animal husbandry needs to be promoted,” said Dr Ashok Kumar Shrivastava, Retired Dean of Ranchi Veterinary College.

“The minimum wages of the people who work as daily labourers and daily workers is very less. These are the basic human rights a person needs and in India this is not taken care of. Another factor that needs to be considered is the inflation.

The prices for everything required for daily living has escalated over the past few years,” said Debolina Sen Hirani, a lawyer with the Jharkhand High Court.

“A significant amount of the budget should be allocated for the education and the healthcare sector and this should also include mental health. The budget should also focus on investment in those areas which can generate employment and create more job opportunities for the youth. Over 30 per cent of our youth is facing anxiety and depression so it is extremely important to address this issue. It should also focus on sports and the development of sportsmen should be taken care of,” said Shilpi Singh, faculty member at TIME.

Ashish Kumar, a city based garment manufacturing businessman said, “The textile industry has maximum man power utilization and in the last year more than 30 Lakh people lost their jobs in this sector.

The Government should introduce subsidies in this industry to promote start ups. There is also a lack of training centres for skilled manpower which needs to be taken care of. The GST slab should also be standard at five percent.”

“There is a high rate of inflation in the fruit and vegetable market and the government should strive to keep the prices under control.

LPG rates should also be reduced. The budget should also focus on the development of young children which are the future of the country. Most importantly the budget should also include some women welfare schemes,” said Sunita Singh, a home maker.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/expectations-soar-high-from-union-budget-2020-21.html
70,01-2-20,Protest against CAA continues,"A day after face-off between Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA) protesters and supporters, activists under the banner of All India Minority Social Welfare Front staged a massive dharna in front of deputy commissioner’s office on Friday.

Though the administration has imposed Section 144 in view of clash on Thursday at Sakchi, but the officials allowed the front to stage demonstration as the organisation had taken the approval before the imposition of Section 144. The Section has been imposed till February 14.

Congress leader and former MP Furkan Ansari said that the Central Government has hurt the sentiments of our National leaders like Mahatma Gandhi by implementing CAA. He asked minorities to unite to oppose the (CAA). He said the Union Government wants to divide the people of the country.

He alleged that the BJP-led Central government was trying to implement NRC in the country to target a particular community. He said that minorities are being targeted under the act.

Participants in large numbers carrying posters and placards against BJP-led Government at the Centre, raised slogans against bringing in the 'divisive' Citizenship Amendment Act.

With ongoing protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) across the nation, the district administration had made elaborate security arrangements. In view of face-off yesterday security forces were deployed at the site of dharna.

JMM leader Babar Khan said that the protest will continue till Government takes back this Act.

The Act seeks to amend the definition of illegal immigrant for Hindu, Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist and Christian immigrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, who have lived in India without documentation. It discriminates against Muslims and violates the right to equality enshrined in the Constitution.

Meanwhile, Hindu Utsav Samiti Samiti led a delegation at DC office and handed over memorandum to deputy commissioner. An activist said the CAA was in the larger national interest.

He said it was not designed to oust anyone from the country, rather it was enacted with the view to give shelter to minorities including Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis, Jainis and Buddhists being persecuted in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. He said those opposing CAA were provoking public anger with vested interests and ulterior motives.

The anti-CAA lobby is trying to gain political advantage by misleading people and creating an environment of terror, he said.

He added that Congress, JMM and other opposition parties were spreading rumours about CAA. In this situation, those supporting the CAA should come forward, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/protest-against-caa-continues.html

72,01-2-20,"Body of man found near pond, kin cry murder","Body of a 35-year-old man, working as dailywage worker was found in the bushes on Fitkoria-Bahadurpur main road in Bengabad area of Giridih district on Friday morning. The youth has been identified as Panchu Singh, a native of Bahadurpur village, who had been living with his mother, wife and children for a long time.

What makes the incident more traumatic is the fact that Panchu was an only man, the only support of his families, as his father passed away a few years ago, locals said.

On Friday morning, as soon as news of Panchu’s murder spread, his house was thronged by a large number of people, who tried to calm his inconsolable mother, but failed as she kept fainting between snatches of lucidity.

Panchu Singh left home on Thursday night after telling his family members that he was going to Patharodih village one of his friends. He never returned. His wife filed a missing report with the Bengabad police on the late night of January 30 and his phone remained switched off. The report mentioned that on the night he went missing, Panchu had left home alone.

Meanwhile, police in-Charge Prasant Kumar said that they have been able to crack the murder mystery. Police have detained 20 peoples for questioning.

“During the investigation, we touched on various points and have come to know about youths (who cannot be named) who were arrested, added the Officer in Charge.

75,01-2-20,Law of jungle rules supreme in Burugurikela: Officials,"The purpose behind the gruesome killings in Chaibasa’s Burugurikela village was to suppress the voices that rose against the dictatorial demands of a particular group, the suspects have told the police during interrogation. A senior police official involved in the investigation on Friday said that the murder suspects had asked the villagers to surrender their Government cards and the ones who vocally resisted the demands were silenced.

“It is not wise to give the incident a tag. Pathalgadi is only one aspect of it. There is no mobile network connectivity in the village. Political parties do not go there even during campaigning. There is an extreme dearth of social, political and economic dialogue in the village where the incident occurred,” he said, adding that lawlessness was rampant in such areas and villagers there do not believe even in the police.

The Pathalgadi movement in Jharkhand, which has its epicenter in Khunti, advocates the idea of having liberated lands in the interiors where the administration’s intervention is prohibited. The idea of having liberated land generates partly from the tribal practice of Pathalgadi and partly from the lack of active presence of Government and authorities in the far flung villages, said the police official.

“The suspects have said that they wanted to silence the voices that refuse to oblige their demands. If people can kill seven villagers only for refusing to surrender their Government cards, we can well understand the situation in the village,” he said, highlighting the extent of lawlessness in the area.

In 2017, villagers in parts of Khunti district held Pathalgadi –a practice of demarcating the borders of a village and declaring it as liberated land through writings on stone plaques – and allegedly prohibited entry of the administration in their villages. Soon after coming to power in the end of 2019, Chief Minister Hemant Soren announced that sedition charges against Pathalgadi supporters will be scrapped.

The gruesome murder of seven villagers in West Singhbhum on January 17 once again drew the attention of the Government towards Pathalgadi. Soon after the killings, media reports highlighted that the seven deceased men had allegedly had a tiff with some Pathalgadi supporters a day before they were killed. They were reportedly abducted for protesting the Pathalgadi supporters’ demand of surrendering their Government identity and welfare cards. The next day, police found their bodies with their throat slit from jungles near the village.

“We are focusing on the incident and investigating accordingly. We will make sure that the culprits are not spared,” said Chaibasa Superintendent of Police Indrajit Mahatha. The Government has constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe into the killings, and its report is likely to reach Ranchi within a couple of days.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/law-of-jungle-rules-supreme-in-burugurikela--officials.html
76,01-2-20,Rush to register name at employment exchange,"After Chief Minister Hemant Soren directed Chief Secretary DK Tiwari to activate all employment exchanges across the State and start registration of youths above 16 years of age, employment exchange in State Capital witnessed rush of people going for registration.

Many people especially youngsters were seen standing in queue for registration of their name and address in hope that when State Government goes for mass recruitment drive they get preference.

Large number of youths standing in queue was also due to ruling party (Jharkhand Mukti Morcha) poll promise which had promised to provide unemployment allowance to youth in the tune of Rs 5,000 and Rs 7,000 depending on their educational qualification.

The Chief Minister has said that soon after registration, necessary action will be taken to provide unemployment allowance to the unemployed youth and the proposed incentive amount to be given by the government and to provide them with available employment opportunities.

Abdul Rehman, a post graduate student and resident from Bokaro who was spotted at Employment Exchange for registration said, “I have come here for registration of my name with employment exchange. The registration will help the Government in keeping a record about number of unemployed youths in the State.”

Rehman said that large numbers of youths have come for registration as in last five years the Government has failed to create any employment opportunities. Echoing the views of Rehman, another youth Abhijeet Kumar a post graduate from Raksha Shakti University said, “I have completed my post graduate in criminology from Raksha Shakti University. But it nearly a year that I have passed from institute still I am jobless as there was no placement in institute.”

The student also claimed that in Jharkhand unemployment is biggest issue as earlier governments had failed to provide any employment opportunities. He said, “The Raghubar Das government to fill up vacant posts in various government departments had carried out examination though Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission (JSSC 2014), Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) 2016 and recruitment for Panchayat Secretary, but the Government had failed to declare results of any of these examinations.” While JSSC examination is cancelled, the JPSC results are still awaited while Panchayat Secretary mains examination is yet to be held.

Meanwhile, Employment Officer Manu Kumar said, “Large number of youths has come for registration of their name and address at exchange after reading news in the newspaper where Hemant Soren has directed Chief Secretary DK Tiwari to activate all employment exchanges across the State.”

Manu Kumar also said that apart from registration state labour department is going to hold a Rozgar Mela on February 7 at Hehal ground.

Eight policemen and a local resident were also injured when the psycho criminal Subhash Batham, 40, opened fire at them during the siege and rescue operation in Kasaria village, police said.

The children were confined to the basement of the house.

“The accused was killed and there were about 23 children who were rescued safely,” Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi told reporters at a hurriedly called press conference here at 1:20 am on Friday.

The hostage drama began on Thursday evening when Batham, a murder accused, invited children between the age of six months and 15 years to his daughter’s birthday party.

Interestingly, while a letter thrown by Batham pointed out that he committed the crime as he was unhappy over not getting a house under PM Awas Yojna as well as free toilet, DGP OP Singh, who retired on Friday, claimed that the accused had demanded a ransom of Rs 1 crore per child for their safe release.

Batham, who was out on bail, had also demanded the withdrawal of the murder case against him.

The spokesperson said that later, when the criminal, went mum for some time after midnight, the police with the help of the villagers broke open the back door of the house and went inside. But on seeing the policemen, Batham opened fire injuring four policemen. He was killed when police retaliated,

She suffered a head injury in the attack, but the exact cause of death would be known after post-mortem, he said.

Agarwal said Batham wanted to talk to the local MLA but refused to speak to him when he arrived.

Agarwal claimed that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was awake till 2 am and was continuously monitoring the operation from his residence with strict instructions that the children should be safe in any condition.

Police recovered a country-made gun, a rifle, about two dozen cartridges and two dozen country-made bombs. The IG said this indicated that he could have kept the children hostage for days, and perhaps planned to blow up the house.

Shah posted on Twitter, “It is praiseworthy that Uttar Pradesh Police with its courage and astute strategy rescued all 23 children who were held hostage in Farrukhabad.’’

Singh has had an eventful tenure and will be remembered for introducing the police commissionerate system in two districts of the state. He also has the credit of ensuring peace in the state after the Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya issue and incident-free Kumbh Mela.

Meanwhile, IG Amitabh Thakur has raised question over discrimination in organising the farewell ceremony on the retirement of three same grade officers.

In a social media comment, Thakur said that on January 31, three officers, all of same rank, were retiring from service but they will be given farewell separately. He mentioned that farewell of DG (Special Enquiry) Mahendra Modi was fixed for the night of January 31, but the same for DGP OP Singh has been fixed for February 1.

Thakur claimed that the farewell of third IPS officer, DG (Intelligence), Bhawesh Kumar, was also fixed for January 31 but now he had no information about his farewell party.

Thakur questioned the discrimination when all the three officers are of same rank and also retired on the same day.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/dgp-op-singh-retires.html
99,01-2-20,Economic Survey disappointing: Maya “Modi govt selling dreams to people’,"Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Friday hit out at the Central government, saying the Economic Survey tabled in Parliament on Friday was “disappointing” and an example of how the Narendra Modi government was selling dreams to people despite rising inflation, unemployment and poverty in the country.

In a series of tweets, Mayawati said: “Because of the wrong policies and programmes of the Centre, rising poverty, inflation, unemployment etc. have led to constant shrinking of the per capita/family income of the people, yet the BJP government is selling dreams to them. The Economic Survey presented in Parliament today is an example of this.”

“The address by the Honourable President (Ram Nath Kovind) is an account of government’s work and whatever he said before the joint sitting of Parliament today was detached from reality,” she said in another tweet in Hindi.

“The Economic Survey presented by the Central government has left the people of the country disappointed,” she further said.

“I have been suffering from common cold and cough since 10 days after my coming home from China. Suspecting infections of Coronavirus, I preferred to undergo medical tests for confirmation,” said the medico Mrutyunjaya Muni.

Promptly, the authorities asked him to undergo medical tests at the Kandhamal District Headquarters Hospital (DHH) here. As the hospital is not equipped with advanced facilities for medical examination to detect Coronavirus, he was referred to the SCB Medical College Hospital.

CDMO Rajashree Patnaik said, “The youth is a final year MBBS student in China. He came home in Phulbani on January 11. He is a chronic asthma patient. As he is a medical student, he visited the hospital after he was down with common cold. Initially, he was admitted in an isolated ward and kept under observation. However, there is no such facility available at the DHH here.

Notably, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon) had held a Rath of the Lord in Mumbai on Thursday. The untimely Rath Yatra has triggered strong resentment in Odisha. Besides, sevayats and leaders of various political parties have hit out at the Iskcon Rath Yatra.

“We cannot call the untimely chariot procession as the Rath Yatra. The Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA) should stop them from calling the untimely chariot festival as Jagannath Rath Yatra,” said Ram Charan Das Maharaj, a former member of the Shreemandir management committee.

SJTA Ritual Administrator Jitendra Sahu said, “The temple administration has no information about the Iskcon Rath Yatra so far. During a recent meeting chaired by Puri Gajapati Maharaja Dibyasingh Deb in Bhubaneswar, the Iskcon representatives had committed not to hold untimely Rath Yatras.”

He said the SJTA would hold talks again with the Iskcon authorities soon.

Congress MLA Suresh Routray demanded that the State Government strongly condemn the untimely Rath Yatra of Lord Jaganath organised by the Iskcon.

Echoing similar views, State BJP spokesperson Golak Mohapatra also demanded action against the organisers.

“We will place a demand before the State Government to discuss with the organisers of Rath Yatra and ensure that festivals associated with Lord Jagannath are held as per the tradition,” said Mohapatra.

107,01-2-20,PhD student in China is State’s 1st coronavirus suspect,"A 25-year-old Ranchi man pursuing PhD in China has become the first suspect of Coronavirus in Jharkhand, albeit only on the basis of the fact that he was in China when the mysterious virus was first reported. The suspect, whose identity is undisclosed, got admitted in the isolation ward of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) hours after the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared Novel Coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern.

However, he refused to stay at RIMS and insisted that concerned health authorities keep a medical watch on him while he is allowed to stay at home. “The man has not shown any symptoms of the viral infection yet. However, we have sent his samples for lab test and kept him under observation as he was in China during the Coronavirus outbreak,” said Rakesh Dayal, Jharkhand Director of Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme.

RIMS Superintendent Dr. Vivek Kashyap said that the man’s samples of mucus and saliva have been sent to the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV) in Pune and the hospital authorities were waiting for the results. “We have sent his samples to the laboratory for tests. Although he wanted to stay at home and we allowed him to leave, we have kept him under surveillance,” said Kashyap.

RIMS has set up a five-bed special isolation ward to admit patients suffering from symptoms similar to that of Coronavirus in Ranchi. Since the airborne virus can enter a person’s body through his respiratory tract and is considered highly communicable, the suspected patients at RIMS will be kept at the isolation ward. “If needed, we will arrange for more beds and a bigger isolation ward only for suspected cases of Coronavirus,” Kashyap said.

Health Minister of Jharkhand, Banna Gupta on Friday told media persons that health department was ready with all necessary measures for dealing with the health emergency. “We are taking the matter seriously and have made necessary arrangements to deal with the emergency,” he said.

The first case of Novel Coronavirus in India was reported from Kerala on Thursday. The patient who tested positive in Kerala was also pursuing higher studies in Wuhan University in China and probably contracted the virus from there. The IDSP has been in constant touch with the suspect in Ranchi in order to ensure necessary interventions in case he complains of symptoms similar to that of Coronavirus patients.

So far, India has screened around 45,000 passengers arriving from China and one positive case has been detected. China on Thursday saw 38 new deaths due to the virus, taking the death toll to 170 worldwide.

People traveling to Jharkhand from countries affected by Coronavirus will be kept under surveillance for at least 28 days since landing in Ranchi, IDSP students have said. The surveillance will be a part of the State’s precautionary mechanism to curtail the spread of the airborne virus in Jharkhand. Jharkhand has also sounded a precautionary alert for Coronavirus, which infects the respiratory tract of patients and causes symptoms similar to common flu.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/phd-student-in-china-is-state---s-1st-coronavirus-suspect.html

109,01-2-20,Will make Ganga confluence of faith and economy: Yogi Adityanath,"Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that his government would make the river Ganga a confluence of economy and faith.

Addressing a gathering at the conclusion of the five-day Ganga Yatra at Atal Ghat in Kanpur on Friday, Yogi Adityanath said, “Maa Ganga has been the centre of our faith since time immemorial. Now we will make it a confluence of economy as well as faith in accordance with the mantra given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.”

The chief minister said that if the Ganga was linked to the economy, the biggest beneficiaries would be the crores of poor people whose livelihood depended on the river Ganga.

Referring to the Namami Gange mission promoted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to rejuvenate the Ganges, the chief minister said the mission had been accomplished and the river Ganga was now clean and pure.

Yogi said when the Ganga Yatra started, the inclement weather had become a cause of concern but today the weather was perfect and this was the mercy of Goddess Ganga.

The chief minister appealed to the people to stop the use of chemicals in villages on the banks of the Ganga and take a pledge to make the river clean and ever-flowing.

He said that earlier the most critical point of the Ganga was Kanpur as due to the high level of pollution in the river, aquatic animals especially the fish were found dead in large number at Jajmau. But the Namami Gange mission had brought about a total transformation and now the river’s water was clean.

He said this could be done successfully because of the leadership of Prime Minister Modi and the united efforts of the UP government and the people who had faith in river Ganga.

The chief minister said the UP government’s Ganga Yatra had started from Bijnor and Ballia and both routes converged in Kanpur after covering 1338 kms in five days.

He said all the schemes announced during the yatra would help in the makeover of towns and villages along the river.

Hitting out at the opposition, Yogi said their canard that law and order was worse in UP had been proved wrong. He said this could be substantiated by the fact that on the day of Ganga aarti and this special assembly, the UP Police had rescued 26 children held hostage and had eliminated their captor.

Earlier, Yogi Adityanath performed Ganga aarti and offered prayer at Atal Ghat here.

Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, state ministers Satya Dev Pachauri, Satish Mahana, Neelima Katiyar Devendra Singh Bholey and many BJP leaders were present on the occasion.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/will-make-ganga-confluence-of-faith-and-economy--yogi-adityanath.html

The police has kept several complaints against corruption in the state in cold storage, while it was quick to file an FIR in frivolous and mischievous complaint by an NGO against a Goa Church body, he alleged.

Speaking about the issue, BJP’s Goa general secretary and former MP Narendra Sawaikar said, “There is no point in dragging children on the street for this issue. The person who has filed the complaint must have found something unconvincing in the rally,” he said.

Citizens have the right to agitate but it should be for a genuine cause and students from school should not be brought on the streets, he said.”It has happened even in Delhi. Where is this heading? Why are we trying to pollute minds of children?” he questioned.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/goa--cong-condemns-fir-against-church-wing-over-protest-rally.html

125,01-2-20,3 PFI activists held in connection with violence during protest in Lucknow,"Three members of the Popular Front of India (PFI) were arrested on Friday for their involvement in the December 19 anti-CAA protests in Lucknow which had turned violent, police said.

Shakeel ur Rehman, Shabi Khan and Mohammed Arshad were among the conspirators behind the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act violence that had rocked the State Capital, a police spokesperson said in a statement issued here.

The trio were held from Hasanganj Police Station area of the city.

“They were arrested following a tip-off by their associates who were arrested earlier. Shakeel ur Rehman, Shabi Khan and Mohammed Arshad are linked to PFI, and they used to instigate people,” the police said.

On December 31, last year, the Uttar Pradesh Police had sought a ban on the PFI, days after its complicity was suspected in the recent statewide violent protests against the amended citizenship law.

The then Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police O P Singh had said that they had written to the Union Home Ministry, seeking a ban on the PFI after its Uttar Pradesh head, Wasim and 16 other activists were arrested for allegedly masterminding the violence in the state capital.

“We have written to the Union Home Ministry, recommending that the PFI should be banned,” Singh had told reporters here.

Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya had said that the PFI in a way was the “incarnation” of the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) — an organisation banned by the government in 2001 for allegedly being involved in a series of terror acts in the country.

Stressing that PFI’s role has been “established” in vandalism in the State, Maurya had told reporters: “The truth is emerging through the probe. If SIMI reappears in any form, it will be crushed.” When asked if the PFI will be banned, Maurya said, “The process is on. Such organisations will not be allowed to grow. If needed, they will be banned.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/3-pfi-activists-held-in-connection-with-violence-during-protest-in-lucknow.html
126,01-2-20,India’s Pad Man to address Oxford Union,"The Oxford Union, one of the oldest student debating societies in the world which commenced its functions in 1823, will host India’s Pad Man, Arunachalam Muruganantham as a keynote speaker to its global audience on February 11, 2020.

A school drop out from a village in Coimbatore district in Tamil Nadu, Muruganantham holds an important position in the hearts of rural as well town women in the lower strata of society. His pathbreaking innovation helped women all over the world with a fresh lease of life, in sanitation, hygiene and health. The machine he designed to manufacture low-cost sanitary napkins and the products have become part of national folklore while Muruganantham earned a cult status through the ‘sanitary revolution’.

No, he is not going to speak in the Oxford Union about the hardship he had to endure to design and develop the low cost but hygienic napkins. Muruganantham is carrying with him a part of the ancient Indian ethos of “Vasudaiva Kutumbakam” (the world itself is a family) and Maanava seva Madhava seva (serving the poor is same as serving the God). “Please don’t be under the impression that I’ll be speaking about charity. I’ll never use that word. My request to the Western world is to be responsible and alert to the society from day one. One should show his compassion and love to the society even as he/she starts building the enterprises from Day One. We should not accumulate wealth and postpone the responsibility to a later day. That’s not fair. It should happen side by side,” Muruganantham told The Pioneer.

He said though he was happy to address the Oxford Union, he has no political views. “It is the same podium from where the likes of Sir Winston Churchill, President Ronal Regan, Albert Einstein and Dalai Lama. I don’t have any qualifications to speak like them and would like to remain the same Kongunadu man (the south west region of Tamil Nadu is known as Kongunaadu). But my love for humanity made me accept the invitation,” he said.

“It would be a great privilege to host you as a guest. We would be thrilled to host you for an address,” Sara Dube, president, Oxford Union said in her letter to Muruganantham.

So, Oxford Union, please stand by for an enthralling speech in rustic Indian English from a rural person in Tamil Nadu who took the country by storm.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/india---s-pad-man-to-address-oxford-union.html

Ramesh, a Rajya Sabha MP, has said in his plea that the RTI amendment Act, 2019 and the Right to Information (Term of Office, Salaries, Allowances and Other Terms and Conditions of Service) Rules, 2019 “collectively violate” the fundamental right to information of all citizens which is guaranteed under the Constitution.

Union Minister for MSME Nitin Gadkari launched Khadi wrist watches, specially designed and manufactured by Titan, in the presence of Minister of State Pratap Chandra Sarangi, Chairman KVIC VK Saxena and CEO Titan Shri Ravi Kant.

The beautifully designed Khadi edition watch sport a silver dial displaying the iconic Charkha with the hand woven signature fabric in the background and on the straps. The grey-black texture of the watch depicts the timeless significance of the watch. Simplistic in its looks, the watch is a representation of the ‘Spirit of Khadi’.

Applauding the efforts of KVIC and Titan, Gadkari said, “Mahatma Gandhi believed that every revolution of Charkha spins peace, goodwill and love. Two things that were closest to Mahatma were Khadi and his watch.

This initiative endeavors to create a product which is a combination of both the products closest to his heart.”

Highlighting the efforts taken by KVIC to promote contemporary Khadi products in the market, Chairman KVIC said, “Khadi is not the age-old fabric anymore, it is the timeless fabric of transformation which is transforming the lives in rural areas every day. KVIC is exploring the uncharted waters and experimenting new trends and designs which could appeal the Indian as well the International markets. “Saxena said that they have opened doors for new thoughts and ideas which could leverage the Khadi fabric and help growth of Khadi and Village Industries, thus promoting the rural entrepreneurs and Khadi artisans.

“ It is time to uphold our badge of honor — Khadi, and provide it the respect and dignity it deserves,” he said.

Saxena said that one square meter of Khadi fabric will be used for manufacturing 10 Titan watches. 1000 such limited edition timeless timepieces are proposed to be sold for now.”

131,01-2-20,"President hails CAA, calls it ‘historic’ amid Opp protest","Amidst shouts of shame-shame from the black band sporting Opposition MPs, President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday hailed the new Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) as “historic” and a fulfilment of Mahatma Gandhi’s wish even as he denounced violence “in the name of protests” saying it weakened the society and the nation. The President, however, did not refer to the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in his address even as he hastened to stress the importance of “mutual discussion and debate” to consolidate democracy.

As the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) has set the ruling and opposition parties on the path of confrontation since its passing last December, the two sides again stood face to face in the central hall with the government again affirming that CAA was the urgent need of the time by highlighting suppression of minorities in Pakistan and also citing the ‘Nanakana Sahib’ incident in the neibhouring country.

“While condemning the atrocities on the minorities in Pakistan, I urge the world community to take cognizance of it and take necessary steps in this regard,” the President said.

The reference to the CAA and abrogation of autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 drew loud and prolonged thumping of benches by the ruling MPs, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Ministers Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and others, while the opposition members shouted “shame-shame”. The President looked up for a few seconds but went on reading the written address.

The address devoted generous space to the nullifying of article 370 and the new Kashmir. The President whose address is customarily the account of the government policies, said the historic measure led to the fulfilling of wishes of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the founder president of the Rs Bharatiya Jana SanghRs , who wanted that all states and union territories should be having equal fundamental rights and benefits .

Congress president Sonia Gandhi and the party’s leader in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad sat in the back rows in the Central Hall of Parliament instead of the front seats allotted to them to mark their protest against the law.

Delivering his 70-minute address in Hindi which marks the start of the Parliament’s Budget session, Kovind pointed out that mutual discussions and debates strengthen democracy.

“At the same time, any kind of violence in the name of protests weakens the society and the nation.” he said without directly referring to the anti-CAA protests in the country some of which have witnessed violence.

He said Mahatma Gandhi had said that Hindus and Sikhs of Pakistan, who do not wish to live there, can come to India and it is the duty of the Indian government to ensure a normal life for them.

“It is our responsibility to honour this wish of the founding fathers of our nation. I am happy that both the Houses of Parliament have fulfilled this wish, by enacting the Citizenship Amendment Act. At a time when the country is celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, all of you have given paramount consideration to this sentiment,” Kovind said.

Referring to atrocities on minorities in Pakistan, the President said, “We have all seen what happened in Nankana Sahib recently. It is the responsibility of all of us to bring the atrocities being committed in Pakistan to the notice of the global community.” The Nankana Sahib gurudwara in Pakistan was attacked by a mob earlier this month.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/president-hails-caa--calls-it----historic----amid-opp-protest.html
132,01-2-20,"PM to NDA members: No need to feel defensive, push CAA strongly","Against the backdrop of ongoing anti-CAA stir across the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday asked the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) members to aggressively defend the new citizenship law that grants Indian nationality to the six persecuted minorities, barring Muslims, from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

Modi sought MPs to take on the Opposition’s charge that the amended citizenship law discriminated against Muslims and said that minorities are as much “ours as other citizens are”.

A BJP ally said after the meeting that Modi asked the NDA leaders, who met to strategise as Parliament’s Budget Session began here on Friday, to go on the front-foot to take on the Opposition’s charge that the amended citizenship law discriminated against Muslims.

The Government has done nothing wrong as far as the CAA is concerned and has no reason to feel defensive about, he said.

The NDA leaders also hailed Modi for the Bodo accord and settlement of Bru tribe members in Tripura.

Opposition leaders have said they will raise the issue of nationwide protests against the CAA in the Session, as they accused the Modi Government of arrogance and making no effort to reach out to protesters.

The sporadic protests in Delhi and other cities have brought CAA at the centre-stage of the current Budget Session with Congress and other Opposition parties set to corner the Government on the issue and the latter set to go aggressive on it and not back out.

133,01-2-20,FIR against Ghosh for remark against protester,"A college girl has lodged a police complaint against Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh for threatening murder and making uncouth remarks lowering a woman’s dignity.

The complaint was lodged a day after Ghosh told the media that the woman — who was heckled by the BJP workers while protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act— was lucky to have escaped with a torn poster “otherwise many more things could have happened to her.”

Sudeshna Dutta Gupta, a Second Year student of Sanskrit University was allegedly heckled by BJP workers on Thursday while she was standing with an anti-CAA poster by the route of a Abhinandan Yatra (rally) led by Ghosh.

The poster that read “No CAA, No NRC” apparently infuriated the BJP workers who challenged the woman and pushed her around until the police came to her rescue.

Subsequently, Ghosh told the media that “why do these people come to protest? She should consider herself lucky that his party men only tore the poster and did nothing else,” adding, “she had come to the spot either to be humiliated or get martyred…. She should remain cautious for the next time. We warn her against such misadventures. We have tolerated enough and won’t put up with any such nuisance again.”

The woman who was protesting alone by holding aloft a placard only later lodged an FIR at the Patuli Police Station in south-east Kolkata.

“I was not only heckled but also abused by the people in the rally and I was luckily saved by the police men,” Dutta Gupta said adding, “I have also brought charges of murderous intent… he is creating panic and trying to divide the people… He has also made sexual remarks. The women in our country are not safe. Every 22 minutes, a woman is raped in India. I am not surprised by his comment. But he should remember that he is a people’s representative and must use his words with caution.”

Elsewhere CPI(M)’s Sujan Chakrabarty slammed Ghosh for publicly acknowledging that his party was dividing the people to get votes. “What more is left to know the real face of these people and the party they represent?” Chakrabarty the Left legislature Party Leader said referring to a recent speech by Ghosh where he took pride in dividing the population to garner votes.

“They (opposition) say that we are dividing the people. If I am doing so I am justified in doing that. I will again do that. What happened then when you (Congress) divided India and Bengal? What happened when Hindus were tortured and driven out of their own homeland?... I willgive divisive speeches. Do whatever you can,” Ghosh had allegedly told in a recent rally.”

Meanwhile, the Left and Congress continued to protest at Jalangi in Murshidabad demanding the arrest of the main accused and a local TMC leader who allegedly shot dead two persons protesting against the CAA and NRC. “The twin murders only prove that Mamata Banerjee is actually backing the BJP’s cause,” Chakrabarty saiid.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/fir-against-ghosh-for-remark-against-protester.html
134,01-2-20,"Kerala Govt: No need to panic, patient stable","A day after India’s first novel coronavirus (nCoV) case was reported from Kerala, the State Government on Friday warned the people of the potential gravity of the threat but maintained that there was no need to panic.

Camping in this city, where the woman medical student who came from China tested positive for the coronavirus, Health Minister KK Shailaja activated the health department and said the patient is currently treated at an isolation ward of the Government Medical College hospital here.

The condition of the patient is stable, official sources said. Earlier in the day, health authorities shifted the student from the general hospital to the Government medical College.

The minister requested those who had travelled to China in recent days to voluntarily report themselves to the nearest hospitals. Some have reported to the health facilities in their neighbourhood in response to a directive given by the State Government, she said.

Strengthening its resolve to check the spread of illness to others, the Minister directed those coming from China and other affected regions to strictly remain under home quarantine.

The Minister also requested the families of those who returned from the coronavirus-hit regions to postpone marriages to prevent a possible outbreak of the disease in the state.

“Home quarantines are being done only as a precaution. No need to panic,” the Minister told reporters here after meeting the private hospital authorities to prepare them for facing the challenge.

She said the family members of the people coming from the affected-regions should abide by the protocol.

“It is heard that in some such families, preparations are being made for marriages. There is no harm in temporarily postponing the date of the marriage. There will be some difficulties in postponing the marriages fixed earlier. But this is a protocol. This must be obeyed,” Shailaja said. Those who are home quarantined would be under observation for 28 days.

“Those who are going for job, they should take leave and be under observation. Health volunteers would be around to solve their problems,” she said.

137,01-2-20,3 JEM fidayeen killed on Jammu-Srinagar NH,"Three highly trained ‘fidayeen’ (members of a suicide squad) of Pakistan based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror outfit, tasked to target vital security installations, were killed by the joint teams of security forces near Ban Toll plaza on Jammu-Srinagar National Highway on Friday.

All three heavily armed terrorists were travelling in a Kashmir bound truck, bearing registration number JK03F-1478, when they were intercepted at Bann Toll plaza by police at a security check point around 5.30 a.m. According to police, terrorists hiding inside the truck opened fire on security forces when they insisted on carrying thorough checking of the truck.

During the encounter, three associates of JeM terrorists, including a Kashmir based local guide, along with a driver and conductor were also arrested by the police. The arrested driver is identified as Sameer Ahmed Dar. A year ago, Sameer Dar’s cousin Adil Dar had rammed his explosive-laden Maruti Eeco car into a CRPF bus, killing 40 personnel on board. Sameer has reportedly done Masters in geology from Kashmir university.

The incident comes days before the Pulwama attack anniversary on February 14.

Preliminary reports gathered by the police teams claimed the trio may have possibly infiltrated from across the International border with Pakistan via Hiranagar sector in Kathua district and were being escorted in a Kashmir bound truck to their destination.

The truck driver along with the conductor had created a special cavity to hide these terrorists by packing polyvinyl bags in a particular pattern.

DGP Police, Dilbagh Singh, who visited the encounter site along with senior police and CRPF officers, told reporters, “according to preliminary reports all three terrorists, belonging to Pakistan based Jaish-e- Mohammad terror outfit, were eliminated by the security forces after intercepting a truck in the early hours of Friday morning”.

Dilbagh Singh said, “the three terrorists were armed with AK rifles including a sniper rifle and large quantities of ammunition, satellite phone, brand new mobile handsets, wire cutters, grenades,ration supplies and other essential items to last long during the operation”.

According to preliminary investigations carried out by the intelligence agencies, these three terrorists were tasked to carry out attacks on vital security installations.

Soon after the encounter started in the area, traffic on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway was suspended.

Educational institutions in the neighboring Udhampur district were closed down and all other vital security installations were put on high alert to prevent any attack.

Thousands of Kashmir bound passengers also remained stranded on the highway at different locations between Jammu and Bann Toll Plaza. After the encounter was called off and necessary

sanitisation operation was completed the traffic was allowed to ply on the highway.

Earlier on September 28, 2019, three pro-Pakistan Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) terrorists were eliminated by the joint team of security forces during nine-hour-long operation in Ramban district.

One civilian who was held hostage by the terrorists inside his house in Batote town was safely rescued by the security forces while one Army jawan had sacrificed his life and two other policemen received injuries. In September 2018, a group of militants,travelling in a Srinagar bound truck, were neutralised near Kakriyal on Jammu-Srinagar National highway by the security forces after they opened fire on a police patrol party.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/3-jem-fidayeen-killed-on-jammu-srinagar-nh.html

139,01-2-20,"Mumbai Traffic police launches ‘Honk more, wait more’ drive","In an effort to reduce noise pollution levels in the country’s commercial Capital, the Mumbai Traffic police on Friday rolled out a novel “Punishing Signal” campaign — centred around “Honk more, wait more” theme — to discipline Mumbaikars who love to honk needlessly even when the traffic signal is red.

A video clip released by the Mumbai police ahead of the introduction and activation of “punishing signals” at major traffic junctions in the metropolis like the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT), Marine Drive, Pedder Road, Hindmata Cinema Dadar and Bandra, has gone viral on the social media.

As part of the “Punishing signal” campaign, the city police have connected decibel monitors to traffic signals at major traffic junctions in the metropolis. When the cacophony triggered by needless honking exceeds the dangerous sound level of 85-decibels, the signal timers get reset, entailing a double waiting time for all vehicles!. And a “punishing” message ‘Honk more, wait more’, comes on the digital display board installed near the traffic junctions.

“To change your tomorrow, we must change our habits today! We have taken the 1st step to end the menace of excessive honking in

#Mumbai. Watch it and #HonkResponsibly,” Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve gently prods and exhorts the motorists through his twitter handle @CPMumbaiPolice to watch the video clip lasting for nearly two minutes.

The video clip opens at a major traffic junction in Mumbai with a commentary: “Welcome! To the Honking Capital of the world..! (Amid cacophony of blaring horns from the vehicles waiting for the signal to turn green)..Here, people honk even when the signal is red! Savai ahe na ! (Isn’t it their habit). Maybe they think that by honking, they can make the signal turn green faster! Samjat nahi (They simply don’t understand)”.

Now the video clip introduces a professional actor in the garb of a traffic hawaldar, who takes the narrative forward. “Wait. We the Mumbai police are itching to do about this. .. One day we connected decibel meters to a few signal poles around the city. If the decibel went over 85 db, the signal would re-set and stay red for longer”. The next day, you get to see motorists honking longer and louder. As the traffic signal stays red for a very long time, a digital display board installed at the traffic junction comes up with a message: “Honk more, wait more”.

The Mumbai Traffic Police have, in collaboration with FCB Interface, hit upon innovative idea to curb noise pollution caused by honking at traffic signals. “Horn not okay, please! Find out how the @MumbaiPolice hit the mute button on #Mumbai’s reckless honkers. #HonkResponsibly,” reads a tweet put out by the Mumbai police. The “Punishing Signal” campaign launched by the Mumbai police on the twitter has come in for immense praise from the twitterati.

“Mumbai is one of the noisiest cities in the world. We get to hear a lot of this noise at traffic signals because of honking…Honking is bad habit and an act of traffic indiscipline. Unfortunately, many Mumbaikars indulge in reckless honking. Honking causes noise pollution, hurts the eardrums, increases heart rate, creates traffic confusion and causes stress,” Joint Police Commissioner (Traffic) Madhukar Pandey said.

“We recognise unnecessary honking is a menace but we do precious little to curb it. The Rs Punishing Signal’ is one of the many attempts by the Mumbai police to inculcate discipline among the Mumbaikars. We hope that our campaign will encourage Mumbaikars to honk less, and create an atmosphere for a noise-free and stress-free commute,” Pandey said.

FCB Group Chairman and CEO Rohit Ohri said: “We have been partnering Mumbai Police for many years now. Noise pollution is a big problem in our cities. This new initiative is a fantastic creative solution for bringing about awareness and a behaviour change among the drivers in Mumbai.”

Robby Mathew, Chief Creative Officer, FCB Interface, said: “Sometimes, the stick works better than the carrot. And a signal that gave us a gentle rap on the knuckles for honking unnecessarily, seemed like a good idea to me”.

Noted anti-noise pollution crusader Sumaira Abdul Ali, who is considered a conscience keeper of Mumbai when it comes to matters relating to sound levels in the metropolis, was all praise for the Mumbai police for its “punishing signal” campaign. “Thank you @MumbaiPolice @CPMumbaiPolice for this amazing and very effective video against honking. This is a first for the police to promise action and hopefully a first step towards enforcement of anti-honking rules< Sumaira Ali tweeted.

140,01-2-20,Opp leaders wear black arm bands during Prez address,"nLeaders of 14 Opposition parties, including the Congress, on Friday wore black arm bands during the President’s address to both the Houses of Parliament, saying it was “shameful” on the part of the Government to claim the CAA as an achievement. Opposition parties decided to move amendments to President Ram Nath Kovind’s address seeking the removal of reference made to the passage of the CAA from it.

The Opposition leaders also staged a protest outside Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in Parliament complex and raised slogans against the Government while standing in solidarity with those protesting against the National Population Register (NPR), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Leaders of these parties, including Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad and Congress president Sonia Gandhi did not sit on their designated seats in the front and second rows and sat together in one block in the Central hall of Parliament during the president’s address as a mark of their protest.

Outside the Parliament Sonia was accompanied by party leader Rahul Gandhi, Azad, senior party leaders Motilal Vohra, Ahmed Patel, Adhir Ranjan Choudhury, A K Antony and all party MPs from Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha. They held placards that read ‘Save the Constitution’ and raised anti-government slogans while expressing solidarity with the protesters against the CAA, NPR and the NRC.

The black bands were worn as a mark of protest against the alleged attack on the Constitution of India with the passage of the amended Citizenship Act by the government, the leaders said.

Opposition members also protested after President Kovind hailed the CAA in his address. As soon as the president made these remarks, some opposition members shouted “shame, shame” and displayed banners in the Central Hall.

Among the leaders of the opposition parties who wore black bands were Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Samajwadi Party (SP), Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India, Shiv Sena, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha Janata Dal (Secular), Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), Kerala Congress (M), Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) and the National Conference (NC), besides the Congress, the sources said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/opp-leaders-wear-black-arm-bands-during-prez-address.html
141,01-2-20,Rural students spend more on books than urban: Survey,"Expenses of a student on books, stationery and uniform in rural India on an average are over 10 percentage points higher than those in urban areas, although participation in education system has seen improvement at all levels, according to the Economic Survey.

As per the Economic Survey 2019-20 tabled in the Parliament by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the absence of suitable financial support system and high burden of course fee, especially in higher education, pushes the poor and underprivileged out of the education system.

Citing data from the National Sample Survey (NSS) report on 'Key Indicators of Household Social Consumption on Education in India 2017-18', the survey said that in 2017-18, there were about 13.6 per cent persons of age 3 to 35 years who were never enrolled in the education system.

""The reasons they cite for not enrolling were 'not interested in education' and 'financial constraints',"" it said.

Among those who were enrolled, drop-out rate was as high as 10 per cent at primary level, 17.5 per cent at upper primary/middle, and 19.8 per cent at secondary level, the survey added.

Highlighting the challenges for 'Education for All' initiative, the survey said the composition of various components of expenditure on education indicates that the course fees, which is 50.8 per cent at all India level, among others contributes about half of the average expenditure of a basic course.

Course fees include tuition, examination, developmental fees and other compulsory payments.

The proportion of course fee is also high in rural and urban areas, it added.

""The second largest component of average expenditure on education by student is books, stationery and uniform where an average student in the rural areas is surprisingly spending more than 10 percentage points as compared to urban areas,"" the survey said.

It also pointed out that students pursuing education in private aided institutions are spending significantly higher as compared to government institutions across rural-urban India.

Quoting the NSS report, the survey said in 2017-18, the average expenditure of an average student in government institutions pursuing secondary education was Rs 4,078 whereas the same for a student in private aided institution was Rs 12,487.

When it comes to graduation, the expenditure for an average student in Government institutions was at Rs 10,501, while in private aided institutions it was Rs 16,769.

The survey said ""due to absence of competition in government schools/institutions, quality of education in Government schools/institutions is low. As a result, more and more students prefer to enrol themselves in private institutions"".",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/rural-students-spend-more-on-books-than-urban--survey.html

Markets had opened on a firm footing, but came under selling pressure in the afternoon trade, coinciding with the opening of the Budget session of Parliament and tabling of the Economic Survey.

The 30-share BSE Sensex closed 190.33 points, or 0.47 per cent, lower at 40,723.49. Likewise, the broader NSE Nifty shed 73.70 points, or 0.61 per cent, to finish at 11,962.10.

The Economic Survey projected revival of economic growth to 6-6.5 per cent in the next fiscal from 5 per cent estimated in 2019-20. However, it recommended relaxing the budget deficit target to boost growth.

Traders said the prospects of increased government borrowing and crowding out of private sector investment spooked market participants, triggering unwinding of positions.

ONGC was the top laggard in the Sensex pack, dropping 5.80 per cent, followed by PowerGrid, HCL Tech, TCS, Tata Steel and Reliance Industries.

Kotak Mahindra Bank was the top gainer, spurting 3.87 per cent, after the lender settled its dispute with RBI regarding promoter Uday Kotak’s stake.

SBI rose 2.53 per cent after the country’s largest lender reported a 41 per cent jump in net profit to Rs 6,797.25 crore for the December quarter.

Other winners included IndusInd Bank, Bharti Airtel, Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp.

Attention now shifts to the Union Budget, to be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday. Markets will remain open on Budget Day.

“Investors stayed away from taking fresh positions ahead of the big event. Focus will turn to Union Budget as all eyes will be on how Centre is going to bring growth as any increase in spending would result in widening of fiscal deficit,” said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services.

“Global economy is also on the edge with slow growth fears significantly high after the outbreak of the virus,” he added.

Sectorally, BSE oil and gas, energy, metal, utilities, power, basic materials, IT and auto indices fell up to 2.65 per cent.

Telecom, realty, consumer durables, bankex and finance rose up to 1.23 per cent. Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices ended in the red.

On the global front, sentiment remained weak as investors assessed the impact of the China coronavirus outbreak.

The death toll in China’s coronavirus epidemic spiked to 213 and total infections reached 9,692, the Chinese government said on Friday as the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak that has spread to more than a dozen countries, including India, as a global health emergency.

Bourses in Hong Kong and South Korea ended in the red, while Japan rose 1 per cent. Markets in China remained closed.

Stock exchanges in Europe opened on a negative note.

147,01-2-20,"Govt must unleash bold reforms to achieve 6-6.5% growth in FY21, say experts, industry","Attaining a GDP growth rate of 6 to 6.5 per cent in 2020-21 as projected by the Economic Survey will be “challenging” and the government needs to prioritise growth while unleashing bolder policy measures to achieve it, experts and industry bodies said on Friday.

India’s economic growth is expected to “strongly rebound” to 6-6.5 per cent in 2020-21 from 5 per cent estimated in the current fiscal, said the Economic Survey 2019-20 tabled in Parliament on Friday by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, adding that the government with a strong mandate has the capacity to expedite reforms.

“The 6-6.5 per cent growth pegged by the Economic Survey for 2020-21, is a target that is achievable with the right dose of reforms and public investments,” CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said.

The chamber said as the Economic Survey is a precursor to the Union Budget, it expects some of the bold reforms highlighting trust, entrepreneurship and primacy of the market to be reflected in the Budget announcements.

Leader economic advisory services at PwC India, Ranen Banerjee, said attaining the projected growth rate of 6-6.5 per cent will be challenging.

“The demand cycle is yet to pick up in India. Global growth including India is likely to be significantly impacted by the coronavirus factor taking cues from history of impacts from the SARS outbreak,” he noted.

Economist at Deloitte India, Rumki Majumdar, said the Survey projects growth revival in FY 2021 but suggests that the government may have to incur expansionary policy to support growth.

“As has been argued earlier, the government has to prioritise growth. Once the momentum picks up, the government can take action to consolidate its expenses,” Majumdar observed.

Assocham President Niranjan Hiranandani said it strongly advocates that the Central government needs to announce bolder policy and fiscal measures to recover from “sharp economic downturn and somnolent market scenario”.

“Realising economic growth targets and attaining national aspirations call for not just renewed focus and investment in key sectors like infrastructure and rural empowerment, but also on establishing and enabling a climate of trust,” said Elias George, partner and national head (infrastructure) Government and Healthcare, KPMG in India.

150,01-2-20,"‘Govt interventions hurt more, help less’","The Economic Survey 2020, pointed out that the Government interventions like debt waiver or food subsidies end up creating distortions in the functioning of the free market. The Survey says that debt waiver schemes’ disrupt credit culture and disrupt formal credit flow to the very farmers it aims to benefit. The share of agriculture and allied sector in the total gross value added (GVA) of the country has been continuously declining from 18.2 per cent in 2014-15 t0 16.5 per cent in 2019-20.

The Economic Survey picked four instances where archaic Government interventions have created more problems than they solve which include rationalisation of Essential Commodities Act, Drug Price Control Order (DPCO), food subsidies and debt waiver.

The food subsidy Bill has increased from Rs 1,13,171.2 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 1,71,127.5 crore in 2018-19, it said adding that the reasons for widening of the food subsidy have been many. While the economic cost has increased, the central issue price (the rate at which grains are sold in ration shops) for NFSA beneficiaries has not been revised from Rs 200 per quintal in case of wheat and Rs 300 per quintal in the case of rice. Foodgrains via ration shops are supplied at highly subsidised rates of Rs 3 per kg for rice, Rs 2 per kg for wheat and Rs 1 per kg for coarse grains through Public Distribution System (PDS) as per the National Food Security Act (NFSA).

“While the interests of the vulnerable sections of the population need to be safeguarded, for sustainability of food security operations, the issue of burgeoning food subsidy bill needs to be addressed,” the Survey added.

The NFSA has been implemented in all states and Union territories. However, in Chandigarh, Puducherry and urban areas of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, the NFSA is being implemented in cash transfer mode, under which food subsidy is being transferred into the bank accounts of beneficiaries who then have a choice to buy foodgrains from open market.

During the financial year 2019-20, the government allocated 603.88 lakh tonnes of foodgrains to states and UTs under the NFSA and other welfare schemes as on December 2019. Under the NFSA, the government supplies 5 kg of subsidised foodgrains to each person per month to over 81 crore people through 5 lakh ration shops in the country.

The Economic Survey also pitched for scrapping of the Essential Commodities Act (ECA), Drug Price Control Order (DPCO) and debt waiver saying the law is “anachronistic” that leads to harassment and is of no help in checking price volatility. The survey said that these acts should be let go of for more economic freedom to the market and to spur wealth creation.

The Economic Survey found that beneficiaries of full loan waivers consume less, save less, invest less and are less productive after the waiver when compared to the partial beneficiaries.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---govt-interventions-hurt-more--help-less---.html

As on January 14, 2020, the Government has been able to set up just 28,000 health and wellness centres under its flagship scheme launched last year.

Citing the latest National Health Accounts (NHA) 2016-17 data, the economic survey on Friday said that out of pocket expenditure as a percentage of total health expenditure has declined from 64.2 per cent in 2013-14 to 58.7 per cent in 2016-17. Talking about performance of the Mission Indradhanush, the survey said 3.39 crore children and 87.18 lakh pregnant women in 680 districts across the country have been vaccinated.”

New vaccines such as Measles-Rubella (MR), Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine, Rotavirus Vaccine and Inactivated Polio Vaccine have also been introduced, it added.

Primary healthcare accounts for 52.1 per cent of India’s current public expenditure on health as per the National Health Estimates, 2016-17. The National Health Policy, 2017 recommended to spend at least two thirds of the government’s health expenditure on primary healthcare, it added.

“Ayushman Bharat- Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), the world’s largest health insurance scheme, is a major step towards providing affordable healthcare to the identified poor,” the Survey said.

The party said the prices of commodities are rising and the Government has not said how it will contain the food inflation. The “Make in India” has failed so “Assemble in India” has come up but this will not add value to the GDP as already the position is grim, the Congress said.

“The Economic Survey comes nowhere close to revealing what the actual situation is. India is facing a very difficult time due to the Narendra Modi Government’s mismanagement yet if you look at the Economic Survey, you will find it is totally disconnected from this grim reality,” Congress spokesperson Rajeev Gowda said.

Gowda said the Economic Survey is not about talking of the past but the current situation in the country. “The current situation is - the economy is in the worst phase in 52 years with unemployment at an all-time high,” said the Rajya Sabha member.

“In this Economic Survey, the Chief Economic Advisor pays scant attention to distribution and inequality. Even today, inequality is worsening.

The survey will be conducted by the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) in collaboration with the Delhi-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII) under the Namami Gange programme of the Union Ministry of Jal Shakti wherin ten rivers in the eight States in the Ganga basin will be covered.

The rivers include Ganga, Ramganga, Yamuna, Gomti, Ghagra, Gandak, Koshi, Son, Chambal and Rupnarayan covering from source to its respective confluences.

Director General of NMCG, Rajiv Ranjan Mishra said that the survey team will use the state-of-the-art scientific tools and techniques such as laser based distance measurement units for channel width determination, sonar-based channel depth estimator, Doppler-based river flow determination, GPS and GIS technology in combination with the local traditional knowledge of the riverside communities.

A large number of Ganga Praharis created for river conservation will support the assessment as the representatives of local communities.

Miishra said that in the First National Ganga Council meeting on December 14, 2019 at Kanpur, it was agreed that aquatic biodiversity conservation such as Gangetic dolphin is important for river conservation.

He further said that a comprehensive project has been awarded to WII for scaling up the aquatic species conservation in the Ganga basin.

Project In-charge Dr. SA Hussain and Dr Ruchi Badola said that the assessment will generate baseline data on river habitat conditions based on which a roadmap will be prepared for aquatic biodiversity conservation in Ganga basin for ensuring Nirmal Dhara and AviralDhara of not only Ganga river but also in its tributaries.

According to a survey by the WII, around 49 per cent of the Ganga River has high biodiversity value and species of conservation concern are reappearing as the river is getting much more cleaner.

Dr. Hussain said the initiative will successfully address the biodiversity and river conservation issues in the Ganga basin, which will be a model for science based river conservation in India.

155,01-2-20,‘Fiscal deficit target may be relaxed to arrest declining growth’,"The Economic Survey on Friday made a case for relaxing the fiscal deficit target of 3.3 per cent of GDP in view of the need to arrest declining growth, estimated to touch a 11-year low of 5 per cent in the current fiscal.

The Medium Term Fiscal Policy (MTFP) statement presented with the Budget 2019-20, pegged the fiscal deficit target for 2019-20 at 3.3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), which was further expected to follow a gradual path of reduction and attain the targeted level of 3 per cent of GDP in 2020-21, and continue at the same level in 2021-22. “While, on one hand the outlook for global growth persists to be weak, with escalated trade tensions adding to the risk; on the other hand, the pace of recovery of growth will have implications for revenue collections,” it said.

In order to boost the sluggish demand and consumer sentiments, counter-cyclical fiscal policy may have to be adopted to create additional fiscal headroom, it said.

During the first eight months of 2019-20, the indirect tax collections have been muted. Therefore, revenue buoyancy of goods and services tax would be key to the resource position of both central and state governments. On the expenditure side, rationalisation of subsidies especially food subsidy could be an important tool for expanding the headroom for fiscal manoeuvre.

The survey further notes that the geopolitical situation unfolding in West Asia is likely to have implications for oil prices, and thereby on the petroleum subsidy, apart from having implications for current account balance.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/---fiscal-deficit-target-may-be-relaxed-to-arrest-declining-growth---.html

Investment in infrastructure is necessary for the economy, as power shortages, inadequate transport and poor connectivity affect overall growth performance, the Economic Survey for 2019-20 tabled in Parliament by Union Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stated.

“To achieve the GDP of USD 5 trillion by 2024-25, India needs to spend about USD 1.4 trillion on infrastructure. The challenge is to step-up annual infrastructure investment so that lack of infrastructure does not become a binding constraint on the growth of the Indian economy,” the Survey said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/india-needs--1-4-trn-infra-spend-in-2020-25-to-become-a--5-trn-economy--survey.html
157,01-2-20,"Economic slowdown bottomed out, uptick from here onwards: CEA","Chief Economic Adviser KV Subramanian on Friday said India’s GDP is expected to grow at 6-6.5 per cent next fiscal as the economic slowdown has bottomed out.

As per the first advance estimates released by the National Statistical Organisation (NSO), the country’s economic growth is likely to hit an 11-year low of 5 per cent in the current fiscal ending March 2020.

The Economic Survey 2019-20, prepared by a team lead by Subramanian, has projected the GDP to expand in the range of 6-6.5 per cent during 2020-21.

“If you look at the business cycle phenomena in India, typically if you look at the peaks and troughs and co-relate it with what has happened, it seems like we have hit the trough therefore there should be uptick in growth. That is what we are Budgeting,” he said in a media briefing post the Economic Survey.

Amid a weak environment for global manufacturing, trade and demand, the Indian economy slowed down with GDP growth moderating to 4.8 per cent in the first half of 2019-20, lower than 6.2 per cent in H2 of 2018-19.

Based on NSO’s first advance estimates of GDP growth for 2019-20 at 5 per cent, an uptick in GDP growth is expected in the second half of the fiscal, it said.

According to it, the uptick in second half of 2019-20 would be mainly due to ten positive factors like picking up of Nifty India Consumption Index for the first time this year, an upbeat secondary market, higher FDI flows, build-up of demand pressure, positive outlook for rural consumption, rebound of industrial activity, steady improvement in manufacturing, growth in merchandise exports, higher build-up of foreign exchange reserves and positive growth rate of GST revenue collection.

When asked if there is any change in meeting USD 5 trillion target by 2024-25, Subramanian said,” To best of my knowledge, there is no change in deadline.”

On the impact Coronavirus outbreak on the economy, he said, “I am not a doctor, (but) it may be very marginal.”

Subramanian said by focusing on labour intensive sector, India can create 4 crore jobs by 2025 and 8 crore jobs by 2030.

The CEA said that the Indian banking sector needs to scale up and become proportional to the size of the economy.

He said exponential rise in India’s GDP and GDP per capita post liberalisation coincides with wealth generation in the stock market.

Subramanian said India should strengthen the invisible hand of markets together with the hand of trust that can support markets, in line with the economic model advocated in our traditional thinking.

He said a 10 per cent increase in registration of new firms in a district yields a 1.8 per cent increase in district level GDP.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/economic-slowdown-bottomed-out--uptick-from-here-onwards--cea.html

159,01-2-20,Economic Survey sees pick up in growth,"The Economic Survey on Friday projected revival of economic growth to 6-6.5 per cent next fiscal and suggested that the Government should relax the Budget deficit target to boost growth from a decade low of 5 per cent this year.

The Survey, released a day before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the Union Budget for 2020-21, suggested a cut in food subsidy to create fiscal space

at a time when tax revenues were falling.

Facing the worst economic slowdown since the global financial crisis of 2008-09 that worsened job prospects, the Survey said businessmen should be respected as they create wealth and jobs.

For India to become a USD 5 trillion economy by 2025, it prescribed strengthening trust in the economy, enabling and empowering markets, promotion of pro-business policies, and measures to enhance farmers’ income.

It also suggested reforms to make it easier to open new businesses, register property, pay taxes and enforce contracts.

The Survey called for boosting manufacturing with ‘assemble in India for the world’ concept and underlined the need to spend $1.4 trillion in infrastructure to nearly double the size of the economy to $5 trillion.

It batted for aggressive disinvestment to bring higher profitability and efficiency, minimal government intervention in markets, encouraging entrepreneurship, and supporting wealth creation.

For the current fiscal, it projected a GDP growth of 5 per cent, the lowest in 11 years.

Commenting on the Survey, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the report focuses on wealth creation for Indians. “It outlines a multi-faceted strategy to achieve a USD 5 trillion economy through enterprise, exports, ease of doing business and more,” he tweeted.

Some economists believe the Survey’s growth forecast is too optimistic as the recovery is likely to be slow and shallow amid rising inflation and declining investment.

The Survey has been wide of the mark in forecasting growth in four out of past five years.

“The deceleration in GDP growth can be understood within the framework of a slowing cycle of growth with the financial sector acting as a drag on the real sector,” it said. “The government must use its strong mandate to deliver expeditiously on reforms, which will enable the economy to strongly rebound in 2020-21.”

Survey-author Krishnamurthy Subramanian, Chief Economic Adviser to the Finance Ministry, rejected his predecessor Arvind Subramanian’s analysis of India’s GDP growth rate being overestimated by 2.7 per cent post-2011, saying the allegation was “unfounded” and “unsubstantiated by the data”.

As has been argued earlier, the government has to prioritise growth, the Survey for 2019-20, which was tabled by Sitharaman in Parliament, said.

And for this, relaxing the fiscal deficit target could be considered, said the Survey -- an annual report card on the economy.

Sitharaman had projected the fiscal deficit at 3.3 per cent of the gross domestic product in her budget for 2019-20 but it is widely seen slipping to 3.8 per cent as the slowdown lowered revenue collections and the government provided a tax stimulus to spur investments.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/economic-survey-sees-pick-up-in-growth-2020-02-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/economic-survey-sees-pick-up-in-growth.html

Facing the worst economic slowdown in more than a decade, Sitharaman is expected to pull out all stops to spur consumer demand and investment, government sources and economists said.

Sitharaman’s second Budget, to be presented on February 1, is expected to announce measures to restore economic growth and to set out a clear road map for achieving the ambitious target of USD 5 trillion economy by 2025.

Investments have failed to pick up despite corporate tax cuts and other stimulus measures, higher FDI inflows, plans to consolidate state-owned banks and monetary easing.

After corporate tax cuts in September last year, speculation is rife about possible reduction in personal income taxes. A combination of an increase in the basic exemption limit and/or the introduction of a differentiated tax rate structure for higher incomes may be on the cards. To cushion the impact on collections, these tweaks might be accompanied by rationalisation in tax rebates.

“The government announced a slew of stimulus measures in the last four months but consumer confidence is missing. Not many are eager to take loans to buy homes or cars fearing the worst. The feel good factor in the economy is missing,” a senior government source said.

“I think the Budget will be a feel-good Budget that will try to restore faith in the economy and spur spending and investments,” the source said.

The data price in the country came down by over 99 per cent during 2016-2019, making it among the lowest tariff in the world, according to the survey.

“Since 2016, the sector has witnessed substantial competition and price cutting by the telecom service providers (TSPs), creating financial stress in the sector. As a result, the sector is experiencing consolidation. While some operators have filed for bankruptcy, others have merged, in their quest to improve viability,” the survey report said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/---intense-competition--low-tariffs-led-to-financial-stress-in-telecom-sector---.html

169,01-2-20,"Thalinomics in times of rising prices: Veg, non-veg thalis more affordable, says survey","Rising inflation may have burnt a hole in common man’s pocket but Finance Ministry’s chief economic advisor believes otherwise as he brought a novel ‘thali’ concept to otherwise heavy-duty data crunching to drive home the point that affordability of a plate of meal has improved.

Calling it ‘Thalinomics’, Krishnamurthy V Subramanian compared price of standard veg and non-veg meal plates across the country to say that affordability as a factor of daily wage has improved overtime, indicating improved welfare of the common person.

The affordability of vegetarian ‘thalis’ improved by 29 per cent while that of non-vegetarian by 18 per cent between 2006-07 and 2019-20, the Economic Survey said in its chapter ‘Thalinomics -- The Economics of a Plate of Food in India”.

The conclusion has been drawn after analysing the data from the Consumer Price Index for industrial workers for around 80 centres in 25 states/Union Territories from April 2006 to October 2019.

As per the survey, a vegetarian thali comprises a serving of cereals, ‘sabzi and dal’ and the non-vegetarian thali comprises of cereals, sabzi and a non-vegetarian component.

“Both across India and the four regions - north, south, east and west - we find that the absolute prices of a vegetarian thali have decreased since 2015-16 though it increased during 2019. This is owing to significant moderation in the prices of vegetables and dal from 2015-16 when compared to the previous trend of increasing prices,” the survey said.

In fact, the increase in prices of pulses and vegetables contributed to the increase in the thali price during 2019-20 (April-October).

“If the prices of a vegetarian thali had followed the trend obtained till 2015-16, an average household comprising of five individuals would have had to spend Rs 10,887 more on average per year for eating minimum two healthy thalis a day.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/thalinomics-in-times-of-rising-prices--veg--non-veg-thalis-more-affordable--says-survey.html
170,01-2-20,Trump trial could end soon; Alexander says no to witnesses,"Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee will oppose calling more witnesses in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, all but dashing Democratic efforts to hear more testimony and boosting odds the Senate will vote to acquit Trump as early as Friday.

A vote on witnesses, expected Friday, could lead to an abrupt end and assured acquittal in only the third presidential impeachment trial in American history.

Trump was pressing for action in time for his State of the Union address, and that now seems likely.

As the Senate adjourned late Thursday, it set the date for Tuesday night’s speech. Despite the Democrats’ singular, sometimes-passionate focus on witnesses after revelations from John Bolton, the former national security adviser, the numbers are now falling short.

It would take four Republicans to break with the 53-seat majority and join with all Democrats to demand more testimony. Chief Justice John Roberts, in the rare role presiding over the impeachment trial, could break a tie, but that seems unlikely.

Alexander said in a statement there was “no need for more evidence,” giving the Trump team the likelihood of a Senate vote in its direction. Trump was impeached by House last month on charges that he abused his power like no other president, jeopardising Ukraine and US-Ukraine relations.

Democrats say Trump asked the vulnerable ally to investigate Joe Biden and debunked theories of 2016 election interference, temporarily halting American security aid to the country as it battled Russia at its border.

The second article of impeachment says Trump then obstructed the House probe in a way that threatened the nation’s three-branch system of checks and balances. Before Alexander’s statement, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said late Thursday she would vote to allow witnesses in the impeachment trial, briefly raising Democrats’ hopes for a breakthrough.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump-trial-could-end-soon--alexander-says-no-to-witnesses.html
171,01-2-20,Life is art,"The 12th edition of the India Art Fair speaks of the changing socio-political landscape of India and reveals how creativity is flourishing unbound. By Chahak Mittal

Who said that art is for the aficionado? A walkthrough at the India Art Fair clearly inspired us with its new ideas and a very humane approach to life as it is lived everyday. This wasn’t an escapade of imagination, it was of owning reality and an attempt to transcend it with human will. It was of a new India that is being scripted in the subterranean folds of the mind, no matter what is being dictated externally. It was a fresh breath that brought us alive.

Voices from India

Curator Sudarshan Shetty’s Look Outside This House stayed with us long after we had left the display area. Earlier showcased at the Serendipity Arts Festival 2019, the first part of the exhibition featured six videos of different people, singing in their native languages from different cities of India. The videos depicted how there are people outside our houses who act as objects, which may be dreaming of another world, one without frames and obligations and constraints. From a tribal woman from Jharkhand singing a song inspired by Gandhian philosophy, a Maharashtrian woman singing Powada and initiating a conversation around how plastic is affecting our collective future, to a Mumbai-based Dalit bard standing beside the road, narrating poignant tales of daily battles against injustice and subjugation of the Dalit community... these objects look for meanings in society’s changing ways. There was also the Bombay Lokal, the first hip-hop band from the suburbs of Mumbai, spreading socio-political awareness, with a vision to unite the country’s youth, and recalling the leaders of the freedom movement as they sing, ‘Follower hain hum Bhagat Singh aur Azad ke.’ Then there were two Miyah poets, the last of their kind who chronicle their sorrow of being called so, the term is a derogatory slur used for Bengali-origin Muslims. They sing about violence, discrimination, apathy and threat of statelessness due to the changing socio-political climate in India.

Making space for more

Next up was the inclusivity portal or Inclusion @ IAF, which hosted a number of workshops at the fair by those who have played small but essential roles in keeping different arts alive and have yet stayed unrecognised. Moving further, Sandeep TK’s series of photographs, Declaration of Empathy, gave an eye-opening and evocative message. The photographs represented the aftermath of what happened when Sandeep asked a few of his friends from Kerala who belong to the trans-community to imagine an alternative life. While in one photograph, a transwoman is dressed as a dancer holding her head high in front of her teachers and classmates, who ridiculed her for her feminine behaviour, in another, a transwoman is a dressed as a lawyer, which would have been her answer to all the discrimination she has ever faced. There were also transpersons dressed as a nurse looking after a patient, a police officer riding a bike, a classical dancer, a film actress and a leader of the Communist Party in Kerala.

Art gone live

Carried out in a ceremonial style, Nigerian artist Jelili Atiku’s performance-installation, Nobody is Born Wise, invited the audience to re-enact the traditional ritual of colouring sacred idols in turmeric, which is considered crucial during various “cultural, religious as well as culinary practices” in India. Dressed in an all-white garment, Atiku’s clean attire soon turned yellow as he painted a 100 Ganesha idols with the colour, as we watched on.

Another one was by Maya Krishna Rao, who presented a solo performance, Loose Woman, giving short and sharp glimpses of a woman who finds herself in situations that push, pull and stretch her skin, as it were. Known for her feminist and protest theatre, she acted as a person driving through the streets, looking at her mother gardening, playing at a highway and dancing with abandon.

Naksha, an Untold Odyssey, by artist Piyali Ghosh, which will be showcased tomorrow, is a live drawing performance inspired by the mathematical design and symmetry the Chakravyuh, the military formation mentioned in the Hindu epic Mahabharata.

Meeting of the two worlds

One of the most eye-catching artwork installations was that by New York-based artist Ghiora Aharoni, who has made some opposites meet with such ease that it looked like they weren’t different from each other at all — vintage and technology, science and religion, Hindi and Urdu, and Jeruselam and Varanasi. Talking about the idea behind combining some completely different worlds, he said that the works were characterised by an interest in exploring dualities such as that of religion and science, which might seem distant, but in a way “go hand in hand.” Looking around the gallery, one found traditional objects and symbols, cultural artifacts and sacred texts, which had been recontextualised with a new meaning, challenging the conventions. He also created a separate space where he combined Hindu and Urdu as the wall reads, ‘Shukr Hai Bhagwaan Ne Mujhe Aurat Banaya,’ both in Devanagri and Persian scripts. He said, “I had been working on combining Hebrew and Arabic. The motive behind combining Hindi and Urdu was to unite two elements which are conflicted yet overlapping.”

What struck the most

While Korea’s Gallery Tableau’s The Sunny Room, Celadon Bowl, and See The World, caught eyeballs, the exhibition Be Reborn at Simyo Gallery from Seoul, South Korea, made waves by showcasing old masterpieces by great artists which were digitally augmented and given a new life. From an old Asian masterpiece of a landscape to the famous Mona Lisa’s painting, the artworks come alive through more dynamic, vivid and colourful elements being added to them. Lee Leenam has presented poetic images and transitions of space with new perspectives and interpretation through the theme, ‘reborn’.

Tapasya Gupta’s sculpture series, Sweet Days of Summer, by Gallery Veda presented the concept of destiny through a wry sense of humour and laughter, which, as per the artist, represent the inner beauty of a person.

172,01-2-20,Finding the unknown,"Inspired by the golden period of Hindi cinema, global artworks at the fair delve deep into India’s history and culture. By Team Viva

As one enters the India Art Fair, time becomes an illusion as you are surrounded by a plethora of creativity and art from across the world. It’s enthralling to see how the contemporary art scene has evolved overtime in the country and today has an immense global presence.

There are around 80 galleries from across Indian and international cities, many of them first-timers. Taking a walk through the fair, one could see many live installations, events, bookshops and workshops.

Inspired by the imagery of the golden period of Hindi cinema — 1960s, the paintings of Canada-based artist Marcel Dzama gives an insight into the Indian culture, details about Bollywood and regional wildlife. Presented by the David Zwirner gallery, Dzama’s works are a visual exploration of the Indian ethos with hints of divine iconography. His works presented a blurred relationship between the real and the subconscious through a understandable visual language. “I have always admired Bollywood. I loved how each character had a specific charm and tone which is somewhere still intact in the hearts of the people. So I have always been drawn to dance, costumes and masks. I remember, during my childhood, I used to dress up in a costume and pretend that I was a film’s character all day long,” Dzama said, pointing towards his work that seamlessly merge Indian mythology, pop culture and memories.

While I wondered the depth each painting talked about, the appealing tent facade designed by popular Indian artist Sameer Kulavoor, grabbed my attention instantly. It focussed on the routine Indian life, I couldn’t help appreciating him for depicting the everyday ordinariness so beautifully.

Another artist, Chitra Ganesh has explored the the lines between past and future. She has also portrayed a dynamic connection between mythology and science fiction. “There are always untold stories trying to rise to the surface. They are inspiring,” said she.

B Prabha, a female modernist, brought one of her prized pieces to the fair. She began painting at a time when very few women were in this profession. Inspired by artist Amrita Sher Gil, Prabha represented real female subjects, liberated from the gaze of the male artist. She painted the trauma and tragedy of women and depicted the melancholy rural women in natural colour palettes.

Moving ahead was the miniature artist, Sahil Naik, who described his meticulous models in a fine manner. For Naik, close examination of structures offers the possibility of understanding what took place and under what circumstances. He is interested in knowing the incidents that led to a particular situation. One of his project called Monuments, Mausoleums, Memorials and Modernism explored the zeal of new nations. Models of structures were inspired by a proposed dam in his native Goa, whose building process would have displaced local residents from there. There is a human cost, Naik implies, to such large-scale ambition.

Apart from a diverse selection of contemporary and modern art galleries from across different cities, the fair also features international galleries from New York, Berlin, Seoul, Colombo, London, Hong Kong, and Dubai.

There were sections showcasing solo presentations curated by various galleries — Ratheesh T by Galerie Mirchandani and Steinruecke, Girjesh Kumar Singh by Rukshaan Art, Anjan Modhak by Emami Art, Avijit Dutta by Kalakriti Art Gallery, D Dhasan by Apparao Galleries, KS Radhakrishnan by Galleri Nvya and Subodh Kerkar by Gallery Art Positive.

Next in line were outdoor art projects, ranging from largescale interactive installations to sculptures. It also had giant wooden rain drops by Chennai-based printmaker Vijay Pichumani with Art Houz Gallery. It touched upon the ongoing conversation around water scarcity.

Yet another interesting part of the fair, that extends beyond the venue, are collateral events programmed by galleries, museums and arts spaces around the city. The opening of the newly refurbished Jaipur House, Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, Gujral Foundation, Khoj International Artists Association, Bikaner House and walkthroughs in Okhla, among others remained a centre of attraction.

Various artists were glad about the fact that they not only do a fair amount of business through the fair but have also been able to build long-term relationships.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/finding-the-unknown-2020-02-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/finding-the-unknown.html
173,01-2-20,Young at heart,"Over the course of 40 years, actor Anil Kapoor had straddled the domain of arthouse and commercial cinema with equal ease. By Ayushi Sharma

The recent trailer of Malang has been making waves as people hazard wild guesses about what the film’s storyline is about. There are conjectures all around as to who is playing what and actor Anil Kapoor fuels the curiosity further when you ask him about his character. He laughs and says that’s the “intent” because it’s a thriller. “Yes, it does look a bit confusing and that’s the idea — to keep people’s curiosity alive. The trailer should be such that people want to watch the film when it releases. Don’t you want to?,” he asks.

Anil has played a range of characters during the 40 years that he has been a part of the industry. But he is not flagging as he continues to reinvent himself with each film. His first reaction to the trailer was similar to that of most of the audience. So what made him go for such a character? “When I heard the script, I felt what the audience is feeling after watching the trailer. It makes you think about what and how will the film unfold. It confuses you. But then you are eager to find out the layers. The narrative is not simple but it is definitely interesting,” says he.

The film revolves around a couple, Advait (Aditya Roy Kapoor) and Sara (Disha Patani), whose seemingly perfect life comes crashing down when they get linked to a corrupt cop (Anil) and his righteous counterpart (Kunal Khemu). To further complicate matters, all four are on a killing spree. Anil plays a police officer from Goa, who is disappointed with the ways of the world and the hostile environment around him. He feels that the process is slow and taxing. “He just wants justice. While his department is a little unhappy with the way he works, he is also dissatisfied with the manner in which his department handles operations. There’s also a simmering anger within him about the decline of Goa. Earlier he was fine with the place becoming a tourist attraction but now he finds that it has become too commercial,” he tells us. Anil feels that such films push one to use their mind and youngsters today enjoy doing that. “They don’t want to be spoonfed,” he says.

Amid this flood of good content and realistic cinema, what do thrillers have to offer? Do they still appeal to the audience as they did before? Moreover, the idea of thrillers has also changed with Sacred Games and Mirzapur. They are no longer infused with fiction or fantasy. It’s reality all the way. Anil thinks it’s changing because of the kind of exposure to content we have now. “It’s so important that even fantasy has a bit of reality now. People want the characters and stories to be real. A little larger than life. Nobody starts investing in something the customer doesn’t require. It’s always according to what people want. There are so many stakeholders, distributors and producers. They always invest in stories which the audience wants to consume. Sometimes they succeed and at times they don’t. It’s just a part of the business. Also, the choices vary from filmmaker to filmmaker, actor to actor. You just need to do your best and eventually, it is the audience which decides what’s right, what’s wrong,” he says.

The actor is known to have blended in with the younger generation really well. So does he feel the pressure of putting the right content forward as many people, especially youngsters look up to him? He feels that it’s not just him but almost everybody has the pressure of putting the right content forward, no matter the age or the profession. “When everybody knows the kind of work you do, they start expecting a little more and you stand in a position where you have to deliver. That’s partially the price you pay for being in the show business. And you are also paid for that, so why won’t you deliver? There are no free lunches in life,” he laughs and says.

As an actor, Anil has straddled arthouse and big commercials effortlessly. How difficult is it to keep a balance while switching genres? It depends on the actor, he says. For him, the more challenging it is, the more exciting it becomes. “I love challenges. I want to dive into something which I have never done before. So I never step back from trying new things because when you keep on doing same things over and over again, there is a tendency to stagnate and people get bored. So that’s not the right move for an actor who really loves his work. And when you start doing great work, people expect you to do the same thing and even that becomes more challenging. Both ways, it is difficult,” says Anil.

174,01-2-20,Helmet will decide if I should play lead: Aparshakti,"Actor Aparshakti Khurana says he had a great time shooting for his quirky next release, Helmet. The film, co-starring Pranutan Bahl, is his first outing as a solo lead actor. He added that the audience response to the film will determine whether he should do lead roles in the future.

“I think these all are wishes of my family, colleagues and the audience that all these things are happening to me. If Helmet connects with the audience then people might think about whether I should play lead roles or not. If it does not connect, then people will say that it was too early for me to do a lead-hero film and I should have done two to three films in supporting roles. So, it’s all very situational. Having said that, I had a great time shooting for the film. Whatever I have seen and heard about it, it’s all going great,” said the actor, while interacting with the media at dancer choreographer Shakti Mohan’s Break A Leg Season 2 shoot along with actor Nushrat Bharucha.

Aparshakti has carved his niche as a fine actor and comedian with some interesting character roles and was recently seen in the dance hit, Street Dancer 3D. “This is the first time I played an emotional character. I have always played comic characters in films. When I used to do theatre, I used to do a lot of dark and intense roles but when I started working in films, I continuously have been doing comic characters and that was a bit weird. I had fun while playing an emotional character in this film and I feel glad that it connected with the audience,” he said.

Helmet, his first outing as a leading man, is directed by Satram Ramani. Nushrat Bharucha, who was also present at the location, talked about her forthcoming film Chhalaang, co-starring Rajkummar Rao. “We have recently launched the poster of the film. Everybody is excited to see what is going to happen in the film and why Raj (Rajkummar Rao) is sleeping in the poster. We are going to release the trailer very soon, so I don’t want to talk about it any more. The film will release on March 13,” she said about Chhalaang, a black comedy directed by Hansal Mehta and backed by Ajay Devgn, Luv Ranjan and Ankur Garg.

This film will be Aparshakti’s first as a lead actor. Directed by Satram Ramani, Helmet is a funny script which touches upon an unusual topic that is considered embarrassing for most people in India. It is yet to be disclosed. Rohan Shankar, who previously wrote Luka Chuppi has been roped in as the writer.

175,01-2-20,‘Live in the moment’,"Actor David Alan Grier says that the best part of his day is to feel a sense of belonging while walking into a theatre

When David Alan Grier was offered a chance to revisit one of his favourite plays on Broadway, he quickly agreed. He just forgot about all the beatings. In A Soldier’s Play, Grier plays a stern Army sergeant who during each show is pummeled twice and later shot dead, again twice. While the violence is fake, the actor does have to repeatedly drop and roll around on the American Airlines Theatre stage.

While this is Grier’s third time performing A Soldier’s Play, the fact that the role he’s playing was so physical slipped his mind. He only remembered the physicality when a fight coordinator appeared.

“I forgot about all that. I was like, ‘Oh, he has lots of lines. Yeah, I’ll do it.’ I thought there were little scuffles. I thought, well, he gets pushed a couple times. A lot of monologues. I’ll take it,’” says Grier.

To be sure, Grier is the last person you’d expect to be caught unaware. One of his earliest roles was in a small part in the off-Broadway debut of A Soldier’s Play when he was in his 20s. He revisited the work when it was turned into a 1984 film. This is his third bite of the apple. “I was the youngest actor. Now I’m the oldest,” he says.

The play by Charles Fuller is set on an Army base in Louisiana during World War II. A Black investigator has been called to find out who murdered the Black sergeant of an all-black company. What he finds is racism — but not from white bigots or the KKK. He finds intolerance within the black ranks.

The play won the Pulitzer Prize for drama and over the years has attracted some of the most accomplished actors in the black community: Denzel Washington, Adolph Caesar, Samuel L. Jackson, Wood Harris, Taye Diggs, Anthony Mackie, James McDaniel and Blair Underwood.

Jerry O’Connell, who plays a captain worrying about the direction of the case, said it’s a kick having Grier — who has now played three different roles — around for the Broadway version. “It is pretty funny asking Grier for advice, like ‘Hey, what happened in the original production?’ He’s like, ‘It was 38 years ago! I don’t remember any of it!’”

Grier recalls making the film in Arkansas and one day then Gov Bill Clinton stopped by the set. He also vividly recalled the food: Patti LaBelle, who played a nightclub singer, made rice and red beans daily and one day the caterer served something a little odd: catfish sushi. “I abstained. Wisely, wisely, I was told later,” Grier says. One reason was that he’d never heard of such a dish. “And I’m going to go out on a limb. I speak for all Japan: Neither have they.”

When you speak to the actor, food often comes up. He’s an avid chef and shares his creations on social media and in a food blog. He recently detailed cooking a massive pork shoulder for eight hours. He managed to pull out the bone and simmer it with root vegetables to make bone broth. Someone mentioned in the comment section they’d also been boiling bones but they were doing it for three days and the broth tasted terrible. “Yeah, you dummy. Three days? That’s what you do to get rid of a body,” joked Grier.

Food — well, dessert, really — had an important role in how he became an actor. Growing up in Detroit, he knew he was funny but he moved to New York in the mid-1970s to be a musician. And like all struggling musicians, he had a side hustle.

Grier worked at a Häagen-Dazs ice cream store in the Upper East Side of Manhattan and often after his sticky shift would go across the street to a disco. One night he was messing around when an actor spotted him and said he had talent and was wasting his life. “He was really responsible for saying you are on the wrong path. Whatever he saw in that moment was ‘You need to go over here,’” says Grier. “And I listened.”

Grier, who after that conversation applied to acting schools and chose Yale, would go on to a career on the stage (Dreamgirls and Porgy and Bess), on TV (In Living Color and DAG) and film (Jumanji and Native Son).

Being on Broadway again these days isn’t old hat to the 63-year-old performer. He even likes to get to the theatre early, long before the place is buzzing.

“To walk into a theater and belong — this is my doorway into my life — is the best. It’s the best part of the day,” he says. “You walk in this environment before the audience is there and the crew is kind of just vacuuming, setting up, testing everything. I love it.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---live-in-the-moment----2020-02-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/---live-in-the-moment---.html
176,01-2-20,Final that nobody saw coming,"In a first, Kenin, Muguruza face-off for first Australian title

Serena Williams dominated talk before the Australian Open but today’s women’s final is between unseeded Garbine Muguruza and unheralded Sofia Kenin — a 750-1 longshot of a championship match that nobody predicted.

After a tournament of surprises, the 21-year-old Kenin can even supplant Williams as the top-ranked American if she manages another plot twist by beating Spain’s Muguruza in Melbourne.

The 38-year-old American legend Williams was attempting to equal the record 24 Grand Slam titles of Australian Margaret Court, but she lost in the third round to China’s Wang Qiang.

Reigning champion Naomi Osaka went out at the same stage to 15-year-old sensation Coco Gauff, who was promptly turfed out herself by fellow American Kenin.

Six of the top 10 seeds exited in the third round, seemingly blowing the tournament open for Australia’s world number one Ashleigh Barty.

But step forward Moscow-born 14th seed Kenin once more, who showed remarkably few nerves in her first Grand Slam semi-final as she broke home hearts in straight sets.

Even if she loses the final, Kenin will reach a career-high nine in the world, rising from her current position of 15th.

If she beats Muguruza — and she did so in their only previous meeting, at the China Open in the autumn — she will leapfrog Williams into seventh in the rankings.

“After this week, she is a top-10 player, she deserves that respect and she deserves the recognition,” said the beaten Barty, the latest to succumb to the fiery Kenin.

“She’s played an exceptional tournament, she’s had an exceptional last 12 months.”

Kenin won her first WTA title only 12 months ago in Hobart and added two more during the season with the determination and aggression that has become her trademark in the past fortnight.

“I’ve always had that, no matter who I’m playing, where I’m playing, I’m going to fight for it,” said Kenin, who moved to the United States from Russia as a baby with her family.

The 26-year-old Muguruza will be the next to try to tame Kenin. British bookmakers William Hill said the odds of a Kenin-Muguruza final were 750-1 before the Australian Open began.

They make Muguruza the favourite because she has experience of the biggest occasions, having won the French Open in 2016 and Wimbledon in 2017.

But this is her first final in Melbourne and she is ranked 32 in the world after her form tailed off alarmingly in the past 18 months.

Unseeded for the first time at a Grand Slam since 2014, Muguruza beat three top-10 seeds in reaching the final.

She fought back in both sets in her semi-final against fourth-ranked Simona Halep to defeat her fellow former world number one 7-6 (10/8), 7-5.

Muguruza is not one for exuberant celebrations and she gives as little away in her post-match comments.

So it was left to Halep to say that the Spaniard has the quality to be the world’s top-ranked player once more — but with one caveat.

“If she can play every day like this, she can be number one for sure,” said the 28-year-old Romanian, also a French Open and Wimbledon champion, following their hard-fought semi-final.

177,01-2-20,Thiem outlasts Zverev,"Tireless Dominic Thiem came from a set down to outlast German Alexander Zverev and make his first Australian Open final on Friday, booking a showdown with seven-time champion Novak Djokovic.

The 26-year-old fifth seed, the first player from Austria ever to reach the Melbourne decider, battled past seventh-ranked Zverev 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/4) on a sweltering evening.

Defending champion Djokovic awaits him after the second seed ended Roger Federer’s dreams in straight sets on Thursday to make his eighth Melbourne Park final.

Thiem has his work cut out against the Serb who is on a 12-match unbeaten streak this season and has won all seven of the Australian Open deciders he has contested.

And if Djokovic needs extra motivation, winning tomorrow will see him reclaim the world number one ranking after Rafael Nadal crashed to Thiem in the last eight.

“It was an unreal match, two tie-breakers, so tough and so close. It was almost impossible to break him,” said Thiem.

“Being in the Australian Open final is unreal. What a start to the season for me.”

Thiem had dealt with semi-final pressure before, although always on the slower red clay at Roland Garros, where he reached the past two finals only to be beaten by Nadal.

That experience paid dividends as he coolly closed out the match after 3hrs 42 mins to give himself another chance to break the stranglehold of the Big Three and win his first Grand Slam.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/thiem-outlasts-zverev.html
178,01-2-20,Boris Johnson hails UK’s new beginning as Brexit day arrives,"Britain begins the day as a member of the European Union. Its status at the end of the day — as a proud nation that has reclaimed its sovereignty, or a diminished presence in Europe and the world — will still be up for debate.

Britain officially departs the EU at 11 pm local time Friday, midnight in Brussels (2300 GMT, 6 pm EST). The departure comes 3½ years after the country voted by a margin of 52%-48% to walk away from the club that it had joined in 1973.

It’s the first time a country has left the EU, and many in the bloc regard it as a sad day. In Brussels, European Council President Charles Michel and EU Commission leader Ursula von der Leyen are due to sketch out the EU’s first steps as a group of 27, rather than 28.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to meet in the morning with his Cabinet in the pro-Brexit town of Sunderland, in northeast England. He is scheduled to deliver a televised address to the country an hour before departure, calling Brexit “not an end but a beginning.” According to his office, he will describe it as “a moment of real national renewal and change.”

The government hopes the moment will be marked in a dignified, nontriumphalist fashion, with red, white and blue lights illuminating government buildings and a countdown clock projected onto the prime minister’s 10 Downing St. Residence.

Some Brexit supporters will be holding more raucous celebrations. Arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage and his band of devotees will gather for patriotic songs and speeches in London’s Parliament Square to mark a moment that even Farage sometimes doubted would ever come.

Britain was never a wholehearted EU member, but actually leaving the bloc was long considered a fringe idea.

It gradually gained strength within the Conservative Party, which has a wing of fierce “euroskeptics” — opponents of EU membership. Former Prime Minister David Cameron eventually agreed to hold a referendum, saying he wanted to settle the issue once and for all.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/boris-johnson-hails-uk---s-new-beginning-as-brexit-day-arrives.html
179,01-2-20,Slow response made coronavirus epidemic worse: Chinese official,"China’s delayed response to the discovery of a deadly new coronavirus infection worsened the epidemic, the most senior official from the city at the centre of the outbreak said Friday. More than 210 people have died and nearly 10,000 others have been infected in China by the SARS-like virus and new cases have been found abroad, with more than 20 countries now affected by the disease.

Public anger has simmered on Chinese social media over the handling of the health emergency by local authorities in Wuhan, where the virus was first detected.

Wuhan officials have been criticised online for withholding information about the infection until the end of last year, despite knowing about the new illness weeks earlier.

“Right now I’m in a state of guilt, remorse and self-reproach,” said Ma Guoqiang, the municipal Communist Party secretary for Wuhan.

“If strict control measures had been taken earlier, the result would have been better than now,” he told an interview with state broadcaster CCTV.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/slow-response-made-coronavirus-epidemic-worse--chinese-official.html

Outside the metropolis in central China, the cargo was shifted to local trucks with drivers in masks and protective suits, part of a tightly controlled flow of food and other supplies through checkpoints that have blocked most access to Wuhan since January 23.

As global anxiety about the new virus rises, authorities have blocked 50 million people from leaving Wuhan and nearby cities at the centre of the outbreak. That in turn requires a massive effort to keep them supplied with food and other necessities. “Wuhan is not an isolated island,” declared a state newspaper, the Yangtze Daily.

Few Governments could attempt such drastic restrictions on a population bigger than South Korea’s or Australia’s. They are made possible by the ruling Communist Party’s extensive controls on society and experience combating the 2002-03 SARS epidemic.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/china-locked-down-50-mn-people--has-to-keep-them-fed.html

About 20 countries, including India, the UK, US, South Korea, Japan and France, have reported confirmed cases of the virus in travellers coming from China. The WHO, which held an emergency meeting in Geneva on Thursday, on declared the outbreak a global health emergency, a rarely used designation that could lead to improved international co-ordination in tackling the disease.

“Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said as he announced the virus as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

Reacting to the WHO announcement, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying in a press statement said, “Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus epidemic, the Chinese Government has been taking the most comprehensive and rigorous prevention and control measures with a high sense of responsibility for people’s health.” Many of these measures go well beyond the requirements of the International Health Regulations, she said.

“We have full confidence and capability to win this fight against the epidemic,” said the spokesperson.

She said at the same time, the Chinese side informed relevant sides and shared the genome sequence of the coronavirus in a timely manner with openness, transparency and a responsible attitude.

Hua said China has been in close communication and cooperation with WHO. “WHO experts recently conducted a field trip to Wuhan. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also visited China and discussed containment and mitigation of the 2019-nCoV with the Chinese side,” she said.

Afghanistan fought hard after posting 189 but just did not have enough runs on the board. Huraira, playing his first game of the tournament, struck a match-winning knock in the fourth quarterfinal.

Qasim Akram (25 not out off 41 balls)and Mohammad Haris (29 not out off 43) saw the team through in just 41.1 overs.

Tahir Hussain (1/28 in 10 overs), Fahad Munir (2/29 in 7) and Mohammad Amir Khan (3/58 in 10) were the pick of the Pakistan bowlers.

Defending champions India and Pakistan play their semifinal in Potchefstroom on February 4. India had beaten Australia in their quarterfinal match.

Talking about the team’s performance, Pakistan captain Rohail Nazir said: “We dropped 2-3 early catches and had we held on, we could have restricted them to a lesser total.

On the India game, he added: “It is another game. India is a good side and we need to play good cricket. The crowd really motivated us, appreciated us and I hope they turn up for the semifinal and cheer for us.”

Afghanistan captain Farhan Zakhil said 189 was defendable.

“The wicket was good and our batsmen did not take responsibility. They bowled well and created the chances. 190 was a par score for our bowlers.

This was the first triumph of the season for the defending champions Raptors after suffering three losses on the trot.

Tai came out as the stronger of the two, making a fast start to go up to 3-0. It, however, did not take the Rio Olympic Silver medallist long to level matters. Finding her trademark smashes, she made it 3-3 before moving ahead to 8-5 as the Chinese Taipei ace seemed to be struggling to figure out Sindhu.

Sindhu looked to be in control to inch her way ahead to 10-7. The Raptors ace then tried accelerating her game and used her skilful deception at the net. That was all she could manage to do against a determined Sindhu who never faltered.

Running Tai around the court by rotating the direction of the shuttle, the Indian raced ahead to 12-9 and soon bagged the opening game 15-11.

A highly competitive second game ensued which witnessed the stamina and hunger of both. Tai kept answering Sindhu’s power smashes with her own attacking game, keeping the game on par till 8-8. Infusing a little more speed in the exchanges, Tai got the better of Sindhu to move ahead to 12-9. With the World No 2 having reached game points, the Indian banked on her aggression to close the gap between the two to just two points before extending the rallies in an attempt to draw an error from Tai’s racquet. It did not help her much as Tai took the second game 15-13.

With the momentum having swung her way, Tai did not make any mistake in the decider to open up a big lead of 6-2, riding on her finesse. Under pressure, Sindhu made unforced errors which did not help her cause further.

Having put Sindhu on the backfoot, Tai kept going for her smashes to lead 13-9. With Sindhu’s smash landing wide, the highly anticipated match ended in an 11-15, 15-13, 15-9 victory for Tai, sealing the tie for the Raptors.

192,01-2-20,Shami is world’s best pacer: Akhtar,"Jasprit Bumrah might be considered one of the best in the business at present, but former Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar believes that it is Mohammed Shami who is best fast bowler in the world at present. Akhtar not only praised the Indian pacer for his brilliant show in the third T20I against New Zealand, but also said that Shami uses his experience really well in tough situations.

“Shami is a very clever bowler. He is the find of India and he is the best fast bowler in the world. Whatever situation you put him in, he always excels, whether it's a world cup or a T20 in New Zealand, he’s a very very smart fast bowler. When he got to know that yorkers won’t work, he immediately switched to length balls and bouncers,” Akhtar said on his Youtube channel.

“When Taylor hit Shami for a six in the first ball, I thought the match was over but that’s where the experience of Shami came into play. He realized there was little bit of dew which will help the ball skid if he hits the length.”

New Zealand needed 9 runs off the last six balls when Kohli handed the ball to Shami and even though Taylor started the over with a six, the pacer kept cool and came back to dismiss him off the last ball to tie the game.

“Taylor hit me a lot through the midwicket region in my last match but unfortunately he dragged the same shot onto his stumps on the last ball. But credit to Shami,” Akhtar pointed.

Earlier Rohit Sharma also credited Shami for bringing the team back into the game after a master-class from Kane Williamson had almost seen the Kiwis stroll home.

“I think Shami’s last over was crucial, and actually that got us the victory. Not my two sixes. It was Shami’s over where we defended nine runs. It’s not easy with the dew,” Rohit had said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/shami-is-world---s-best-pacer--akhtar.html

Messi’s double, as well as goals from Antoine Griezmann, Clement Lenglet and Arthur Melo rounded off an emphatic win at Camp Nou, where Barca successfully bounced back from Saturday’s surprise La Liga loss away at Valencia.

Griezmann made his case by opening the scoring after four minutes as Nelson Semedo cut back for the Frenchman to control and poke home his 13th goal of the season.

Another Griezmann strike was ruled out shortly after, only for Lenglet to head in Messi’s corner at the near post to put Barcelona two up after 27 minutes.

Messi made it three after springing in behind just before the hour and then Arthur Melo, on for Griezmann, added another, banging in after both Ansu Fati and Messi had been denied.

Leganes were finished but Messi had one more goal left in him as he latched onto Ivan Rakitic’s pass and rounded Pichu Cuellar, before finishing for his 19th of the season and third under a relieved Setien.

197,01-2-20,‘Couple of good shows can put Saina back on track’,"Ace shuttler Saina Nehwal is currently in a tight spot in her bid for a Tokyo Olympics singles berth but a couple of good performances in the coming weeks can put her back in contention, her mentor Parupalli Kashyap said on Friday.

Saina is racing against time to make the cut for her fourth successive Olympics.

According to the BWF Olympics qualification rules, only two players from each singles category can qualify from a country if their rankings lie within the top-16 by April 28.

“It is getting tight now. There are two more weeks before the Spain Masters (February 18-23). It is a crucial time. She has to get her confidence back. I think she will be okay. A couple of good weeks and she will be back on track. But her body has to support her,” Kashyap said about his wife.

The 2012 London Olympic Bronze medallist, has not won a title since the 2019 Indonesia Masters in January and she was able to cross the first-round only six times in the last 14 tournaments that she has played.

The gradual dip in her performance saw her slip to the 18th spot in BWF rankings and a lowly 22nd in the Olympic qualification rankings.

Explaining further, Kashyap, himself a former world No 6 singles player, said: “Saina is currently world No 18 and she has to be inside top 16 by April 28. She has 49000 points and she has to get to around 53000 points by that time, so basically she has to make 4000-5000 points in the next eight tournaments.

“She has to defend points at All England and Asian championship. So she has to basically make four quarters or semifinals. She has to play better in next few tournaments and she can still make it.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---couple-of-good-shows-can-put-saina-back-on-track---.html
198,01-2-20,Sathiyan hopes to make Olympic cut soon,"Though the Indian men’s and women’s table tennis teams missed out on an opportunity to secure qualification for the Tokyo Olympics in the 2020 ITTF World Team Qualification tournament, earlier this month, but top Indian TT players still have a chance to book a berth in the singles competition. India’s TT star G Sathiyan expressed that the top Indian singles players have a great chance of qualifying for the Olympics.

“We have a very big chance for qualifying for the singles and I will definitely try to make amends there and see how I can improve my best and how I can maintain my top form. The preparations are going great. We have a lot of tournaments scheduled. I am pretty sure that I will make the cut very soon,” said the paddler.

The Indian table tennis contingent performed exceedingly well at the Asian Games and Commonwealth Games in 2018 with the women’s team clinching Gold at CWG and the men’s team winning Bronze at the Asian Games, among other medals. Sathiyan said that increased exposure for athletes has helped the sport grow in India.

“Table tennis has improved by leaps and bounds in India. The very fact that we were the favourites in such a big tournament like the Olympic qualification talks about how we have grown in the last four years. We have started proving our mettle in the world arena. It’s not an easy job for teams to take on India now,” said the 27-year-old.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sathiyan-hopes-to-make-olympic-cut-soon.html

200,01-2-20,Mendis spoils Zimbabwe party,"A stubborn 80 not out from Sri Lankan opener Kusal Mendis frustrated Zimbabwe’s hopes of squaring the two-Test series on Friday’s fifth and final day of the second Test in Harare.

Set a challenging 361 to win, Sri Lanka dropped anchor, scoring just 51 runs in the afternoon session, to reach 156 for three at tea.

Sri Lanka lost captain Dimuth Karunaratne in the morning and Oshada Fernando for 47 just after lunch but Mendis batted though to tea, striking 10 fours in his 170-ball vigil.

Zimbabwe gained some renewed hope shortly before the interval when Angelo Mathews slapped a delivery from Victor Nyauchi straight to Craig Ervine at mid-on.

Sri Lanka require another 205 in the last session although with rain forecast, any result other than a draw would now be a surprise.

Instead they batted on briefly to reach 247 for seven before the declaration came with Williams, who made a century in the first innings, picking up the three runs he needed for another half-century to finish 53 not out.

Williams then chose to open the bowling with spinner Raza who took seven wickets in the first innings.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mendis-spoils-zimbabwe-party.html
201,01-2-20,"JeM terrorists carried ready-to-use IED, ammunition capable of piercing bulletproof vehicles","Three JeM terrorists, killed in a gunfight near a toll plaza here, had left an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) under a hoarding on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway which another member of the module was to use to target security forces, police said on Saturday.

The Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorists also carried 'armoured piercing steel core ammunition' which can go through Level 3 protection bulletproof vehicles that police and other security forces use, they said.

The ammunition was in large quantity and could have posed a grave threat, top police officials said.

The terrorists were killed in a fierce gunbattle with police at Bann Toll Plazaa near Nagrota, about 28 km from Jammu city, officials said.

The operation was called off after eliminating all the three terrorists but vigilance will still be carried out in the area, they added.

The truck-borne terrorists carried with them a powerful ready-to-use IED from across the border to carry out attack against the security forces on the highway, they said.

They had ""dumped it at a convenient location"" near a hoarding on the highway to be used by a third person of their module, who is currently in Jammu, they said.

Truck driver Sameer Dar, conductor Asif Malik and another over ground worker (OGW) were arrested.

Based on the disclosure during questioning of the three OWGs, a police team and bomb disposal squad swung into action and defused the IED fitted with RDX, grenades and other material and placed under a hoarding at Nagrota on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway, the officials said.

Efforts are on track down the person of the JeM module in Jammu who was to plant IED to target security forces, they said.

The JeM terrorists also carried with them a deadly US-made sniper rifle, six rifles, five pistols, 11 hand grenades, explosives and high-end satellite communication phones and GPS. DGP said that JeM terrorists only carried such weapons, that too by its top commanders.

They said M4 sniper rifle was used by militants in Kashmir in 2018 in five incidents fatally targeting police personnel.

The officials said that had the M4 carbine again fallen into the hands of militants, it could have proved disastrous for security personnel.

Three OGWs of the militants including their handler Sameer Dar, Sartaj Ahmed Mantu and Asif Malik, all residents of Kakpora, Pulwama, were arrested by police and have been shifted to safer location for sustained questioning as they were part of JeM plot to cause wide spread disturbances in the Valley, the officials said.

Sameer was cousin of February 14 Pulwama attack mastermind Adil Dar. Sameer's brother, Manzoor Malik, a Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant, was killed in South Kashmir in 2016.

Police and security forces detained five more truck operators from Rhembal and Udhampur last night and two of them had called Sameer Dar on telephone but involvement of all of them was being investigated, the officials said.

Police said the terrorist group is suspected to have infiltrated from along the International Border (IB) in Dayalachak area in Hiranagar sector of Kathua district and were picked by truckers around 2 am on Friday to carry out an attack.

The group was on its way to Srinagar when the police team intercepted it at the plaza around 5 am on Friday, they said.

One of the terrorists was killed in the ensuing gunfight while the rest managed to escape to the adjacent forest area, Director General of Police Dilbag Singh said, adding a policeman was injured and has been hospitalised.

The terrorists also fired grenades, the officials said.

The new tax regime will be optional and the taxpayers will be given the choice to either remain in the old regime with exemptions and deductions or opt for the new reduced tax rate without those exemptions, she said in the Lok Sabha while unveiling the Budget 2020-21.

Under the proposal, people with an annual income of Rs 5 lakh to Rs 7.5 lakh will have to pay a reduced tax rate of 10 per cent; between Rs 7.5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh 15 per cent; between Rs 10 lakh and 12.5 lakh 20 per cent; between Rs 12.5 lakh and 15 lakh 25 per cent; and above Rs 15 lakh 30 per cent, she said.

The proposal would lead to a revenue sacrifice of Rs 40,000 crore per annum, she added.

The two sides meet for the final match at Mt Maunganui tomorrow.

“It has been our motto, not only for these two matches, that till the time the last ball is bowled, we won’t give up any match. If you play with that intent you will get matches like these where you might get a Super Over, and you win from there,” Pandey said at the post-match conference.

“And now we have an opportunity to make it 5-0 and it will be really amazing to do that. Come the fifth match, we will look to go 5-0 up, that is our plan. Nobody has done it before and especially India has not done it before. So, I think it will be a great start to do that.”

Asked if the players believed they could pull off a Super Over win yet again as they did on Friday, Pandey said, “In the middle, it looked like we were a little easy on ourselves. But since it had happened the last game, we thought we had to bowl good balls and it is possible we push it to a Super Over. And then, as the balls went by and we reached the last two balls, we were certain that this would go to Super Over.

“We were ready for it in the back of our mind. We have very good bowlers and Shardul (Thakur) bowled a very good last over. For his effort, he deserved it that the game went into a Super Over,” said Pandey who made 50 not out off 36 balls.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---stay-calm-till-the-end---.html

Besides, a national police university and a national forensic science university are being proposed in the domain of policing science, forensic science and cyber forensics.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/govt-to-bring-new-education-policy--allocates-rs-99-300-cr-for-sector-in-fy21-2020-02-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/govt-to-bring-new-education-policy--allocates-rs-99-300-cr-for-sector-in-fy21.html
214,01-2-20,"Synchronised action of central banks helped world economy, says IMF chief","Synchronised action of central banks and accommodative monetary policy have delivered half a percentage boost to global growth, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has said, cautioning that the Coronavirus outbreak in China posed a major threat to the global economy.

""We are in a better place in comparison to October, but the growth remains sluggish and we see risks still tilted to the downside. Why we believe we are in a better place? We saw reduction of trade tensions prior to Davos and in Davos and trade tensions were weighting quite severely on growth prospects,"" Georgieva told a group of reporters here on Friday.

""We also saw the benefit of synchronised action of central banks. Accommodative monetary policy has delivered half a percentage boost to global growth. Actually, it is quite remarkable that 49 central banks cut interest rates 71 times, and leading to an outcome for growth for 2019 of 2.9 per cent,"" she said.

""If we didn't have this synchronised monetary policy, growth would have been in the zone that by IMF assessments lingers into recession. So very important to recognise the contribution monetary policy has made,"" she said.

Noting poor trade and industrial output, Georgieva said it is a more uncertain world than before.

""It is a more shock-prone world and we got the evidence virtually days after we presented this outlook with the Coronavirus hitting the Chinese economy but also presenting a risk for growth globally,"" Georgieva said.

""That point of more uncertain global environment is one I want to stress very strongly. Australia saw a significant risk to its own growth prospects because of forest fires. We had a week of uncertainty because of tensions in the Middle East and now we have Coronavirus,"" she said.

At the same time, there are other uncertainties that still hang on the world economy, whether the trade truce between China and the US will turn into trade peace, whether there would be reform of the trade system that boosts the role of trade as an engine of growth; what kinds of geopolitical tensions one might be faced throughout the year, she said.

The IMF managing director urged policymakers to do everything possible not to add to the uncertainty and to build agility so they can anticipate and act quickly as these kinds of events occur.

Georgieva said climate change has now taken central stage.

""On one side it presents a clear danger to our economies and to livelihoods of people. And also because it presents a tremendous opportunity for investments in low carbon climate resilient development,"" she said.

The world, she said, is faced with 'low productivity growth, low economic growth, low interest rates, low inflation'.

""And if we are seeking a silver bullet to boost investments and growth, it might very well be that concerted climate action is that silver bullets. I'm stressing it because we tend to talk about climate as a risk negative. However, it is also an opportunity for growth,"" she noted.

One of the reasons for the IMF to slightly downgrade assessments for 2019, projections for 2020 and 2021 was unrest in a number of countries -- Chile, Ecuador, Lebanon, Iraq, Hong Kong.

""We need to recognise that inequalities have been growing,"" she said, ruing that in the OECD member states and in many countries there was a record high or climbing towards a record height.

""Our research shows that raising rising inequalities is not good for growth and actually building more inclusive societies facilitates better economic performance,"" the IMF chief said.

The IMF, she said, is very closely monitoring the impacts of Coronavirus.

The first and most immediate is on domestic demand in particular in the parts of China that had been most directly impacted by measures to contain the virus.

""We see some indirect impacts building up around manufacturing, value chains being impacted by the disruption caused by the virus,"" she said.

""We see impact on travel and on tourism. This in the short-term is likely to bring some slow down. In the long-term, we don't know. We have to assess how quickly action is being taken to contain the spread of Coronavirus and how effective this action is,"" Georgieva said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/synchronised-action-of-central-banks-helped-world-economy--says-imf-chief-2020-02-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/synchronised-action-of-central-banks-helped-world-economy--says-imf-chief.html

216,01-2-20,Scent of rose improves learning and sleeping,"Researchers have found that smelling the scent of rose improves the quality of the learning and can also helps in sleeping better.

The study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, was conducted within pupils of two classes that learned English vocabulary, one of which learned it with the scent sticks while the other one did it without it.

""We showed that the supportive effect of fragrance works very reliably in everyday life and can be used in a targeted way,"" said study leader Jurgen Kornmeier from the University of Freiburg in Germany.

For the study, first author and student teacher Franziska Neumann conducted several experiments with 54 students from two 6th grade classes of a school in southern Germany.

The young participants from the test group were asked to place rose-scented incense sticks on their desks at home while learning English vocabulary and on the bedside table next to the bed at night.

In another experiment, they also placed the incense sticks on the table next to them during a vocabulary test at school during an English test.

The results were compared with test results in which no incense sticks were used during one or more phases.

""The students showed a significant increase in learning success by about 30 per cent if the incense sticks were used during both the learning and sleeping phases,"" Neumann said.

The results also suggest that the additional use of the incense sticks during the vocabulary test promotes memory.

""One particular finding beyond the seminal initial study was, that the fragrance also works when it is present all night, this makes the findings suitable for everyday use,"" Kornmeier said.

Previous studies had assumed that the fragrance needs to be only present during a particularly sensitive sleeping phase.

""Our study shows that we can make learning during sleep easier. And who would have thought that our nose could help considerably in this,"" Kornmeier said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/scent-of-rose-improves-learning-and-sleeping-2020-02-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/scent-of-rose-improves-learning-and-sleeping.html

218,01-2-20,"Senate rejects motion calling for new witnesses in impeachment trial, sets stage for Trump acquittal","The Republican Party-controlled US Senate on Friday narrowly rejected the opposition Democrats' motion to call new witnesses and documents for the impeachment trial against President Donald Trump.

As a result, the Senate is expected to acquit Trump of the charges early next week. He is scheduled to deliver his third State of the Union Address on February 4. The move to invite new witnesses was defeated by 51 to 49 votes.

In the 100-member Senate, the Republican Party has 53 seats and the Democrats 47. Two of the Republican Senators, Mitt Romney and Susan Collins, sided with the Democrats in this vote to call former White House national security advisor John Bolton and other Trump aides to testify.

The Democrats need 67 votes to convict and remove Trump from the White House.

""The vote represented a major victory for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Trump, both of whom have been calling for Republicans to reject the motion and move toward ending the trial,” Politico said.

The House, wherein the Democrats enjoy a majority had impeached Trump on two counts of misuse of power and obstruction to the Congress.

The Senate started the impeachment trial last week.

“The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats keep chanting “fairness”, when they put on the most unfair Witch Hunt in the history of the U.S. Congress. They had 17 Witnesses, we were allowed ZERO, and no lawyers. They didn't do their job, had no case. The Dems are scamming America!” Trump said in a tweet moments before the voting on move to call new witnesses.

“Democrats = 17 Witnesses. Republicans = 0 Witnesses,” Trump tweeted after the vote justifying the Senate vote against the move to call new witnesses.

“The vote Friday represented a major victory for Republican leadership,” The Wall Street Journal said. According to the Journal, the vote on whether to convict or acquit Trump may not take place until next week, likely on Wednesday.

There was ""no need"" for the Senate to re-open the investigation which the House Democratic majority chose to conclude and which the managers themselves continue to describe as overwhelming and beyond any doubt, Senate Majority Leader Senator Mitch McConnell said.

“Never in Senate history has this body paused an impeachment trial to pursue additional witnesses with unresolved questions of executive privilege that would require protracted litigation,” he said.

“We have no interest in establishing such a new precedent, particularly for individuals whom the House expressly chose not to pursue,"" McConnell told reporters.

“We knew this was an uphill fight,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters.

“We're not in the majority; we have a president who strikes fear in the hearts of Republicans,” he added.

“To not allow a witness, a document--no witnesses, no documents--in an impeachment trial is a perfidy. It's a grand tragedy, one of the worst tragedies that the Senate has ever overcome. America will remember this day, unfortunately, where the Senate did not live up to its responsibilities, where the Senate turned away from truth and went along with a sham trial,” Schumer said.

“If the president is acquitted with no witnesses, no documents, the acquittal will have no value because Americans will know that this trial was not a real trial. It had no witnesses, no documents, is a tragedy on a very large scale,” the Senate Minority Leader alleged.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi described it as a ""sad day"" for America.

""The Senate Republicans' vote against calling witnesses and compelling documents in the impeachment proceedings makes them accomplices to the President's cover-up,” she said.

“The President was impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. He is impeached forever. There can be no acquittal without a trial. And there is no trial without witnesses, documents and evidence,” she added.

“It is a sad day for America to see Senator McConnell require the Chief Justice of the United States to preside over a vote which rejected our nation's judicial norms, precedents and institutions to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law,” Pelosi said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/senate-rejects-motion-calling-for-new-witnesses-in-impeachment-trial--sets-stage-for-trump-acquittal-2020-02-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/senate-rejects-motion-calling-for-new-witnesses-in-impeachment-trial--sets-stage-for-trump-acquittal.html
219,01-2-20,"Coronavirus: Death toll rises to 259 in China, infections surge to nearly 12000","The death toll from the novel coronavirus outbreak in China has risen to 259 with total confirmed cases surging to 11,791 amid stepped up efforts by a number of countries to evacuate their nationals from Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus, officials said on Saturday.

Chinese health authorities have announced that the death toll has risen to 259 with total confirmed cases increasing to 11,791, the biggest increase since China began reporting the spread of the virulent virus on January 21.

China's National Health Commission said in its daily report on Saturday that 1,795 patients remained in critical condition, and 17,988 people were suspected of being infected with the virus as of the end of Friday.

A total of 243 people had been discharged from hospital after recovery.

Friday saw 2,102 new confirmed cases, 5,019 new suspected cases, and 46 deaths.

So far about 124 positive cases have been reported in a host of countries, including India where the first case was confirmed in Kerala.

Hubei province and its provincial capital Wuhan remained the ground zero of the virus with 45 deaths and 1,347 confirmed cases, according to the Chinese commission's report.

A total of 1,36,987 close contacts had been traced, the commission said, adding that among them, 6,509 were discharged from medical observation on Friday, with 1,18,478 others still under medical observation, state run Xinhua news agency reported.

By the end of Friday, 13 confirmed cases had been reported in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, seven in Macao Special Administrative Region and ten in Taiwan.

India and several other countries, meanwhile, have stepped evacuating their nationals stranded by Hubei province.

Air India's jumbo B747 plane took off from the Wuhan airport in the early hours of Saturday for Delhi, evacuating 324 Indian nationals from China as the neighbouring country continued to deal with the outbreak of novel coronavirus, said officials.

A second flight is due to take the remaining people on Saturday.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus--death-toll-rises-to-259-in-china--infections-surge-to-nearly-12000-2020-02-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/coronavirus--death-toll-rises-to-259-in-china--infections-surge-to-nearly-12000.html
220,01-2-20,"US declares virus 'emergency,' bans travelers from China","The US said Friday it was declaring a public health emergency and temporarily banning the entry of foreign nationals who had traveled to China over the past two weeks to contain the spread of a deadly new virus.

Sweeping new restrictions will also be imposed on American citizens, with those returning from the province at the disease's epicenter placed in facilities for mandatory 14-day quarantines, said Health Secretary Alex Azar.

US citizens coming from other parts of China will undergo health screening at ports of entry and then be placed under monitored self-quarantine at home.

""I have today declared that the coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the United States,"" said Azar during a briefing at the White House, adding the directives would take effect on February 2 from 5:00 pm eastern time (2200 GMT).

""Foreign nationals, other than immediate family of US citizens and permanent residents, who have traveled in China within the last 14 days will be denied entry into the United States for this time,"" he added.

The restrictions apply to people who have traveled to the designated areas in the two weeks prior to their attempted entry.

There have been seven confirmed US cases of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, which originated in a live seafood market in Wuhan, in Hubei province, in December.

The World Health Organization has already declared the epidemic a global emergency, and the Chinese death toll has risen to 259 while total infections reached nearly 12,000, surpassing the SARS epidemic of two decades ago.

Three US airlines, American, Delta and United said they would soon suspend all flights to China.

Earlier, officials imposed mandatory 14-day quarantine orders on 195 Americans who were air evacuated from Wuhan, the first time a federal directive of this kind was issued for more than 50 years. The last case involved a person who was evaluated for smallpox in the 1960s.

A plane carrying the repatriated citizens, who include diplomats and their families, touched down at the March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, California, on Wednesday and officials initially said the passengers would be asked to voluntarily isolate themselves for up to 72 hours.

Early signs were good, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declared that none of the individuals showed symptoms of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus.

One of the individuals tried to leave the base and was placed under quarantine by the state of California, said CDC official Marty Citron, before the federal action.

The repatriated group submitted samples for testing at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta -- but officials now say they are not certain about the accuracy of their diagnostic tools.

""We are seeing in the cases that are in the hospital, we've seen people who had detectable virus, and they didn't have the technical virus, and then three days later they had detectable virus,"" said Robert Redfield, the CDC's director.

Given that the extent of asymptomatic transmission was not yet clear, a negative test was not being used as a release criteria.

""It isn't like it's a horrible test, but it is not a test that's absolute,"" added CDC immunologist Anthony Fauci.

Despite the seemingly drastic actions, the US public ""should not let fear or panic guide your actions,"" said senior CDC official Nancy Messonnier, but instead exercise normal precautions for stopping the spread of respiratory viruses.

These include washing your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds, disinfecting surfaces, staying home when sick and covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue and then throwing it in the trash.

""We do not currently recommend the use of facemasks for the general American public,"" said Messonnier. ""This virus is not spreading in your communities."" ""Please do not assume that just because someone is of Asian descent that they have this new coronavirus,"" she added, noting there are four million Chinese Americans in the United States.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-declares-virus--emergency---bans-travelers-from-china-2020-02-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/us-declares-virus--emergency---bans-travelers-from-china.html
221,01-2-20,"Clinton jabs again at Sanders, says he didn't unite party","Hillary Clinton is not done talking about Bernie Sanders.

The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee said in a podcast interview that aired Friday that Sanders didn't try to unify the party after losing the primary to her four years ago and that he and his supporters contributed to her loss to Donald Trump in the general election.

Asked by Emily Tisch Sussman of the podcast “Your Primary Playlist"" what Sanders could do this time to unite the party against Trump, Clinton replied, “Well, he can do it, for one.""

“That's not our experience from 2016,” Clinton said.

Clinton's comments come just days before the first-in-the-nation caucuses in Iowa, where Sanders is bunched at the top of the polls with former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

The remarks are yet another reminder of the lasting scars of the the brutal 2016 primary battle between Sanders, whose supporters believe the contest was rigged in Clinton's favour, and Clinton, who has begrudged Sanders for not supporting her candidacy quickly enough after she clinched the nomination.

Just last week, Clinton raised doubts about whether she would endorse Sanders if he wins the 2020 Democratic nomination to face Trump.

Clinton told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview that she's “not going to go there yet,” but later took to Twitter to say her priority was to defeat Trump, “and, as I always have, I will do whatever I can to support our nominee.”

The Sanders campaign didn't immediately respond Friday to requests for a reaction about Clinton's comments.

Last week, Sanders refused to comment on Clinton's critical remarks, saying only in a statement, ""Together, we are going to go forward and defeat the most dangerous president in American history.”

In Friday's podcast, Clinton contrasted the conversations she had with Barack Obama in 2008 about unifying the party after he became the nominee with the conversations she had with Sanders in 2016 after it became clear she would come out on top.

They were “like night and day,” she said.

Although there was “no question” about her nomination, she said, Sanders' “campaign and his principal supporters were just very difficult and really constantly not just attacking me but my supporters.”

At the Democratic National Convention, she said, Sanders' supporters were ""booing Michelle Obama, John Lewis. It was very distressing and such a contrast between what we did to unite in '08.”

“All the way up until the end, a lot of people highly identified with (Sanders') campaign, were urging people to vote third party, urging people not to vote — it had an impact,” she said.

Clinton, who narrowly defeated Sanders in Iowa in 2016 but lost the state to Obama in 2008, also criticised the caucus process as “an undemocratic way of picking the nominee.”

“I'll be happy to see the primaries start rolling around because that's a much easier way for people to participate and for the outcomes to be much clearer,” she said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/clinton-jabs-again-at-sanders--says-he-didn-t-unite-party-2020-02-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/clinton-jabs-again-at-sanders--says-he-didn-t-unite-party.html

The BJP has promised good quality wheat flour at Rs 2 per kg for the poor and supply of clean drinking water to every household in its Delhi Sankalp Patra for the February 8 Delhi Assembly elections.

The BJP also promised creation of 10 lakh jobs in Delhi in the next five years. It has also promised to implement Central Government’s flagship schemes Ayushman Bharat and Kisan Samman Nidhi in the national Capital.

The document highlighted the Modi Government’s work like providing ownership rights to residents in unauthorised colonies and slum redevelopment scheme to provide permanent houses to those living in Jhuggi-Jhopri (JJ) clusters in the city and setting up of a Colony Development Board (CDB).

“Delhi’s future cannot be built by distributing a few freebies. It can be done only through a vision comprising concrete projects,” Gadkari said referring to AAP Government’s freebies schemes.

The party’s manifesto focused on air, water pollution, land reforms, employment opportunities for youth, sports facilities under Khelo India, health schemes, new colleges, schools and implementation of solar and electric policies.

In a response to questions existing subsidies on water and electricity by the AAP Government, Tiwari said none of the existing benefits will be discontinued if the BJP forms the Government. “The schemes on electricity and water are part of a continuous process and will continue. We will not stop any of the existing schemes,” Tiwari said.

In its bid to reach out to the traders, the party promised to address their concerns vis-à-vis “sealing” that has been going on the orders of the Supreme Court empowered committee headed by former bureaucrat Bhure Lal . “Ten lakh shops and offices will be converted from leasehold to freehold in one year and necessary legal changes will be brought to end sealing of commercial properties,” the manifesto stated.

In the ‘’Sankalp Patra’’, the BJP said, “We will set up a water taxi service between Wazirabad and Sonia Vihar, Jagatpur and Tronica City at affordable prices. This will be a non-polluting mode of transport which will also save time of travelers.”

“An annual festival - Yamuna Mahotsav - will be organised to highlight and celebrate the religious importance of the Yamuna. We will also deploy bio-remediation technology for cleaning up the river,” the party said.

The BJP also said it will implement biological treatment of industrial pollutants at source and expand the capacity of sewage treatment plants.

“We will also build a network of ghats on the Yamuna to ensure proper facilities during Chhath Puja,” it said, adding that the party is committed to taking all steps to free the river of pollution in a time-bound manner.

Also, it promised a green industry corridor for green energy technology companies, incentivize installation of solar panels in houses, colonies and factories , a new sports policy to promote and nature sporting talent will be established, keeping in line with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s initiative of ‘fit India and Khelo India’.

New startup schemes to make Delhi as Startup city, upgradation of employment exchanges, rejuvenation of water bodies and develop them as major tourist spots are in BJP’s plan of action if it is voted to power in the city.

The party also promised to start a talent hunt for youth and to provide economic assistance to those selected in pursuing various creative arts.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/atta-at-rs-2-kg--potable-water--bjp---s-sankalp-2020-02-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/atta-at-rs-2-kg--potable-water--bjp---s-sankalp.html
223,01-2-20,Tareekh pe tareekh...,"Justice hangs fire as Nirbhaya convicts not to be hanged today

A Delhi Court on Friday deferred the “death warrant” of the four convicts of the Nirbhaya gangrape-murder case till further order as the mercy plea of one of the convicts is pending before the President. The hanging was scheduled for Saturday (February 1) at 6 am.

Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana of the Patiala House courts ruled that four “death-row convicts”— Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31) — of the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case will not be hanged on Saturday and postponed the execution of their death warrants till further order.

Vinay’s mercy plea before the President is pending, while Akshay has not filed a mercy plea yet. Pawan is the only one yet to file a curative plea. Mukesh’s mercy plea was dismissed by President Ram Nath Kovind on January 17.

Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court dismissed Pawan’s plea seeking review of the decision by which his application claiming to be a juvenile at the time of the commission of offence was rejected.

Convicts have the option of moving a mercy petition before the President only after the apex court dismisses their curative plea.

The court passed the order on the plea by the convicts seeking adjournment of the executions “sine die” (with no appointed date for resumption). This is for the second time that the execution of the death warrants has been deferred. The first order for execution of death sentence, issued on January 7 for January 22 was stayed on January 17.

Tihar jail administration has completed all the formalities for the execution. The hangman, Pawan Jallad, requisitioned for the hanging has even carried out a dry run of the hanging and has been housed on the jail premises.

Advocate AP Singh, the counsel for the three convicts — Pawan, Vinay and Akshay — had urged the court to adjourn the matter “sine die” saying their legal remedies were yet to be exhausted.

The Tihar jail authorities had challenged their application saying it was not maintainable and the death-row convicts can be hanged separately. However, the argument of the Tihar jail authorities was not accepted by the court.

The convicts’ lawyer had argued that rules dictate that when one convict’s plea is pending, the others cannot be hanged. In the order, the judge noted that if an appeal or an application is made by only one convict, the execution of sentence shall be postponed in the case of co-convicts also.

The judge said, “Without commenting upon the dilatory tactics adopted by the convicts, suffice it would be to state that seeking redressal of one’s grievances through procedure established by law is the hallmark of any civilised society. The courts of this country cannot afford to adversely discriminate any convict, including death-row convict, in pursuit of his legal remedies, by turning a Nelson’s eye towards him.”

“As a cumulative effect of the aforesaid discussion, I am of the considered opinion that the execution of warrants issued by this court vide order dates January 17, 2020, deserves to be postponed till further orders,” the judge said.

The court said a copy of this order be given to the counsel for convicts and the jail officials present in the court. “The jail superintendent is directed to file the compliance report by tomorrow,” it said.

Reacting to the court’s order, Nirbhaya’s mother Asha Devi on Friday said she will continue her fight till the convicts in the 2012 gangrape and murder case are hanged.

Devi told reporters her “hopes are dashed” but she will continue her fight till the convicts are hanged. “These convicts have no right to live. We keep getting disappointed by the system. I will continue my fight till the convicts are hanged,” she said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tareekh-pe-tareekh----2020-02-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/tareekh-pe-tareekh---.html

The Economic Survey on Friday projected revival of economic growth to 6-6.5 per cent next fiscal and suggested that the Government should relax the budget deficit target to boost growth from a 11-year low of 5 per cent this year.

Sensex skidded 190 points while the Nifty closed below the 12,000-mark on Friday after the Economic Survey suggested relaxing fiscal deficit target to boost growth.

The Survey, released a day before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the Union Budget for 2020-21, suggested a cut in food subsidy to create fiscal space at a time when tax revenues were falling.

Facing the worst economic slowdown since the global financial crisis of 2008-09 that worsened job prospects, the Survey said businessmen should be respected as they create wealth and jobs.

For India to become a $5 trillion economy by 2025, it prescribed strengthening trust in the economy, enabling and empowering markets, promotion of pro-business policies, and measures to enhance farmers’ income.

It also suggested reforms to make it easier to open new businesses, register property, pay taxes and enforce contracts.

Giving a new dimension to “Make in India”, the Survey suggested that the Government should integrate “Assemble in India for the world” into its flagship programme to boost exports and generate jobs. “By integrating ‘Assemble in India for the world’ into Make in India, India can raise its export market share to about 3.5 per cent by 2025 and 6 per cent by 2030. This will create 4 crore well-paid jobs by 2025 and 8 crore by 2030,” the survey said.

The survey said China’s remarkable export performance vis-a-vis India is driven primarily by deliberate specialisation at large scale in labour-intensive sectors, especially network products, where production occurs across Global Value Chains (GVCs) operated by multi-national corporations.

It batted for aggressive disinvestment to bring higher profitability and efficiency, minimal government intervention in markets, encouraging entrepreneurship, and supporting wealth creation.

Commenting on the Survey, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the report focuses on wealth creation for Indians. “It outlines a multi-faceted strategy to achieve a $5 trillion economy through enterprise, exports, ease of doing business and more,” he tweeted.

Some economists believe the Survey’s growth forecast is too optimistic as the recovery is likely to be slow and shallow amid rising inflation and declining investment.

The Survey has been wide of the mark in forecasting growth in four out of past five years. “The deceleration in GDP growth can be understood within the framework of a slowing cycle of growth with the financial sector acting as a drag on the real sector,” it said.

“The Government must use its strong mandate to deliver expeditiously on reforms, which will enable the economy to strongly rebound in 2020-21.”

Survey-author Krishnamurthy Subramanian, Chief Economic Adviser to the Finance Ministry, rejected his predecessor Arvind Subramanian’s analysis of India’s GDP growth rate being overestimated by 2.7 per cent post-2011, saying the allegation was “unfounded” and “unsubstantiated by the data”.

As has been argued earlier, the Government has to prioritise growth, the Survey for 2019-20, which was tabled by Sitharaman in Parliament, said.

And for this, relaxing the fiscal deficit target could be considered, said the Survey — an annual report card on the economy.

Sitharaman had projected the fiscal deficit at 3.3 per cent of the gross domestic product in her budget for 2019-20 but it is widely seen slipping to 3.8 per cent as the slowdown lowered revenue collections and the Government provided a tax stimulus to spur investments.

This will be the third straight year when the government will miss its fiscal deficit target. Once the momentum picks up, the government can take action to consolidate its expenses. Several economies have done this in the past.

Cutting some of the Rs 1.84 lakh crore food subsidy bill can create the fiscal space, the Survey said.

It emphasized on raising capital expenditure (and reducing revenue expenditure) that leads to asset creation.

This means economic growth, which primarily is driven by consumer spending, has to now come from greater investments. The Survey emphasised on investment-led growth by focusing on reviving the MSME sector.

To further make it easier to do business, it suggested removing the red tape at ports to promote exports as well as measures to make it easier to start a business, register property, pay taxes and enforcing contracts.

It also called for improving governance in public sector banks and the need for more disclosure of information to build trust. It also talks about dwarfism in the banking sector.

Stating that only when wealth is created, it can be distributed, Subramanian said, “A feeling of suspicion and disrespect towards India’s wealth creators is ill-advised.”

In an attempt to boost demand, the Reserve Bank cut interest rate by 110 basis points in 2019 while the government speeded up the insolvency resolution process under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and easing of credit, particularly for the stressed real estate and Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFCs) sectors.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/assemble-in-india--for--5-tn-economy-2020-02-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/assemble-in-india--for--5-tn-economy.html
225,01-2-20,AI flight to bring back students from Wuhan today,"Army, ITBP ready quarantine facilities for returnees; WHO declares coronavirus outbreak global emergency

An Air India jet landed in Wuhan on Friday evening to bring back the Indian students stuck in China’s Hubei province, the epicentre of deadly coronavirus outbreak. All students, save two suffering from fever, boarded the plane which is scheduled to reach India early on Saturday.

After arrival in Delhi, they will be taken to the newly set up Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) quarantine facility. Besides medical care, the paramilitary will provide them basic amenities like food, lodging and internet facilities.

The Army and ITBP have set up separate quarantine centres in the NCR. The ITBP has set up a 600-bed facility, the Army facility will cater to about 300 students being evacuated from China’s Hubei province.

Meanwhile, as the death toll due to lethal coronavirus climbed to 213 with nearly 10,000 infections across 15 countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.

The facility at ITBP’s camp in Chhawla area of south-west Delhi is ready with medicines and monitoring equipment along with a team of qualified doctors from the paramilitary and Safdarjung Hospital, ITBP spokesperson Vivek Kumar Pandey said.

A team of doctors have been stationed at the facility where special arrangements have been made to host children and women at this quarantine facility, Pandey said.

After preliminary diagnosis at the airport, these families will be brought to the quarantine centre which will coordinate with Safdarjung Hospital for assistance, said the official.

The Army quarantine facility in Manesar near Gurugram will keep around 300 Indian students. Officials said the students will be monitored for any signs of infection for two weeks by a qualified team of doctors and staff members.

The procedure of screening and quarantine will comprise two steps. The first one will be at the Indira Gandhi International Airport followed by quarantine at the Manesar facility.

If any individual is suspected to be infected, he or she will be shifted to the isolation ward at the Base Hospital Delhi Cantonment, they said.

Screening at the airport will be done by a joint team of Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) and Airport Health Authority (APHO). During the screening they will be classified into three groups.

They include suspect case where an individual with any signs of fever, cough or respiratory distress will be directly transferred to Base Hospital.

Second step will cover any individual without symptoms but having visited a sea food or animal market or a health facility or having come into contact with a Chinese person with symptoms in the last 14 days. He will be escorted in an earmarked vehicle directly to the quarantine facility.

The third category is non-contact case of any individual without any symptom(s) or contact or who does not fit into either of the earlier two categories. He will also be clubbed along with the close contact category and sent to the quarantine facility.

The facility will be administered by a nominated officer who will have under his command a Community Medicine Specialist, two Nursing Officers, a Lady Medical Officer and one Nursing Assistant. No civilian or serving personnel detailed to work inside the facility will be allowed to go outside unless compelled by extreme emergency situation.

With the DefExpo 2020 scheduled to begin in Lucknow on February 4-8 and more than 40 countries expected to take part in the mega international event, Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar said here on Friday all precautions have been taken for foreigners as regards coronavirus. A delegation from China is also coming. The standard operating procedure is in place and screening will be done as per procedure, he said. DefExpo, the defence exhibition is held every two years. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the exhibition on February 5.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ai-flight-to-bring-back-students-from-wuhan-today-2020-02-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/ai-flight-to-bring-back-students-from-wuhan-today.html
226,01-2-20,JJB remands Jamia shooter in 14-day protective custody,"The youth, who fired at a group of anti-CAA protesters near Jamia Millia Islamia on Thursday injuring a university student on the hand, was on Friday sent to a 14-day protective custody by the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB).

“The juvenile was presented before the JJB on Friday afternoon. We have also urged the board to form a medical panel to conduct a bone ossification test that will verify the age of the youth,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Rajesh Deo.

On Thursday, the accused opened fire at an anti-CAA protester injuring him before walking away while brandishing the firearm aloft and shouting “Yeh lo aazadi” amid heavy police presence. He was soon overpowered by police.

Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik has asked the Crime Branch to probe the case as it is sensitive in nature and should be investigated from all angles following claims that his Class Xth marksheet issued by the CBSE, shows that he is a yet to attain 18 years of age and he is a minor.

The injured Jamia student, Shadab Farooq, was discharged from AIIMS after a surgery on Friday.

227,01-2-20,"Farrukhabad captor shot, wife lynched","The hostage drama ended early on Friday after the captor was shot by security forces and his wife was lynched by angry villagers. All 23 children held captive for eight hours were rescued.

Eight policemen and a local resident were hurt when Subhash Batham, 40, opened fire at them during the siege in Kasaria village, police said.

The accused had invited the children for his daughter’s birthday party and held them hostage since 5.45pm, UP Director General of Police OP Singh said.

The crisis continued past midnight, he added.

Police said Batham, who was a murder accused and appeared mentally unstable, initially released a six-month-old girl by handing her over to a neighbour from a balcony.

They said Batham, who was out on bail, had demanded the withdrawal of a murder case against him.

“The accused was killed and there were about 23 children who were rescued safely,” Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi told reporters at a hurriedly called Press conference at 1.20 am on Friday.

Batham’s wife died in hospital late on Thursday night. She had tried to escape from the spot, but was caught by angry parents who thrashed her and pelted stones at her, Kanpur Inspector General Mohit Agarwal said.

She suffered a head injury in the attack, but the exact cause of death would be known after post-mortem, he said.

The children were confined to the basement of the house.

Agarwal said Batham wanted to talk to the local MLA, but refused to speak to him when he arrived, Agarwal said.

Police recovered a country-made gun, a rifle, about two dozen cartridges and two dozen country-made bombs. The IG said this indicated that he could have kept the children hostage for days, and perhaps planned to blow up the house.

When Batham demanded the withdrawal of the murder case against him, police assured him that they would consider it. They also talked about offering a Government house to him.

While this conversation was going on, a police team entered the house by breaking open the back door. Batham fired two bullets to scare them away.

We thought he had fired at the children and stopped midway, Agarwal said.

His wife then tried to escape from the front door but the children’s parents who had collected there attacked her.

Agarwal said she was seriously injured before police could rescue her.

Sensing that he was surrounded from all sides, Batham opened fire, injuring four policemen. He was killed when police retaliated, the IG said.

Four other policemen were injured when Batham had fired earlier from the terrace and a villager shot in the leg when he was sent to negotiate with the hostage taker.

In a tweet, Union Home Minister Amit Shah congratulated the Uttar Pradesh Police and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.

“It is laudable to get all the children held hostage in Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh safely rescued through the efficient strategy and planning by the police, he said.

Earlier, Adityanath had called a meeting of the State’s crisis management committee and monitored the situation from capital Lucknow, about 200 km away, an official said.

The CM announced an award of Rs 10 lakh for the police team that carried out the rescue operation.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/farrukhabad-captor-shot--wife-lynched.html
228,01-2-20,India go 4-0 up as Kiwis Super Over jinx continues,"A nervous New Zealand threw it away yet again as a perseverant India prevailed in the Super Over for the second successive time to take a 4-0 lead in the T20 International series here on Friday.

Needing just 11 runs off the last two overs with seven wickets in hand, New Zealand dug a hole for themselves yet again, taking the game to a Super Over two nights after doing the same in Hamilton.

New Zealand managed 13 runs in six balls and India got there effortlessly. “What’s happened in last two T20 games is unbelievable...We are very proud of how we went about our business today,” said India captain Virat Kohli, who struck the winning four in the game.

KL Rahul smashed 10 runs off the first two balls before he was caught. Then, a fired-up Kohli and Sanju Samson finished the game in style. “It is very tough. To get ourselves into the position we got today and then give them a chance... India grabbed it with both hands,” said New Zealand stand-in skipper Tim Southee.

This was after New Zealand won a fourth consecutive toss and opted to field. Their regular captain Kane Williamson didn’t take part in the match owing to a shoulder niggle. The Indians weren’t off to a great start but Manish Pandey proved his value to the team with an unbeaten 50 off 35 balls, taking the visitors to 165 for eight from 88 for six in the 12th over.

India’s total wasn’t enough considering the batting-friendly conditions but the hosts made life a lot tougher for themselves from a commanding position before succumbing to pressure.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-go-4-0-up-as-kiwis-super-over-jinx-continues-2020-02-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/india-go-4-0-up-as-kiwis-super-over-jinx-continues.html
229,01-2-20,"US, India cooperation in Indo-Pacific based on shared commitment to uphold rule of law: State Dept","Underscoring the important role of India in America's Indo-Pacific strategy, a US official has said the partnership between the two nations in the region stands on a shared commitment to uphold the rule of law, freedom of navigation and counter-terrorism cooperation and there was no difference in their approach in the area.

Briefing the media about US President Donald Trump's vision in the Indo Pacific, Jonathan Henick, Deputy Assistant Secretary For Central Asia, said America, under its renewed commitment to the Indo-Pacific, was strengthening relations with partner nations that share the value of freedom and openness.

It includes growing our broad and multi-faceted strategic partnership with India, he said.

America's focus in the region is to safeguard and advance the core principles like respect for rule of law, national sovereignty, freedom of navigation, open market, good governance, transparency and democratic institutions, Henick said.

""These include commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, democratic values, rule of law, and private sector-led development,"" he said.

""The India-US partnership stands on a shared commitment to uphold the rule of law, freedom of navigation, democratic values, counter-terrorism cooperation and private sector-led economic growth, so it is not surprising that there is virtually no daylight in our approaches to the Indo-Pacific,"" he added.

Strengthening the security and diplomatic cooperation between India and the United States in the Indo-Pacific region was at the centre of the 2+2 dialogue held last December, Henick said.

""Last December, we hosted the second annual US-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue, led by our secretaries of State and Defense and their counterparts. Strengthening our security and diplomatic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region was at the center of those discussions,"" he told foreign reporters at the Washington Foreign Press Center.

Under its renewed commitment to the vital Indo-Pacific region, the US is strengthening relations with partner nations that share the values of freedom and openness.

""That includes growing our broad and multi-faceted strategic partnership with India,"" the official said.

The US, he said, also continues to coordinate its approaches in the Indo-Pacific with the quadrilateral partners: India, Japan and Australia.

In November 2017, President Trump outlined a vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, a biogeographic region comprising the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean, the western and central Pacific Ocean.

Henick said there is some misconception that the US wants to exclude some nations from it.

The US has been pushing for a broader role by India in the strategically important Indo-Pacific region.

India, the US and several other world powers have been talking about the need to ensure a free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of China's rising military maneuvering in the region.

""We encourage and welcome all countries in the region to commit to and act in accordance with the principles"" that the Indo-Pacific vision is based on and be a part of it.

Walter Douglas, a Deputy Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, when asked whether America's strategy wants to exclude China, said the US' Indo-Pacific strategy excludes no nation.

He said that although the approach to the Indo-Pacific has been called a strategy, ""it is really a vision for how we see the region going forward"".

""It is a restatement and upgrading, and the inclusion of India in this wider vision"" because it can bring prosperity to the region,"" he added.

Douglas said that America''s ""vision"" of the Indo-Pacific extends from the west coast of India to the west coast of the US from Mongolia down to the bottom of New Zealand.

Defending the renaming of Indo-Pacific, he said: ""Geographically it's pretty easy. It's basically the west coast of India to, say, the west coast of the United States, from Mongolia down to the bottom of New Zealand. So that area is what is geographically part - we consider the Indo-Pacific"".

""It's really a vision for how we see the region going forward in talking about free and open Indo-Pacific and talking about the - all these - the private sector-led development, all of that sort of thing. So it excludes no nation.

""We think every nation should be part of it. These are universal values that we're speaking about, and we think they are values that historically, especially let's say in the last 50, 60, 75 years, have brought a lot of prosperity to the region. So it's, in a sense, a restatement and upgrading, an inclusion of India in this wider vision, because we see the economies and the interests being connected much more. But it excludes no nation in that region,"" Douglas added.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us--india-cooperation-in-indo-pacific-based-on-shared-commitment-to-uphold-rule-of-law--state-dept-2020-02-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/us--india-cooperation-in-indo-pacific-based-on-shared-commitment-to-uphold-rule-of-law--state-dept.html

The actor will soon be seen playing the powerful and sinister antagonist Roman Sionis aka Black Mask in upcoming film ""Birds of Prey"".

In the DC Comics adaptation, Margot Robbie will be back as Harley Quinn along with her gang Mary Elizabeth Winstead's huntress, Jurnee Smollett-Bell's Black Canary, and Rosie Perez's detective Renee Montoya.

""I wanted to work with Margot, and then I saw Cathy Yan's movie 'Dead Pigs' and really liked it. It reminded me of 'Trainspotting' - something new and interesting, so I was excited to work with her as well. But mainly, I just liked the script. The dialogue was clever and very well-written, and I was happy to play the chief villain who's all about control and power and thinks he's so clever and wonderful. But of course, he's a horrible, despicable person,"" McGregor said.

McGregor feels ""it's important for an actor to understand the character"".

""You can't play the 'bad guy' or the 'good guy,' you have to play the person and know what makes him tick. In Roman's case, he is an absolute narcissist, which makes him think he can charm anyone, and he has rage issues that come into play, so he loses his temper all over the place.

233,01-2-20,Our Meena chatbot better than others: Google,"Google has claimed that its new chatbot, called Meena, can chat just about anything and is better than other similar conversational agents.

In a paper published on pre-print repository arXiv.org, Google scientists showed that Meena can conduct conversations that are more sensible and specific than existing state-of-the-art chatbots.

To put Meena, an end-to-end trained neural conversational model, to test, the scientists used a new human evaluation metric for open-domain chatbots, called Sensibleness and Specificity Average (SSA), which captures basic, but important attributes for human conversation.

""Remarkably, we demonstrate that perplexity, an automatic metric that is readily available to any neural conversational models, highly correlates with SSA,"" study authors Daniel Adiwardana, Senior Research Engineer, and Thang Luong, Senior Research Scientist, Google Research, Brain Team, said in a blog post this week.

Modern chatbots tend to be highly specialised -- they perform well as long as users do not stray too far from their expected usage.

To better handle a wide variety of conversational topics, open-domain dialogue research explores a complementary approach attempting to develop a chatbot that is not specialized but can still chat about virtually anything a user wants.

Besides being a fascinating research problem, such a conversational agent could lead to many interesting applications, such as further humanising computer interactions, improving foreign language practice, and making relatable interactive movie and videogame characters.

However, current open-domain chatbots have a critical flaw -- they often don't make sense. They sometimes say things that are inconsistent with what has been said so far, or lack common sense and basic knowledge about the world.

Moreover, chatbots often give responses that are not specific to the current context.

For example, ""I don't know,"" is a sensible response to any question, but it's not specific. Current chatbots do this much more often than people because it covers many possible user inputs.

Meena, on the other hand, learns to respond sensibly to a given conversational context, according to the paper titled ""Towards a Human-like Open-Domain Chatbot"".

""The training objective is to minimise perplexity, the uncertainty of predicting the next token (in this case, the next word in a conversation),"" Adiwardana and Luong said in the blog post.

""At its heart lies the Evolved Transformer seq2seq architecture, a Transformer architecture discovered by evolutionary neural architecture search to improve perplexity,"" they added.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/our-meena-chatbot-better-than-others--google-2020-02-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/our-meena-chatbot-better-than-others--google.html

A new report by MyDrivers claims the iPhone SE successor is already going through trial production.

""Apple has finally started trial production of the highly anticipated iPhone 9. This process will be used to iron out any issues and ensure assembly lines are running smoothly,"" PhoneArena reported quoting MyDrivers on Friday.

This comes at a time when smartphone companies like Samsung, Huawei and OnePlus are bringing out big and gorgeous display phones.

It is pertinent to note that some Apple loyalists still prefer a device as the size of the immensely popular iPhone 5S and iPhone SE and perhaps that's why the Cupertino-headquartered giant decided to bring a small-screen device in 2020.

If everything goes to plan and there are no major problems, Apple should start full mass production in mid-February.

235,01-2-20,Invincible India eye rare 5-0 whitewash in final T20I,"Invincible so far, India will eye a rare 5-0 whitewash against a bruised and battered New Zealand in the final T20 International here on Sunday.

New Zealand have never lost all games in a bilateral T20I series (three or more matches) at home.

Since 2005, they have only once lost all games in a bilateral T20I series at home, going down 2-0 to England back in February 2008.

While this puts India in a unique position going ahead, they will still stay fifth in the ICC T20I rankings behind Pakistan, Australia, England and South Africa.

India will have their mind set elsewhere though, pertinently the experimentation cycle ahead of the T20 World Cup in Australia. The fourth T20I was a step in that direction, but it mostly came to nought with the likes of Sanju Samson and Shivam Dube wasting their opportunities.

Samson has been promoted up the order in his limited opportunities against both Sri Lanka and New Zealand, and has been dismissed while attacking the bowling.

The team management would want him to show more patience, while backing him to come good once again. Meanwhile, Dube has lacked footwork against both spinners and pacers.

Elsewhere, with Manish Pandey firming up the number six spot, Shreyas Iyer could be promoted to number three. The bigger question is about the keeper-batsman spot.

Ever since the Australia series at home, K L Rahul has played with an increased workload in that role. Pre-series, skipper Virat Kohli had more or less confirmed that Rahul would continue to keep in the ensuing three-ODI series. While he has been in great form, the team management could afford to rest him and bring in Rishabh Pant.

There is incentive to do so, for this fifth and final game of this series is the last T20I India will play in the current 2019-2020 season. In the shortest format, there is only the Indian Premier League to look forward to in two months' time, and the next T20I series – against Sri Lanka later in the summer – is quite far away.

Pant, meanwhile, has been benched since suffering concussion in the first ODI against Australia in Mumbai. While he has fully recovered, his spot in the first-choice playing eleven is long gone. In fact, his status in the current scheme of things is far worse.

At the Westpac Stadium, Rohit Sharma was rested to create an additional space in the batting line-up. Logic dictates that Kohli will take Sunday off and Rohit could lead instead, thus continuing with the one additional batting spot.

In the bowling department, Jasprit Bumrah could be rested with Mohammed Shami coming back to maintain the three-pacer theory.

Meanwhile, Kane Williamson is expected to be fit for the clash, after he missed out in Wellington due to a left shoulder niggle. The Black Caps' team management were confident of his recovery even on Friday.

The hosts will have greater concern over their lack of finishing though, after squandering two last over winning positions in two consecutive games, and the series along with.
