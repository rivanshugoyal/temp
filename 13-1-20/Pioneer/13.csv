0,13-1-20,Wake up before it is too late,"All political parties must unite to aid the Government’s initiatives to foster efficient water management in the country

Water is the most important resource for sustaining life on Earth. The happiness and development index of any civilised society depends upon access to safe drinking water. India lies in the tropical region with plenty of rainfall, though it is more in the North and the North-East and comparatively less in the West and South. The Himalayan glaciers complement the precipitation and provide year-long supply of water to our rivers, rivulets and recharge aquifers. Forest catchments also play an important role in maintaining the flow in rain-fed rivers, recharging aquifers and subsurface drinking water. India receives around 4,000 billion cubic metres (bcm) of rainfall annually from June to September, which is equivalent to four per cent of the world’s water resources. The renewable water resource in India is 1,897 sq km per annum. The World Health Organisation (WHO) prescribes 25 litres of water for one person a day to meet all basic hygiene and food needs. If rain and river water is managed thoughtfully, there should be sufficient water for agriculture, drinking, industrial and energy use. We have 12 major rivers catering to 253 million ha of catchment with another 47 rivers catering for other catchments. The Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna river system is the largest in India with 43 per cent of the catchment area of all the major river systems.

According to the Central Water Commission, India needs a maximum of 3,000 bcm of water a year while it receives 4,000 bcm of rain. However, due to poor planning, natural causes like climate change and the negligent attitude of the people, India is in the grip of severe water scarcity. As per the Niti Aayog’s composite water management index, 75 per cent of households do not have drinking water on the premises and 84 per cent rural households do not have piped water access. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research says the per capita annual water availability declined to 1,508 cubic metres in 2014 from 5,177 cubic metres in 1951. It is estimated to fall further to 1,465 by 2025 and 1,235 cubic metres by 2050. We will become a water stressed nation if it goes down to 1,000-1,100 cubic metres. Already cities like Delhi, Gurugram, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad are badly affected and facing severe water famine during the summers.

The biggest reasons for water stress are overexploitation of groundwater and over 89 per cent of it is used for agriculture. It is estimated that around 50 per cent of urban water requirement and 85 per cent of rural domestic water needs are fulfilled by groundwater. India captures only eight per cent of its annual rainfall and the local catchment areas like ponds and lakes have been lost due to demands for land. We therefore, need serious introspection and prevent wastage of water and learn from Israel which recycles and manages its water efficiently.

Thankfully, the Government integrated the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation and Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation and created the Jal Shakti Ministry, which has already taken several actions like the cleaning of Ganga in Kanpur, Varanasi and Haridwar. Under the Jal Jeevan Mission the Prime Minister on December 25, 2019 launched the Atal Jal Yojana to help improve the groundwater level in 8,300 villages in 78 districts of Maharashtra, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka. The farmers of these States and elsewhere, will have to rethink the use of water-intensive crops and irrigation methods. The National Rainfed Area Authority had recommended to the Cabinet Secretary to transfer rice cultivation in eastern States and converge water conservation, forests and rural development schemes in other States.

To provide safe drinking water to rural areas the Union Cabinet had also approved the Jal Jeevan Mission to provide Functional Household Tap Connection to every rural household by 2024. It is going to be one of the best Government decisions if implemented successfully, as out of the 17.87 crore rural households about 14.6 crore (which accounts for 81.67 per cent) are yet to get water tap connections. The scheme aims at providing assured 55 litre of potable water per capita per day. It envisages that each village will prepare an action plan comprising components of water source and its maintenance, water supply and management of water used for washing dishes, clothes and bathing. The total project cost is estimated to be `3.60 lakh crore. The Government had finalised the guidelines of the scheme and kept the provision of a third-party inspection before making payment, which is an innovation in Government functioning, as it will involve organisations and institutions outside the bureaucracy for efficacy. Yet another innovative thinking is changes in drinking water supply services that will have a utility-based approach and concept of service delivery. This will enable them to function as utilities focussing on services and recover water use fee. This initiative will be successful, provided people are made stakeholders, there is proper monitoring and experts are involved. It will help in initiating efficient water management and all political parties must unite for its success, as Earth is the only known planet that has water for sustaining life.

1,13-1-20,Why do some South Asians eulogise Nazis?,"It’s odd to hear praise for Hitler coming from folk who, too, would have been sent to the gas chambers in Auschwitz

Often one comes across a statement made by a Pakistani or an Indian politician, praising the former German Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler, whose regime was responsible for the systematic state-sanctioned murder of millions of people considered to be of the “inferior race.” So it is odd to hear praise for him coming from folk who, too, would have been sent to the gas chambers in Auschwitz along with men, women and children of the so-called “non-Aryan races.” The phenomenon of some South Asians romanticising Hitler could be the result of the region’s recent shift to the populist Right, along with various other regions of the world. But there are many other possibilities. The idealisation of Hitler among some sections in India and Pakistan could also be due to the residual impact of a clever propaganda campaign that the Nazis unleashed upon certain segments of India’s Hindu and Muslim polities in the 1930s. This fact has been largely forgotten by mainstream history. However, even a brief recap of this can aid in better understanding the ironic spectacle of a “brown” Muslim or a Hindu fawning over a mass murderer, who would have thrown them in one of his many death camps at the drop of a hat.

In his essay for the May/June 2000 issue of the academic journal, Social Scientist, Eugene D’Souza writes that Nazi German propaganda made its way into India when mainstream Hindu and Muslim leadership in the region had become disoriented after the gradual collapse of two major anti-British movements in the 1920s: The Khilafat Movement and the Non-cooperation Movement.

D’Souza writes this is when German business interests in the region were first activated by Nazi Germany to contact the more radical elements within the Hindu and Muslim political, social and media outlets. The campaign in this regard began from Bengal, where “communal” and “revolutionary” anti-British sentiment was the strongest. To Nazi Germany, the British were enemies, even before the start of World War II.

Nazi agents preyed on the fears of Bengal’s landed and business elite, telling them that their lands and businesses were under threat due to the “socialist” bent of the Indian National Congress (INC). Hitler’s notorious biography, Mein Kampf, was then translated into various languages of India — including Hindi, Urdu and Bengali. These translations were distributed free of cost, especially among the editors and staff of various Hindi and Urdu newspapers.

D’Souza writes that Nazi agents then began to infiltrate various Muslim and Hindu social and cultural organisations. The September 8, 1939 issue of the English daily The Times of India quoted Jewish and socialist refugees from Germany in India as saying that Indian employees working in German companies were being used to spy on the refugees.

Nazi Germany also sent agents to India disguised as technicians, tourists, salesmen, musicians and photographers. According to D’Souza, German businesses would frequently give advertisements to Indian newspapers that were willing to facilitate Nazi propaganda.

Even though the main intention of Nazi Germany was to ferment unrest in India against the British colonialists, its plans in this context never looked to unite the anti-British Hindu and Muslim segments. Maybe the Germans had noted the volatility of such a move. Hindus and Muslims had collaborated with each other against the British during the Khilafat and Non-cooperation movements; but both the movements had eventually mutated into becoming communal, giving the British the space to crush them.

Instead, and as noted in the files kept by the British colonial government’s Home Department (file No. 8301, 1939), Nazi agents in India applied a two-pronged strategy in which they approached radical Hindu and Muslim leaderships with entirely separate sets of rhetoric.

For example, when the agents managed to get a foothold in newspapers funded and run by the Hindu nationalist organisation, the Hindu Mahasabha, they constantly informed the Mahasabha that Hitler considered the Hindus of India as the real custodians of the Indian nation, while the Muslims and other non-Hindu communities in the region were “aliens” just like the Jews were in Germany.

It is thus not surprising to note similar sentiments in the works of the period’s celebrated Hindu nationalists such as VD Savarkar and MS Golwalker. Both weren’t very secretive about their admiration of Nazi Germany either. However, during their interactions with radical Muslim groups, the Nazi agents completely flipped their message. The agents glorified the “martial tendencies” of the Muslims and claimed to be major supporters of their religious and territorial interests, especially in the Middle East.

According to the Home Department’s files, Nazi Germany funded various established and small newspapers as long they continued to publish pro-Germany articles and propaganda. Hindi newspapers in this circle would carry anti-Muslim, anti-Jew and anti-British articles; whereas the Muslim-owned Urdu papers, that received advertisements and funds from German companies, would produce anti-Hindu, anti-Jew and anti-British material.

According to the Home Department’s files dated October 18, 1939, the German wife of a Muslim professor at the famous Aligarh University received funds from her home country to publish a daily called Spirit of the Times through which she tried to prove that “Nazi ideals approximate to the tenets of Islam.”

In his detailed study of India’s pre-Partition Muslim and Hindu middle-class milieu, German historian Marcus Daechsel, in his book The Politics of Self-Expression, writes that middle-class political culture in inter-war India was haunted by fascistic resonances. Activists from various political camps believed in Social-Darwinism, worshipped violence and war and focussed their political action on public spectacles and paramilitary organisations. Marcus identifies various Muslim and Hindu personalities and organisations which did this. And, as D’Souza demonstrates, almost each one of them was shaped, influenced and at times, funded by Nazi propaganda in India between 1933-1940.

D’Souza laments that the origin of Nazi propaganda still echoes in India, especially in the politics and rhetoric of Hindu nationalists. In Pakistan, these rudiments largely emerge during discourses involving talk of Israel and the idea of nationalism held by certain radical Right-wing elements.

The fascinating thing is, in both cases, the language is almost the same as it was in the 1930s. The narrative, its tone and language are quite similar.

According to Marcus, despite their enthusiasm for Nazi Germany and Hitler, most radical Hindu and Muslim ideologues never fully comprehended the Nazi ideology. That’s why they largely sound contradictory. And since the narrative, imagery and language in this context has not changed much since the 1930s, the same is the case today when a Hindu or Muslim politician glorifies Hitler. The results are always ironic.

2,13-1-20,Govt set to revive State’s culture,"Apart from being the heart of the country, Madhya Pradesh is also rich in various regional and traditional culture, art and archaeology. This invaluable identity of the State was in the blind run for development during last few years. The Kamal Nath Government, in its initial one year, has made several efforts to re-establish this identity as well as to conserve and protect it.

The new Government revived the tradition of awards and honours in the field of literature, painting, theatre, etc. which was stalled for the past several years. Awards for Urdu literature, along with Hindi, were also established during this period. People of various fields were conferred with the Rajya Shikhar Samman. It was also decided to organise Lata Mangeshkar Alankaran Samaroha with full grandeur. On the occasion of State Foundation Day, a glorious cultural programme was organised at Bhopal and district headquarters.

The State Government has also remembered and paid respects to the great men who were instrumental in building the new India. The 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, is being celebrated throughout the year. During this period, creative activities are being undertaken at every level to apprise the society, especially the younger generation of Gandhiji’s personality and work. Similarly, the 130th birth anniversary of Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of the country, is also being celebrated throughout the year. Messages of these great men were spread from village to village, door to door. This instilled a sense of patriotism in the society. The younger generation was given new thinking and new direction.

The entire ancient heritage of the state was preserved in museums. Honours were awarded for outstanding work in the field of archaeology. The process of felicitating archaeologists for their contribution in this area was completed.

A plan was prepared for documenting and preserving the painted rock formations of primitive man. The ancient temples in Khandwa, Shahdol and Sehore districts were beautified by cleaning them with scientific method.

Many ancient monuments have been transformed by maintenance works. 18 major monuments were upgraded in the State.

About 3 lakh documents of significance from historical point of view were digitalised.

Students, researchers and the general public were connected with creative activities on the occasion of World Heritage Day April 18, World Museum Day May 18, Independence Day August 15, Gandhi Jayanti on 2 October and World Heritage Week 19 to 25 November through painting competitions, exhibition, workshop, lectures, musical programmes and various publications.

Efforts were also started to preserve regional culture in Madhya Pradesh.

5,13-1-20,Fundamental nationalism need of hour,"Technology has been a single largest factor in mobilisation of anti-India vandalisation in Kashmir and it is nothing but a remarkable feat to achieve current peace. No wonder it is worrying anti-nationals. It is same when it comes to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC)

One nation, one flag and one Constitution has been the adage for the longest time post-independence. Without any doubt, the Modi government has taken the belief of One Nation-One Constitution to a new high. There were several clauses added to the Constitution after independence that were intended to create a stronger, better and elevated India.

Article370 was disputed from the beginning amidst all these clauses. Today, after the abrogation of Article 370, implementation of CAA and planned NRC is a celebration and also a political moot point. When you see books replaced with stones and sweat with blood, you know something is really not well with Indian youth.

It should matter to the rest of us because India is the youngest nation in the world with about 72 per cent of our population under the age of 32. ‘Free Kashmir’ posters made a debut in Mumbai last week and my hard earned money - your hard earned money is already being burnt down and vandalised in Delhi and West Bengal in the name of Kashmir, CAA and NRC by the same youth that runs the biggest back office of the world.

Article 370 has been a peculiar irony for Jammu and Kashmir. On the one hand, it had given the najority community there power and aggression while on the other, it blocked the development of areas like Jammu, Poonch, Rajouri, Kishtwar and Ladakh for decades. These regions will now benefit from progressive all-inclusive schemes of the Centre after a long hiatus of 70 years.

Yes this has been a difficult time for people of the region in absence of telephone and internet. Yes, life in the past was challenging and may continue to be so for some more time but do we understand why these restrictions are much needed? Peace and prosperity is not a candy you can buy at a departmental store. Likewise was independence that came at humbling invaluable sacrifices of our forefathers. Let me say this to the youth– go back to the schools and colleges, read the right books, educate yourselves beyond propaganda and save yourselves from becoming political fodder.

Dissent is the very base of democracy – but that is dissent and not destruction. Kashmir is where the art of State sponsored Islamic terror was mastered and unleashed right under the nose of the great Indian democracy. Kashmir has had a history of Islamic terror right from the turn of 11th century that transformed the Hindu dominance into a minuscule minority.

Dal Lake is the largest graveyard of Hindus in the world where men, women and children were massacred daily by the then Afghan governor in the brutal ‘game’ of Votalbuj and dumped in the lake. The Afghan diktats to aid conversion of Hindus in Kashmir are unparalleled in the world. The diktats ranging included forbidding Hindus from even crying on death in family while celebrating religious festivals, worshiping, owning modes of transportation, jewellery, decorative cloths and even wearing shoes was forbidden. Eventually, 1931 onward and upto 1956 was the time that modern Kashmir witnessed widespread persecution of minorities and exodus. Then, 1956 onwards saw the emergence of the goriest chapter in recent history that allowed the transformation of Islamic terror into state sponsored ethnic cleansing specifically directed at minorities. After the Kashmir Conspiracy case that saw Shaikh Mohammed Abdullah and his colleagues behind bars, four tools of ethnic cleansing were formalised.

These were spearheaded by Land Reforms Act and J&K State Competent Authority. Land Reforms Act was the state sponsored land grab of minorities without any compensation and the land transferred to the majority community. J&K State Competent Authority was introduced to deny admission to minorities (in J&K) in professional institutions; the entire procedure was non-merit and interview based.

The cleansing strategy was clear – take their properties, deny them education and employment thus fueling migration. It was only during late 80s that the perpetrators realised that minorities were still not leaving that they unleased the fourth and final assault through armed terrorism ironically by Afghan terrorists. Hindu opinion leaders and Sikhs were brutally murdered in cold blood and their bodies lay in the open for days in compliance of the orders of terrorist organisations to further fear psychosis.

This eventually led to the days of January 1990 when thousands of majority community members resorted to anti-India and anti-Hindu protests, arson, stone pelting and eventually the birth of world’s first generation of “Kashmiri Hindus – the refugees in their own country”. Ever since, homes and temples have been desecrated and the former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti was brazenly reported as saying “Kashmir no longer has oxygen for aboriginals”.

Technology has been a single largest factor in mobilisation of anti-India vandalisation in Kashmir and it is nothing but a remarkable feat to achieve current peace. No wonder it is worrying anti-nationals. It is the same when it comes to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). It is all right for baby boomers to protest – most of them were objectively conditioned illiterates left over by the Britons but for the young, vibrant and educated youth of India to protest against CAA and NRC is utterly embarrasing especially when you take the Indian situation from a global perspective. Every country that prospers needs the support of fundamental nationalists.

Secularism in isolation is a widely misrepresented and an abused term and must be read with nationalism. Our earlier masters left India bereft of dignity and self-esteem to prosper and hence a part of Indian populace still finds everything wrong in what India stood for. They promote and practice denial of our own glory and the very reason we were continuously invaded and vandalised for 800 years. The anti – CAA and NRC protest is a reflection of the same ignorance. CAA will simply allow persecuted minorities from three of our theocratic neighbouring nations to return to their roots and strengthen a nationalist following.

The exclusion of Muslims has many reasons. Above all, Muslims don’t want to come to India, they want to go to Saudi Arabia, UAE, USA and Europe. Pakistanis don’t want to come to India – do they? They say India is their enemy number one – so who are you fighting for? Privacy and segmentation is an illusion. Look at USA. Despite being constitutionally secular the US Congress hosts National Prayer Breakfast, a Christian fellowship initiative where all the members of the US Congress eat and pray together in the name of Christ. Christ did not stop them from becoming the greatest country so why will Rama or Krishna stop the big Indian march? Did we not apply for Aadhaar cards, PAN cards, don’t we complete arduous paperwork

even for a harmless SIM card and passports? Does it come without identification? WWW interface, bank accounts, vehicles, Amazon, Flipkart and Netflix – which part of our daily life including Roti, Kapda and Makaan comes without documentation? Yes, no doubt a part of population, especially, in deep villages may not have paperwork but then have you read the NRC? Even a village Panch anywhere in India can vouch for antecedents. Yes, it should put Hindus to test also, if they don’t have paperwork but there is no reason they shouldn’t. Even a simple rent agreement is sufficient. In view of dilution of nationalism due to various other ‘isms’ – CAA makes an exceptionally strong case for India to have a larger role play in maintain peace, harmony and prosperity in the Asia region – but some seem to be too busy chanting freedom for terrorists to understand this. It’s my money, it’s our money that pays for the very institutions and properties you vandalise– to you I say, find another place if you don’t want to get back to the classrooms and contribute to making India great.

6,13-1-20,Minister inaugurates gas supply pipe line in Haridwar,"The gas supply pipeline installed in Uttarakhand with the assistance of the Government of India was inaugurated by the State’s Housing and Urban Development minister Madan Kaushik in Haridwar on the weekend. He lit a cooking stove at a home in Ambedkarnagar locality of Jwalapur to inaugurate the gas supply pipeline.

Speaking on the occasion, Kaushik said that this was an effective step towards achieving the vision of all-round development in the state. Stating that this ill bring about a positive change in the lives of the people, he said that due to the efforts of the state government and assistance from the Central Government, the nation’s second gas supply pipeline project was undertaken in the state to provide gas supply to the locals.

Kaushik further averred that within a year, cooking gas will be supplied directly to homes through pipe lines in about 70 per cent of the homes in the Haridwar area. Work on this project was being undertaken for the past two years and has now been completed.

The minister inaugurated the scheme by opening the first connection to Pramod, a resident of Ambedkarnagar in Jwalapur. Kaushik also said that before the elections, he had promised to facilitate supply of gas in the homes which has now been facilitated.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/minister-inaugurates-gas-supply-pipe-line-in-haridwar.html
7,13-1-20,Decade of the SUV,"No matter what the brand, the Sports Utility Vehicle has become the shape of choice for consumers and will continue to be so. How did that come about?

Recently, a fellow motoring journalist took to the social media and asked me and his peers about our thoughts on the Indian “car of the decade.” Making choices on the “Indian car of the year” is in itself a tough task. So, asking anyone, let alone someone who must have driven at least a few hundred different types of vehicles in the previous 10 years, his opinion as to which car he thinks stood out is even tougher. In any contest — from fashion pageants and movie awards to car choices — a bias towards more recent contenders cannot be ruled out. This is why a rash of Hollywood movies, starring top actors and directed by top directors, are released towards the end of the year so that they can be eligible for the “awards season.”

But unlike movies or even fashion pageants, choosing a car that defines the year is not easy because factors like affordability and market acceptance, too, come into play. The best of cars driven by this writer in 2019 were stupendous vehicles but cost the same as that of a small house. Ergo, the vehicle that won the “Indian Car of The Year” award was the Hyundai Venue, a compact Sports Utility Vehicle that the judges, including myself, chose. It has made technologies such as dual-clutch gearboxes and turbocharged small petrol engines affordable for large parts of the car market.

Of course, contenders are many if one were to look at the “car of the 2010s” rather than the the “car that defined” the 2010s in India. But what is surprising, rather what is not surprising, is that almost all vehicles that one can consider in the list are SUVs with possibly one or two exceptions. Think about it. The car that defined the decade, according to this writer, was Hyundai Creta. This, because in my opinion, the white Creta is now ubiquitous across every major Indian city. But others on the social media rightly pointed that Renault Duster, Ford EcoSport and Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza, too, are equal contenders.

All of them are SUVs and in the past 10 years, each one of them has made significant impact on the Indian automotive market. Surely, I would also like to consider Maruti Suzuki’s second generation Swift Dzire on the list of top cars of the decade. By powering the fleet of app-based taxi aggregators, it has become a symbol of changing mobility dynamics in the country. But as far as personal mobility goes, the past decade was all about SUVs.

What is not surprising, however, is that this is a global trend. Across the world, consumers have taken a shine to SUVs. So much so that even car-makers like Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Lamborghini and wait for it, even Italian super car-maker Ferrari, are now manufacturing SUVs. This because the market has spoken — a trend that began with large American pick-up trucks such as the Ford F150, which gradually became more luxurious moving away from its purely utilitarian role in the 1980s and 1990s. The flatbed part of those cars became more and more irrelevant. Covering that space made more sense in order to fit in more seats and covered luggage space. Technically, SUVs have been on the road for over a quarter of a century now. Some might remember the Tata Sierra of yore, India’s first SUV, which came onto the road in the mid-1990s. It wasn’t a sales success but it spawned the Tata Safari, which enjoyed a degree of success for about two decades. Then there was Mahindra Scorpio, which made its foray in 2001. People still doubt if Mahindra redefined the Indian utility vehicle market, particularly with Scorpio, both from the design and engineering aspect.

But in the 2000s, SUVs were an exception, not the rule. They were still expensive and heavy cars with lumbering engines. No matter how good an example of engineering Scorpio and Safari were, one could never describe them as “good cars” performance wise. The early-build models suffered from handling issues, considering the way the engine performed and even workmanship to a certain degree. The 2000s was the time for small cars in India. The silver WagonR stood out even in cities like Delhi, the Alto became a sales success like no other and Hyundai’s Santro and i10 both stole the show.

What changed in the 2010s were engineering and increased computerisation, not just during the design process but also on board. Changes started to become visible in luxury SUVs first. The first generation of Porsche Cayenne and BMW X3/X5 were not lumbering beasts and not anywhere close to handling like other cars from those companies. Today, when you take a modern Porsche Macan or a BMW X4 around a race track to evaluate them, you will be flabbergasted at the way they perform. Sure, the Porsche Panamera sedan or the BMW 5-series are both better around a track but that yawning gap between the performance of a sedan and an SUV is barely a whisper now.

And it is a direct result of a fundamental change. SUVs became lighter because of the way changes were incorporated. Earlier, utility vehicles of any sort were built with the car body on the frame of the car. The frame being the suspension, engine and transmission is what took the structural load. While this made the SUVs very rugged, it also made them difficult to manoeuver and killed handling.

Modern SUVs from the 2010s are monocoques, which is a way of manufacturing the vehicle where the body is its own structural component, an exoskeleton as such. This made SUVs much, much lighter and, thus, cheaper. It also opened the doors to cheap and cheerful small utility vehicles, which given that they shared platforms with sedans, ensured that they were better at handling.

To an extent, more computers and Traction Control systems onboard cars nowadays eliminated the performance degradation that usually comes with an SUV. One will be able to understand this through simple physics as SUVs sit higher and, thus, have a higher centre of gravity and are still slightly heavier.

Crucially, sharing the same construction technique and, thus, platforms as that of hatchbacks and sedans, made SUVs a lot cheaper and allowed the shape to be fitted onto smaller platforms. The EcoSport, Brezza and Venue are all SUVs that slot inside the four-metre length criterion for a lower duty rate in India. Because they have become lighter, they can use the same engines as other small cars. In addition, this change made SUVs cheaper to maintain, albeit less capable in the eyes of some. Similarly, this construction technique also makes vehicles safer in accidents, at least to other road users, both vehicular and pedestrian.

Of course, until recently, the body-on-frame construction model was the preferred way to go if one wanted an SUV to go off the road, really off the road simply because of the structural rigidity of the construction technique. But even that is being challenged by the monocoque today. The Jeep Compass Trailhawk may not have set the sales charts alight but as a monocoque, what it can do off-road is nothing short of extraordinary. This is something one may not have considered possibly a decade ago because the torsional (that is twisting) forces that a vehicle has to endure when it goes off the road would have in effect broken any such car just a few years ago.

If not literally broken, taking a monocoque in severe off-road trail conditions would have flexed the metal so much that it would have suffered from fatigue issues, similar to those that aircraft have to deal with after tens of thousands of flights. But guess what, the upcoming new Land Rover Defender, the last word in off-roading according to some, including the British Armed Forces, is a monocoque.

So the SUV, no matter which particular vehicle you consider, was the “car of the decade” in India. But is that a good thing? Sure, we can argue about the road conditions in our country, which despite a penchant for speed-breakers is far better than ever. At the same time, the revolution in SUVs has led to many more diesel cars being sold. As we now know, diesel isn’t as clean as it was hyped to be 10 years ago. While it emits lesser amount of carbon per kilometre, emissions of nitrous and sulphur oxide as well as particulate matter is far higher than of petrol. Also, considering cars on the same platform with the same engine and transmission — look at the Honda CR-V and Honda Civic— a sedan is always more economical to operate and cheaper to buy than an SUV.

It is particularly ironic, therefore, that the first electric cars with a reasonable amount of range to be launched in India are the Hyundai Kona and MG eZS, both, surprise surprise, SUVs. So while new construction methods made the SUV cheaper and better and, thus, the vehicle of choice in the 2010s, the impact of these cars on our psyche — maybe we like sitting at a height off the road, lording over the others — has meant that the SUV will most likely dominate the 2020s as well.

8,13-1-20,God of carnage,"Initial probe reports on JNU violence raise more questions than answers. There can’t be selective interpretation of facts

In the end, the Delhi Police was left to do the job as a purveyor of the official narrative, a tough one when the nation’s eyes are on the violence at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and its perpetrators. A tougher job when its no-show during the mayhem has raised questions on its institutional integrity and loyalty to its role ordained by the Constitution. That, too, at a time when there have been far too many eyewitnesses, live accounts and videos of an unruly mob beating up students in the campus that do not leave much of a doubt as to how events unfolded. It is, therefore, left with the onerous task of exonerating itself and the establishment of any maleficent design of crushing dissenting students. Hence its probe report reduces the enormity of the brutalisation of the campus as a feisty war of ideologies between the Left and Right student groups, their mutual provocation, which spun out of control and descended into chaos. In its books, both were to blame and both had smuggled in outsiders. And to please its political masters, it has focussed on the origin of the problem, in this case Left-inspired protests over fee hike, naming student union leaders more frequently than Rightist student leaders and groups, who have masqueraded themselves as marauders. This follows the familiar trope of making everybody look like a victim of circumstance, and, therefore, absolving everybody of responsibility. So a general picture has emerged of the Left-dominated students’ union protesting against fee hike and stopping the registration process to drive home their point through a confrontationist style of scuffles, gheraoing the server office and stalling operations. In the process, they came to blows with Right-wing students of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidya Parishad (ABVP), who have been tasked with the regime’s agenda of cleansing the Left ideology from the country’s campuses and ensuring a new cultural revolution. A day later, the other side allegedly went about teaching its own kind of lesson, a fact now corroborated by a TV expose and proud claims by fringe groups. Nobody condones any kind of violence, no matter what the colour, but selectively using evidence to colour a probe is just fogging out the truth. Assigning causality and not condemnation of the consequence is wrong. For guilt will remain in the realm of suspicion, not facts. It is a comment on our police system, which has now begun to mimic that of totalitarian regimes in history, where policing had an explicit political dimension and was directed against those perceived as threats.

The probe, which the Delhi Police says will be staggered as it still doesn’t have evidence, has raised more questions than answers. And, if indeed investigation is a long process, then the entire findings should have been revealed together rather than naming suspects for one episode while conveniently leaving out the other. Or be discriminatory against the students’ union because it is easier playing up stereotypes than exposing the new face of campus aggressors. There should also have been an explanation why the majority of those gravely injured belonged to the Left-backed unions, or why they would self-inflict woes upon themselves when they could have fought their issues full-bodied and healthy? Till we get these answers, every evidence swirling around gets dumped in a basket of conspiracy theories. And theory being theory cannot battle the heft of the official narrative, especially one that is propagandist and force-fed. But they certainly can keep the issue alive, a fact that suits all parties concerned, to be used and abused at will. Except in JNU, the night of the broken glass was seen by many people who need no convincing. Students and teachers were made to live in a house of horrors and beaten up, not because it is a battleground of competing ideologies just like any other campus but simply because it is a crucible of national conscience and has been fostering a culture of mindfulness, learning and dialogue. Simply because it nurtures thinking citizens who can question gullible ones and have the spine to stand up to what the State should not become. Simply because it seems disruptive in a faux stability of a deeply divided society, arising from domination by intimidation. Had this not been the case, the “I told you so” narrative of demonising the students’ union would not have been peddled with such fury and rapidity. Whether this crackdown will indeed end up scaring a generation, tire them out or strengthen their resolve to continue peacefully despite the odds remains to be seen. Because it is only students who can be uncompromising.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/god-of-carnage-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/god-of-carnage.html
9,13-1-20,Murder in the skies,"Iran’s confession that the Ukrainian plane was hit by mistake has de-escalated tension but it had to pay a heavy price

The irony of Iran shooting down a civilian airliner is not lost on anyone with a sense of history. Iran’s admission that it shot down an Ukrainian Boeing 737 in the middle of an escalating conflict with the US after the targetted assassination of Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani was foretold, thanks to the proliferation of footage and pictures on social media. Iran Air flight 655 was shot down mistakenly by the US missile cruiser USS Vincennes back in July 3, 1988, a time when US-Iranian tensions were escalating. While Iran seems to be more contrite than the US was when it shot down the aircraft, it seems almost impossible that after the Iran Air incident and the accidental downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17 by Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, precautions were not taken. Iran had already started its ballistic missile attack on US bases in Iraq, a few days after Soleimani’s death. Logically, if indeed it was expecting a retaliation from America, it should have shut down its airspace while the attack was going on. It is very easy in the “fog of war” for mistakes to happen and situational awareness to get lost, particularly by aggressive trigger-happy commanders or highly nervous operators of advanced air defence systems. The former clearly happened with the Iran Air and Malaysia Airlines flights, whereas the latter may have been the cause of the Indian Air Force shooting down its own helicopter in the aftermath of the Balakot strikes in February 2019. A mistake should not have happened. This was a regularly scheduled civilian flight and technology available today allows for easy tracking of such flights. Possibly the pilots were nervous and made a turn a few seconds too soon that triggered the shootdown. But that’s no excuse for the Iranians.

Iran must undertake a thorough investigation as to why this incident happened. At the same time, with rising conflicts across the world, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) needs to come up with clear rules with regard to airspace closure if there is even a slight possibility of conflict. Civilian aircraft should not be operating in conflict zones. The Ukrainian plane should never have been given permission to take off but Iran never closed its airspace as the country makes cold, hard cash from flying rights. However, for better or worse, this tragic incident has forced both Iran and the US to de-escalate the situation. But 176 innocent lives were too high a price to pay to prevent a conflict.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/murder-in-the-skies-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/murder-in-the-skies.html
10,13-1-20,Judiciary must stand firm,"The Supreme Court and High Courts were set up inter alia to act as guardians of the Constitution and protectors of the fundamental rights of the people

Thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting.” These words from the Holy Bible were used by Sir Winston Churchill in 1938 to criticise Neville Chamberlain, the then British Prime Minister, for signing the Munich Pact with Hitler. They can be used for the judiciary, too, for failing to protect the fundamental rights of Indians, its sacred and solemn duty under the Constitution.

The Indian Constitution, promulgated in 1950, had a part containing certain fundamental rights of the people. These fundamental rights incorporated the theory of the English political philosopher John Locke in his Second Treatise on Civil Government that every citizen had certain “natural” rights, which even the king could not violate. This theory was the basis of the Bill of Rights in the US Constitution, as well as the Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789 by the French National Assembly during the French Revolution. Under the Indian Constitution, these fundamental rights were rights which even the legislature or the executive could not legally violate.

But who was to ensure that they were not violated? This was the job of the judiciary, which was meant to be independent of the legislature or the executive. The Supreme Court (SC) and High Courts (HCs) were set up inter alia to act as guardians of the Constitution and protectors of the fundamental rights of the people. Their judges take an oath to uphold the Constitution.

Thus, in the State of Maharashtra vs Bhaurao Punjabrao Gawande, the SC observed that while the first objective of the founding fathers was to give to the people a Constitution whereby a government was established, their second object, equally important, was to protect the people against the government.

The court observed: “The imperative necessity to protect the people’s rights is a lesson taught by all history and all human experience. Our Constitution-makers had lived through bitter years of the freedom struggle and had seen an alien government trample upon human rights which the country had fought hard to preserve. They believed, like Jefferson, that ‘an elective despotism was not the government we fought for’. And therefore while arming the government with large powers to prevent anarchy from within and conquest from without, they took care to ensure that these powers were not abused to mutilate the liberties of the people.”

In one of its early decisions, State of Madras vs VG Row, the SC held, “As regards the fundamental rights the court has been assigned the role of a sentinel in the qui vive.” This expression (‘sentinel on the qui vive’) has been reiterated in several decisions of the court. For instance in the IR Coelho vs State of Tamil Nadu; Navtej Singh Johar vs Union of India; Shakti Vahini vs Union of India; C Ravichandran Iyer vs Justice AM Bhattacharjee; Padma vs Hiralal Motilal Desarda; Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab; Indra Sawhney vs Union of India and so on.

As held in the Navtej Singh Johar case, once violation of the fundamental rights of a citizen or a group of citizens is brought to the notice of the court, it cannot remain a mute spectator. As held in the Shakti Vahini case, when there is violation of fundamental rights, the court cannot choose the path of silence.

As observed by the SC in C Ravichandran Iyer vs Justice AM Bhattacharjee, “Under the Constitution, it is the judiciary which is entrusted with the task of keeping every organ of the state within the limits of the law. The judiciary must protect the citizen against violation of his constitutional or legal rights and it must stand between the citizen and the state as a bulwark against executive excesses and misuse or abuse of power by the executive.”

In the Shakti Vahini case, the court observed, “Once a fundamental right is inherent in a person, intolerant groups cannot scuttle the right by leaning on any kind of philosophy, or self-proclaimed elevation.”

This being the settled Constitutional position, we may now ask whether the SC of late has been doing its solemn duty of protecting the rights of the people? The impression which has been created by its recent verdicts, orders and actions/inactions is that it has, with some exceptions, largely surrendered before the political executive, instead of behaving like an independent organ of the state which it was expected to be.

Consider the following instances: The SC Collegium recommended Justice Kureshi of the Bombay HC to be appointed as Chief Justice (CJ) of the Madhya Pradesh HC. Instead of making the appointment, the Government sent the recommendation back to the Collegium. Thereafter, the Collegium should have reiterated its recommendation and then in view of the verdict in the judges case, the Government would have had to make the appointment. But instead, the Collegium recommended his transfer as the CJ of the much-smaller Tripura HC.

The SC Collegium had recommended the appointment of Gopal Subramaniam — an outstanding Senior Advocate of the SC who had also been a lawyer in the famous Sohrabuddin case, and a former Solicitor-General of India — as a judge of the SC. But the Government objected and instead of reiterating his name, the Collegium went with the decision.

In the case of the Bhima Koregaon accused and professor Saibaba, the SC should have quashed the prosecution using the Brandenburg test (relied upon in Arup Bhuyan vs State of Assam, and Sri Indra Das vs State of Assam cases) but it did not even consider the same.

Abhijit Iyer Mitra should have clearly been granted bail in view of the decision of the celebrated Justice Krishna Iyer in the State of Rajasthan vs Balchand. Bail not jail, is the normal rule, unless the accused is likely to abscond or tamper with the evidence, or was accused of a heinous crime. Abhijit had only made a satirical tweet, for which, too, he had promptly apologised. Yet his bail application was rejected, with a flippant and cruel remark by former CJI Gogoi that the best place for him was in jail.

Recently, masked hooligans beat up students and teachers in Jawaharlal Nehru University, with the police apparently complicit, and about 30 people were admitted to AIIMS, Delhi with serious injuries. The SC should have suo motu issued notice to the authorities concerned and taken the guilty to task, but it did not.

The UP Police beat up the anti- Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protesters and even entered some houses and beat up the inhabitants, including old people. They allegedly destroyed and looted property. Again, the SC took no notice, though this was widely reported in the media and videos went viral.

Within 72 hours of his reinstatement by the SC, the CBI Director Alok Verma was removed by a panel headed by the Prime Minister. The court should have reinstated him but did not do so.

Since 2014, there have been continuous attacks on Muslims, lynchings and hate speeches. A former Union Minister even garlanded some alleged lynchers. Instead of taking strong action against the killers, often the family members of the victim are harassed, for instance Ikhlaque’s family. Surely it is the duty of the judiciary to grant protection but it rarely does anything except utter homilies.

There is frequent and arbitrary use of sedition and preventive detention laws against those who criticise the Government. For instance, cartoonist Aseem Trivedi in Maharashtra, Ambikesh Mahapatra of Jadavpur University in West Bengal, folk singer Kovan in Tamil Nadu, and Kashmiri politicians like Farooq Abdullah and others under detention, which make the right to liberty in Article 21, illusory. Unfortunately, the apex court nowadays rarely interferes in this gross violation of this most precious of all rights, although in one of its very first decisions — in the Romesh Thapar vs State of Madras case that the court delivered in 1950 — only a few months after the Constitution came into force, it had held that in a democracy people had the right to criticise the Government.

The most important case in India today is not the Ayodhya appeal but the trial of the SC itself. We are afraid the people’s faith is likely to go against the court unless it quickly recovers and resumes its role of guardian of the liberties and rights of the people.

At a gathering held here on Sunday, the UKS leader said that the Central Government had declared monkeys as vermin in Himachal Pradesh, allowing the culling of monkeys there. The same should be applied in Uttarakhand for monkeys and wild boars which damage or destroy the crops and property of farmers.

Further, the UKS leaders demanded that farmers should be compensated as per the market value for the damage to crops and domestic animals killed by the wild animals. The farmers should be provided with free insurance for their crops too.

Moreover, the UKS also demanded that the government should lift the restrictions over the cattle trade as it has drastically affected those who earn their living by dairy farming, meat selling and leather industry.

The issue of animals destroying the harvest of farmers and monkeys making the life of people harder in the region was also raised in the last board meeting of Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD).

The Dehradun mayor Sunil Uniyal ‘Gama’ had responded by stating that a cattle shelter is nearly ready and the stray cattle will be shifted there soon, recalled the UKS leaders.

13,13-1-20,‘Odisha power reforms model for States’,"Union Minister for Power and New and Renewable Energy Raj Kumar Singh has lauded the role of Odisha for it being a leader in electricity reform in the country and the current phase of reform is an example all other States should follow.

While complimenting the Odisha Government, he desired that loss reduction and improvement in customer satisfaction through professional management should be brought about through private sector involvement in all other States

A two-day Review, Planning & Monitoring (RPM) meeting was held by the Ministry of Power, Government of India in New Delhi during January 9-10. While the State of Uttar Pradesh made a presentation on smart meter roll out, Odisha was asked to make a presentation on DISCOM reforms done by the State.

Principal Secretary Energy, Odisha,Bishnupada Sethi briefed the gathering how the State of Odisha had taken a lead in the country in undertaking power sector reform with the enactment of the Odisha Electricity Reform Act, 1995.

As a pioneer in the distribution sector reform from first unbundling to first privatization, Odisha had led the way in the reform nearly a decade before the enactment of Electricity Act, 2003.

From unbundling of OSEB into OHPC and GRIDCO (T&D) to corporatization of distribution segment and privatization of four DISCOMs in the year 1999 was the first phase of privatization.

After enactment of the Electricity Act 2003, Odisha again is the front runner in distribution sector reforms with the first sale of a utility under section 20 of the Act.

Sethi stated that the current reform in distribution sector by following a well designed framework was going to address the concerns of all stakeholders to create a win- win situation for all.

While the consumer will benefit on account of certainty of tariff due to rapid AT and C loss reduction, improved customer service, improved quality of power, reliable 24x7 power supply, the employees will benefit due to increased focus on capacity building, better growth opportunities and assurance on terminal liabilities.

Increased private sector investment will reduce the strain on Government budgetary resources giving the flexibility to spend the resources on much needed social sector. Higher efficiency and professional management will provide dividends to the Government agencies, private investors and the electricity sector.

Sethi explained in detail about the transparent and balanced transaction framework followed by the Regulatory Commission with pre- defined target, incentives and penalty clauses. Discussion was held on the bid specific parameters like baseline setting, regulatory certainty, gain retention, capex commitment, Government support, performance monitoring and freedom from past liabilities for the private investor.

The meeting covered many topics like new reform linked distribution scheme, smart metering implementation models, multiple franchise models, power market design, rationalization of ISTS transmission charges, RoW and forest clearances etc. Various schemes like IPDS, DDUGJY, metering of feeders and distribution transformers, PAT, schemes on solar and other renewable energy were reviewed by the Minister.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---odisha-power-reforms-model-for-states---.html

While the banker, a DGM of a private bank, was arrested on the charge of raping the college Lecturer after inebriating her, the woman and her three associates were apprehended for kidnapping, cheating and robbery.

Notably, the banker and the teacher had come to know each other on the dating platform on January 2 and exchanged mobile phone numbers on the very day. Later, both filed complaints against each other with the Chandrasekharpur police on January 10.

“After exchanging contact numbers on Tinder on January 2, we decided to meet next day. She came to my room, we consumed liquor and had some intimate moments. We clicked photos and made videos of our intimate moments on my mobile phone with mutual consent. Later on January 8, she called me and requested me to take her to a hospital saying that she was undergoing severe headache,” the bank official said.

“While I was taking her to the hospital on my motorcycle, her two associates intercepted the vehicle, thrashed me and forcibly dragged me to a house, where I was held captive for a day. They took away money and debit,credit cards from my possession, and also demanded Rs 5 lakh,” he added.

On the other hand, the Lecturer accused the banker of “harassing” her besides taking her photos and recording her videos without her “consent” while she was “unconscious”. “I had sought help of a person for deleting the photos and videos from his mobile phone,” she said and refuted the abduction allegation levelled against her by him.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---tinder----dating-app--5-including-banker--woman-lecturer-held.html

18,13-1-20,‘Financial inclusion key to poverty alleviation’,"Financial inclusion is a key to poverty alleviation, but it can’t be achieved without an appropriate policy and result-oriented partnership between the Government, industry, civil society and financial institutions.

Experts argued at a seminar held on the subject by the Centre for Policy, Governance and Advocacy (CPGA) at the CYSD Convention Centre here. Chairman Tejeswar Parida welcomed the guest and introduced the theme to the participants.

Former Finance Minister Prafulla Ghadai spoke on “Poverty-free India and Odisha”. He expressed concern that financial literacy is not reaching to everyone and many are excluded in accessing financial support.

Citing slum dwellers’ plights, Ghadai advocated change of mindset of policy makers, bureaucrats, bankers and common people towards a more compassionate approach to the less privileged.

Former Chief Secretary Dr Jugal Kishore Mohapatra stressed that financial inclusion is pre-requisite to achieve livelihood security in the rural areas. To achieve higher financial inclusion, he advised to bring innovation at three levels; customised products, institutions and the enabling system.

Former Tripura Chief Secretary Dr Sanjay Kumar Panda argued that financial inclusion is key to achieve economic justice which is an objective enshrined in the Preamble of the Constitution. He highlighted three essential requirements for better financial inclusion which are positive mindset, a multidisciplinary team and appropriate use of technology.

Senior journalist Nageswar Patnaik expressed his concern on declining of number of bank branches in rural India from 3,948 in 2018 from 8,948 in 2015. He also added that nearly half of the bank accounts opened in India were not in operation during the last financial year as against 25 per cent at the global level.

Canara Bank CMD Rajendra Kumar Swain shared the timeline of the poverty alleviation initiatives to provide a historical background of the initiatives of financial inclusion.

Nabard GM AP Das outlined a broad strategy for financial inclusion including universal access, sector specific targets, market development, differentiated players, financial literacy, consumer awareness, protection, regulation and expansion of outreach.

He always envisioned for youth to stay away from orthodox ways and to polish their talents and qualities, so that they may establish social harmony and become aware of their social obligations. His call to ‘Arise, Awake and Stop Not Until the Goal is Achieved’ inspires youth to dedicatedly pursue and achieve their goals. I am glad to say that many generations made this call of Swami Vivekananda their life’s motto. To motivate our new generation to make this vision of Swami Vivekananda come true, we have organized Youth Fest. This mega event started from October 15, 2019 at block-level. Competitions in 25 different categories were organized. And now, state-level Youth Fest will be organized from January 12-14, 2020. This three-day youth fest will mark colourful presentation of Chhattisgarh’s culture, youth power and young talents. I believe that events like this are platforms of cultural exchange and opportunity for youth to widen their horizon’’.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/baghel-claims-he-would-succeed-changing-chhattisgarh---s-face.html

Why such a huge fund was sent to the private bank after drawing from nationalised banks and what prompted the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA) to do so have come in for public scrutiny.

The money which was earlier in several banks with lower rate of interest was deposited in the Yes Bank in March, 2019 for one year term deposit. The deposit was going to mature in March 2020 when the SJTA would receive huge money towards interest.

Sources also said that the SJTA took such a decision following a guideline of State Government in 2018-19 fiscal which had sent a list of bankers for transactions.

The matter came up in last managing committee when one member raised a question on the issue.

35,13-1-20,Benefit of paper-free railway e-tickets use,"Sir,

It is given to understand that many passengers still rely on e-ticket printouts on physical paper and carry the same along with them while traveling. The facility to print e-tickets on a paper is still optionally-enabled apart from the facility of SMS/ e-mail confirmations sent to the passengers. Thus, it is high time to put a complete stop on physical printing of e-tickets only for those users registered on IRCTC web portal/ mobile application.

The Indian Railways has made a robust shift to digital transactions through e-ticket booking facility. A passenger has the flexibility to book rail tickets at ease through a website and mobile app. The e-ticket is delivered through SMS/ e-mail and acts as a valid authority with necessary ID proof while travelling. The Railways should otherwise incentivise passengers to carry only SMS/ e-mail-based e-ticket confirmations along with valid ID proof instead of an ill-conceived idea yet of printing physical e-tickets on a paper. The suggestion will help the Railways reduce carbon footprint by encouraging passengers to go paper-free extensively while travelling on reserved tickets. The Railways will otherwise inch closer to achieve its sustainable goals by encouraging passengers to use paper-free e-tickets completely. The Railways will stand to gain immensely through such a major step aimed towards conservation of environment and, thus, save trees.

“The NINL purchases minerals at market price whereas private companies get iron ore at much lower rates. Despite this, the NINL had been incurring profit. As it made a loss of Rs 200 crore once, the Union Government has decided to privatise it by withdrawing 49% stake held by the MMTC. The Naveen Patnaik Government has also welcomed the decision and proposed to withdraw its OMC stake of 29 per cent from the NINL. It is a conspiracy hatched by both the Governments to handover the PSU to a private company,” alleged Jena.

Slamming Union Steel Minister Dharmendra Pradhan for terming the NINL disinvestment as “historic”, Jena wanted to know why a year back he had announced to provide Rs 500 crore for revival of the NINL.

He criticised the Centre for delaying environmental clearance for a captive mine allocated to the NINL in 2013. Jena said the NINL would make huge quantities of profit if it gets Government support.

Stating that the OMC has a surplus capital of Rs 2,000 crore, Jena too urged the State Government to procure the NINL in the interest of the State.

He urged the Congress to raise voice against the decision as the NINL was founded during its regime.

Jena said the Samajika Nyaya Abhiyan would go to people and make them know how the Narendra Modi Government at the Centre and the Naveen Patnaik Government in the State have hatched a conspiracy to hand over the NINL to a ‘friendly’ private company against the interest of people of the State.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---ninl-disinvestment-against-odisha---s-interest---.html

43,13-1-20,SAD appeals Centre to commute death penalty,"Over a month after the Union Home Minister Amit Shah had declared in the Lok Sabha that “no pardon has been given” to Balwant Singh Rajoana, facing death sentence for assassinating Punjab’s then Chief Minister Beant Singh in 1995, Shiromani Akali Dal’s (SAD) high-level delegation on Sunday appealed to Shah to intervene to commute his death penalty.

The SAD delegation led by its president Sukhbir Badal, requested Shah to intervene and expedite the matter of Rajoana’s clemency with the competent authority to commute the death penalty awarded to him and ensure his release from prison at the earliest.

Taking up the issue of Rajoana with the Union Minister, the SAD delegation, comprising the senior SAD leadership, presidents of SGPC, DSGMC and heads of Takhat Sri Hazoor Sahib and Takht Sri Patna Sahib, on Sunday informed that he had already undergone 24 years of imprisonment without any parole.

It said that a clemency petition, under Article 72 of the Constitution, was filed by the SGPC on March 25, 2012, before the President which was still pending.

The delegation added that the commutation of Rajoana’s death penalty was announced as a goodwill gesture on the pious occasion of 550th years of celebrations of parkash purb of Guru Nanak Dev.

Shah’s statement, on December 3, 201z8, had led to a controversy of sorts as the reports of commutation of Rajoana’s death sentence had been doing the rounds ever since the Centre had announced to grant special remission to eight Sikh prisoners besides commuting death sentence of “one Sikh prisoner” on September 30 on the occasion of Guru Nanak Dev’s 550th birth anniversary.

Soon after, the SAD had decided to meet Shah and also the Prime Minister Narendra Modi to commute Rajoana’s death sentence and urge that he be released from prison immediately.

Rajoana is currently undergoing death sentence at Patiala Central Jail, and the Shiromani Gurudwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has moved a plea seeking commutation.

Taking up several other religious issues, the delegation urged Shah to constitute a national level celebrations’ committee to commemorate the 400th birth anniversary of ninth Sikh master Guru Teg Bahadur in a most befitting manner across the country.

The delegation apprised the Union Minister about the approaching 399th parkash purb of Guru Teg Bahadur on April 12, 2020, saying that the occasion symbolized the spirit of selfless sacrifice in defense of the defenseless against repression and tyranny.

“Guru Teg Bahadur laid down his life in the fight against religious bigotry, sectarian hatred and violence,” it said adding that Guru Sahib came to the defense of helpless Kashmiri Pandits who were facing forcible religious conversions.

The delegation also urged the Home Minister for setting up a National Integration Memorial in New Delhi in the memory of the great Guru besides requesting him to announce a national holiday on this pious occasion.

SAD chief Sukhbir Badal also took up the issue of denial of permission to the SGPC delegation to visit Nankana Sahib to assess the ground situation after the recent attack on Gurdwara Janam Asthan as well as targeting of members of the Sikh community.

He urged the Home Minister to take up the issue with the Pakistan authorities and also ask the Pakistan Government to take concrete steps to ensure the safety and security of members of the Sikh community as well as other minorities in Pakistan.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad-appeals-centre-to-commute-death-penalty.html
44,13-1-20,SAD a fiefdom of Badal: Ministers,"Amid growing disenchantment with Sukhbir Badal’s leadership within the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), several Punjab Cabinet Ministers on Sunday launched a scathing attack on the party, which had been clearly reduced to the Badals’ personal fiefdom.

The Cabinet Ministers — the state Rural Development and Panchayats Minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Housing and Urban Development Minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, and Power and Revenue Minister Gurpreet Singh Kangar reacted sharply to Sukhbir’s wife and Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal’s “increasing interference” in the affairs of the party’s state affairs, as evident from her presence at the meetings of SAD’s core committee, despite not being its member.

“It is ironical that the very Akalis, who had historically fought to free the Gurdwaras from the hereditary control of the mahants (the traditional clergy that had become extremely powerful and ritualized, in the early 20th century) are now being led by a similar hereditary command structure under the Badals,” said the Ministers in a hard-hitting statement.

They asked, “What is the difference between the heredity promoted by those mahants or udasis in British India and the Badals, who are openly and brazenly nurturing a similar culture to ensure that the control of the SAD remains with the family?”

Harsimrat’s increasing involvement in SAD’s and Punjab’s affairs, even at the cost of her important work as a Union Minister, was a clear indication that the rank and file of the party were not happy with Sukhbir’s leadership, said the Ministers.

“SAD is in a complete disarray, particularly in the post Prakash Singh Badal era,” they observed, pointing to the rebellion by Dhindsa father-son duo, who had already been suspended from the party.

Only a day before, the Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and his MLA son Parminder Singh Dhindsa were suspended from the Akali Dal after the core committee meeting that was attended by Harsimrat also.

The Dhindsas had openly revolted against the stifling control of SAD by the Badals, declaring their intent to liberate the party from the family and revive its lost glory, the Ministers pointed out, citing it as just the latest example of the mounting disillusionment within the party against Sukhbir’s leadership and the lack of democracy prevailing in it.

“If senior leaders of the party are so unhappy with the leadership and loss of ideology, one can only imagine how dissatisfied the ordinary workers would be,” they quipped.

The Akali Dal, said the Ministers, had lost all credibility under the unprincipled, unethical and corrupt leadership of the Badals, who had lost all political integrity and had cut off the party complete from the grassroots in order to promote their selfish personal interests.

The Ministers also termed Sukhbir’s senseless recent diatribes against the Capt Amarinder Singh government as a frustrated bid to divert attention from Akali Dal’s total collapse, and his own personal downfall in the face of the growing resentment against him from within the party.

Unable to cope with his failure, Sukhbir had been resorting to attacking the incumbent Congress Government, using lies and fabrications to woo the people of Punjab, who had completely rejected the divisive and destructive SAD, and the leadership of the Badals, in favour of the positive, development-oriented and progressive leadership of Capt Amarinder Singh, the Ministers added.

“As far as Harsimrat is concerned, instead of jumping into the SAD’s Punjab affairs, she should spend her time and energy representing Punjab’s interests in the Central Government, of which she is a party,” said the Ministers.

The Ministers stressed that it was time for the Badals to step down from the SAD and hand over the party reins to those who remain committed to the Akali ideology. “Else, the day will soon come when the Akalis would be completely wiped out from the face of Punjab (and Indian) polity,” they warned.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad-a-fiefdom-of-badal--ministers.html

47,13-1-20,"Big Bird Count on Jan 12, 19","To know the presence of various species of avi-fauna in Haryana, State Forests and Wildlife Department has decided to organise Haryana Big Bird Count 2020 on January 12 and January 19, VS Tanwar, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Chief Wildlife Warden, Haryana said.

""The objective of the bird count is to know the exact number of various species of avi-fauna in the State as well as to find out the well-being of the birds and the habitat in which they were living, he said, adding the counting would focus on bird species.

The highest numbers of migratory birds are used to be at the wetland areas during this season,"" he said.

Tanwar said, “The lots of migratory birds reach at various wetlands areas in the State during winter season.

Study reveals that migratory birds from China, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tibet, Siberia and Iraq start thronging the wetland in October-mid.

The winged visitors return to their native countries in March with the onset of the spring season. This month is the best time for its counting and recording. This is the first time that the department is organising two days Haryana Big Bird Count 2020 on January 12 and 19 in the State.”

The Chief Wildlife Warden said that team comprising three to six members, headed by an expert having knowledge of identifying bird species and the methodology of their counting has been formed at each district of the State.

To complete this exercise, all the necessary arrangements have been made at Forest Rest Houses particularly at Pinjore, Kaleshar, Ambala, Jind, Kurukshetra, Panipat, Mahendergarh, Rewari and Palwal.

Tanwar said that Haryana is a natural habitat of many bird species and some data reveals that the number of individuals across species of birds has declined as well in many cases due to human activity, especially since the industrial revolution, severely affecting genetic variation, biodiversity, among other issues.

The Chief Wildlife Warden said that all the districts will be covered under this exercise. Many other volunteer bird watchers show their interest to participate in this exercise. This exercise will be done in two days.

For this, the district wildlife officers have been directed to assist the participant in this exercise with field functionaries along with the volunteer bird watchers.

Moreover, the officers have been asked to form separate teams of each district accompanied by an inspector, sub-inspector with all the available equipments like binoculars and telescope among others.

They need to ensure that all the field functionaries must be in their departmental uniform, he said, adding the bird watcher teams should be provided all the possible help in this exercise.

Tanwar said that all the divisional wildlife officers have been directed to remain in contact with the team members during this exercise.

If any kind of help required from the territorial wings than the concerned DWLO will discuss with the concerned DFO, territorial, he said, adding, this exercise will be started at 7 am on January 12 and completed by 5 pm.

If any district will not be able to complete this exercise on January 12 due to any reason than it will be done on January 19.

Another wildlife officer said that the distribution, numbers and behaviour of birds are changing over the period of time because of various reasons.

The population of the black partridge (kala teetar), Haryan state bird, sparrow among others has been decreasing over the past few years.

As of now, there are no exact figures of the population of many bird species in the state.

He said, ""After completion of the counting, more effective measures would be taken to conserve wildlife in State.”

He further said that the bird count will be conducted with the assistance of a team representing wildlife institute, forest department and avian experts belonging to various organisations in and around the State.

The teams for bird count have already been divided and one team member is expected to travel at least 20 kilometers to count the birds during the exercise.

In the last year 2019, 50, 000 wetland birds of 520 different species were counted by the team members.

The Wildlife officer further said that the district officers have been advised to provide drinking water and eatables during this exercise to all the participants in each district.

All the teams of each district will share their list of birds noticed during this exercise at the end of this event.

Follow the instructions accordingly and make this event a successful event, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/big-bird-count-on-jan-12--19.html

Pankaja, who worked with tribal women and weavers for over ten years, studied textile designing from National Institute of Fashion Technology, New Delhi and did masters in Social Anthropology from the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London besides bagging a number of Fellowships from prestigious institutions including the Ministry of Culture.

Her presentation covered the cultural context of rare indigenous textiles traditions of Odisha like the bark cloth of Gadaba, Kapdaganda of Dongria Kondh and Kotpad Pata by Panika community.

Pankaja lucidly explained how nature played the pivotal role in shaping up of the tribal culture and its textiles tradition. She later elaborated two case studies of Panika community’s indigenous weaving tradition – one from Kotpad in Koraput district of Odisha and the other from the Bastar region of Chhattisgarh.

Her presentation further highlighted the fast vanishing unique creation of Kerang cloth pattern crafted by Gadaba tribal women and the Kapdagonda shawls that carry various stories about the community and its culture.

50,13-1-20,Rechristening ‘Manimajra’ triggers row,"Chandigarh, which is known as one of the best experiments in urban planning and modern architecture in the twentieth century in India, came into existence in 1966. For more than a half century, Chandigarh, which is divided into various sectors, has lived without “Sector 13”.

However, the number 13, which is considered unlucky in European culture, may soon be seen prominently on Chandigarh’s map with the UT Administration giving a go ahead to rename Manimajra as “Sector 13”.

The move has attracted mixed reactions from the city residents with many opposing it and expressing apprehensions that rechristening of Manimajra will harm its historical importance. Not only this, the issue has also reached the local Court.

Commenting on UT Administration’s decision, former Chandigarh chief architect Sumit Kaur says, “While renaming any place in Chandigarh, we should consider that the fact that a sequence has been followed by the city planners to number the sectors in the city. Sector 12 is on one corner while Manimajra, which will be renamed as Sector 13, is on another side of the city. This would look wrong… ”

“Also, Manimajra holds historical significance and decisions related to renaming of any place here should be taken only after taking into consideration the facts related to the city’s planning,” she adds.

Notably, the Resident Welfare Associations in various places of Chandigarh have been demanding renaming of their respective areas for a long time. It was during last year when the Resident Welfare Association Modern Housing Complex, Chandigarh demanded that the Complex and adjoining areas be granted the status of Sector 13.

Accordingly, the Administration had chalked out a proposal to rename eight areas including Manimajra and Modern Housing Complex as Sector 13. Punjab Governor and UT Administrator VP Singh Badnore had approved the proposal last week, while a notification in this regard is yet to be issued.

It is said that when Swiss-born French architect Le Corbusier was designing Chandigarh, he never included Sector 13 in the layout of the city. While many believe that number 13 is considered unlucky in France and this superstition led to the omission of Sector 13 from Chandigarh city, the official documents tell a different story.

The city development plan states, “The sectors of the city are numbered commencing from the northern most edge of the city with the highest numbers located at the southern edge. There is no Sector 13 in Chandigarh, but the addition or subtraction of the number of any two consecutive Sectors in Phase I sectors vertically amounts to 13 or its multiple (e.g. Sec. 2 + Sec. 11 = 13, Sec.11 + Sec. 15=26, etc.).”

“Though it is generally believed that number 13 was left out due to superstition but records indicate that Sector 12 and 13 were demarcated initially as a cultural zone in the lower halves of Sector 10 and 11 but later removed to avoid confusion. However, later number 12 was assigned to residential area at the edge of Sector 11 but number 13 was left out in absence of an appropriate area for its location,” the plan further says.

Architect SD Sharma, who has worked with Le Corbusier told The Pioneer, “The city planners decided against adding Sector 13 to Chandigarh as they followed their European belief which holds the number 13 inauspicious. However, in India, we celebrate festivals like Lohri and Baisakhi on the 13th of the respective months.”

“As far as the issue of rechristening Manimjra as Sector 13 is concerned, many inhabitants are opposed to the idea. While it would not be wrong to overcome the stigma of number 13 and have Sector 13 in Chandigarh, the authorities should do it after taking suggestions from all sides,” he says.

Interestingly, the city’s creator Le Corbusier’s original plan was divided into a gird of 30 sectors with Capitol Complex as well as Civic Centre as its focal points. And, phase II layout included Sector 31 to 47.

Under Chandigarh Master Plan 2031, the reference area for planning constitutes 144 sq km which includes 60 sectors in the sectoral grid as well as the periphery areas outside it.

Colonel Gursewak Singh, President Resident Welfare Association, Modern Housing Complex (MHC), Chandigarh says, “Last year, we had demanded that MHC and its adjoining areas should be renamed as Sector 13, to introduce Chandigarh’s missing sector. But, the Administration decided to rename entire Manimajra as Sector 13.”

“We welcome this decision and are not opposed to the renaming of Manimajra and MHC,” he adds.

On the other hand, advocate Ravinder Singh Bassi, who has filed a petition in District Court challenging the decision, says that the rechristening of Manimajra will harm its historical significance.

The Administration is ignoring the facts and sentiments of local people. The original inhabitants are not happy with the decision of renaming of Manimajra and few people who migrated here from other places are in favor of this, he further says.

The petition filed in the Court states, “Manimajra is a small historical town situated in the foothill of the Shivalik range, established 600 years ago by its then ruler named Garib Dass and Manimajra has witnessed many historical events. It also has a social and religious importance as the ‘Sidh Peeth’ of Mansa Devi temple is situated in the periphery of Manimajra.”

“Manimajra has a 500 to 600 years old historical fort, Thakurdwara. Gurudwara Khooni Sahib in Manimajra holds historical importance as Guru Gobind Singh had visited the place. But, ignoring all the said facts and also, ignoring the sentiments of local people, Administration has decided to rename the place,” the petition adds.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rechristening----manimajra----triggers-row.html

52,13-1-20,Vivekanand spelled out Hinduism on world’s stage: Jai Ram,"Himachal Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur on Sunday said that Swami Vivekananda was responsible for revival of Hindu spiritualism and established Hinduism as a revered religion on world stage, working tirelessly towards betterment of the society, in servitude of the poor and needy.

Thakur was speaking on the occasion of Swami Vivekananda Jan Mahothsav Samaroh held at Palampur in Kangra district on the occasion of birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda organised by Kayakalp Himalayan Research Institute for Yoga and Naturopathy.

The Chief Minister said that Swami Vivekananda was not just a spiritual mind, but was also a prolific thinker, great orator and passionate patriot.He said that Swami carried on the free-thinking philosophy of his Guru, Ramakrishna Paramhansa and converted into a new paradigm.

His message of universal brotherhood and self-awakening remains more relevant today, especially in the current backdrop of widespread political turmoil around the world, he added.

The Chief Minister said that Swami Vivekananda succeeded in constructing a virtual bridge between the culture of east and the west.He said that Swami interpreted the Hindu scriptures, philosophy and the way of life to the western people.

He made them realize that in spite of poverty and backwardness, India had a great contribution to make the world culture, Thakur added.The Chief Minister said that Swami Vivekananda travelled the length and breadth of the country, absorbing much of the social, cultural and religious aspects of the people he came in contact with.

Swami witnessed the adversities of life that the common people faced, their ailments, and vowed to dedicate his life to bring relief to these suffering, he said.

Thakur said that organising such an event to educate the younger generation about the teachings and life of Swami Vivekananda was really a commendable endeavour.

55,13-1-20,Liberation of the Embodied Soul,"Ultimate purpose of any spiritual discipline is escape of beings from suffering. Bhagavad Gita has analysed precisely as to why do the sufferings arise and how can these be alleviated.

In shloka 15.9, it is stated that while dwelling in the body, jivatman enjoys different objects of the senses using the five senses and also the mind. The three modes (gunas) which are born of material nature, bind the imperishable embodied soul to the body (Shloka 14.5).

When jivatman starts identifying himself with his body and the mind, he forgets his own eternal existence. The self is lost in a false identification with the non-self. He starts living for the satisfaction of his own ego. He is, thus, bound by the three modes of material nature. Such bondage becomes the reason for his sufferings in the physical world. To gain one’s spiritual freedom, one has to rise above these gunas.

It is stated in shloka 14.20 that when the embodied soul rises above these three modes associated with the body, he then becomes free from birth, death, old age and all kinds of pain ; and attains to the immortality.

The one who is happy from within, whose contentment is from within, who is illumined by the inner light, whose sins have been washed away, whose doubts have been cleared, whose mind is disciplined, who works for the welfare of all, who is free from anger and lust, who has subdued his mind ; and who has knowledge of the self - such a sage is sure to attain the absolute freedom (Shlokas 5.24 to 5.26).

Equanimity of mind is considered to be essential for liberation of the soul. It has been stated in shloka 2.51 that the wise men possessing an equipoised mind free themselves from the bondage of repeated births by renouncing the fruits of their actions. In this manner, they attain that blissful state, which is beyond any sorrow.

In various other shlokas, it has been explained as to how man, the subject, can gain freedom from enslavement of the objective world. Freedom from bondage of works can be gained by performing one’s prescribed duty without attachment, by being content with whatever comes one’s way, by getting beyond dualities of pleasure and pain, by being free from envy, by removing all the doubts through wisdom ; and by remaining the same in success and failure.

Whatever one does, it should be done as an offering to Krishna, the Supreme Lord. In this manner, one is freed from the bondage of good and bad results of actions. And by establishing one’s mind on the way of renunciation, one becomes free and attains the Supreme Lord (Shlokas 9.27 and 9.28).

Regarding the path of bhakti, it has been stated that he who constantly remembers Krishna, the Supreme Lord, thinking of no one else - such a yogi who is ever united with Him, can easily reach Him. Having reached Him, such a great soul does not take birth again in this impermanent world, full of miseries (Shlokas 8.14 and 8.15).

Those who fix their mind upon Krishna, let their buddhi dwell in Him ; certainly reside in Him. To those devotees who are ever united with Him through devotion and who worship Him with love, He grants such power of understanding by which they go to Him. He who knows in reality the divinity behind His birth and works, is not born again. Instead, he goes to Him (Shlokas 12.8, 10.10 and 4.9).

One should always focus his mind on Krishna, the Supreme Lord, pay obeisance to Him, be devoted to Him ; and worship Him. Thus absorbed in Him and having Him as one’s goal, one shall go to Him (Shloka 9.34).

Whatever state of being, at the end, one thinks while giving up his body ; he attains that state because he always remains absorbed in contemplation thereof (Shloka 8.6). Therefore, it has been advised in shloka 8.5 that at the time of death, one should think of Krishna alone. In this manner, one attains liberation.

Lust, anger and greed are stated to be the three gates of hell. He who is freed from these gates of darkness attains to the supreme destination (Shlokas 16.21 and 16.22).Apart from these, Gita has also stressed upon meditation and pranayma for liberation of the soul.

All the teachings of Gita have been summarised in shloka 11.55 wherein it is stated that he who dedicates all his actions to Krishna, the Supreme Lord, who looks upon Him as his supreme goal, who worships Him, who is free from attachment ; and who is free from enmity to any of the creatures - such a devotee certainly attains Him. In other words, he is always spiritually free.

In short, when one understands that the soul is different from the body and the mind and also realises that only the modes of material nature, and not the soul, are the doer ; he then performs his prescribed duty without any attachment and remains devoted to the Supreme Lord. As a result, he is freed from sorrows of the phenomenal world. He obtains complete self-awareness and, thus, becomes master of his life.

When one obtains such wisdom, he arrives at a perfect harmony with his fellow beings. He is full of compassion and love.That is what is called liberation of the soul, a state of inexhaustible bliss.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/liberation-of-the-embodied-soul.html

59,13-1-20,Jharkhand: The way forward,"When Jharkhand’s boundaries took shape as the 28th State on the Indian map, withthe passing of the Bihar Reorganization Bill, on November 15th 2000, a dream gotconverted into reality. Jharkhand has it all to be a winner: a prodigious child of theIndian Nation now entering the 18th year of its existence has much to boast.

Look atit from the point of view of topography, flora or fauna, industries, or mineral wealth,the State of Jharkhand does have a distinct laudable character of its own.

With 40 %mineral resources of the country comprising, inter alia, coal, iron ore, copper ore,kyanite, graphite, mica, uranium and gold, a good industrial base comprising Iron &Steel, aluminum, Iron –ore and Coal Mining, Motor vehicles, coke-oven products,basic ferrous and non-ferrous metals, machinery etc., nearly 1400 mm of annualrainfall, a good network of rivers like Subernarekha, Damodar, Barakar, Koel,Shankh, Mayurakshi, Kharkai etc., the State does carve for itself a niche among theStates of India. Given the picturesque beauty of the state with all its water falls andforests, flora & fauna, leave alone all other endowments, the state has potentialenough to attract tourists and launch a tourism inspired economic growth path.

Nonetheless, with all the bounties of nature notwithstanding, the State is indeed astudy in paradox.

Even with all the gifts of God, it still reels under the curse ofpoverty with nearly 40% of its population under the poverty line, net irrigated areabeing less than 10% of the net sown area ( to understand the contrast :Punjab has apercentage of 97% and the neighboring State of Bihar is above 60%). It has been around nineteen years of the formation of Jharkhand State and several developmentinitiatives have also been launched during this period but the problems remainlargely the same : poverty, unemployment, poor infrastructure (The State is belowthe national average in basic infrastructure, such as irrigation, electricity, road andrail transport), corruption, low productivity, poor law & order and above all lack ofopportunities for the youth of the State who comprise a good majority of thepopulation.

All these compound to prevent Jharkhand from attaining the heights itcan with ease and facility.

At 6 % GSDP rate of growth, it certainly has to cover a lotof ground to catch up with the other leading States. With a potential to reach 15%GSDP rate of growth, the State has to work out the nitty-gritties for achieving a higherproductivity, growth and sustainable development.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jharkhand--the-way-forward.html

75,13-1-20,"Tension achieves nothing, honest efforts bring success, says Rawat","Honest efforts are needed for success in life, said the chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat. He said this while interacting with participants on the concluding day of the Uttarakhand Young Leaders Conclave on the occasion of Swami Vivekanand’s 157th birth anniversary here on Sunday.

Addressing the youth the CM said, “Stress does not help achieve anything. Our right is to work hard while the rest should be left to god. Only when the youth are happy will the nation be happy and move forward,” he said.

While addressing the gathering at the venue, he also interacted with students in other districts through video conferencing. On the subject of migration, Rawat said that being a border state, Uttarakhand is especially sensitive.

The state government has formed the Rural Development and Migration Commission. The CM border area development scheme has also been initiated for 22 border area blocks in the state.

On being asked about the government’s vision for the youth, Rawat said that the youth are most important for any government. “The focus of the government is on quality education. Big institutions are being established in the state including CIPET and the national law university. The government’s effort is aimed at ensuring good education for the youth, their skill development and happiness. The youth should also come forward for self-employment. It is also important to accord respect to labour,” he said.

78,13-1-20,Protesting Anganwadi worker taken to GDMC hospital by police,"After protesting for more than a month, the Anganwadi workers recently escalated their protest with two of them undertaking a fast unto death in support of their demands. On Sunday, the third day of the fast unto death, the police took away one of the hunger strikers to the hospital.

Meanwhile, the State minister for Women and Child Development, Rekha Arya said that the government had been open to communication with the Anganwadi workers. She also said that the allowance given to them in Uttarakhand is higher than the amount paid in other states.

One of the protesters Savita Sharma said, “The Government has not responded to us since the commencement of our protest. Of course, we don’t expect them to accept all our demands at once but at least they can initiate some sort of communication. But no, they are behaving like we don’t exist whatsoever.”

“All we can do is to make stronger efforts and be optimistic that the government will care to listen to us through our ongoing fast unto death strike before it’s too late”, added another protester Shashi Thapa. At noon, doctors arrived to examine Shashi Thapa and Savita Sharma. One of the doctors, Dr Sushil said, “Though we still have a few more tests to do, for now, both the women seemed to be alright. Their blood pressure is normal, and there is no problem with urination.

Once we’ll figure out the ketone bodies in their urine, we would be able to comment on their health conditions clearly. As of now, the weight of both women has dropped, but there is no visible drastic health issue.” He added that only after complete test results are received would the final statement on their health be issued.

Later, in the evening, police carried Savita Sharma to Government Doon Medical College Hospital due to some health complications. Minakshi Rawat, an active member of Anganwadi workers protest, alleged, “We are mistreated by the government because we are women.

As per the statement of Child Development Minister Rekha Arya, we are just some ordinary women and we’ll get back to our work in a few days. If this is the thinking process of a female minister towards other women, we don’t know what to say.

She is not even aware of what we do or contribute to the welfare of children and society.” However, all the allegations were denied by the minister Rekha Arya. The minister stressed, “Uttarakhand pays the highest allowance to Anganwadi workers among all the states. They are not neglected just because they are women. Actually, their allowance was raised in the year 2018 only due to the fact that they are women and contribute significantly to the development of the State. It is unfortunate that they are lying about the efforts of the government to communicate with them.

Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had met them after calling them personally and their association has also been in constant touch with me. I think they are lost because of some political agenda.” She further added that the ninety per cent funding for Anganwadi workers is provided by the central government while the remaining ten per cent is funded by the State.

Also, the rules and regulations are similar in every state too as per the Centre.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/protesting-anganwadi-worker-taken-to-gdmc-hospital-by-police.html

The day kick-started with Art Attack event that witnessed an overwhelming response from 250+ kids where they let their creativity run wild by awakening their inner Picasso. This was followed by the Kids Dance Show which has more than 150 (solo+ group) performances. The judges have it tough deciding the best dances amongst all the mind-boggling performances.

The fair also had stalls on food, art and craft and a gaming zone. Events like kids' fashion show, MasterChef, live art performances and a dance competition were held across 2 days.

Standup comedians- Sohrabh Pant and Kumar Varun also performed on Sunday that attracted a number of visitors.

"" The fair received overwhelming response. Maxi is also working on a research project of Hindustan Unilever to launch new products in the food industry. There were several other clients too. We are thus researching talking to chefs from major hotels of the city,"" said Abhilash Nandy, secretary of Maxi.

The Marketing Association of XLRI, or MAXI as it's fondly known as, is the oldest committee on campus. Established forty-six years ago, in 1971, MAXI's mandate has been simple - to popularize the field of Marketing at XLRI and ensure that fun and quirkiness are an integral part of the entire process.

This is achieved through a mix of competitive events, talks, interaction sessions, conferences and of course, the world-renowned MAXI Fair. It is often said that Marketing is something that needs to be experienced rather than studied, and MAXI uses this as one of its guiding principles.

All events conducted by MAXI are designed to give students a deep, working insight into what Marketing is really about. MAXI is possibly the best-known and most respected committee, both within and outside XLRI.

This standing is a result of constant innovation - be it in the more famous form of MAXI Fair, or other initiatives like Mindscapes - India's first seminar on the applications of Behavioral Research in Marketing.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/maxi-fair-receives-overwhelming-response.html

While talking to the Pioneer on Sunday, the former Director General of Police (DGP) turned politician said that good governance will be of paramount importance in the fresh Cabinet.

Q: How does the new Government plan to meet the expectations of the people?

A: We will provide good governance, eradicate corruption, and ensure that people do not have to run from pillar to post for departmental works. The Government will fix a stipulated time period for officials of the State Government for their work. Generally people visit offices for certificates like Birth Certificate, Death Certificate and cards like health cards, ration card and others. The Government will simplify this process.

Q: Congress had announced in its manifesto that it will provide job to one person from each family. How will the Government fulfill this promise?

A: There are huge vacancies in every department of the State Government. First of all the Government will assess the vacancies, and then it will start recruitment process. The recruitment will be started very soon, just after the expansion of Hemant Soren’s cabinet. The estimated number of vacancies in the State Government is more than One Lakh. During his election campaign Soren had also vowed that the Government will even hold two Jharkhand Public Service Commission exam in a year if the situation demands us to do so. After that the Government will focus on self employment. First of all the aspirant will be trained, and then the Government will help them start their own work.

A: Congress has said in its poll manifesto that the party will raise limit for Other Backward Cast (OBC) from existing 14 per cent to 27 per cent in Government jobs. Once the Government starts functioning, we will work on this. As far as local policy is concerned, the Government will form a committee to examine the various clauses of the policy. One thing is sure that there will be provision for local people for class 3 and class 4 jobs.

Q: Seventy per cent of total population of the State is surviving on agriculture and the sector is severely affected by lack of irrigation facility and lower price of farm produce. How do you plan to address this?

A: The irrigation system of the State still depends of Monsoon and around 90 per cent of total farmers have less than two acres of land, so they can’t invest much to install water pumps. The Government will form a committee to examine the options to provide better irrigation system in the State. As water level is decreasing day by day, the Government will lay stress on increasing the number of ponds, check dams on small rivers. To provide better price for farm produce the Government will strengthen the procurement system and increase minimum support price at the same time it will ensured that the each and every farmer could get the benefit of this plan.

Q: What will be plan of the Government to boost education, health and other important sectors?

A: The Govt will improve condition of Govt Schools as most of the people live in rural areas and they don’t’ have access to private schools. Poor people also can’t afford private school, so the Govt will chalk out a plan to provide better education system in Govt Schools and to implement it. First of all, Govt will recruit efficient teachers. For health services, the Government will ensure presence of at least one ANM at every primary health centre so that the people of remote areas can get better health facility. For every community health centre, the Government will ensure presence of at least one doctor with other staff.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jobs--livelihood-top-govt---s-priority-list--rameshwar-oraon.html
82,13-1-20,Bandhu opposes JVM merger with BJP,"Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) legislator from Mandar, Bandhu Tirkey has opposed the merger of his party with BJP claiming that it will be a big setback for the party. As the news of Babulal Marandi merging his party JVM with BJP is gaining momentum, the party legislators are anxious, said Tirkey.

Tirkey said, “For past few days we have been hearing that Babulal Marandi jee is planning to merge his party with BJP. I don’t think that there is any truth, but if such development occurs it will setback for party and party legislators.”

Tirkey further said, “My politics revolves around opposing BJP and I will never join BJP at any cost.”

Tirkey, who was granted bail days before Assembly election, had contested and won election from Mandar (ST) seat. On November 25, the Jharkhand High Court granted bail to former Minister and Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) candidate, Bandhu Tirkey, accused in the 34th National Games scam and two cases related to Pathalgadi in Khunti.

Tirkey, the three-time legislator from Mandar had won the election in 2005 and 2009 but in 2014 lost to BJP’s Gangotri Kujur.

Sources said that as Bandhu gets support from Christian and Muslim apart from tribals who play a deciding role in his election victory joining hands with BJP will be suicidal for him.

Also Bandhu blames that BJP and former Chief Minister Raghubar Das after he was arrested in national games. On September last year, state’s anti-corruption bureau (ACB) arrested senior JVM (P) leader and former sports minister Bandhu Tirkey in connection with its ongoing probe into the multi-crore games equipment purchase scam in the run-up to 34th National Games held in Ranchi in 2011.

It was alleged that Tirkey, the then sports ministers, had granted final approvals to all murky deals related to purchase of equipment and other logistics for the games that caused a loss of Rs 28.34 crore to the exchequer.

Sources said that as Tirkey has openly opposed the merger of JVM with BJP it will not be an easy task for Babulal Marandi to merge his party as per anti-defection law.

Sources said that Marandi may have to convince one of his two other legislators to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) along with him or give away his membership of House if at all he makes a return to the saffron party, legal experts says.

“As per the 10th schedule of the Constitution, a legislator alone cannot join another party. At least 2/3rd majority of the total number of MLAs of a particular party have to merge with the other party in order to avoid legal complications,” said Sanjay Kumar Vidrohi, senior lawyer and elected member of the Jharkhand State Bar Council (JSBC).",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bandhu-opposes-jvm-merger-with-bjp.html

The Saffron party main concern is that different educational institutions such as JNU, Jamia Millia Islamia and others too have witnessed violence over CAA. Moreover, people from different walks of society have condemned violence in JNU and other educational institutions in the name of the CAA.

The BJP losing ground in CAA front has decided to create awareness and in this connection the party has made elaborate strategy. The party has announced a 10-day door-to -door awareness campaign from Sunday to “dispel misinformation” on the issue. Also the party has decided to delegate 42 leaders who will visit various states creating awareness on CAA.

In Jharkhand the BJP has raised CAA during election with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP national president Amit Shah raising the issue.

However, Chief Minister Hemant Soren had categorically stated that he will go through the details of the amended citizenship law and if even one person from his state is uprooted due to the amended legislation, then it will not be implemented.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-plans-human-chain-to-create-caa-awareness.html
84,13-1-20,Salkhen demands separate Sarna code,"As the Union Govt prepares for 2021 census collecting data of people, which also include their religion, the demand for inclusion of separate Sarna code, a religion based on the concept of nature worship, followed by tribals in several Indian States including Jharkhand has gained momentum.

Former Member of Parliament and convener of Adivasi Sengel Abhiyan, Salkhan Murmu has written a letter to President Ramnath Kovind with a demand to include Sarna as separate religious code in 2021 census. Murmu in his argument had stated that tribals are basically nature worshipers as they worship Sun, Moon, Earth, Plants and Trees, rivers and mountains and even animals, which indicates that tribal culture and living style revolves around nature. Murmu the tribal leader has urged the Union Government to accord separate religious code for Sarna in 2021 census.

The former MP giving instance of Article 25 (1) of Constitution claims that Article 25 states that ‘all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practice, and propagate religion subject to public order, morality and health’ and in such condition tribals who are nature worshiper should be accorded separate religion code.

The demand for a separate Sarna religious code in the Census has been pending for a long time. Sarna followers are worshippers of nature. Jharkhand has 32 tribal groups, of which eight tribes are from Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG). These tribal groups are Hindus. However, few have converted to Christianity.

Under the Census 2001, there were six options under the religion column -- Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, Jain, and Sikh -- which were given 1-6 code numbers. People from other religious groups were asked to mention their religions but not to highlight the code numbers. Likewise, in 2011 Census, the same procedure was followed.

Murmu in his letter had stated that Jains and Buddhist having population less than tribals too have separate religious code, but the tribals who are numerically more than other communities don’t have separate religious code.

Murmu claims that by not assigning separate religious code for tribals, the centre and state government wants to puts tribals in Hindus, Muslim and Christian category. It is believed that in 2011 Census, 42 lakh people from Jharkhand and about six crore people from across the country had mentioned their religion as Sarna, which was then included in others section.

Sources said that the demand for inclusion of separate Sarna religious code may gain momentum in coming days as many political parties including JVM and others too had promised to have separate religious code for tribals in their manifesto.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/salkhen-demands-separate-sarna-code.html

Counting was done during the Big Bird Day ( BBD ) - 2020 in the seven diversity parks.

According to the data prepared by Dr Faiyaz Khudsar, a Delhi University professor, in the current season, 83 bird species were counted against 102 in 2017, 103 in 2018 and 98 in 2019 in Yamuna Biodiversity Park (YBP). Special species that have been seen in YBP are - Red Crested Pochard and Ferrogenous Pochard.

In Tilpath valley, Biodiversity Park, this year only 43 migratory species counted however in 2017, the number was 64, and 45 , 53 were in 2018 and 2019 respectively.

In Kamla Nehru Ridge, 59 migratory species marked their presence while in 2017, only 54 were their and in 2018, 2019 number was 45 and 59 respectively. Special species that have been seen here are Verditer fly catcher and Northern Shoveler

According to environmentalists, Delhi Biodiversity Parks have assumed global importance as models for replication not only to conserve the vanishing natural heritage from urban centres but also render a wide range of ecosystem services.

Citing low visibility a crucial factor, Dr Khudasr said the number seems to be underestimated due to heavy smog which led to little poor visibility as well as sighting of birds.

“It has been 30 years since the commission recommendation implemented in the country in 1990. While SEBC and the OBC is a major constituent of Odisha population, it is not understood why the State Government has not implemented 27 per cent reservation for them,” Pradhan said in response to a question of reporters on the State Government’s move for enumeration of SEBC and OBC population along with the General Census in 2021.

He said he had earlier on July 25, 2018 written to Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik to implement the Mandal Commission recommendations in Odisha in line with other States. The SEBC and the OBC people have the constitutional right to get reservations,” he said.

Addressing a Press meet here, he said the State Government soon implement Mandal Commission recommendation of 27% reservation for SEBC and OBC candidates in both Government jobs and higher education institutions and 38.5 reservation for SC and ST candidates in education sector.

Jena ridiculed the Chief Minister for thinking about development of SEBC and OBC people, which constitute 94% of the State’s population, after remaining in power for 20 years.

Stating that Article 15 (4) and 16 (4) have given power to the Union Government and the State Governments to make development plans for the SC, ST, Minorities and Socially and Economically Backward Classes, Jena said, “I thank Naveen Patnaik to have gone through the Article 15 (4) and 16 (4) and is now thinking about the development of the SEBC and OBC people. Had he implemented reservations recommended by the Mandal Commission, many doctors, engineers and officers in higher posts have been produced from the SEBC and OBC categories by now.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/give-constitutional-right-to-sebc--obc--pradhan.html

After garlanding a statue of Vivekananda in Ranchi on the occasion of Swami Vivekananda’s birth anniversary, Soren said that the ideologies and teachings of Vivekananda are source of strength and energy among the youth.

“We need to channelise this strength and energy to be able to serve the society and the country,” said Soren, adding that Jharkhand was a young State and the youth here should strive hard to make Swami Vivekananda’s vision for the country a reality.

On this occasion, the Govt also opened the gates of Vivekananda Sarovar for visitors. The Infrastructure, which has a 33-feet-tall bronze statue of Vivekananda, will remain open from 10am to 8pm on Monday. As per directives from the Chief Minister’s Office, the site will remain open for common public from 10pm to 5.50pm Tuesday onwards.

The statue of Vivekananda was unveiled last year on National Youth Day by former CM Raghubar Das. However, the Vivekananda Sarovar, built in Ranchi Lake, was not open for common public of the State. “Taking cognizance of media reports, the honourable CM has made the Vivekananda Sarovar open for visitors,” said a press communiqué from the CM’s office on Sunday.

Swami Vivekananda’s birth anniversary is celebrated across the country as National Youth Day. Remembering the teachings of Vivekananda, the Chief Minister on Sunday said that the former’s contributions in strengthening youth and the society have formed the basis of the youth power that is gradually becoming a game-changer in the country.

The State is with you,” he told the Tirkey sisters.

112,13-1-20,"UP turns aesthetic with ‘one road, one tree’ plan","The Uttar Pradesh government has decided to turn aesthetic by following ‘one road, one tree (species)’ concept. It has been opted to not only enhance the beauty and fight pollution but also serve as a road map for the commuters.

Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Social Forestry) Prabhakar Dubey said that while the trees would be planted and maintained by the Urban Development department, the onus of planning would be on the Forest department.

The Forest department officials have selected the species, which are being raised in nurseries and will later be handed over to the Urban Development department.

Dubey said the matter was still at the planning stage but it would be implemented from monsoon this year.

Under this concept, which is being used in several cities, trees of one flowering species are planted on the highway or a street and the foliage or the bloom helps people in identifying specific areas.

The official added that they had followed the concept for some roads in Lucknow earlier as well, and this time the technique would be used to cover the entire capital city.

In 2015-16, rows of mulsarry (Mimusops elengi) or Maulshree tree were planted along Raj Bhawan for aesthetic appeal. It is a prized ornamental specimen with small, shiny leaves.

Meanwhile, the golden bell (Tabebuia argentea), a tropical flowering tree with a crooked trunk and trumpet-shaped bright yellow flowers, were planted on the stretch between Hazratganj and Raj Bhawan.

Several other varieties like Tabebuia with violet-pink flowers were planted on Vikramaditya Marg while the silk floss (Chorisia speciosa), were planted in Gomti Nagar with its pink floral crown in winters.

Another benefit of these trees with dense foliage is that they will reduce pollution in cities.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-turns-aesthetic-with----one-road--one-tree----plan.html
113,13-1-20,Oppn attacks UP govt over Noida loot-murder case,"The opposition on Sunday targeted the Uttar Pradesh government over the murder of a private firm employee in Noida last week, with the Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party accusing Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s dispensation of laxity and indifference.

Gaurav Chandel, a resident of Greater Noida’s 5th Avenue Gaur City, was returning from work in Gurgaon on the night of January 7 when he was shot dead after being robbed of his SUV, wallet, laptop and other belongings, police had said.

Around 10:30 pm, he had called up his wife to inform her that he was at Parthala Chowk and would reach home in five minutes, the police had said.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said Chandel’s family should get justice at the earliest.

“Gaurav Chandel, who worked as a manager, was murdered by criminals in Noida. The government action in this loot-and-murder case has been lax so far,” she tweeted in Hindi.

“If the morale of criminals in a place like Noida is so high, what will be the situation in the whole of UP,” she asked.

Bahujan Samaj Party president Mayawati asked the Yogi Adityanath government to pay attention to issues of crime control and maintenance of law and order.

“Public anger is continuously rising across the entire region due to the government’s cover-up and indifference in the Gaurav Chandel murder case in Noida. It will be better if the UP government gives up this kind of laxity in matters of crime control and law and order and gives proper attention to public welfare,” Mayawati tweeted in Hindi.

Chandel was found unconscious around 4 am on January 8 along a service road between Parthala Chowk and Hindon Vihar. He was rushed to a private hospital where doctors declared him dead, the police had said.

His family alleged that they approached the local Cherry County police post but they got no help.

Later, they reached Bisrakh police station where they requested that Chandel’s phone be put on surveillance but the officials there kept dilly-dallying the matter, saying the case did not fall in their jurisdiction, and two crucial hours were wasted, they said.

Over the past week, protests have been held in Greater Noida (West) to demand justice for Gaurav Chandel’.

According to officials, a station house officer and three sub-inspectors of a police station in Greater Noida have been suspended for dereliction of duty in connection with a loot-and-murder case.

117,13-1-20,Sonia calls Opp meet for joint action plan,"With the stir against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) spreading across the country, Congress president Sonia Gandhi has called a meeting of like-minded Opposition parties on Monday to frame a ‘joint action plan’ against the CAA and proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC). West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and BSP chief Mayawati has decided to skip the meeting.

The Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Saturday had discussed the party’s organisational and political response to the Modi Government’s attempt to push CAA in the States, would deliberate with “friendly” Opposition parties the current political situation.

Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said Monday’s meeting “will further discuss the emerging situation”. Leaders of around a dozen Opposition parties, including DMK, RJD, NCP, Samajwadi Party and Left parties are expected to attend meeting.

Though several Chief Ministers in the country have pronounced that they could not allow implementation of the CAA, the Opposition has not been able to consolidate its unity despite the momentum provided to it by the campus unrest against it and backing it received by assorted sections of the society, including the film-world.

Unsettled by the clashes between the workers of the Left and her Trinamool Congress during last week’s trade union strike, Banerjee announced that she would absent herself from the Opposition meeting. While almost denouncing the meet, the TMC chief said the meeting was her brain-child.

“What happened yesterday in the State — it is no more possible for me to attend the meeting anymore,” she had said, announcing her boycott of the Delhi deliberations.

“I was the first to launch an andolan (movement) against CAA, NRC,” she added. “What the Left and the Congress are doing in the name of the CAA-NRC is not a movement but vandalism,” she said.

Mamata who had earlier called for a wider Opposition unity against the Modi-Government’s contentious CAA has chosen to exclude herself.

Mayawati, too, had attacked Sonia and Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra recently days over the deaths of infants at a hospital in the Congress-ruled Rajasthan’s Kota.

The BSP leader who has split with SP post-Lok Sabha polls said if the “woman general secretary of the Congress” would not visit Kota to meet the mothers who lost their children, then her meetings with families of victims in Uttar Pradesh will be considered for “political interest and drama”.

On Saturday, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi described the citizenship law a “discriminatory and divisive” law whose “sinister” purpose was to divide people on religious lines. “The CAA is a discriminatory and divisive law. The sinister purpose of the law is clear to every patriotic, tolerant and secular Indian: it is to divide the Indian people on religious lines,” she said at a meeting of the CWC and sought its withdrawal.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sonia-calls-opp-meet-for-joint-action-plan.html
118,13-1-20,Cabinet Secy asks Ministries to provide staff details by Jan 15,"Ahead of the ambitious project to redevelopment of Parliament and the Central Vista in Lutyens’ Delhi, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba has sought details of employees from all Ministries by January 15 to formulate an accommodation action plan. The mammoth project that involves setting of a central secretariat complex, housing all Central Government departments and Ministries, and redeveloping the old Parliament building or setting up a new structure is aimed to be complete by March, 2024.

In his letter to Secretaries, Gauba has asked them to appoint a nodal officer not below the rank of joint secretary in their respective ministries to facilitate collection of all required information in this regard. Gauba also stated that such details will help the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, which is a nodal ministry for the mega project, formulate accommodation plan.

The Modi Government has readied a blue print for its ambitious plan to redevelop Central Vista — the nation’s power corridor in Delhi — for which several buildings such as Krishi Bhawan, Shastri Bhawan, Vigyan Bhawan, Vice-President’s residence and Nirman Bhawan are likely to be razed.

While the deadline for redevelopment of Central Vista — the three kilometre stretch between India Gate and Rashtrapati Bhawan on Raisina Hill — has been set at November 2021. The Parliament is expected to be ready by March 2022. The third phase of the grand project — setting up a Central Secretariat complex — is expected to be finished two years after that. The deadlines set for each phase are not without a rationale. For the Parliament complex for example, the deadline is set at March 2022. As the Government plans to hold the monsoon session in 2022 — marking India’s 75th independence — in a new Parliament complex.

The redevelopment plan of Central Vista is likely to include a triangular Parliament building next to the existing one, common Central Secretariat for ministries and the revamping of the 3-km-long Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan till India Gate.

Shifting the residences of the Vice-President and the Prime Minister close to the Rashtrapati Bhavan is also under consideration.

As part of the Central Vista redevelopment project, the Government will construct a Central Secretariat to accommodate offices of all ministries, the Cabinet Secretary said in the letter.

According to an estimate, the Government is currently paying Rs 1,000 crore as rent annually for its offices spread across the national Capital.

“The Cabinet Secretary has sought a list of requirement of ministries, their attached and subordinate offices about the sanctioned and filled posts. He has asked secretaries of ministries to submit such details by January 15,” sources said.

The Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry has planned to float tenders for each project by next month. According to the Central Public Works Department, the entire Central Vista redevelopment project will be executed at an estimated cost of Rs 12,879 crore.

The new Parliament building with seating capacity for 1,000 to 1,200 people is targeted to be constructed by August 2022 when India will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day. The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024.

In October last year, Gujarat-based architecture firm HCP Designs won the consultancy bid for architectural and engineering planning of the Centre’’s ambitious project.

The firm, which will be paid Rs 229.75 crore for consultancy services, will prepare the master plan of the project, including designs, cost estimation, landscape and traffic integration plans, and parking facilities among others.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cabinet-secy-asks-ministries-to-provide-staff-details-by-jan-15.html

The Book maintains that more than 12.90 lakh party workers have been trained following years the Modi Government ascended to power in 2014 and BJP emerged as the “largest party” in the world with about 11 crore members.

Training programme assumed particular significance with the coming of Amit Shah as Party President who launched a nation-wide training programme on the birth centenary of its ideologue Deendayal Upadhyaya in 2015.

According to the 208-page book put together by the party’s training cell and titled ‘Training for a new India’ - it captures a variety of programmes organised from mandal to district, State and national level by the BJP to train and reorient party workers on its ideology from 2015 onwards.

More than 12.90 lakh party workers have been trained since then, the book says. “This programme is also the largest political leadership training programme undertaken anywhere in the world,” it said.

121,13-1-20,Green panel defers decision to construct Dhalbhumgarh airport,"A green panel of the Union Environment Ministry has deferred its decision on the Airport Authority of India’s (AAI) proposal to construct a greenfield domestic airport in Dhalbhumgarh, 60 km away steel city Jamshedpur in Jharkhand, questioning its feasibility besides taking exception that the site was a habitat of the large number of elephants.

Situated at Dhalbhumgarh in Ghatshila subdivision, about 60km from the Steel City Jamshedpur, the airport is being built on an abandoned World War II airfield. The airstrip was extensively used by the armed forces during the 1962 and 1971 wars, too.

About 96.761 hectares (239.1 Acres) of reserve forest land will be required for the development of Dhalbhumgarh airport project to be set up at the cost of Rs 100 crore.

Refusing to give go-ahead, the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of the Ministry in a recent meeting has sought details of forest/ecological sensitive areas around the proposed site which falls in the forests which are habitat of large number of elephants. Dalma Wildlife sanctuary is very near to the site. Elephants travel from Dalma to West Bengal through this forest. Every year there are number of man elephant conflict cases in these areas.

The panel also noted that disturbance to the elephant habitat by way of building an airport on their habitat and also by the sound of aeroplanes in the area and traffic movements will result in disturbance in the behavior of elephants resulting in increased human elephant conflict.

“The proposed site is supposed to cater the Jamshedpur town which is 60 km far away from the city. Further, there is an airport at nearby location at Sonari is already existing. On the other side of Jamshedpur is Ranchi which is 120 km away and has a major airport. Jamshedpur is also well connected to Calcutta, which has major airport facility.

“It takes only 4 hours to travel from Jamshedpur to Kolkata by train. In the past Kingfisher, MDLR, and Air Deccan started their flights from Jamshedpur airport at Sonari but could not sustain their operations,” noted the EAC.

It further suggested that creation of an airport at site which is nearer to Jamshedpur town will be better for the people of Jamshedpur. For that a site near the Jamshedpur town may be considered with its pros and cons for building airport.

Now, the EAC has asked the AAI to submit revised pre-feasibility study including proper justification for proposed site as a fair weather airport situated at 60 Km from Jamshedpur city, details of Forest/Ecological Sensitive Areas/Wildlife Sanctuary/Elephant Corridor around the proposed site and ground water study and geo-technical study in the proposed site.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/green-panel-defers-decision-to-construct-dhalbhumgarh-airport.html

123,13-1-20,It’s ploy to divert attention from eco slowdown: Sinha,"Former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha on Sunday said enactment of the “unconstitutional and unnecessary” new citizenship Act was a ploy by the Centre to “divert attention” of people from its “failure” to prevent the economic slowdown.

Addressing a gathering during the course of his “Gandhi Shanti Yatra” here, the former BJP leader quoted former chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian saying that India was facing a “great slowdown with its economy headed for intensive care unit (ICU)”.

“All sections of the society are disenchanted with the functioning of the Government. Those in the government are great experts at diverting attention.

“So, this unconstitutional, unnecessary Act is meant to divert the attention of the youth, farmers, women, so they get involved in opposing this and do not think about their daily difficulties,” Sinha said.

The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which was notified on January 10, grants Indian citizenship to non- Muslim minorities migrated to India Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh till December 31, 2014, following their persecution over their faith.

Massive protests were witnessed against the CAA, mainly by the student community, since its passage by Parliament in December last year.

Opposition parties has been dubbing the CAA an “anti-Muslim” legislation, a charge being debunked by the Government.Sinha said, “The Act was brought in because the economic condition of the country is at present in a great danger”.

The former Finance Minister was in Surat as part of his 3,000-km yatra, which began from Mumbai on January 9, for various demands including repealing the CAA; constituting judicial inquiry into instances of “state-sponsored violence” such as the attack on JNU students, and seeking the government’s assurance in Parliament that nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise will not be carried out.

“The biggest catch of the Act, which is why this can’t be implemented, despite being notified by the Central Government, is that it talks about giving citizenship to persons who have suffered religious persecution or fear of religious persecution,” Sinha told reporters.

“..Where is the evidence of religious persecution? It is in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, but not in India. Will India get proof of this from neighbouring countries?” he asked.

“How will a child prove if their parents or grandparents who migrated here from neighbouring countries are dead? This Act cannot be truly implemented because it is unconstitutional, with an artificial cut-off date, is based on religion, and is impractical,” he added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/it---s-ploy-to-divert-attention-from-eco-slowdown--sinha.html

Such kites were also distributed to people on the occasion. The festival was organised at Agrawal college and was participated by the party’s state president Satish Poonia, Jaipur MP Ramcharan Bohra, former BJP’s state unit president Ashok Parnami and others.

The law excludes Muslims.

Those opposing the law contend that it discriminates on the basis of religion and violates the Constitution. They also allege that the CAA along withe the NRC is intended to target the Muslim community in India.

However, the central government has dismissed the allegations, maintaining that the law is intended to give citizenship to the persecuted people from the three neighbouring countries and not to take away citizenship from anyone.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-holds-kite-festival-in-support---of-act-in-jaipur.html
132,13-1-20,Demolition drive against four Kochi illegal flats completed,"Sending a strong message to violators of environmental norms, the Supreme Court ordered demolition drive against four illegal waterfront apartment complexes here was completed on Sunday with the last two high rises pulled down using controlled implosion method.

In perhaps the first of its kind drive in the country against illegal residential high risses, the four concrete colossuses housing nearly 350 flats were reduced to piles of rubble in seconds one after another over the last two days.

Ernakulam District Collector S Suhas and Kochi Police Commissioner Vijay Sakhare said the demolition drive was successful and said everything went as planned.

Explosives, weighing totally nearly 750 kgs, were used in a controlled manner to bring down the lakeside structures in Maradu, eight months after the apex court ordered their demolition for violation of the Coastal Regulation Zone norms.

The Kerala Government stuck to its time line of 138 days given to the Supreme Court in September last year as the meticulously planned operation was successfully carried out in a precise manner amid tight security and after people in the neighbourhood were evacuated as a precautionary measure.

Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was imposed in the evacuation zone of 200 metre radius from 8 am to 4 pm on both days to ensure there was no movement in the area.

The Government, which made it clear that it will implement the court orders, had managed to evict the owners of the flat, who staged protests, saying they had invested their hard earned money in buying the flats. The Supreme Court had ordered payment of Rs 25 lakh as interim compensation.

On the eve of the demolitions, one of the owners had said: “It is injustice done by a State against its citizens. The Government is responsible for this situation.”

The drive was completed at around 2.30 pm on Sunday with the demolition of the 55-meter high “Golden Kayaloram” building, the smallest among the four complexes, after an about half-an-hour delay due to some technical reasons, official sources said.

Earlier in the day, “Jain Coral Cove”, which is also 55 meters high, was brought down at around 11.03 am.

On Saturday, two complexes — H2O Holy Faith and the twin towers of Alfa Serene — abutting the backwaters were destroyed in the similar implosion method in which explosives filled in the structures blasted in a controlled manner.

Areas in the 200 metre radius of the buildings were kept out of bounds for people and all kinds of traffic during their demolition.

In a precise sequence, explosives filled in the structures were blasted in a controlled manner at the end of the third warning siren.

The towering buildings that took several months to build and had housed 100s of families collapsed inwards into a pile of rubble like a house of cards in seconds, triggering mammoth ‘clouds’ of dust.

Just in a few seconds, the towering buildings, whose interior walls had been removed in pre-demolition work over the past weeks leaving them concrete shells, became mounds of debris.

Following the blasts, clouds of dust billowed out around the wreckage, enveloping nearby spectators.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/demolition-drive-against-four-kochi-illegal-flats-completed.html
133,13-1-20,"35 Sena MLAs in Maha unhappy, may switch to BJP: Rane","Former Chief Minister and BJP leader Narayan Rane on Sunday made a sensational claim that as many as 35 out of 65 ruling Shiv Sena MLAs were “unhappy” with Sena president Uddhav Thackeray’s leadership and indicated that these disgruntled MLAs might switch over to his party leading to change in Government in the State.

Talking to media persons on the sidelines of a function at Thane, Rane — a long-time bête noire of Uddhav — hinted at the possibility of the BJP coming back to power in the state with the support of the support of the “disgruntled” Shiv Sena MLAs.

“Thirty five of 65 Shiv Sena MLAs are unhappy with Uddhav Thackeray... The BJP has 105 MLAs, while 35 Sena MLAs are unhappy,” Rane said, thus indicating these “disgruntled” MLAs would switch sides and help the BJP muster numbers to form a Government in the State.

Rane’s claim should be seen in the light of theoretical possibility that with the addition of 35 MLAs, the BJP’s strength will go up to 140, five MLAs short of a simple majority of 145 in the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly which is not difficult to muster.

Though there is some resentment within the Shiv Sena over the denial of ministerial berths, there are not many takers for Rane’s claim for three reasons. First, the figure of disgruntled Sena MLAs suggested by Rane is unbelievably high. Secondly, Rane is known for making tall claims which have in the past fallen flat on his face. Thirdly, the Sena leadership is in the process of keeping its disgruntled MLAs in good humour through chairmanships of state-run corporations.

Looking from a different perspective, is Rane’s claim that 35 Sena MLAs might switch sides an indication that the BJP intends to undertake Operation “Kamala” in the State?

Rane, meanwhile, charged that Uddhav had absolutely no idea on how to run a Government. “Since he does not know how to run a Government, people are not expecting anything from the MVA Government. It took him (Uddhav) five weeks to form a government. From this, you can gauge his ability or otherwise to run a Government”.

Rane, who is currently a Rajya Sabha MP, said that Uddhav had failed to implement his promise of farm loan waiver. “We do not know as to when farm loan waiver decision will be implemented. When the Chief Minister went to Marathwada recently, people there expected him to come out with a development package for the region. He returned without announcing any package or financial relief to the region. That speaks for itself how things are moving in the new Government”.

When his attention was drawn to the recent meeting between former chief minister and senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis and MNS chief Raj Thackeray and if there was a possibility of a tie-up between the two parties, Rane evaded a direct reply and said: “On this ( the issue of a possible alliance between the two parties), senior BJP leaders will speak”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/35-sena-mlas-in-maha-unhappy--may-switch-to-bjp--rane.html
134,13-1-20,"Respect for all religions inherent in Indian blood, says Naidu","Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday said respect for all religions was inherent “in the Indian blood” and asserted secularism does not mean ‘insult’ or appeasement of one particular faith.

For a long time, India has sheltered persecuted persons and given refuge to many, Naidu said at an event here to mark the centenary of Sri Ramakrishna Vijayam, a Tamil monthly of Sri Ramakrishna Math.

Speaking on the occasion coinciding with the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda, Naidu said people should forever remember him and propogate his teachings and preachings “which are eternal for the betterment of mankind.”

Hailing the guru as a “great saint, teacher and social reformer,” he said Swami Vivekananda played a major role in introducing Hinduism to the West. “He was a social reformer and was against religious dogmas and believed in the uplift of humanity irrespective of caste or creed and emphasised that spiritualism is important for the survival of mankind,” Naidu said.

“Swami Vivekananda stressed on the importance of spirituality. India, in a way is the spiritual guru for the entire world. People look to India for solace, guidance and spiritualism,” he added.

Quoting from Vivekananda, he said the Swamiji was proud that he belonged to a religion “that has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance.”

“...The only religion which says all religions are true. That is the greatness, that is the beauty of this religion (Hinduism),” he said. Swami Vivekananda also said he belonged to a nation which has sheltered the persecuted and the refugees of all nations of the earth, Naidu said.

“Now also we are ready to accept those who are persecuted though some people are trying to make it controversial and all,” he said in an apparent reference to the Opposition to the NDA Government’s controversial Citizenship Amendment Act.

“That is our culture, our heritage. This is what our forefathers have told us,” the Vice President added.

The CAA envisages providing Indian citizenship to persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

Today there was more than ever a need to bring down the walls that create differences among the people and “we follow sarvadharma samabhavana,” or respect for all religions, he said.

“It is there in our Indian blood. People now talk about secularism, constitution. Constitution came later, but the Indian blood — sarvadharma samabhavana — respect for all religions (existed already),” Naidu said.

From time immemorial, people have come from outside and have been given shelter, he said, adding different religions also came to India and were respected “because we believe every religion is important and sarvadharma samabhavana is the essence of our civilisation.”

Without naming anyone, he said some people had some kind of an “allergy” towards the word Hindu.

“There are some people in this country who have some allergy towards this word called Hindu. We can’t help them and they have got every right to have that view. But they are not right,” he said.

On the International Yoga Day, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had made efforts to take it to the UN following which it was now being practiced in many countries.

In a possible reference to critics of the Prime Minister, he said “yoga is for your body, not because of Modi,” and urged one and all to do it for one’s own good.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/respect-for-all-religions-inherent-in-indian-blood--says-naidu.html

“It is unfortunate that the youth today want to settle in foreign countries by getting caught in the false idea of modernism and forgetting our culture and religion.

They should give up this obsession, stay here and serve the country, he said.

The Chief Minister was addressing school and college students at Kanteerava Stadium during the celebration of Hindu religious scholar and philosopher Swami Vivekanandas birth anniversary here. The Chief Minister said Indians settled abroad should treat their visit back home as a pilgrimage and have faith in the religious beliefs.

He also appealed to the youth to follow Swami Vivekanandas path of sacrifice, service and nationalism.

Recalling the hard times he went through during his school days, Yediyurappa said he used to sell vegetables and lemons to earn some money for his family.

...But today with the blessings of 6.5 crore people I am standing before you as a four-time Chief Minister. I grew to such a stature because I followed the footsteps of noble people, the Chief Minister said.

139,13-1-20,"‘Are we not citizens,’ asks Kolkata’s ‘Shaheen Bagh’ as protests continue","Protests in the city against the amended Citizenship Act has broadened the outlook of many people who had stopped interacting with their friends from other communities over recent socio-political developments in the country.

One among them is Muzaffar Ali, a garments trader from Beniapukur area, who had felt hesitant to discuss with his friends from other communities about certain “sensitive issues” and “felt ostracised”.

Ali, in his 40s, now participates in anti-CAA rallies and an indefinite demonstration by women in Park Circus area, being touted as Kolkata’s ‘Shaheen Bagh’, against the new citizenship law.

The businessman, who participated in one such rally at Zakaria Street recently, said he discovered a new side of the city, as strangers from other communities, many of them in their youth, turned up in droves at protests against the contentious law.

“From bright young boys and girls to social activists, writers and artistes, many people have assembled at a protest site in Park Circus and are giving speeches from a makeshift podium. This is a spontaneous, apolitical movement against CAA and NRC,” Ali told PTI on Sunday.

Ali said he had never participated in similar rallies with people of other communities in the past.

“The outpour has made me realise the love and bonding among people and I have started to open up. My two school- going sons have told their friends from other communities that they will never part ways,” he said.

Around 30 women have been staging a sit-in protest against CAA, the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR) in Park Circus since January 7 on the lines of the Shaheen Bagh protest, mainly led by Muslim women, in Delhi.

Nirufa Khatoon, one of the protesters, said, “I was born here. My grandfather was born here. During partition, my predecessors had opted to stay back in India as it is our motherland.”

“But now, I am afraid that the BJP wants to take my right to live in my city. Are we not citizens of this country?” she said, vowing not to withdraw the stir till the Centre takes concrete steps to revoke CAA, NRC and NPR.

Another woman participant, Sabina said, “After several discussions, we had decided to begin the sit-in as the Muslim women, of all generations, expressed eagerness to take part in a dharna when our male family members were already out on the streets. Ours will be a peaceful protest.”

Also present in the sit-in was Moutusi Banerjee, a former Calcutta University alumna who is working with a production house.

“I had first participated in a rally from Sealdah to Esplanade where thousands of people had raised slogans against CAA, NRC and NPR. Since then, I had been planning to join the Park Circus protest and finally, I am here,” she said.

The women agitators have been joined by Ali and other men of the locality including Firoz Islam, a fruit-seller by profession.

“It has become my duty to be on the side of those who have left behind their work for a greater cause. I cannot stop my business as my earning depends on it. But, I can express my solidarity,” Islam said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---are-we-not-citizens-----asks-kolkata---s----shaheen-bagh----as-protests-continue.html
140,13-1-20,Thousands join protest in Mumbai,"Thousands of citizens on Sunday congregated in Mumbai’s suburban Jogeshwari to oppose the new citizenship law, the proposed NRC and NPR.

They also condemned last Sunday’s violence on the JNU campus in Delhi, where masked men ran riot and attacked students. Leftist organisations had claimed RSS-affiliated ABVP’s role in the attack, a charge denied by the students’ body.

Former Tata Institute of Social Science (TISS) general secretary Fahad Ahmed told PTI that they assembled under the aegis of ‘Hum Bharat Ke Log’ in Millat Nagar area.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi should call 56 students from across the country to debate on the CAA, NRC and NPR,” Ahmed said in an apparent jibe at Modi’s “56 inch chest” remark, which the latter had made ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.

“Why the PM is not talking to us? Why is he not communicating? Even the Britishers used to talk to Indians whom they ruled, but our PM is not talking to poor people,” he alleged.

Bollywood actor Sushasht Singh also spoke on the occasion. “We are people of this country and such acts (CAA) are tarnishing the image of our country,” he said.

At the gathering, people waved banners with slogans like “I Am From Gujarat, My Documents Burned in 2002”, “No CAA, Boycott NRC, Stop Dividing India, Don’t Divide us”, “Save Constitution”, written on them.

A large number of police personnel were present at the venue.

The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which was notified on January 10, grants Indian citizenship to non-Muslim minorities migrated to India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh till December 31, 2014, following persecution over their faith.

Massive protests were against the CAA, mainly by the student community, since its passage by Parliament in December last year. Opposition parties have been dubbing the CAA an “anti-Muslim” legislation, a charge being debunked by the Government.

Speaking at a protest rally organised by ‘We the Citizens of India’ in Nagpur, Deshmukh said, “In Maharashtra, we have our Government and though the laws are made by the Central government, whether it will be implemented or not is in the hands of State Government”.

The Centre had issued a gazette notification announcing that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), under which non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan will be given Indian citizenship, will come into force from January 10.

The CAA was passed by Parliament on December 11.

Maharashtra Energy Minister Nitin Raut of Congress, who also took part in the rally, said the State would not implement the CAA.

“However, much they (Centre) may try, the Maharashtra Government will not allow this law (CAA) to be implemented in the state,” Raut said.

The new Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government comprises the Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress.

Home Minister Deshmukh further said that leaders like NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi had opposed divisive moves like CAA, National Register of Citizens and National Population Register in Parliament.

In a swipe at the BJP, Deshmukh said, “Some powers having majority in Parliament are doing this work, the people who were never seen during the freedom struggle.

The Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) was closed early for winter vacations from December 16, a day after students clashed with police during a protest against the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) on campus.

The university was to reopen on January 6 but the vacation was extended owing to persisting tension over the changes in the citizenship law.

It will reopen in phases starting Monday.

The vice chancellor (VC) has written a letter to the state authorities, including the director general of police and the home secretary, asking for extra security for himself and his family in view of threats posed by “lumpen elements and outsiders, including some rusticated students,” the sources said.

The letter, which was marked as ‘secret’, has somehow been leaked in the media, they said.

Later, Mansoor said in a statement that he has no problem if “students exercise their democratic rights by holding peaceful protests” against any legislation which is rankling them.

His concerns, the VC said, were regarding those people who might mingle with the students and give a violent turn to the peaceful agitation.

“The threat perception pertains to elements from outside the campus and does not refer to the students. The VC faces no danger from his students, whom he considers his sons and daughters,” AMU spokesperson Shafey Kidwai told PTI.

“We are all participating in this rally as common citizens...Everyone here is supportive of the Centre’s action to grant citizenship to the oppressed minorities fleeing Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan,” senior BJP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh told reporters.

He alleged that “anti-nationals” are behind the violence in the country over the Act. “Indian Muslims are pro-nationalist like any other citizen of the country but Pakistan, Congress and communists launched a falsehood campaign to mislead the Muslims.”

“The CAA is not against taking away the citizenship of any Indian citizen but is meant to give citizenship to the minorities who are oppressed and are facing Jihadi terrorism in the three neighbouring Islamic countries,” he said.

Another senior BJP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Kavinder Gupta also accused opposition parties of misleading the students of the universities on the CAA pointing out that there is a need for aggressive campaigning in the country to educate the people about the reality of the Act.

He said the government-owned undertakings like AFT Mill and other concerns were defunct what with serious losses they had suffered over the last few years.

Saminathan said the charges Dhanavelou had made against his own party government are 'too serious to be ignored' and this only exposed lack of majority for the government.

“The Chief Minister should prove his governmentRs s majority in the backdrop of the allegations of malpractices Dhanavelou had made,” the BJP leader said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-to-pondy-cm--prove-majority-via-special-assembly-session.html
148,13-1-20,Navy introduces superior quality fuel for its platforms,"The Indian Navy on Monday started using a new and superior category of high speed diesel which is expected to boost reliability of key platforms and their performance besides reducing carbon footprint.

Indian Navy officials said the use of high flash high speed diesel (HFHSD – IN 512) with revised technical specifications would also help the force to ensure interoperability in operations with leading foreign navies.

""Successful introduction of the new fuel is a landmark occasion highlighting the enormous potential which exists within the country to produce world class products,"" the Navy said in a statement.

In the last few months, the Indian Navy in collaboration with Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) carried out an extensive and thorough study on the new fuel before deciding to introduce it.

The officials said a comparative evaluation of existing international regulations were also examined zeroing on the specification of the fuel.

""As an outcome, a revised technical specification was arrived at consisting of 22 test parameters including critical parameters cetane number, flash point, sulphur content, sediment content and oxidation stability,"" said an official.

""The new specification will not only ensure a better quality fuel but also result in a reduced carbon footprint,"" he said.

The Navy said the ""achievement"" would also mark a new high with quality fuel available to all foreign Navy ships at Indian ports during exercises with the Indian Navy.

""This revolutionary initiative would go a long way in enhancing equipment reliability, performance, reduced carbon footprint, emissions and more importantly would be key enabler in the Navy's 'Mission Based Deployment' on a global scale,"" it said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/navy-introduces-superior-quality-fuel-for-its-platforms-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/navy-introduces-superior-quality-fuel-for-its-platforms.html
149,13-1-20,Non-life insurers to get capital dose soon,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman may announce second-round capital infusion for public sector general insurance companies in the upcoming Budget to improve their financial health.

The Government infused Rs 2,500 crore in the three insurers - National Insurance, Oriental Insurance and United India Insurance - through first supplementary demands for grants for 2019-20 last month.

However, these companies would require additional Rs 10,000-12,000 crore capital dose to meet the prescribed solvency margin, sources said.

The sources further said that announcement to this effect can be made in the Budget 2020-21 that is scheduled on February 1.

Infusion will not only improve their financial health but facilitate merger announced in the Budget 2018-19.

In the Budget 2018-19 speech, then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had announced that the three companies would be merged into a single insurance entity.

However, the process of merger could not be completed due to various reasons, including poor financial health of these companies. According to the sources, after the merger, the combined entity will be listed on the bourses.

Initial estimates suggest that the combined entity formed by merging the three insurers will be the largest non-life insurance company in India, valued at Rs 1.2-1.5 lakh crore.

As on March 31, 2017, the three companies together had more than 200 insurance products with a total premium of Rs 41,461 crore and a market share of around 35 per cent.

Their combined net worth was Rs 9,243 crore, with total employee strength of around 44,000 spread over 6,000 offices.

The initial plan was to bring the fuel through Chinese ports but it could not be materialised, sources said, adding that the Centre is trying to bring coal through Russia's Vostochny Port which is known for handling the commodity.

Pradhan, who holds the portfolios of Steel Ministry and Petroleum and Natural Gas, said, ""We have also initiated talks on behalf of the Indian Government with the Russian authorities and signed a memorandum of understanding for cooperation for undertaking coking coal ventures.""

Lalu Hanuman has claimed 70,000 pounds (USD 91,451) in damages after being falsely accused of ""theft for walking away with an unpaid bar of chocolate"".

He was on his way to a concert when he bought the 1.05 pounds (USD 1.37) bar of vegan chocolate and paid for it at the self-service till.

Hanuman threw the receipt in the bin and made his way out of the Tesco Express store in the Russell Square area of central London.

According to The Sunday Times, he claims to have been stopped by the store's security guard who falsely accused him of not paying and then forcibly moved him back into the shop.Hanuman claims the incident resulted in his kidney stones being dislodged.

Tesco admitted that the chocolate had been paid for and explained the confusion over an inadvertent double-swipe of the barcode by the lawyer, who had required some assistance while using the self-service checkout till.

153,13-1-20,Farm loan write-offs touch Rs 4.7 lakh cr in last 10 years,"Various states have cumulatively written off a whopping Rs 4.7 lakh crore of farm loans in the past one decade, which is 82 per cent of the industry-level bad loans, according to a report.

In FY19, farm loan NPAs jumped to 12.4 per cent or at 1.1 lakh crore of the Rs 8,79,000 crore of total bad loans in the system, up from Rs 48,800 crore or 8.6 per cent of the total NPAs of Rs 5,6,6,620 crore in FY16, the report by SBI Research said.

""Even though agriculture NPA was only Rs 1.1 lakh crore or 12.4 per cent of the overall NPAs in FY19, if we accounted for Rs 3.14 lakh crore worth of farm loan waivers announced in the last decade, agri NPAs/burden for the exchequer/banks could be as much as staggering Rs 4.2 lakh crore and if the latest Rs 45,000-51,000 crore of write-offs announced by Maharashtra (second in three years) this it could be at Rs 4.7 lakh crore which is 82 per cent of the industry level NPAs,"" the report claimed.

It can be noted that since FY15, ten of the largest states announced farm loan waivers worth Rs 3,00,240 crore to alleviate the indebtedness of farmers and the spate of suicides. If the numbers announced by the Centre under Manmohan Singh regime in FY08 is counted, this goes up to around Rs 4 lakh crore. Of this, over Rs 2 lakh crore have been made since 2017.

In FY15 Andhra announced to write off farm loans worth Rs 24,000 crore, in the same year Telengana too did so involving Rs 17,000 crore. FY17 saw Tamil Nadu announcing write-offs of Rs 5,280 crore.

154,13-1-20,Foreign envoys' visit to J&K important step: US,"The State Department has described the recent visit of envoys of 15 countries, including that of the US, to Jammu & Kashmir as an “important step” but expressed concern over the continued detention of political leaders and restrictions on internet in the region.

The restrictions were imposed on August 5 last when India abrogated the Article 370 that gave special powers to Jammu & Kashmir, and bifurcated the state into two Union Territories.

In the first such trip by foreign diplomats post August 5, envoys of 15 countries, including the US Ambassador to India, Kenneth Juster, last week visited Jammu and Kashmir where they interacted with select political representatives, civil society members as well as top military brass with the Indian Government rejecting criticism that it was a “guided tour”.

Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Alice Wells, who will be travelling to South Asia this week, on Saturday expressed hope that the region will return to normalcy.

“Closely following @USAmbIndia & other foreign diplomats' recent trip to Jammu & Kashmir. Important step. We remain concerned by detention of political leaders and residents, and Internet restrictions. We look forward to a return to normalcy,” she said in a tweet.

Wells will travel to New Delhi from January 15-18 to attend the Raisina Dialogue. She will also meet with senior Government officials to advance the US-India strategic global partnership following the success of the 2019 US-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue, and will discuss topics of mutual interest with members of the business community and civil society.

From New Delhi, Wells will fly to Islamabad where she will meet with Pakistan's top officials and members of civil society to discuss issues of bilateral and regional concern.

Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for withdrawing Jammu & Kashmir's special status.

Reacting sharply to India's decision, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian high commissioner.

India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was its internal matter. It also advised Pakistan to accept the reality and stop all anti-India propaganda.

The External Affairs Ministry (MEA), which facilitated the visit of the envoys, said in New Delhi that the objective was to show first hand efforts made by the Centre to normalise the situation”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/foreign-envoys--visit-to-j-k-important-step--us.html

156,13-1-20,"PM renames KoPT after Syama Prasad Mookerjee, draws criticism from Opp","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday rechristened Kolkata Port Trust after Jan Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee, drawing criticism from the Opposition camp, which said he was more of a “name-changer” than a “game-changer”.

Modi, while addressing the 150th anniversary programme of Kolkata Port Trust, invoked Mookerjee and BR Ambedkar and said their contributions had led to the development of the country post Independence, but suggestions made by them were not implemented after they resigned from the Government.

“I announce that the Kolkata Port Trust will now be known as Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port. He was the father of industrialisation in India, a man who made sacrifices for one nation and one Constitution,” Modi said, while addressing the ceremony at Netaji Indoor Stadium here.

Hinting at a change of guard in 2021 Assembly polls, he said the West Bengal Government was not implementing central schemes as it did not help “syndicates” (cartels), but people in this state would not have to miss out on the benefits for long.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who was scheduled to attend the port trust programme, was conspicuous by her absence. None of the Trinamool Congress ministers were also present at the event.

“When there is no syndicate or cut money involved, why would someone implement Central Government schemes? I don't know whether they (state government) would give approval for central schemes such as Ayushman Bharat Yojana, PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, but if they do, people of Bengal will be able to enjoy their benefits,” he said.

The Prime Minister also claimed that he was pained to see that the poor in the State was not getting the benefits of the Centre's welfare schemes.

“Eight crore farmers across the country are getting benefited (due to the central schemes). But there will always be pain in my heart (about the schemes not being implemented in Bengal). I will always pray to god for the welfare of farmers and poor patients. May god give them (Bengal Government) good sense...

“However, I have a feeling that the people of West Bengal will not remain deprived of central schemes for long,” he insisted.

Modi, who released a commemorative stamp on the occasion, said his Government at the Centre was making every possible effort to develop Bengal, its poor, underprivileged and exploited sections.

He also inaugurated and laid foundation of infrastructure projects for the expansion and modernisation of the Kolkata Port.

“Development of waterways has improved Kolkata Port Trust's connectivity with industrial centres in east India, made trade easier for our neighbouring countries, Bhutan, Myanmar and Nepal.

“Our country's coasts are gateways to development, the (central) Government has started the Sagarmala programme to improve connectivity,” Modi added.

Criticising the prime minister's move to rename the port, CPI(M) politburo member Mohammed Salim said Modi had turned into a “name-changer” rather than being a “game- changer”, contrary to what the saffron camp had claimed when it came to power in 2014. “When Narendra Modi came to power, we thought his Government will be a game-changer. Now we see that the Government is more of a name-changer.

This name-changing, however, will not have any material impact on the port's performance,” Salim said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pm-renames-kopt-after-syama-prasad-mookerjee--draws-criticism-from-opp.html

The incident happened at Padam Chowk area when BJP workers from six Assembly constituencies of the district took out the procession in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

“Some anti-social elements pelted stones on a procession of the BJP. Few policemen and some of those participating in the rally suffered minor injuries, forcing police to use teargas to bring the situation under control,” Superintendent of Police Surendra Jha said.

Giridih's Deputy Commissioner (DC) Rahul Kumar Sinha reached the spot and is camping there, along with the SP. Taking part in the rally, former BJP state unit president Ravindra Rai told reporters that the CAA was not against any citizen of India.

The BJP, an ally of the JD(U) headed by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, got rankled by the commendation of the Opposition party by the former election strategist.

The saffron party came out with a statement criticising “over intelligent and super knowledgeable people” for their propaganda on NRC and asserted that the CAA was passed in Parliament with JD(U)'s support and “it will be implemented in all concerned states, including Bihar”.

“I join my voice with all to thank #Congress leadership for their formal and unequivocal rejection of #CAA-NRC. Both @rahulgandhi & @priyankagandhi deserve special thanks for their efforts on this count,” Kishor tweeted reacting to the Congress Working Committee (CWC) resolution.

The CWC has demanded that the CAA be withdrawn and the process of NPR stopped forthwith, accusing the BJP-led Government at the Centre of using its brute majority to impose a “divisive and discriminatory” agenda.

Forty two-year-old Kishor, whose first claim to fame was the management of Narendra Modi's election campaign in 2014, said, “Also would like to reassure to all — Bihar mein CAA-NRC laagu nahin hoga (CAA-NRC will not be implemented in Bihar)”.

Kishor had joined the JD(U) in September 2018 as a full-time member and has been elevated to the post of national vice president of the party.

His relationship with the BJP has remained uneasy since the 2014 Lok Sabha polls after which he has offered his professional services to parties like the Congress (in UP and Punjab), Trinamool Congress (West Bengal) and the Aam Aadmi Party (Delhi) — all bitterly opposed to the saffron party.

Kishor's recent tirades against his party for supporting the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill and his vociferous opposition to NPR and NRC had raised the hackles of the BJP.

The saffron party's Bihar unit spokesperson Nikhil Anand came out with a statement in response, dripping with sarcasm but without mentioning Kishor by name.

“Some over intelligent and super knowledgeable people are creating propaganda on NRC. But the fact is that there is no initiative by the central Government on the issue. We thank the PM, the HM for bringing such much-needed legislation of CAA.

“We appreciate the support of our NDA allies including CM Nitish Kumar Ji in passing the Bill in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. The CAA will be implemented in all the concerned states including Bihar and there is no question on this matter. Bihar Government has already notified start of the NPR in May 2020,” Anand said.

India's exclusive economic zone in the seas along its 7,500-kilometre coastline comprises over 2 million square kilometres, he said.

""With a target of becoming a $5 trillion economy by 2024, we are looking at over $250 billion coming from the maritime zone.

""It is this $250 billion economy that the ICG has the responsibility to protect and safeguard,"" Kumar said after commissioning coast guard ships 'ICGS Amrit Kaur' and 'ICGS Annie Besant' which will be deployed along the eastern coast.

The maritime economy constitutes nearly five per cent of the world economy, he said.

With the depletion of land resources, economic activities are increasingly getting focussed on the oceans, Kumar said.

Describing the coast guard as the sentinels of the country's seas, the Defence secretary said it is reassuring to witness the force's growing strength.

Commissioning the two ICG fast patrol vessels designed and manufactured by the Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers Ltd (GRSE) here, Kumar said India is increasingly becoming self-reliant in the science of shipbuilding.""Most of our ships today are over 70 per cent indigenous and some of the latest platforms are over 90 per cent indigenous,"" he said.

Kumar said that being the fourth largest coast guard in the world, ICG has performed credibly in protecting the country's maritime zones and also in preventing the plunder of its wealth in the oceans.

The challenges and complexities of maritime security are no less than those of land territories and air space, he said.Kumar said that the hands of ICG have been further strengthened by providing legal powers for visiting, boarding, searching and seizing vessels in the country's high seas.

He said the ICG, along with the Indian Navy, has the onerous responsibility of ensuring that maritime zones of India remain safe and secure not only to ensure economic progress but also to counter dynamic security challenges emanating from the sea.

""Incidents like 26/11 Mumbai terror attack have made it incumbent upon all agencies, be it ICG, Navy, marine police and all other stakeholders to synergise resources and also to make greater use of technology in the interest of the country,"" he said.The Defence secretary lauded the ICG for organising awareness and

community welfare programmes along the coastline for fishermen and other local residents, making the general population equal stakeholders in security issues.

ICG Director General K Natarajan said that coastal surveillance has substantially increased since 26/11.

""We now have 145 ships, which will go up to 200 vessels by 2025, while 16 new advanced light helicopters will be added (to the arsenal) apart from the 62 surveillance aircraft that are already in service,"" Natarajan said.

He said that out of the present inventory, 30 to 40 ships and 10 to 12 aircraft are deployed every day.

162,13-1-20,Trump warns Iran against ‘massacre’,"US President Donald Trump has said that the United States was monitoring Iranian demonstrations closely, warning against any new “massacre” as protests broke out after Tehran admitted to shooting down a passenger plane.

Iran said earlier it unintentionally downed a Ukrainian jetliner outside Tehran, killing all 176 people aboard, in an abrupt about-turn after initially denying Western claims it was struck by a missile.

The firing came shortly after Iran launched missiles at bases in Iraq housing American forces.

President Hassan Rouhani said a military probe into the tragedy had found “missiles fired due to human error” brought down the Boeing 737, calling it an “unforgivable mistake.”

At a student protest to pay tribute to the crash victims on Saturday, Iranian authorities briefly detained Britain’s ambassador, in what the British Government called a violation of international law. He was later released.

Trump told Iranians — in tweets in both English and Farsi — that he stands by them and is monitoring the demonstrations.

“To the brave, long-suffering people of Iran: I’ve stood with you since the beginning of my Presidency, and my Administration will continue to stand with you,” he tweeted.

“There can not be another massacre of peaceful protesters, nor an internet shutdown. The world is watching,” he added, apparently referring to an Iranian crackdown on street protests that broke out in November.

“We are following your protests closely, and are inspired by your courage,” he said.

The new demonstrations follow an Iranian crackdown on street protests that broke out in November. Amnesty International has said it left more than 300 people dead.

Internet access was reportedly cut off in multiple Iranian provinces ahead of memorials planned a month after the protests.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has demanded that Iran provide “full clarity” on the downing of the plane. Ottawa says the dead included 57 Canadians.

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also offered his condolences and ordered the armed forces to address “shortcomings” so that such a disaster does not happen again.

Tehran’s acknowledgement came after officials in Iran denied for days Western claims that the Ukraine International Airlines plane had been struck by a missile in a catastrophic error.

The Kiev-bound jet slammed into a field shortly after taking off from Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport on Wednesday.

The crash came hours after Tehran launched missiles at bases hosting American forces in Iraq in response to the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike.

Fears grew of an all-out war between Iran and its arch-enemy the United States, but those concerns have subsided after Trump said Tehran appeared to be standing down after targeting the US bases.

On Saturday evening, police dispersed students who had converged on Amir Kabir University in Tehran to pay tribute to the victims, after some among the hundreds gathered shouted “destructive” slogans, Fars news agency said.

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said UK envoy Rob Macaire had been detained.

“The arrest of our ambassador in Tehran without grounds or explanation is a flagrant violation of international law,” Raab said in a statement. The US called on Iran to apologize.

Iran’s Tasnim News Agency, which is close to the country’s conservatives, said the envoy had been “provoking radical acts” among students. He was released a few hours later and would be summoned again by Iranian officials on Sunday, it said.

State television reported that students shouted “anti-regime” chants, while Fars reported that posters of Soleimani had been torn down.

The aerospace commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards accepted full responsibility for Wednesday’s accident.

But Brigadier General Amirali Hajizadeh said the missile operator acted independently, targeting the 737 after mistaking it for a “cruise missile”.

The operator failed to obtain approval from his superiors because of disruptions to a communications system, he said.

163,13-1-20,Top Iran Guard briefs Parl over downed jet after protest,"Iran’s top Guards commander briefed parliament on Sunday, a day after the armed forces said a Ukrainian airliner was shot down in error in an admission that sparked an angry demonstration.

His closed-session testimony comes after the temporary arrest Saturday of Britain’s ambassador to Tehran, Rob Macaire, shortly after he left a vigil for the air disaster victims that turned into a protest.

On the day after the rally at Tehran’s Amir Kabir University, tensions appeared to be mounting again on the streets of the capital, with a heavy police presence notably around the iconic Azadi Square south of the centre.

Riot police armed with water cannon and batons were seen at Amir Kabir, Sharif and Tehran universities as well as Enqelab Square. Around 50 Basij militiamen brandishing paintball guns, potentially to mark protesters to authorities, were also seen near Amir Kabir.

The military acknowledged Saturday that the Ukraine International Airlines plane was mistakenly shot down Wednesday, killing all 176 people aboard, after denying for days Western claims it was downed by a missile.

The majority of those on the Boeing 737, which slammed into a field shortly after take-off from Tehran, were Iranians and Canadians, and many were students.

World leaders welcomed Iran’s admission, but Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and others have also called for a full and transparent investigation.

The Kiev-bound plane was shot down at a time when Iran’s armed forces were on a heightened state of alert after launching a volley of missiles at US troops stationed in Iraqi military bases.

Iran had vowed to exact “severe revenge” for the January 3 US drone strike that killed Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Revolutionary Guards’ foreign operations arm.

The Guards’ top commander, Major General Hossein Salami, briefed parliament about the general’s killing, Iran’s retaliation and the downing of the airliner, semi-official news agency ISNA said.

At the end of the session, speaker Ali Larijani asked the Majles’ security and foreign policy commission to examine the air disaster and how to prevent such incidents from occurring again, ISNA said.

On Saturday, President Hassan Rouhani said a military probe into the tragedy had found “missiles fired due to human error” brought down the Boeing 737.

The Guards’ aerospace commander General Amirali Hajizadeh accepted full responsibility.

In the evening, a memorial at Tehran’s Amir Kabir University in honour of those killed turned into a demonstration that, AFP correspondents said, was attended by hundreds of students.

They shouted “death to liars” and demanded the resignation and prosecution of those responsible for downing the plane and allegedly covering up the accidental action.

Fars news agency said police “dispersed” them as they left the university and blocked streets, causing a traffic jam.

US President Donald Trump warned Iran against cracking down.

“There can not be another massacre of peaceful protesters, nor an internet shutdown. The world is watching,” he tweeted.

“We are following your protests closely, and are inspired by your courage,” Trump said in a comment directed at protesters.

The latest demonstrations follow a crackdown on street violence that erupted across Iran over fuel price hikes in November. Amnesty International has said more than 300 were killed.

Newspapers called for resignations and sackings over the handling of the air disaster.

Sazandegi, a moderate conservative publication, also apologised to its readers for having trusted official sources on the matter.

“Apologise, resign,” said the main headline of the reformist Etemad daily.

“Unforgivable,” said government newspaper Iran, which published all the names of those who died in the air disaster on the image of black plane tail.

Kayhan, a hardline daily, led on the supreme leader’s “strict orders” to follow up on the “painful incident of the plane crash”.

As public anger grew, state television aired interviews with people who it said “have not forgotten everything the Guards have done for the country”.

Britain’s ambassador to Tehran meanwhile took to Twitter to deny he had attended the demonstration before being arrested.

“Can confirm I wasn’t taking part in any demonstrations! Went to an event advertised as a vigil for victims of #PS752 tragedy,” Macaire said, adding he had been detained half an hour after leaving the area.

“Normal to want to pay respects — some of victims were British. I left after 5 mins, when some started chanting,” he tweeted.

The arrest triggered diplomatic protests, with London calling it a violation of international law and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell added his voice to the chorus of condemnation.

“Very concerned about the temporary detention of the UK Ambassador @HMATehran in Iran. Full respect of the Vienna convention is a must.

The EU calls for de-escalation and space for diplomacy,” Borrell tweeted.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/top-iran-guard-briefs-parl-over-downed-jet-after-protest.html
164,13-1-20,Rockets hit Iraq base hosting US troops: Military,"A volley of rockets slammed into an Iraqi airbase north of Baghdad where US forces have been based, wounding four local troops, the Iraqi military said on Sunday.

Its statement said eight Katyusha-type rockets landed on Al-Balad airbase, wounding two Iraqi officers and two airmen.

Al-Balad is the main airbase for Iraq's F-16s, which it bought from the US to upgrade its air capacities.

The base had held a small US Air Force contingent as well as American contractors, but a majority had been evacuated following tensions between the US and Iran over the past two weeks, military sources told AFP.

""About 90 per cent of the US advisers, and employees of Sallyport and Lockheed Martin who are specialised in aircraft maintenance, have withdrawn to Taji and Erbil after threats,"" one of the sources said.

""There are no more than 15 US soldiers and a single plane at al-Balad,"" the source added.

Military bases hosting US troops have been subject to volleys of rocket and mortar attacks in recent months that have mostly wounded Iraqi forces, but also killed one American contractor last month.

That death set off a series of dramatic developments, with the US carrying out strikes against a pro-Iran paramilitary group in Iraq as well as a convoy carrying top Iranian and Iraqi commanders outside Baghdad airport.

Pro-Iran factions in Iraq have vowed revenge for those raids, even as Iran said it had already responded in ""proportion"" by striking another western airbase where US soldiers are located.

Rocket attacks against Baghdad's high-security Green Zone, where the

US and other embassies are based alongside international troops, are still taking place.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/rockets-hit-iraq-base-hosting-us-troops--military.html
165,13-1-20,China slams US for congratulating Tsai on Taiwan election victory,"China on Sunday slammed officials from the US and other countries for congratulating Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen after she was re-elected with a landslide victory in a stunning rebuke of Beijing’s campaign to isolate the self-ruled island.

Tsai, who had pitched herself as a defender of liberal democratic values against an increasingly authoritarian China, secured a record-breaking win in Saturday’s presidential election.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as well as top diplomats from Britain and Japan, issued statements congratulating Tsai and the island’s democratic elections. But Beijing, which views Taiwan as part of its territory, denounced their actions as violating the one-China principle.

“The Chinese side expresses strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to this,” said foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang.

“We oppose any form of official exchange between Taiwan and countries that have established diplomatic relations with China,” he said in a statement. Chinese state media also sought to downplay Tsai’s victory and cast doubt on the legitimacy of her campaign by accusing the Taiwanese leader of “dirty tactics” and cheating.

Tsai and her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) used “dirty tactics such as cheating, repression and intimidation to get votes, fully exposing their selfish, greedy and evil nature”, said official news agency Xinhua in an op-ed Sunday.

Xinhua also accused Tsai of buying votes, and said “external dark forces” were partly responsible for the election results.

Beijing, which has vowed to one day take Taiwan — by force if necessary — loathes Tsai because she refuses to acknowledge the idea that Taiwan is part of “one China”.

China doubled down on its “one-China principle” after Tsai’s victory, with Geng emphasising Sunday that “regardless of what happens in Taiwan, the basic facts won’t change: there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China”.

“The Chinese Government’s position won’t change,” he added in a

statement. Over the last four years, Beijing has ramped

up economic, military and diplomatic pressure on the island, hoping it would scare voters into supporting Tsai’s opposition.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/china-slams-us-for-congratulating-tsai-on-taiwan-election-victory.html
166,13-1-20,"Flights halted, evacuations as Philippine volcano spews ash","Philippine authorities warned Sunday a volcano near the capital Manila could erupt imminently, hours after it sent a massive column of ash skyward that grounded flights and coated towns across the region in fine dust.

Thousands of people living near Taal volcano, a popular tourist attraction set in the centre of a picturesque lake, were evacuated from their homes as it spewed ash, rumbled with earthquakes and lightning exploded above its crest.

A “hazardous explosive eruption is possible within hours to days”, the nation’s seismological agency warned, adding that the ash could pose a risk to aircraft.

Aviation officials ordered a suspension of flights in to and out of the capital’s Ninoy Aquino International Airport, after the ash cloud was reported to have reached 50,000 feet (15,000 metres). Government seismologists recorded magma moving towards the crater of Taal, one of the country’s most active volcanoes located 65 kilometres (40 miles) south of Manila. Taal’s last eruption was in 1977, he added. A kilometre-high column of ash was visible and several volcanic tremors were felt within the vicinity of the volcano, which is popular among tourists for its scenic view.

The local disaster office said it had evacuated over 2,000 residents living on the volcanic island, which lies inside a bigger lake formed by previous volcanic activity. Solidum said officials will also order the evacuation of people living on another island nearby if the situation worsens. “Ash has already reached Manila... It is dangerous to people if they inhale it,” he told AFP. Earthquakes and volcanic activity are not uncommon in the Philippines due to its position on the Pacific “Ring of Fire”, where tectonic plates collide deep below the Earth’s surface.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/flights-halted--evacuations-as-philippine-volcano-spews-ash.html
167,13-1-20,Nepal Parliament meeting postponed for third time over vacant Speaker post,"The Lower House of Nepal’s Parliament was on Sunday postponed for the third time since December over the election of a new Speaker.

Deputy Parliament Speaker Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe announced the postponement of the House of Representatives meeting until January 20.

The postponement, the third since the winter session commenced on December 20, follows the ruling Nepal Communist Party’s (NCP) failure to decide on a speaker candidate.

A secretariat meeting of the ruling party on Saturday had asked Deputy Speaker Tumbahamphe to resign.

But Tumbahamphe turned down the party’s directive to quit, saying she won’t step down until the party makes her the candidate for Parliament Speaker.

The post of Parliament Speaker has remained vacant since Krishna Bahadur Mahara stepped down from the post, following attempt to rape allegation against him on October 7 last year.

The NCP wants to elect a new candidate for the post of speaker and asked Tumbahamphe to resign.

According to Nepal’s Constitution, the Parliament Speaker and Deputy Speaker cannot be from the same party.

Tumbahamphe has alleged “male domination” by the party.

Meanwhile, Opposition Nepali Congress has objected to Deputy Speaker Tumbahamphe’s decision to postpone the Parliament meeting till Monday next week, January 20.

Last month, the meeting was postponed twice as the ruling party could not decide its speaker candidate.

Nepali Congress spokesperson Bishwa Prakash Sharma, in a statement, said the ruling party was holding the House hostage due to its internal dispute.

Nepali Congress has urged the ruling party to begin the procedure to elect the new speaker at the earliest.

Former Parliament Speaker Subhash Nembang and ruling NCP’s Standing Committee member Agni Sapkota are the probable candidates for the speaker post.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/nepal-parliament-meeting-postponed-for-third-time-over-vacant-speaker-post.html

170,13-1-20,Vistara starts phasing out nine Boeing 737,"Tata-SIA joint venture airline Vistara has started phasing out nine Boeing 737 planes, which it had leased after the grounding of Jet Airways, from this month amid induction of the latest batch of A320 neos in the fleet.

The airline is returning two of these nine leased B737 from January and the rest seven will be exited the fleet between 2022-23 as they are on long term lease, a Vistara spokesperson told PTI.

The government has temporarily reallocated as many as many as 488 Jet Airways' slots to Air India, IndiGo, SpiceJet, Vistara, GoAir and AirAsia India to fill the capacity gap in the wake of the airline ceasing operations mid-April last year.

A slot is a specific date and time at which an airline can arrive or depart at an airport.

""Two of our Boeing 737-800NG aircraft are exiting fleet this month as their lease tenure ends. The remaining seven have longer lease duration and most of them will exit fleet between 2022 and 2023,"" a Vistara spokesperson said in response to a PTI query.

The spokesperson also said that by the time Vistara phases out all these leased Boeing planes, it would induct more than 50 narrow-body and wide-body aircraft in its fleet from Airbus and Boeing additionally.

After the Government put a rider that temporary allocation of ex-Jet Airways slots was subject to aircraft induction, Vistara leased nine Boeing 737-800 planes to reportedly secure as many as 110 additional slots of the 488 slots.

Vistara, which is 51 per cent owned by the Tata Group and rest by Singapore Airlines, had placed orders for 50 aircraft, comprising both A320 Neos and A321 Neos for domestic as well as short and medium-haul international operations with deliveries between 2019-2023.

The airline has already taken deliveries of some of the A320 Neos from this order, starting last November.

Besides, the carrier has also bought six Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners for long-haul international operations.

Vistara will start inducting these wide-body planes in the fleet from next month.

173,13-1-20,Auto industry seeks bold fiscal measures in Budget to revive growth,"In middle of a prolonged slowdown, the automobile industry has asked the Government to take bold fiscal measures to revive the sector that has reported its worst-ever sales decline in two decades during 2019, industry sources said.

In the upcoming Union Budget, the auto industry has sought measures, such as reduction in GST rates on vehicles and abolition of duty on import of lithium-ion battery cells, to encourage electric mobility.

The industry, which has been facing a downturn for almost a year now, has also sought an incentive-based scrappage policy and an increase in re-registration charges of vehicles to discourage use of old vehicles.

Sources said that the introduction of BS-VI emission norms is a positive step to reduce emissions significantly but the initiative would lead to an 8-10 per cent increase in vehicle cost, leading to enhanced GST collections for government.

""However, this extra cost would lead to a fall in demand. As a win-win situation, we are requesting the government to consider reducing GST on BS-VI vehicles to 18 per cent from the current 28 per cent from April onwards,"" an industry source said.

The decision-making power for GST reduction lies with the GST Council and not related to the Budget directly but this is an important element for demand revival, he added.

The auto industry is also scrapping duty on import of lithium-ion battery cells so that battery packs can be manufactured locally and progressively cell manufacturing can also be established in the country.

It would also help in reducing cost of electric vehicles and aid in accelerating adoption of green mobility in the country, another source said.

He added that a formal incentive-based scrappage policy with monetary support from the government as well as manufacturers is required to take old vehicles off the roads and generate demand for new vehicles.

""Incentive in the form of 50 per cent tax rebate in GST, road tax and registration charges is proposed,"" the source noted.

The industry has also sought adequate Budget allocation for the Ministry of Urban Development to support state transport undertakings in procuring buses.

""Robust public transportation will reduce the number of vehicles on the road, thereby will reduce pollution and hence positively impact climate change. This would also lead to reviving demand for commercial vehicles which is very much needed in the current economic scenario,"" the source said.

Besides, the industry has asked increase in depreciation rate on passenger vehicle and two-wheelers to 25 per cent to have depreciation aligned to real useful life of the vehicle.

Similarly, it has asked the government to permanently withdraw the proposed hike in the vehicle registration fee as a higher fee would further impact the demand negatively.

""Besides, we are seeking income tax benefits on the interest part of vehicle loan to be provided to individuals purchasing green vehicles,"" the source noted.

The automobile industry recorded its worst-ever sales decline in two decades in 2019, with an unprecedented slowdown hampering vehicle offtake across segments.

According to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) last week, all vehicle segments reported de-growth last year as low consumer sentiments, weak rural demand and economic slowdown took toll on demand.

Overall wholesale of vehicles during the year across categories, including passenger vehicles, two-wheelers and commercial vehicles, saw a decline of 13.77 per cent in 2019 at 2,30,73,438 units as against 2,67,58,787 units in 2018. This is the worst fall in sales since the industry body started recording monthly and yearly sales data in 1997.

176,13-1-20,No strings attached,"Whether it be clothes, cars, furniture or gadgets, consumers are opening up to the idea of renting rather than buying them, says Sakshi Sharma

A stressed economy doesn’t mean that you have to compromise your lifestyle choices. You can still wear designer clothes, swank up your home and get a fancy car without buying them. Simply rent them. The millennial way of life is all about putting your money in the right places, with no strings attached. Or so it seems going by a recent report that says the global rental market is expected to reach $335 billion by 2025. Although the rental industry in India is highly fragmented, it comprises about 10 per cent of the global figure. That’s because it offers the convenience of living without the responsibility of maintaining or upgrading them.

Why is renting trending?

The urban millennial workforce switches between major cities frequently, says Ajith Mohan Karimpana, founder and CEO of Furlenco, a furniture renting brand. With every relocation to a new city, they need furniture and appliances. “However, they would incur a lot of expenditure if they buy new assets or even in transferring their furniture from one city to another. This is besides the damage done during the shifting process,” he says. The newly acquired furniture and appliances can also become a logistical issue each time one shifts. Rental options not only free you from the financial burdens of mounting debts but also let you indulge in mega experiences without guilt.

Sanchit Baweja, co-founder at Stage3, apparel renting brand, believes that India is embracing “sharing economy” across sectors with the emergence of platforms like Uber, Netflix and AirBnB. New-age consumers are turning towards shared services as a smart and convenient way to focus more on experiences. “Collaborative consumption has enabled people to differentiate between what they want and what they can afford. This enables people to experiment with fashion without having to worry about the commitments to a particular garment,” says he. Moreover, with sustainability being the talk of the town, there’s never been a better time or need to rent clothes. This promotes the idea of a conscious closet.

Greg Moran, CEO and founder of Zoomcar, car rental company, points out that India’s growing preference for rental options is a part of an overarching paradigm shift towards easy consumption and on-demand accessibility instead of ownership. He says, “Previously, owning assets was a beacon of one’s social status, however, users today have shunned such notions. From property to office spaces, furniture and more, the users today are more inclined to access such assets for a little while and then switch to something else. The shift in consumer behaviour also stems from the socio-political and economic forces at large.”

Greg agrees with Sanchit that the current state of economy along with rising aspirations are influencing Indian consumers to rent the best experiences possible within the given constraints. He adds, “When we consider the hassle of taking loans and EMI or the looming job insecurity of salaried professionals, renting seems to be a pragmatic alternative.” Another factor that we must consider is the that we live in a world of rapid advancements, with new models hitting the stores every few days. Renting, thus, gives users the liberty to sample different options instead of being stuck with one for long.

Sunil Gupta, MD and CEO, Avis India attributes this rising shift towards the changing consumer sentiments. They wish to enjoy the comfort and prestige attached to driving cars but are averse to using their savings to make a down payment for one or salaries for EMIs.

WHAT ARE THE Challenges?

For apparels, Sanchit says that the biggest challenge in the Indian market is the psychological barrier of “renting” an outfit. People usually don’t prefer clothes that have been worn by others even if they are drycleaned. This deep-seated perception against renting might take a lot of work to be dispelled.

“We have opened stores that allow customers to touch, feel and rent. This is rapidly changing mindsets especially among the young. They are open to rentals given that occasion wear has high social obsolescence,” says he.

Furniture renting has challenges which are specific to it. For instance, Ajith says, “Fundraising is tough in this sector since this business is asset heavy. Besides, when we compare the industry to China or the US, it is still in a nascent stage. There is a need to infuse confidence in stakeholders, which is a bit tricky since the market is still evolving.”

While the vehicle market has to deal with the concern around the safety of passengers. Sunil says, “To combat this, all our vehicles are comprehensively insured and come fitted with GPS devices. This enables us to track our cars at all times. They are fitted with a speed governor which tracks the speed at which the car is being driven and alerts the driver in case he is overstepping the speed limit.”

MILLENNIALS RULE IT

It is quite obvious that these options are usually preferred by millennials because of its ease, financial constraints and commitment issues. Sanchit says, “With social media playing a pivotal role in today’s world, our platform appeals primarily to millennials. They are aware of the latest trends.” Also, the youth always wants to be seen in new, trendy outfits and don’t like to repeat them, especially if they post a picture on the social media while wearing them — all thanks to celebs. Rentals, thus, save money, time, storage and maintenance headache.

Same is the case with cars. Greg says that youngsters have shown a higher proclivity for such services. However, Sunil points out that car rental bookings are not restricted to consumers of a particular age group. “For instance, customers between 40 and 50 years comprise the strongest user base for our chauffeur driven and luxury rental categories. On the other hand, millennial customers between 25 and 40 years go for our self drive service.”

Furlenco’s target audience, too, are millennials. Ajith says, “India has one of the largest population of youngsters and they are now entering their prime spending age. There has been economic growth and we will further see the earnings and lifestyle aspirations of this generation rise and look forward to new experiments and global lifestyles. Over 85 per cent of our subscribers belong to the millennial category.”

Buy OR RENT?

Though renting is a good option but in certain instances, like beds and tables, renting the asset might cost more than the actual price of the product in the long run. A customer, Sonal Singh, who has taken a bed on rent feels that she should have bought it instead. “It has been a year since I have rented a bed for which I pay Rs 1000 per month. Now after paying Rs 12,000, I feel I could have easily bought one.”

We need to understand that modern consumers have very different preferences from their preceding generations, basically they value fulfilling experiences over material possessions. The very fundamentals that our society works around is now based on the concept of shared mobility or collaborative consumption, marking the advent of the age of accessibility. Increasingly, the economy is being shaped by the idea that we don’t really need to own things to be able to use them. Millennials swear by this as this concept fits perfectly into how they live their life — no frills attached, being able to move around freely, and not hoard things everywhere they go.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-strings-attached-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/no-strings-attached.html
177,13-1-20,Sania all set for return,"Sania Mirza and her partner Nadiia Kichenok have been drawn to meet Oksana Kalashnikova of Georgia and Miyu Kato of Japan in their opening round at the Hobart International, the first tournament the Indian ace will compete in her comeback bid.

The unseeded Indo-Ukrainian team may run into Spanish fourth seeds Georgina Garcia Perez and Sara Sorribes Tormo in the quarterfinals.

The Spanish players had reached three WTA tour finals in 2019 season and won two of them.

Sania is returning to the circuit after two years, having started a family with Pakistan cricketer Shoaib Malik.

Meanwhile, Sania has decided to pair with compatriot Rohan Bopanna at the Australian Open as Rajeev Ram, with whom she had originally planned to play at the first Grand Slam of the season, has pulled out. Sania and Rohan had last played in the 2016 Rio Olympics.

178,13-1-20,Pliskova unlocks Keys,"Karolina Pliskova said her tough three-set win over Madison Keys in the final of the Brisbane International on Sunday was the ideal preparation for next week’s Australian Open.

The Czech world number two won 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 in two hours, seven minutes on Pat Rafter Arena.

Pliskova’s third Brisbane title in four years and her 16th on the WTA tour stamps her as one of the favourites for the year’s first Grand Slam.

The former world number one is yet to win a Grand Slam singles title, but she reached the semi-finals in Melbourne last year, falling in three sets to eventual champion Naomi Osaka.

Pliskova beat Osaka in a marathon three-hour semi-final on Saturday night, and the way she backed up to defeat Keys in another gruelling clash on Sunday shows she has form and fitness heading into the Australian Open.

She said while she still saw the Brisbane International primarily as part of her Melbourne preparations, it was a good tournament to win.

“Especially beating the last two players, Naomi and Madison,” she said.

“I think it always gives you some extra confidence and at least you know which level are you at, so I think it was a great way to start the year.

“But of course, Grand Slam or any other tournament it always starts on zero, so there’s nobody’s really thinking that, ‘Oh, she won a tournament two weeks ago’.

“I can still feel well and confident and whatever, but I think we still have to start from zero.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/pliskova-unlocks-keys.html
179,13-1-20,Xavi decides against taking Barca job immediately,"Ernesto Valverde will take Barcelona training today after Xavi told the club he would not be accepting the job of coach immediately.

Xavi, who is currently in charge of Qatari team Al-Sadd, held talks with Barca’s sporting director Eric Abidal and chief executive Oscar Grau on Friday and Saturday.

But a source said that Grau and Abidal were returning to Barcelona on Sunday, after Xavi said he would not be giving his agreement straight away.

Xavi could yet resume negotiations in the coming days or, more likely, in the summer once the season has finished.

In the meantime, Valverde remains in charge and the plan is that he will take training as usual today morning.

Yet it remains to be seen how he responds, with the current Barca coach likely to have been unimpressed by the club’s indiscreet pursuit of Xavi.

Abidal and Grau met Xavi on Friday in Qatar and then again on Saturday night following Al-Sadd’s Qatar Cup semi-final win over Al-Rayyan.

The suggestion on Saturday had been that Xavi would make a decision as early as Sunday but the club’s iconic former midfielder wants more time.

His situation is complicated by the fact he would like to lead Al-Sadd in the Qatar Cup final, which will be played on January 17.

It would also be a daunting task to join Barcelona mid-season. The team are level on points in the league with Real Madrid and face a tough last-16 tie in the Champions League next month against Napoli.

“It’s a difficult decision,” wrote El Pais on Sunday. “If he accepts, he is put under the wing of a weak leadership, with elections due in 2021. But if he says no, he may be criticised for refusing to return home.”

Xavi is also said to want to show respect to Valverde, who has overseen Barcelona winning two La Liga titles in his two seasons in charge.

But Champions League collapses against Roma and Liverpool have not been forgotten and recent poor performances have prompted fears of a repeat.

“I respect Barcelona, I respect Valverde and I respect my club and I’m doing my job here,” Xavi said on Saturday.

“I’m focussing on Al-Sadd. I cannot hide that it’s my dream to coach Barcelona, I said it many times.”

Asked about talks between Barca and Xavi, Al-Sadd’s sports director Muhammad Ghulam Al-Balushi told the Qatar-based BeIN broadcaster: “I will not deny that. There are negotiations with Xavi and everyone is talking about them... but I can say that Xavi so far is at Al-Sadd.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/xavi-decides-against-taking-barca-job-immediately.html
180,13-1-20,Serena breaks title drought,"Serena Williams ended a three-year title drought and donated her winner’s cheque to victims of the Australian bushfires in an emotional WTA Auckland Classic final on Sunday.

Williams raised expectations for this month’s Australian Open, where she can equal Margaret Court’s record of 24 Grand Slam titles, with her 6-3, 6-4 victory — her first WTA trophy since she won in Melbourne in 2017.

But the 38-year-old tempered celebrations as she donated her US$43,000 winners cheque to the Australian bushfire relief fund and described how the tragedy had affected her deeply.

“I’ve been playing in Australia for over 20 years and it’s been really hard for me to watch all the news and everything that has been happening in Australia with all the fire and... animals and people that have lost their homes,” she said.

“I decided at the beginning of the tournament... I’d donate all my prize money for a great cause.”

It is Williams’ first title since 2017 — and her first as a mother — since she won the Australian Open while pregnant. Her 73 WTA titles now stretch across four decades, after she won her first in 1999.

“It’s been a long time, I think you could see the relief on my face,” she said, adding she could feel her game sharpening up as she prepares to head to Melbourne.

“It definitely feels good, it feels like i was definitely improving as the week went on and obviously I needed to.”

Williams, whose last tournament was the US Open in September, was looking for as much game time as possible in Auckland and an hour after winning the singles crown she was back on court partnering Wozniacki in the doubles final.

However, the pair were beaten 6-4, 6-4 by Americans Asia Muhammad and Taylor Townsend.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/serena-breaks-title-drought.html

182,13-1-20,Handanovic’s save avoid Inter defeat,"Inter’s position on top of Serie A is at risk after a 1-1 draw against Atalanta.

Lautaro Martinez put Inter ahead after four minutes in the San Siro only for Robin Gosens to pull Atalanta level on 76 minutes.

Atalanta striker Duvan Zapata got his first start after a long injury layoff but Inter were struggling without suspended Nicolo Barella and injured duo Matias Vecino and Alexis Sanchez.

Good work by in-form Inter strike duo Martinez and Romelu Lukaku paved the way for the first goal minutes into the game.

But Gosens volleyed in with quarter of an hour to go and Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic saved a Luis Muriel penalty two minutes from time to hold onto a point.

Atalanta are fifth, equal on points with Roma, who occupy the final Champions League berth.

Lazio extended their winning streak to a club record of ten games as they inflicted a second consecutive defeat on Serie A runners-up Napoli thanks to a blunder from goalkeeper David Ospina with eight minutes to go.

Colombian international Ospina was caught in possession inside his own box allowing Immobile to tap in his 20th goal in 19 games to the delight of the home crowd as the club marked their 120th anniversary.

“What is missing for the Scudetto? To be honest, we’re not missing much,” said coach Simone Inzaghi.

“We keep conceding crazy goals,” said Napoli coach Gennaro Gattuso whose side drop to tenth place.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/handanovic---s-save-avoid-inter-defeat.html
183,13-1-20,Liverpool park Mourinho’s bus,"Roberto Firmino’s strike ensured Liverpool made a record-breaking start for one of Europe’s top five leagues after beating Tottenham 1-0 on Saturday, but ending a 30-year wait to win the title is the only history Jurgen Klopp is interested in.

Klopp’s men have earned 61 points from a possible 63 in 21 games to streak 16 points clear at the top and with a game in hand to spare over second-placed Leicester.

There is now a 31-point gap between the sides that contested last season’s Champions League final as Spurs remain in eighth, nine points adrift of even the top four.

However, the European champions were made to sweat by the side they beat in Madrid last June as Son Heung-min and Giovani Lo Celso missed the target with the goal gaping in the final 15 minutes.

“The problem is you don’t get anything for best starts apart from numbers,” said Klopp. “If people say in 50 years... it was the best start, cool, but the only thing we are interested in is what we can get in the summer.

“That is not done yet because this league is so strong, because we face so many strong opponents.

“The moment when we have enough points that nobody can catch us anymore, then we start talking about it. Until then I couldn’t be less interested.”

Lo Celso’s miss left Jose Mourinho on his knees in anguish and the honeymoon period for the Tottenham manager is already over after just two wins in their last eight games in all competitions.

The Portuguese’s game plan to cede possession to Liverpool before the break backfired, but he still believed his side deserved at least a point for their onslaught in the final quarter.

“Liverpool have worked with this coach for five years. The players are totally adapted physically to the football he wants to play,” said Mourinho.

“If we try to play the way we did in the last 20 minutes from the start, I think we would collapse because the players are not used to this style.

“We knew that (Erik) Lamela, Giovani, in the last 25-30 minutes they could turn the game. I think we deserve more.”

Mourinho sprang a huge surprise with his team selection as Japhet Tanganga was handed his Premier League debut in defence. And responded to Kane’s absence by utilising Lucas Moura and Dele Alli in attack as he sat back and hoped to catch the European champions on the break.

However, it was largely one-way traffic before half-time as Liverpool controlled the game and waited patiently for Spurs’ fragile defence to break.

Tottenham have kept just one clean sheet in 13 games since Mourinho took charge and their luck ran out eight minutes before half-time as Tanganga’s inexperience showed as he tried to intercept Mohamed Salah’s pass into Firmino and the Brazilian fired into the far corner.

Mourinho’s men showed more ambition in the second period and should have reaped some reward.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/liverpool-park-mourinho---s-bus.html
184,13-1-20,Trend Blazer,"Important to make relevant films: Rani

Actor Rani Mukerji says it is important to make films which are relevant to today’s times.

In her initial years, Rani was seen in socially relevant films like Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat, based on rape and Mehendi revolving around dowry.

Should these films be remade now? “I think there are a lot of stories that need to be told and need to come on celluloid. So, I don’t think remaking something is an answer for that... I think it is important to make films which are relevant to today’s times,” Rani said.

Rani will next be seen in Bunty Aur Babli 2, a sequel to the 2005 film Bunty Aur Babli. The film also stars Saif Ali Khan, Siddhant Chaturvedi and debutante Sharvari Wagh.

‘Shah Rukh has very graciously given the voiceover of The Forgotten Army: Azaadi Ke Liye. The series is based on true story, so there is an introduction of a few minutes before every episode along with real footage, where he has lent his voice. Back then, when this was a film script, I wanted Shah Rukh to do the film. We even had a few meetings but we couldn’t take it forward.’

—Kabir Khan

Actor Nora Fatehi feels that her decision to start off with different platforms paid off, and have made her a better artist.

She says, “My journey is still early on in my career because I am still very new. If I look at it from the beginning until now, it has been amazing. I have learned so much and I am lucky to have received such a start. It is not like any other mainstream journey; a lot of people start off directly with films. I got lucky to start off with different platforms like Tollywood movies, Bollywood films and reality shows.”

185,13-1-20,On a high,"After three deaths at Sunburn, it’s time to focus on drugs at EDM fests

That music galas, especially electronic music dance (EDM) festivals are often associated with abundant drug abuse is nothing new. In recent times, if raves have grown more popular among youth, so has the drug culture among the attendees.

The deaths of three tourists at the recent Sunburn festival in Goa are widely being seen as the latest example of a direct link between EDM festivals and alleged use of illegal substances. The event has come under constant scrutiny after these deaths. Many have speculated that drug overdose was the reason, although the real cause of the deaths is still to be officially ascertained. Nevertheless, the incident has raised questions, throwing light on the increasing use of drugs by people at such big festivals.

Clive (name changed), who was at Sunburn this year, says that even if one were to assume that the deaths happened due to drugs consumed during the fest, it does not necessarily mean these were smuggled inside the venue. “The reason can be an overdose, but two out of the three men died outside the venue and not inside. Before entering the venue, people consume various things to get a kick while watching the show. About the third person, I don’t know if he consumed drugs. We can’t say for sure because he was shifted to the hospital after the event was over and he died the next day,” Clive said, adding that “security arrangements at the fest were really tight.”

Which is where, however, Clive’s next observation stumps you. He did spot people having drugs inside the venue despite stringent security checks. “When I was entering the venue, they thoroughly checked me. However, I discovered many people were smoking weed inside the venue. They might have smuggled a few sticks inside cigarette packets. However, I did not see anyone snorting coke. The police were around with trained sniffer dogs,” he said.

There were others who too corroborate Clive’s assertion. Ronaldo, who flew to Goa from Delhi to attend the festival, said. “I had a very bad experience. Despite security I saw people consuming illegal substances. Some of them carried the drugs in their undergarments or their socks.”

IGP Jaspal Singh of Goa Police insists that there’s always a massive police arrangement at such venues. “There was a huge police force outside as well as inside the venue. Inside, there was anti-narcotic cell with well trained dog squads. There was Raman spectrometer, which tests drugs in real time. The device gives you an indication whether the material is a drug or not. There was zero availability of drugs inside the venue because the police controlled everything,” Singh claimed. However, he acknowledged there are some drugs that can be concealed easily. “There are drugs that can be taken to the venue easily. People can use currency notes like blotting paper, and then it becomes a challenge for us to trace them. This time, we had a lot of meetings with the organisers and tried our best to provide 100 per cent security. Still, we regret the loss of three lives. The cause of the deaths is not confirmed yet,” Singh explained.

Amid all the fuss, international DJ Luciano, who was at the fest this year and who is himself a reformed drug victim, urged people to get rid of such addiction. “Drugs are impure. I know it’s easy to say this but one must realise the value of self-discretion when it comes to the use of drugs, rather than blame it on the authorities. I discovered something as pure as music can help me come out of it much faster,” he said.

Indian DJ Mr Bose detests that EDM has become synonymous with drugs. “There’s a myth attached to EDM. Some people think EDM is all about drugs but it actually depends on the person. I don’t take drugs and I don’t expect that my audience has to in order to listen to my music. We should value the art of EDM,” Mr Bose, whose original name is Shiladitya Bose, concluded.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/on-a-high-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/on-a-high.html

187,13-1-20,Green beyond the blue,"NASA satellite reveals more plants are growing around Mount Everest and across the Himalayan region

Researchers have found that plant life is growing and expanding around Mount Everest and across the Himalayan region as the area continues to experience the consequences of global warming.

According to the study, published in the journal Global Change Biology, research team from University of Exeter in UK, used satellite data to measure the extent of subnival vegetation — plants growing between the treeline and snowline — in this vast area.

Little is known about these remote, hard-to-reach ecosystems, made up of short-stature plants (predominantly grasses and shrubs) and seasonal snow, but the study revealed they cover between five and 15 times the area of permanent glaciers and snow.

Using data from 1993 to 2018 from NASA’s Landsat satellites, researchers measured small but significant increases in subnival vegetation cover across four height brackets from 4,150-6,000 metres above sea level. “These large-scale studies using decades of satellite data are computationally intensive because the file sizes are huge. We can now do this relatively easily on the cloud by using Google Earth Engine, a new and powerful tool freely available to anyone, anywhere,” said study researcher Dominic Fawcett, who coded the image processing.

The Hindu Kush Himalayan region extends across all or part of eight countries, from Afghanistan in the West to Myanmar in the East. More than 1.4 billion people depend on water from catchments emanating here.

According to the study, results varied at different heights and locations, with the strongest trend in increased vegetation cover in the bracket 5,000-5,500m.

Around Mount Everest, the team found a significant increase in vegetation in all four height brackets. Conditions at the top of this height range have generally been considered to be close to the limit of where plants can grow.

Though the study doesn’t examine the causes of the change, the findings are consistent with modelling that shows a decline in “temperature-limited areas” (where temperatures are too low for plants to grow) across the Himalayan region due to global warming.

Other research has suggested Himalayan ecosystems are highly vulnerable to climate-induced vegetation shifts. “A lot of research has been done on ice melting in the Himalayan region, including a study that showed how the rate of ice loss doubled between 2000 and 2016,” said researcher Karen Anderson.

“It’s important to monitor and understand ice loss in major mountain systems but subnival ecosystems cover a much larger area than permanent snow and ice and we know very little about them and how they moderate water supply,” Anderson added.

According to the researchers, snow falls and melts here seasonally, and they don’t know what impact changing subnival vegetation will have on this aspect of the water cycle, which is vital because this region (known as ‘Asia’s water towers’) feeds the ten largest rivers in Asia.

Researcher Anderson said “some really detailed fieldwork” and further validation of these findings is now required to understand how plants in this high-altitude zone interact with soil and snow.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/green-beyond-the-blue-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/green-beyond-the-blue.html
188,13-1-20,Arise and awake,"Youth are not only the leaders of tomorrow but also the partners of today so we should consider them to be our strength, says Rajyogi Brahmakumar Nikunj Ji

The youth, in the current social set-up, are deprived of opportunities of growth and participation in the affairs of the family, the state and society. Therefore, it is thought that they are disappointed, disillusioned and restless. This is one of main reasons why they indulge in violence and destructive activities.

In 2009, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution proclaiming the year commencing August 12, 2010 as the “International Year of Youth” to draw the attention of society and the state towards the aspirations and problems of youth and the need to provide them with better facilities and opportunities. The spirit behind this idea was undoubtedly laudable but the question here is: What are our definitions of the terms “growth,” “development” and “participation” used in the theme selected by the UN. This question is crucial because currently, the main emphasis is on economic, social, political and even physical aspects of these three “key words” neglecting it’s moral and spiritual sides. Our policy makers do not usually realise that a person cannot be happy and satisfied if their moral growth and spiritual development are neglected. Hence, a man may grow physically and financially but he might not have enough spiritual and moral knowledge. This, in turn, might force him into substance abuse or other harmful ways to relieve stress. It is, therefore, of utmost importance that the moral and the spiritual growth form the base of all other kinds of growth and development.

A great leader, Mahatma Gandhi, believed in transforming youth into a cadre of inspiring and competent role models and change agents with the courage of conviction. This too will trigger the process of building a healthy nation. Remember, a nation which allows its youth to travel on the path of indiscipline, violence and disrespect, unwittingly permits itself to be a state of chaos. The youth are like a double-edged sword that can be used to destroy an enemy or spread terror in their own territory by sabre-rattling. Hence, if they are instigated to wreck national property, question their teachers and indulge in acts of arson and rampage at the slightest provocation, then, they would become an army who will pull down the structure of their nation without any remorse.

Let us, therefore, be wiser to consider our youth to be our strength and our prospective nation-builders, for, “they are not only the leaders of tomorrow but also the partners of today.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/arise-and-awake-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/arise-and-awake.html
189,13-1-20,Never too young to change the world,"Are child crusaders, heroes fair game for adult critics?

The point where childhood ends and adulthood begins isn’t as straightforward as it seems. Add the limelight and things can get complicated for young people who either voluntarily or through circumstances live very public lives. Those public lives often come with heaping helpings of adult-size sniping. But are children and adolescents who find themselves under global microscopes still entitled to age-appropriate protection from the harshness of public discourse? And, more importantly, can they handle it?

Children and teens, in this era of blurred boundaries, have at their disposal mobile megaphones — for the first time in human history — to reach the entire world. That allows them to be heard, and potentially taken seriously, by hundreds of millions of people, all the way up to heads of state who include the president of the United States. But does it give those who hear them the right to slap back? At what point does the imperative to treat children more gently collide with their decision to enter the marketplace of ideas — and what happens when it does?

In 2012, 16-year-old gymnast Gabby Douglas became the first African American woman and woman of colour of any nationality to win Olympic gold in the individual all-around. The feat was joyous but some on social media bemoaned that her hair wasn’t perfect. The teen clapped back, “Are you kidding me? I just made history. And you’re focussing on my hair?”

When climate activist Greta Thunberg, who just turned 17, was named Time magazine’s 2019 person of the year, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to call her choice “ridiculous,” going on to say, “Greta must work on her anger management problem, then go to a good old fashioned film with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!” To that, Thunberg responded by changing her Twitter profile to mock the president’s words. She told The Intercept: “Honestly, I think it’s funny.”

Since Serena Williams was a teen, when Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize after being shot in the face, with the ascent of 18-year-old pop star Billie Eilish and in the aftermath of the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that turned young survivors into gun control activists, the treatment of young people in the public eye has had its ups and downs.

“For anyone who shares public opinions about civic and social issues, like Greta Thunberg and the Parkland teens have done, it can cut both ways. It can be empowering for young people to use their voices in such a public way. Young people can also be especially effective in changing public conversations about important issues. People listen to young minds in a different way,” said Dr Parissa Ballard, a developmental psychologist at Wake Forest School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

“At the same time, public political engagement can be very stressful and can put young people in a vulnerable position when they receive criticism or people publicly disagree,” said Ballard, whose research focuses on the intersection of civic engagement and adolescent health and wellness.

Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, who began speaking out for gun reform soon after the shooting there were already in a devastating position when they faced accusations that some were “crisis actors” and the group was under the manipulation of gun control advocates. The teens were unfazed.

“There are people who are going to be putting us down. It doesn’t matter. Everything we’re doing, it can’t be stopped,” Diego Pfeiffer, an 18-year-old senior at the time, told The Miami Herald in February 2018. “We are children and we have a message. They are bashing survivors of a school shooting. You can go ahead but our message is going to be heard loud and clear.”

Development psychologists prefer to speak of stages when describing life’s slide from childhood into adolescence and on to young adulthood, such as the onset of biological changes and shifts in social roles. Some use more rigid measures, considering childhood to extend through age 12, with adolescence roughly between 12 and 18 and young adulthood the period between 18 and 25.

Richard West, an Emerson College communications professor who focuses on family, bullying and identity, said that’s only part of the story for young people who prematurely find themselves in adult spaces. “These are individuals who are emotionally driven and passionately obsessed with having a dialogue,” he said. “I don’t feel that they should be held to a standard that we hold, for instance, a president or an ambassador.” Finding that line isn’t easy. “We all need to jump in. It’s not just Greta’s family. It’s not the Parkland kids’ families. It should be all of us jumping in when we see something or hear something that might be completely out of line with the values of this country,” West said. “We don’t have the value as a country of attacking young people who might be activists.”

Jumping in is exactly what former first lady Michelle Obama did on Twitter after Trump’s “chill” tweet about Greta. “Don’t let anyone dim your light,” Obama urged Greta. “Like the girls I’ve met in Vietnam and all over the world, you have so much to offer us all. Ignore the doubters and know that millions of people are cheering you on.”

Eilish, who grew popular in 2016 with her SoundCloud single Ocean Eyes, has long been surrounded by family in her entourage, including her parents and her older brother and collaborator, Finneas Baird O’Connell. But fame has had its rough spots nonetheless. “I forget sometimes that they’re not literally my friends,” she told Variety of her fans. “It’s weird, like, that’s probably the biggest con in it all: that people I’ve never met think I’m really close friends with them. And then they forget that I’m not, and sometimes say stuff at meet-and-greets or post things that are joking or sarcastic about how bad I look in (a certain) photo, and I’m like, wow, that’s so mean. But then I remember that it’s just part of being friends — you make fun of your friends as a joke, and they make fun of you back — so it’s all love, and I really, really don’t want it to change.”

Ballard, too, sees a key role for supportive adults when public young people face detractors, especially those like Greta and the Parkland survivors who are up against grown-ups with immense power and resources.

“Adults can support young activists by helping them understand the range of possible reactions they might get and to help manage their expectations about public political engagement,” she said.

Daryl Van Tongeren, an associate professor of psychology at Hope College in Holland, Michigan, specialises, in part, on questions of morality. “I think sadly in our society they do sometimes forfeit their childhoods, but I don’t think that they should have to,” he said. “I think as a society we view them as no longer being children and somehow we now have rights to kind of put them in a different realm, put them in a different category. It’s a moment for us to pause and say, just because this is happening, does that mean that it’s good or it’s healthy or it’s right?”

Williams, who is now 38 and owns 23 Grand Slam singles titles, knows some of the issues well. “People have been talking about my body for a really long time,” she told The Fader in 2016. “Good things, great things, negative things. People are entitled to have their opinions, but what matters most is how I feel about me, because that’s what’s going to permeate the room I’m sitting in.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/never-too-young-to-change-the-world-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/never-too-young-to-change-the-world.html
190,13-1-20,Djoker has last laugh,"An emotional Novak Djokovic overpowered long-time rival Rafael Nadal and led Serbia to victory in the inaugural ATP Cup Sunday, capping a perfect build up to his Australian Open title defence.

The world number two blasted the top-ranked Spaniard off court 6-2, 7-6 (7/4) after world number 10 Roberto Bautista Agut caned Serbia’s Dusan Lajovic 7-5, 6-1 in the other singles.

A fresh Djokovic returned to Sydney’s Ken Rosewall Arena for the deciding doubles but Nadal opted not to, saying his energy levels were too low, with Feliciano Lopez partnering Pablo Carreno Busta.

But they proved no match for Djokovic and Viktor Troicki, who bounced back from a break down in the first set to romp home 6-3, 6-4 and ensure Serbia was the last country standing from the 24 that began the season-opening event.

“I’ll remember this experience for the rest of my life. It’s one of the nicest moments in my career,” said Djokovic, who close to tears after winning the doubles.

“I’ve been very fortunate to have an amazing career these last 15 years, but playing for the team, playing for my country with some of my best friends for a long time, you can’t match that. It’s too special.”

The doubles drew the curtain on an event that proved a big hit with players and fans, dishing up competitive matches driven by the passion of athletes representing their home countries.

Some US$15 million in prize money was at stake along with up to 750 singles and 250 doubles ATP rankings points, with new rules trialled including on-court coaching and team zones in the corners of the court.

Djokovic, warming up for his bid to win an eighth Australian Open crown this month, went into his clash with Nadal leading their head-to-heads 28-26.

But the statistics did not tell the full story.

The Serb had won nine of their past 12 contests and been dominant over the years on hard courts — including a comfortable win against Nadal in the Australian Open final last year.

He showed his intent immediately and broke Nadal in the opening game with no let-up, as his driving groundstrokes and deft touches proved too much.

Nadal lifted in an intense second, with Djokovic saving five break points in a crucial sixth game.

It went to a tiebreaker where a crunching backhand down the line from the Serb gave him the break he needed to complete the victory.

“Every time I play Rafa we get to play a lot of exciting points,” Djokovic said. “We had some incredible exchanges.”

Nadal said he was happy with the way he fought back in the second set.

“I had my chances. I was very close. I’m not happy with the loss, of course, but the feeling in that second set is positive,” he said.

“Probably today was maybe a little bit too early in the season,” he added.

Djokovic owned a perfect 6-0 singles record at the tournament. Nadal won four and lost two.

Bautista Agut was a class above Lajovic, ranked 34, also earning the distinction of going through the tournament unbeaten.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/djoker-has-last-laugh.html
191,13-1-20,Never thought things will happen so fast: Ghosh,"Richa Ghosh is still soaking it all in. When most girls of her age will be preparing for their board exams in February, the 16-year-old Siliguri girl will be bracing for her maiden international cricket tour with the Indian women’s side and that too the marquee ICC World T20.

The teenager picked up the willow seeing her father Manabendra Ghosh, now a part-time Bengal umpire, at a tender age of four and a half years and after a good show in the Challenger Trophy has made her way into the national team.

“I never thought that this will happen so fast. It’s hard to believe and the feeling hasn’t sunk in yet,” Richa said.

“My first role model has always been my dad from whom I learnt cricket. Then it was Sachin Tendulkar, who will always remain my idol.”

But when it’s about her six-hitting skill, it’s none other than MS Dhoni.

“I love the way he hits sixes and try the same. Whoever maybe the bowler, when you have the bat, you can do anything.”

Known for her six-hitting exploits, the 16-year-old from Siliguri is a complete package — someone who loves to open the batting, bowls quick and also keeps wickets.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/never-thought-things-will-happen-so-fast--ghosh.html
192,13-1-20,ICC planning to increase number of teams in T20 World Cup to 20: Report,"The International Cricket Council is considering expanding the T20 World Cup from 16 to 20 teams from the 2023-31 cycle, according to a media report here.

The ICC, which views the T20 format as the best way to increase the reach of the sport, is mulling the option as a way for cricket to try and match the popularity of sports like football and basketball, according to the 'Telegraph.Co.Uk'.

The newspaper reported that this consideration is ""a part of broader discussions for the shape of international cricket calendar from 2023-2031"". The first T20 World Cup in this cycle is scheduled for 2024.

The ICC had earlier put forward a proposal to organise a flagship event every year as a plan to enter the global media rights markets and the a bigger T20 World Cup will also increase the viewership.

A bigger tournament will also increase the likelihood of the participation of the USA, a market where ICC has recently made several attempts to spread the sport. Other teams that could take part are Canada, Germany, Nepal and Nigeria.

The ICC is looking at two options for the format if the tournament expands to 20 teams.

One of the options is the current two-tier format used in the T20 World Cup with lower-ranked teams playing the qualifiers to reach the main draw which includes the top countries.

The second possibility could be four groups of five teams each with the top sides from each group progressing to the knockout stage.

The ICC is carrying out several discussions about the future of the sport, including shortening of five-day Test matches to four days.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/icc-planning-to-increase-number-of-teams-in-t20-world-cup-to-20--report-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/icc-planning-to-increase-number-of-teams-in-t20-world-cup-to-20--report.html
193,13-1-20,"Char din ki chandni hoti hai, Test cricket nahi: Sehwag takes a dig at planned four-day Tests","""A fish out of water is a dead fish"" -- This is how Virender Sehwag described the ICC's plan to revamp Test cricket by shortening it to four days, asserting that innovation should not mean tinkering with the soul of the format.

Delivering the 'MAK Pataudi Memorial Lecture' at the annual BCCI awards on Sunday night, Sehwag relied on some classic Hindi idioms to drive home the point that innovation in the longest form should stop at day/night matches.

""Chaar din ki chandni hoti hai, Test match nahi...Jal ki machli jal main hi acchi hai, bahar nikaloge toh mar jaegi,"" he said in his inimitable style.

""...Test cricket ko chanda mama ke pass le jaa sakte hai. We can have Day-Night Test cricket. If there is a day-night Test, maybe people will come to watch game after office. Innovations should happen but within the five days. It should not be shortened"" he asserted.

The ICC will consider the proposal to make Test cricket four-dayers during its cricket committee meeting in March. However, the feedback so far has been largely critical with top current and former players such as Virat Kohli, Sachin Tendulkar, Ravi Shastri and Ian Botham ridiculing the plan.

Calling Test cricket an enduring romance, Sehwag said it is the waiting game which makes the format charming.

""I have always welcomed change but five day Test cricket is a romance. Bowler tries to get the batsman out by setting up a field. Batsman tries to win by building an innings...The fielder in the slip waits for the ball like a a man in love waits for a 'yes' from his lover...All day long,"" he said.

At the same time, the former opener said he is not completely averse to innovation.

""...Number on jersey etc are okay but diaper and five-day cricket should be changed only when they are soiled. I don't think there is any problem with Test cricket. It is a 142 year-old young man fit like today's Indian team. It has a soul and this soul's age shouldn't be shortened,"" he asserted.

Sehwag said the format has delivered on results regularly and dawn matches cannot be the basis of changing the format's basic fabric.

""In the past five years, 31 matches have been drawn out of 223 Tests played ie; 13 per cent, a lot more than our GDP. In the last 10 year, only 83 matches were drawn out of 533 played ie; 19 per cent,"" he said as he brought the house down.

Another issue that Sehwag touched upon was players' on-field behaviour. The 41-year-old said abuse is bothersome as youngsters, watching on TV, tend to emulate their heroes.

""Children nowadays can lip read what a player says. Switching off stump mic is not a solution. Maybe defining certain boundaries and adhering to it is a solution. Healthy banter without being abusive makes Test cricket interesting,"" he said.

Reflecting on his association with late former captain Pataudi, in whose memory the lecture is conducted since 2013, Sehwag said the stylish batsman's advice came in handy at a very crucial juncture of his career.

""I've had a very close relation with him. The first time I met him in 2005-06, I asked him 'you have seen me play a lot, what should I improve in my game?' He told me just one thing 'When you are batting, you are far from the ball. If you stay near, you won't get out'.

""I had never taken any advice. But I took his advice and made a lot of runs in Test cricket. The credit goes to him,"" recalled the batsman with more than 16,000 Test and ODI runs.

""If I had to compare him to someone, I would compare him to Mahabharat's Krishna. If he (Krishna) wouldn't have been there, Pandavas would not have won. He changed how we played Test cricket. He was the first captain to win overseas. Maybe, if he wasn't there then it would have taken more time for India to win abroad.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/char-din-ki-chandni-hoti-hai--test-cricket-nahi--sehwag-takes-a-dig-at-planned-four-day-tests-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/char-din-ki-chandni-hoti-hai--test-cricket-nahi--sehwag-takes-a-dig-at-planned-four-day-tests.html
194,13-1-20,"Both Dhawan and Rahul can play, I might bat lower down, indicates skipper Kohli","India captain Virat Kohli on Monday hinted at dropping himself down the batting order to accommodate both Shikhar Dhawan and KL Rahul in the playing XI against Australia in the first ODI here.

With vice-captain Rohit Sharma an automatic pick, the team management is left with tough choice of selecting either Dhawan or Rahul in the playing eleven. But the skipper sees no reason why both can't play together.

""Look, a guy in form is always good for the team. ...You obviously want to have the best players available and then chose from what the combination should be for the team. There might be a possibility that all three (Rohit, Shikhar and Rahul) might play. It will be interesting to see what balance we want to take in on the field,"" Kohli said on the eve of the match.

Asked if he would he be happy to bat lower down the order, Virat said,""Yeah, big possibility. I would be very happy to do so. Look I am not possessive about where I play. I am not insecure about where I bat,"" said the skipper.

For Kohli, it is more important as to what kind of leadership legacy he leaves behind rather than chase personal glory.

""Being the captain of the team, it is my job to make sure that the next lot is also ready. A lot of the other people might not look at it that way, but your job as a captain is not only to look after the team right now, but also to prepare a team that you leave behind when you eventually pass it onto someone else,"" he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/both-dhawan-and-rahul-can-play--i-might-bat-lower-down--indicates-skipper-kohli-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/both-dhawan-and-rahul-can-play--i-might-bat-lower-down--indicates-skipper-kohli.html

Tendulkar holds the Indian record for most centuries in the 50-over format, scoring 20 of those at home.

But Kohli, who currently has 19 centuries on home soil, has a chance to equal the feat when he leads India in the first ODI of the three-match series against Australia here on Tuesday.

196,13-1-20,SC asks senior lawyers to deicide for deliberation issues related to discrimination against women,"The Supreme Court Monday asked four senior lawyers to convene a meeting on January 17 to decide on the issues to be deliberated by it in the matter relating to discrimination against women in various religions and at religious places including Kerala's Sabarimala Temple.

The top court however made it clear at the outset that it was not considering review pleas in the Sabarimala case.

""We are not hearing review pleas of Sabarimala case. We are considering issues referred to by a 5-judge bench earlier,"" said a 9-judge Constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde.

The bench said it will consider listing the petitions related to entry of Muslim women into mosques, female genital mutilation in the Dawoodi Bohra Muslim community and barring of Parsi women, married to non-Parsi men, from the holy fire place at Agiary.

It said the apex court Secretary General will coordinate with the four senior advocates, including Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and A M Singhvi, in thrashing out issues to be dealt by it.

The lawyers will decide whether the several issues referred to it by an earlier bench on November 14 last year needed to be reframed, it said.

The meeting should also deal with the time to be allotted to each lawyer for advancing arguments in the case, it added.

The bench said the lawyers should decide as to who will address which issue and fixed the matter for further hearing after three weeks.

""We will grant three weeks time for this (deciding the issues) and we will put this matter after that for hearing,"" it further said.

The bench said it will not go into the specific details of each case like Sabarimala temple matter and would strictly go by the reference order of November 14 in deciding the scope of judicial intervention in matters of religious issues.

While referring the matter to a larger bench, the five-judge bench had said that the debate about the constitutional validity of religious practices like bar on entry of women and girls into a place of worship was not limited to the Sabarimala case.

It had said such restrictions are there with regard to entry of Muslim women into mosques and 'dargahs' and Parsi women, married to non-Parsi men, being barred from the holy fire place of an Agiary.

It set out seven questions of law to be examined by the larger bench. They included -- interplay between freedom of religion under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution; need to delineate the expression 'constitutional morality'; the extent to which courts can enquire into particular religious practices; meaning of sections of Hindus under Article 25 and whether 'essential religious practices' of denomination or a section thereof are protected under Article 26.

While the five-judge bench unanimously agreed to refer religious issues to a larger bench, it gave a 3:2 split decision on petitions seeking a review of the apex court's September 2018 decision allowing women of all ages to enter the Sabarimala shrine in Kerala.

A majority verdict by then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justices A M Khanwilkar and Indu Malhotra decided to keep pending pleas seeking a review of its decision regarding entry of women into the shrine, and said restrictions on women in religious places was not restricted to Sabarimala alone and was prevalent in other religions as well.

The minority verdict by Justices R F Nariman and D Y Chandrachud gave a dissenting view by dismissing all review pleas and directing compliance of its September 28 decision.

The split decision came on 65 petitions -- 56 review petitions, four fresh writ petitions and five transfer pleas -- which were filed after the apex court verdict of September 28, 2018 sparked violent protests in Kerala.

By a majority 4:1 verdict, the apex court had lifted the ban that prevented women and girls between the age of 10 and 50 from entering the famous Ayyappa shrine in Kerala and held that the centuries-old Hindu religious practice was illegal and unconstitutional.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-9-judge-bench-commences-hearing-on-pleas-on-discrimination-against-women-at-religious-places-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sc-asks-senior-lawyers-to-deicide-for-deliberation-issues-related-to-discrimination-against-women.html

Talking to reporters here, Raut said the BJP should declare that it has no link with the book comparing Modi with Chhatrapati Shivaji.

199,13-1-20,Good dilemma to have: Rathour on opening combination,"In Rohit Sharma, K L Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan, India are spoilt for choice at the top of the order, and batting coach Vikram Rathour on Sunday called it a “good dilemma” to have.

Rohit had a phenomenal 2019, having struck five centuries in the World Cup.

Dhawan, who made a comeback in the T20 side in the just-concluded three-match series against Sri Lanka, was also among the runs, while Rahul, too, is having a great time with the bat.

“It’s a good dilemma to have. Rohit is an obvious choice of course. Both of them (Shikhar and Rahul) are playing well. Shikhar has done well in one- dayers and Rahul is in great form. So we’ll deal with it when we have to,” Rathour said.

“There are still a couple of days to go. The management will sit down and make the choice,” he told reporters ahead of the first ODI against Australia.

Asked about the relevance of the series in a T20 World Cup year, Rathour said, “It’s a different format and cricket is a game of confidence. So as a batter and bowler, especially when you are playing against a team like Australia, who are one of the better teams in the world, performances do make a difference. It gives you a lot of confidence.”

“We’ll take it as any other series and playing against one of the better sides in the world, we are looking to do well as a team, looking to perform and win if possible,” added the batting coach.

Rahul can also keep wickets and the coach was asked whether there was a thought process to use Rahul as a stumper.

“We haven’t really started thinking on those lines yet. Rahul can keep, that’s the skill that he has. So that will depend if the team management feels at any stage we require that.”

Rathour also asserted that he does not see any issue with the middle-order.

“It’s (middle-order) not a weakness. Few innings back we scored 383. We’ve been scoring runs, our batters have done well. Shreyas (Iyer) is batting really well. (Rishabh) Pant has played a couple of useful innings. So I don’t see an issue.

“Top three are scoring heavily, so that’s a good problem to have, but we have enough options and don’t see any issues with that,” he added.

Australia possess some of the best pacers in the world, and have come with a four-pronged attack, comprising Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Kane Richardon.

So what is the game plan against the pacers?

Rathour replied, “All of our batters have played against them quite a lot. They know these bowlers, their strengths, the areas where they bowl — so the game plan will be according to that.

“It’s a good surface we are playing on and nothing different basically. Just take it as any other team.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/good-dilemma-to-have--rathour-on-opening-combination.html
200,13-1-20,We are underdogs in ODI series: Richardson,"Australian speedster Kane Richardson says coach Andrew McDonald “camped out” at the Wankhede Stadium on Saturday night to check on dew as his players prepared to practice with wet balls.

“Andrew McDonald camped out here last night to try and see what time the dew came in. Who knows, everyone is guessing. I think everyone is prepared,” Richardson said.

“We’re going to train today with some wet balls so we can practice that. We’ll just wait and see on game day. It’s nothing new, we have dew back home as well.”

He said the Virat Kohli-led Indians were the favourites at home, calling his team the underdogs for the three-match ODI series, beginning here tomorrow.

“I think the home team is always favourite. I think on the back of last year, I think Finchy (Aaron Finch) has said no team has ever won here back to back. It’s going to be so hard,” he said.

“India in India is always the biggest challenge and after what happened last year they will be ready for it. Confidence is up but the home team is always favourite. We are the underdogs,” he said ahead of a practice session.

Last year, Australia had made a spectacular comeback to record a 3-2 win in ODI series in India.

The 28-year-old pacer, who has played 22 ODIs, also said playing in India, where the grounds are smaller, is the biggest challenge.

“It’s the biggest challenge in white-ball cricket, coming over here and playing against India on the surfaces over here. It’s a lot different than Australia. The ground sizes are a lot smaller than Australia, (and) mis-hits can often go for six.

“It’s something we have spoken a lot about. I think everyone in the team has played here before, so it’s nothing new. Starting today we will figure out a plan to stop some of those guys. It will be a high-scoring contest I’m sure,” added the right-arm medium pacer.

Australia are touring India with a four-pronged pace attack comprising Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Starc, apart from Richardson. And the fast-bowler says he is comfortable to be the “next guy in”.

“It would be nice to take the field with all three of them or a couple of them. I don’t know how it’s going to pan out in terms of selection. I’m comfortable being that next guy in.

“I have always spoken about if injuries or form happen being the next guy in. So if I could take the field with those guys it gives you a lot of confidence that hopefully when I come onto bowl there are two or three down early,” he added.

On a personal note, Richardson, who was in and out of the playing XI during the last World Cup, says that he made his way back into the team by performing well.

“I think it was just through performance on field. You can improve away from the game all you want but I think it was just about performing. The Big Bash last year after doing well got me back in the fold and then injuries happened.

""And then try and be the next guy in. Always try and stay on top of my game and improve but I’m back in this team because I performed at the level below,” the pacer added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/we-are-underdogs-in-odi-series--richardson.html

“I don’t know if it’s fair on my part to make a formal comment or not as BCCI has not announced,” said Madan Lal when his comments were sought on the development.

Asked about the Conflict of Interest clause since he has a contract with a TV channel as cricket expert, the former India all-rounder said, “Let me first get my appointment letter and obviously there will be terms of reference and guidelines.”

A source close to the cricketer confirmed that he was approached by the BCCI for the role and he has accepted the offer.

“Yes, they did ask Madan for his consent and he had told them it will be an honour to be on CAC. It doesn’t matter if it’s one meeting or half a meeting,” said the source.

In all likelihood, the committee will meet just once as only two changes are required in the senior selection panel.

The committee has to find replacements of outgoing chairman MSK Prasad (South) and Gagan Khoda (Central).

Sarandeep Singh (North), Devang Gandhi (East) and Jatin Paranjpe (West) still have a year left in their respective four-year terms.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/madan-lal--gambhir-to-be-appointed-as-cac-members.html
202,13-1-20,Bumrah headlines BCCI Annual Awards,"India spearhead Jasprit Bumrah on Sunday headlined the BCCI Annual Awards function, grabbing the prestigious Polly Umrigar award apart from annexing the Dilip Sardesai honour for his exploits in international cricket in the 2018-19 season.

Polly Umrigar award is presented to the best male International cricketer and it carries a citation, trophy and cheque for Rs 15 lakh.

Dilip Sardesai award is conferred on both the highest wicket-taker and highest run-getter in Test cricket. Bumrah took 34 wickets in six matches with three five-wicket hauls.

Prolific Saurashtra batsman Chetshwar Pujara was picked for the honour for scoring 677 runs in 8 matches at an average of 52.07 with three centuries and two half centuries.

While Bumrah netted the biggest prize in the men’s category, Poonam Yadav claimed the top prize in women’s section and was awarded the best international cricketer.

The award will be another feather in the leg-spinner’s cap who recently won Arjuna Award.

Former India captains Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Anjum Chopra were presented the Col CK Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award and the BCCI Lifetime Achievement Award for women respectively.

A member of the 1983 World Cup-winning team, Srikkanth took on the fearsome West Indies fast bowlers and scored an attacking 38, the top individual score in the low-scoring final at the Lord’s.

Anjum is one of the finest batswomen and the first Indian to play 100 ODIs. In a career spanning 17 years, Anjum represented India in four 50-over World Cups and two T20 World Cup (played in one).

Mayank Agarwal, who emerged as an impact batsman starting with his debut series in Australia in 2018-19, received the best international debut in men’s category while talented 15-year-old Shafali Verma grabbed the same in the women’s category.

Mumbai all-rounder Shivam Dube, who impressed in the recently concluded T20 series against Sri Lanka, was presented the Lala Amarnath Award for the best all-rounder in the Ranji Trophy while Delhi’s Nitish Rana received the same for doing well in the limited overs competition.

203,13-1-20,Malinga ready to quit,"Lasith Malinga said on Sunday he was ready to stand down as Sri Lanka’s Twenty20 skipper after the team’s humiliating 2-0 loss to India in their latest foreign tour.

Returning from the series, the 36-year-old told reporters that Sri Lanka was just not good enough to make an impact in the 20 over game.

He said Sri Lankan bowlers weren’t able to restrict opponents while the batsmen were incapable of putting up the 170 runs needed for a fighting chance in a match.

“We don’t have that,” Malinga said, adding that it was unfair to expect a winning performance from the team given they were ranked just ninth in the world when returned to the captaincy just over a year ago.

But he added that he was “ready to accept” his responsibility for the team’s performance.

“I am ready any time. I am ready to quit,” he said.

Malinga led Sri Lanka to the T20 World Cup title in 2014 and remained in charge until early 2016.

His return to the top job in December 2018 was a surprise as he had lost his spot in the team after recurring injuries forced him to sit out several tournaments.

Frictions were evident in the Sri Lankan team under Malinga’s leadership, the Sunday Island newspaper reported.

“There seems to be deep divisions in the side. As captain, he has also sidelined his predecessors” including Thisara Perera and Angelo Mathews, the paper said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/malinga-ready-to-quit.html
204,13-1-20,Tare’s 154 help Mumbai post 488,"Skipper Aditya Tare struck 154 to lead a fine lower-order rally and put Mumbai in command by posting 488 in their first innings on the second day of their Group B match against Tamil Nadu.

Tare, who resumed the days on his individual score of 69, was involved in a 123-run stand for the eight wicket with Shashank Attarde (58).

Tare hit 19 fours and 2 sixes during his 253-ball knock as Mumbai added 204 runs from 59 overs on Sunday from overnight 284 for 6.

In reply, Tamil Nadu were 66 for no loss with experienced opener Abhinav Mukund batting on 52.

The Tamil Nadu bowlers toiled for five sessions before wrapping up the Mumbai innings with ace off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin (3/121) and left-arm spinner R Sai Kishore (4/125) sending down 47 and 46 overs respectively.

The Mumbai lower-order continued to make things difficult for the home side bowlers with Tushar Deshpande (39) smashing Ashwin for three huge sixes while No 11 Royston Dias too joined the fun, hoisting B Aparajith for a big one over long-on.

Double ton for pujara

Rajkot: Prolific India Test batsman Cheteshwar Pujara slammed 248, his 13th first-class double century to help Saurashtra post a massive 581 for 7 declared in Group B match against Karnataka.

Pujara, who on Saturday joined a select group of cricketing greats by smashing his 50th first-class century, is already the Indian player with most first class double centuries when he scored his 12th double ton in 2017 to go past Vijay Merchant.

With his 248 on Sunday, Pujara also became only the third player to record seven double centuries in Ranji Trophy. He is at joint second with Ajay Sharma two behind Paras Dogra, who played most cricket for Himachal Pradesh.

Pujara also completed 6000 runs in Ranji Trophy during the course of his marathon knock.

He and senior batsman Sheldon Jackson (161) rescued Saurashtra with a massive 394-run stand for the third wicket after they lost their two openers for only 33 runs.

Pujara resumed the second day on 162 and raised his double ton on Sunday before being eventually dismissed for 248 off 390 deliveries with help of 24 fours and a six.

In reply, Karnataka were 13 for 1 in eight overs.

Haryana bounce back

Rohtak: Left-arm spinner Tinu Kundu grabbed five wickets as Haryana staged a remarkable comeback to take an upper hand in Elite Group C match against Odisha.

Haryana, who were bundled out for a paltry 90 after electing to bat, bowled out Odisha for 160 and then replied strongly in their second essay by posting 218 for five, taking an overall lead of 148 going into the penultimate day.

Overnight 141 for five, Odisha lost their remaining five wickets with the addition of just 19 runs inside nine overs at the Chaudhary Bansi Lal Cricket Stadium in Lahli.

Haryana batted sensibly in their second innings with openers Shubham Rohilla (48) and Ankit Kumar (46) putting up a 101-run stand. Himanshu Rana also contributed at number five before Pramod Chandila and Patel saw through the day.

At the Barsapara Stadium in Guwahati, Assam replied strongly with 209 for three after Chhattisgarh posted 318 in their first innings, trailing the visitors by 109 runs with seven wickets intact.

Nagaland on top

Sovima: Wicketkeeper-batsman Yogesh Takawale slammed an unbeaten 117 as Nagaland batsmen made merry against the Arunachal Pradesh to pile up a mammoth 543 for seven declared in Plate group fixture.

Takawale’s knock from 162 balls, laced with 14 fours, came after No 3 Shrikant Mundhe top-scored for the team with 166 on the opening day at the Nagaland Cricket Stadium.

Mundhe also claimed three for 32 to leave Arunachal Pradesh reeling at 141 for four in 37 overs, trailing by 393 runs.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/tare---s-154-help-mumbai-post-488.html
205,13-1-20,Harman leads in World T20,"Bengal’s rookie batswoman Richa Ghosh was the only new face in a 15-member Harmanpreet Kaur-led India squad for the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup in Australia, starting February 21.

The team, announced on Sunday, has no other surprises.

The 15-year-old Haryana schoolgirl Shafali Verma will be playing her first global meet following some good performances at the international level in her first season.

Richa, 16, has been rewarded for her exploits in the recent women’s Challenger Trophy, scoring 36 off 26 balls in one of the games with four boundaries and a six.

“See, in the past one year, we have taken five to six debutants. Earlier, the same team used to play but after the 2017 ODI World Cup, a lot of new prospects have emerged. We feel we have nurtured five or six new players, who are playing now,” chairman of women’s selection committee Hemlatha Kala told reporters at the press conference

“Richa Ghosh is a new player and here the role of selectors increases.”

Source close to the women’s team said that Richa has been picked since she can lend solidity to India’s middle order.

“Richa was the most impressive player during Challenger trophy. People questioned us when we picked 15 year old Shafali and she repaid the faith and I am pretty certain Richa will be on the same path,” the source said.

“While shafali is the X factor at the top, Richa will provide the much needed firepower in the middle order. We had to give her the chance now. Anyway in women’s cricket there are not many players to choose from in comparison to the vast talent in men’s cricket.”

The selectors also announced a 16-member squad for a tri-series in Australia prior to the T20 World Cup, with Nuzhat Parveen being added as the 16th member. That tournament starts on January 31 and also features England.

Skipper Harmanpreet feels that playing the tri-series before the big event will be advantageous for the team.

“Before the World Cup, this series is going to be a big one for us and we will look for our best combination and with that we will give chances to newcomer also.

“As (Hemlata) ma’am mentioned, we have Richa, who did well in the Challenger Trophy and domestic cricket, so we will stick to our best XI. Before the World Cup, we will be able to decide our best XI,” Harmanpreet said.

The skipper has had the experience of playing in the Women’s Big Bash League and that will help her plan better.

“I think that experience will definitely help and we know how the wickets are over there and that definitely give us extra boost (over) there,” said the skipper, who has played for Sydney Thunders in WBBL.

She also agreed that spinners have been India’s strength in bowling and it wouldn’t change much on the bouncy Australian tracks.

“We are looking for more spinners in our side and we have got that. Now the only thing is how we are going to use their strengths. They are very good and always give us breakthroughs.

“Our strength is spin and we have to stick to that and whenever we need them they will perform for us,” Harmanpreet exuded confidence.

World T20 Squad: Harmanpreet Kaur (captain), Smriti Mandhana, Shafali Verma, Jemimah Rodriguez, Harleen Deol, Deepti Sharma, Veda Krishnamurthy, Richa Ghosh, Tania Bhatia, Poonam Yadav, Radha Yadav, Rajeshwari Gaikwad, Shikha Pandey, Pooja Vastrakar, Arundhati Reddy.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/harman-leads-in-world-t20-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/harman-leads-in-world-t20.html
206,13-1-20,"PM should select 5 critics, hold televised Q&A session on CAA with them: Chidambaram","Asserting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not talking to his critics, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Monday urged him to select five critics and have a televised question and answer session on CAA so that people can reach their own conclusions on the amended citizenship law.

The Congress leader said he hoped that the prime minister would respond favourably to his suggestion.

""PM says that CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) is meant to give citizenship, not take it away. Many of us believe that CAA (in conjunction with NPR or NRC) will declare many persons as 'non-citizens' and take away citizenship,"" the former home minister said.

""PM talks from high platforms to silent audiences and does not take questions. We talk through the media and are willing to take questions from media persons,"" he added.

The prime minister is not talking to his critics and they do not have an opportunity to talk to him, Chidambaram said in a series of tweets.

""The only way out is for the PM to select five of his most articulate critics and have a televised Q and A session with them. Let the people listen to the discussion and reach their conclusions on CAA,"" he said.

Chidmbaram's suggestion comes after Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday termed the CAA a ""discriminatory and divisive"" law whose ""sinister"" purpose was to divide people on religious lines, and asserted that the NPR (National Population Register) in form and content was ""disguised NRC (National Register of Citizens)"".",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pm-should-select-5-critics--hold-televised-q-a-session-on-caa-with-them--chidambaram-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/pm-should-select-5-critics--hold-televised-q-a-session-on-caa-with-them--chidambaram.html
207,13-1-20,'Gumshuda Ki Talash' for MP Sunny Deol in Pathankot,"Posters declaring Gurdaspur MP and actor Sunny Deol ""missing"" surfaced in Punjab's Pathankot district, which comes under his Lok Sabha constituency.

The posters were pasted at public places, including near the railway station, and read, “Gumshuda Ki Talash MP Sunny Deol.”

It was not known who pasted the posters.

However, Deol said in a video message on his Twitter handle on Monday that his political rivals were behind the ""senseless"" act.

""I have learnt that my rivals are talking some senseless things about me,” Deol said, promising voters to bring some “big projects” to the Gurdaspur constituency in the future.

He also said the traffic problem in Pathankot city would be addressed by the narrow gauge elevated project as the Centre has sanctioned funds for it.

""I have been able to do such things because of the strength of faith you reposed in me. I will bring some big projects in the future because your faith is my strength,"" Deol said.

But Congress leader and Anandpur Sahib MP Manish Tewari said the “same thing” happened to Deol's father and veteran actor Dharmendra when he was a lawmaker from Bikaner Lok Sabha seat.

""Not Suprising same thing happened to his father Dharmendra in Bikaner. Gurdaspur missed the chance of a good man @sunilkjakhar representing them again. Would have added to @INCIndia 's strength in Parliament,"" Tewari tweeted.

In July last year, Deol had faced flak from the Congress over the appointment of a ""representative"" to stand in for him in his constituency. Deol had appointed Gurpreet Singh Palheri, a writer, as his representative to ""attend meetings and follow important matters"".

The Congress said it was a ""betrayal"" of the voters' mandate.

In 2019 parliamentary polls, Deol defeated Congress nominee Sunil Jakhar by a margin of 82,459 votes on Gurdaspur seat.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-gumshuda-ki-talash--for-mp-sunny-deol-in-pathankot-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/-gumshuda-ki-talash--for-mp-sunny-deol-in-pathankot.html

Addressing a meeting of the Opposition attended by leaders of 20 parties, Gandhi said there have been nation-wide spontaneous protests by youths supported by citizens from all walks of life.

""The immediate cause is the CAA and NRC but they reflect widespread frustration and pent up anger, which is now out in the open. The response of the police in UP and Delhi has been shockingly partisan and brutal,"" the Congress chief said.

""The Prime Minister and Home Minister have misled the people. They have contradicted their own statements of only weeks ago, and continue with their provocative statements while remaining insensitive to the state suppression and violence that is increasingly becoming commonplace,"" she said.

The ""Modi-Shah government stands totally exposed"" for its inability to govern and to provide security to the people, Gandhi alleged.

The nation has watched in horror at the ""BJP-orchestrated assault"" on JNU after what happened in Jamia, BHU, Allahabad university and AMU, she said

Asserting that the NRC seems to have back-fired in Assam, Gandhi said the Modi-Shah government is now focusing on the NPR exercise that is scheduled to begin in a few months.

Contrary to the assertions of the Home Minister, it is clear that this is being done to lead to a nation-wide NRC, she claimed.

Stating that the real issue facing India today is the collapse of economic activity, she alleged that the prime minister and the home minister have no answers and want to divert the nation's attention from ""this grim reality by raising one divisive and polarizing issue after another"".

""Narendra Modi should stand up and have the courage to speak to the youngsters of these universities on why the economy has become a disaster, why has it become a basket case and why unemployment in India is at its highest in 50 years.

211,13-1-20,HC verdict likely on Tuesday on ED plea challenging bail granted to businessman Ratul Puri,"The Delhi High Court is scheduled to pronounce on Tuesday its verdict on the Enforcement Directorate's (ED) plea to set aside bail granted to businessman Ratul Puri, nephew of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath, in a money laundering case connected with the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam.

Justice Suresh Kait on December 13, 2019 reserved judgement on the plea of ED which had contended its objections against grant of bail to Puri were not considered by the trial court.

It had also contended that grant of relief to him was an arbitrary exercise of power by the trial court and added that Puri was capable of influencing witnesses and destroying evidence in the case and these aspects were not appreciated by the lower court.

The ED had also told the court that anticipatory bail plea of Puri was rejected for the reason that he could influence witnesses and destroy evidence and for the same reasons, he ought not to have been granted regular bail.

Opposing ED's contentions, Puri's lawyers had told the court that there was ""no overwhelming evidence"" to warrant cancellation or setting aside of the bail granted to him on December 2, 2019 by a trial court.

Granting him the relief, the trial court had directed Puri, who was in the ED custody since September 4, not to ""tamper with evidence"" or ""try to contact or influence the witnesses"".

In the present VVIP chopper scam case, Puri was named as an accused in the sixth chargesheet filed by the ED.

The trial court had noted that the ""co-accused having similar or greater role than the role of present accused have already been enlarged on bail.""

According to the ED, the role of Puri was that his foreign entities received proceeds of crime directly from Interstellar Technologies Ltd, a co-accused in the case, and that he had received funds from both the chains of money laundering involved in the present matter.

The ED had filed the supplementary prosecution complaint (ED's equivalent to a charge sheet) against Puri and Jaspreet Ahuja in the Rs 3,600-crore AgustaWestland VVIP chopper deal case.

In January 2014, India had scrapped a contract with Finmeccanica's British subsidiary, AgustaWestland, for supplying 12 VVIP choppers to the Indian Air Force, over alleged breach of contractual obligations and charges of kickbacks worth Rs 423 crore being paid to secure the deal.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hc-verdict-likely-on-tuesday-on-ed-plea-challenging-bail-granted-to-businessman-ratul-puri-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/hc-verdict-likely-on-tuesday-on-ed-plea-challenging-bail-granted-to-businessman-ratul-puri.html

Defence counsel requested the Anti-Terrorism Court-I Lahore for adjournment of the hearing against Saeed in the terror financing case, saying the JuD chief needed more time to record his statement, a court official told PTI after the in-camera hearing.

The court accepted the request of Saeed's counsel and adjourned the hearing till Tuesday.

In the last hearing on Friday, a questionnaire was handed over to Saeed in the ATC regarding charges of terror financing against him.

Deputy Prosecution General Abdur Rauf submitted the questionnaire for Saeed in the ATC which was handed over to him for reply.

Earlier, the cross examination of prosecution witnesses, including some revenue officers, by the defense counsel concluded. The prosecution had produced a number of witnesses against Saeed and his three close aides.

The ATC had indicted Saeed and others on December 11 in the terror financing case.

The Counter Terrorism Department had registered 23 FIRs against Saeed and his accomplices on the charges of terror financing in different cities of Punjab province and arrested him on July 17. He is held at the Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore.

Saeed-led JuD is believed to be the front organisation for the LeT which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans.

The US Department of the Treasury has designated Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. The US, since 2012, has offered a USD 10 million reward for information that brings Saeed to justice.

Saeed's indictment followed growing international pressure on Pakistan to stop militant groups from collecting funds in the country and to take immediate action against those still involved in militant activities.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hafiz-saeed-seeks-more-time-from-pak-court-to-record-statement-in-terror-financing-case-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/hafiz-saeed-seeks-more-time-from-pak-court-to-record-statement-in-terror-financing-case.html

Pankaj Mishra, Vasker Vijay Mech and Ghose were questioned by the crime branch's officers, they said.

The trio are among the nine suspects whose pictures were recently released by police following the January 5 violence in which 35 students, including Ghosh, were injured.

Last week, the Delhi Police claimed that the violence at JNU was a fallout of tensions brimming on the campus since January 1 over the registration process.

Ghosh is among the seven out of the total nine suspects, who are from Left-leaning student organisations while two suspects are from the the RSS-affiliated Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP).

Besides Ghosh, Mishra and Mech, Dolan Samanta, Priya Ranjan, Sucheta Talukdar and Chunchun Kumar (an alumni) had been named as suspects by the police.

Vikas Patel and Yogendra Bharadwaj, both from ABVP, are among the nine suspects in the case.

According to the police, Akshat Awasthi and Rohit Shah, who featured in a sting operation conducted by a TV news channel, have also been served notices to join the investigation.

Police have also identified the masked woman, seen in the purported videos of the violence shared on social media, as Komal Sharma, who was wearing a check shirt, light blue scarf and carrying a stick.

Sharma, who is a student of Daulat Ram College, has also been sent a notice to join the probe, the police said, adding her phone was found to be switched off since Saturday night.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/jnu-violence--delhi-police-questions-jnusu-president-ghosh--two-others-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/jnu-violence--delhi-police-questions-jnusu-president-ghosh--two-others.html
214,13-1-20,"UK Queen to meet Prince Harry, Meghan over royal couple's future roles","Queen Elizabeth II will meet her grandson Prince Harry for face-to-face talks on Monday to discuss the future roles for him and his wife Meghan Markle following the couple's bombshell announcement that they want to ""step back"" from Britain's royal duties.

Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, his brother William, the Duke of Cambridge, and their father Charles, the Prince of Wales, have all been invited to the emergency meeting at the Queen's Sandringham estate in Norfolk, while Meghan, who is in Canada with the couple's eight-month-old son Archie, is expected to join the discussion over phone.

The meeting will be the first time the 93-year-old monarch has come face-to-face with Harry since the Sussex crisis exploded. It will determine the couple's future roles and decide if they will retain their royal titles as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

The couple made their bombshell announcement on Wednesday that they intend to ""step back"" from being frontline royals, split their time between the UK and North America, and work towards becoming ""financially independent"".

According to royal insiders, the so-called Sandringham Summit is expected to thrash out some of the key details, but a complete resolution to the couple's expressed wish to split their time between the UK and North America and become financially independent is unlikely to be achieved at the end of Monday's meeting.

There are likely to be tax implications as a result of such unprecedented changes to their residential and financial status as royals.

A concrete plan is expected to be broadly agreed and publicly announced some time in the coming week, with details left to be fleshed out over time.

Some of the issues to be discussed at the crisis talks would include how much ""official"" royal work Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, will do in the UK and overseas on behalf of the royal family and the government.

It will also discuss Harry and Meghan's His and Her Royal Highness titles, and how they will be styled; how much money they might receive from the Queen and Prince Charles once their Sovereign Grant public funding is cut; and what commercial deals the couple might be allowed to strike.

The crunch meeting presided over by the 93-year-old monarch, being dubbed a family showdown, will present Harry with a range of draft written proposals – compiled by a team of aides and private secretaries.

The Queen traditionally remains at Sandringham in the Norfolk county of England after Christmas until February 6, the anniversary of the death of her father, King George VI.

""The family will gather on Monday at Sandringham to talk things through. The Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and the Duke of Sussex will meet for the first time,""a Buckingham Palace source was quoted as saying by 'The Telegraph' on Sunday.

""Following a series of meetings and consultations across the last few days there are a range of possibilities for the family to review which take into account the thinking the Sussexes outlined earlier in the week,"" the report said.

The aide stressed that this was not a simple deal to strike as making a change to the working life and role in the monarchy for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex required ""complex and thoughtful discussion"".

""Next steps will be agreed at the meeting and the request for this to be resolved at pace is still Her Majesty's wish. The aim remains for this to be in days, not weeks. There is genuine agreement and understanding that any decision will take time to be implemented,"" the source said.

It is hoped that when a deal is finally agreed for the way in which the Sussexes will spend their future lives, it will form a blueprint for future royal generations, including Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis – the children of William and Kate who are not in the direct line of succession for the British crown.

Meanwhile, William has spoken of his ""sadness"" at the broken bond with his younger brother.

According to 'The Times', William told a friend: ""I've put my arm around my brother all our lives and I can't do that any more; we're separate entities"".

""I'm sad about that. All we can do, and all I can do, is try and support them and hope that the time comes when we're all singing from the same page. I want everyone to play on the team,"" the 37-year-old second in line to the British throne was quoted as saying on Sunday.

The brothers were seen as being close until a split emerged months after Harry's wedding to Markle in May 2017 when they decided to divide up their joint charitable foundation.

Harry is due to make his first public appearance on Thursday since renouncing his senior royal role, when he will host the Rugby League World Cup 2021 draws for the wheelchair tournaments, at Buckingham Palace.

The royal family was said to be ""hurt"" and ""blindsided"" by the couple's shock announcement, which they said was finalised after ""many months of reflection and internal discussions"".",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/uk-queen-to-meet-prince-harry--meghan-over-royal-couple-s-future-roles-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/uk-queen-to-meet-prince-harry--meghan-over-royal-couple-s-future-roles.html

216,13-1-20,Nirbhaya gangrape case: Dummy execution of four convicts performed in Tihar,"A dummy execution of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gangrape case was performed at the Tihar Jail here, prison officials have said.

A Delhi court had on January 7 issued death warrants against all the four convicts -- Mukesh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) -- and ordered they be hanged on January 22 at 7 am in Tihar jail, over seven years after the brutal crime sparked outrage and anger across the country.

A team of prison officials performed the dummy execution on Sunday. The officials recorded the weights of the convicts and the prepared the dummies accordingly with sacks filled with debris and stones, a senior jail official said.

The execution will take place on in Jail No 3, he said, adding that the UP Prison authority has confirmed that Pawan Jallad from Meerut will be sent to hang the four convicts.

The Tihar authorities had written to the Uttar Pradesh prison authorities, seeking the services of two hangmen from the state to the execution.

All the four convicts are likely to hanged simultaneously. The jail authorities were also holding conversations with them on a daily basis to ensure that they were in a good mental state, the official said.

The court order was pronounced on applications moved by Nirbhaya's parents and the prosecution (Delhi government) seeking issuance of death warrants against the convicts.

The 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya or fearless, was gang-raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012 inside a moving bus in south Delhi by six persons before being thrown out on the road.

She died on December 29, 2012 at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore.

Ram Singh, one of the six accused, allegedly committed suicide in Tihar Jail. A juvenile, who was among the accused, was convicted by a juvenile justice board and was released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term.

The only legal remedy now left with the four convicts is to approach the Supreme Court with curative petitions to seek relief from the capital punishment.

The convicts can also avail the constitutional remedy of filing mercy pleas with the President.

Advocates for the convicts have said they will soon approach the apex court with the curative petitions and will also seek a stay on the death warrants till the disposal of the curative plea.

A curative petition is the last legal recourse available to a person and it is generally considered in-chamber.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nirbhaya-gangrape-case--dummy-execution-of-four-convicts-performed-in-tihar-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/nirbhaya-gangrape-case--dummy-execution-of-four-convicts-performed-in-tihar.html

218,13-1-20,"Nationwide NRC needless, has no justification: Nitish","Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday asserted that a nationwide implementation of National Register of Citizens (NRC) was needless and had no justification.

He made the remarks on the floor of the state assembly while thanking the House members for unanimously approving a constitutional amendment for extending quotas to SCs and STs by another 10 years.

Referring to an impassioned speech made by Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav, who had demanded that the chief minister, who is an ally of the BJP, come clean on the issue of Citizenship (Amendment) Act, NRC and National Population Register (NPR), Kumar wondered from where did this talk of NRC sprung up?

The country is witnessing huge turmoil on these issues (CAA, NRC and NPR), Kumar said, adding that we should keep in mind that NRC was an exercise confined to Assam as part of the accord signed by the Rajiv Gandhi government.

A natiowide NRC would be needless (koi zarurat nahin hai) and has no justification (koi auchitya nahin hai). We do not think any such thing is going to take place.

219,13-1-20,"Nusli Wadia withdraws defamation cases, including 3,000 cr damage suit against Ratan Tata, others","Bombay Dyeing Chairman Nusli Wadia on Monday withdrew all defamation cases including the Rs 3,000 crore suit for damages against Tata group Chairman Emeritus Ratan Tata and others.

A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde allowed Wadia to withdraw the petition in the apex court after the court recorded that Tata and others had no intention to defame him (Wadia).

""In view of the statement made by Tata that there was no intention to defame Wadia, which is in accordance with the finding of the high court, the petitioner is hereby allowed to withdraw the present petition as well as the pending suit for damages,"" the bench said.

The top court told senior advocate C A Sundaram, appearing for Wadia, that court appreciates his client for the response.

The top court had on January 6 asked Wadia and Tata to sit together and resolve their differences in the defamation case.

Wadia had filed a criminal defamation case against Ratan Tata and other directors of Tata Sons in 2016 after he was voted out of the boards of some Tata Group companies.

The bench, also comprising Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant, which was initially inclined to dispose of the matter while upholding the finding of Bombay High Court that there was no intention of defamation, adjourned the matter for January 13, after counsel for Wadia said that he would like to seek instruction from his client on the separate suit filed in the matter.

Wadia had moved the apex court challenging the Bombay High Court order of last year, quashing proceedings initiated by a Mumbai local court against Tata, Tata Sons' current chief N Chandrasekaran and eight directors in a criminal defamation case filed by him.

On December 15, 2018, a magistrate court in Mumbai had issued notices to Tata and the others in the case.

Wadia filed the defamation case in 2016 after he was voted out of the boards of some Tata Group companies, and claimed that Tata and others made defamatory statements against him after they removed Cyrus Mistry on October 24, 2016 as the chairman of Tata Sons.

Tata and others had then approached the high court seeking to quash and set aside the proceedings initiated against them.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nusli-wadia-withdraws-defamation-cases--including-3-000-cr-damage-suit-against-ratan-tata--others-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/nusli-wadia-withdraws-defamation-cases--including-3-000-cr-damage-suit-against-ratan-tata--others.html

221,13-1-20,"Bengal guv convenes all-party meet to discuss pending bills, CPI(M), Cong non-committal","Hours after West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Monday invited Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and leaders of legislature parties to discuss issues pertaining to two bills, CPI(M)'s Sujan Chakraborty expressed his inability to attend the meeting due to a prior commitment.

Echoing similar sentiment, senior Congress leader Abdul Mannan said he would have to be at an event in Delhi the day before and a decision would be taken on the meeting following consultations with the party's central leadership.

Earlier in the day, the governor had taken to Twitter to convene an all-party meet on January 17 to seek ""guidance"" and a ""way forward"" on two bills -- West Bengal (Prevention of Lynching) Bill, 2019 and West Bengal State Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Bill, 2019 -- which have been passed by the Assembly and were waiting for his consent.

""@MamataOfficial. I have invited leaders of the Legislature Parties in the Legislative Assembly on 17.1.2020 at 12 noon at Raj Bhavan, Kolkata as regards pendency of West Bengal (Prevention of Lynching) Bill, 2019 and West Bengal State Commission for SC and ST Bill 2019,"" he tweeted.

In a letter attached with the tweet, he said, ""As regards both the Bills, highest attention is being bestowed by me for their consideration at my end, essential inputs have been sought from the West Bengal legislative assembly as also the state government.

""In spite of repeated serious efforts at my end, the requisite information is not forthcoming and that has resulted in further appropriate consideration of the Bill in terms of the Constitution.""

Apart from Banerjee, the letter was forwarded to Mannan, Chakraborty, and leaders of the RSP, the AIFB, CPI, GJM and the BJP.

""The step was being taken for this meeting as on one hand the inputs are not being made available and on the other hand, total factually untenable information is being put in public domain both at the level of the Assembly as also the state government,"" Dhankhar wrote on his Twitter handle.

Shortly after, Mannan told a press meet here that a Congress delegation had earlier met the governor to point out ""unwanted changes"" made in the original draft of lynching prevention bill, but the party had no reservations regarding the SC-ST bill.

""We will decide about the issue (meeting the governor) after talking to the central leadership of our party. There is

An event scheduled on January 16 in Delhi, which I will attend. We will take a decision after considering all these factors,"" the leader of opposition in the Assembly said.

CPI(M) legislator Sujan Chakraborty stated that he was ready to sit with the governor for a discussion on the bills, but not on the proposed date.

""Due to a prior commitment on January 17, I can't attend the meeting with the governor. I will inform him accordingly,"" he said.

BJP state president Dilip Ghosh, however, welcomed the governor's call and said his party was positive about attending the meeting.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bengal-guv-convenes-all-party-meet-to-discuss-pending-bills--cpi-m---cong-non-committal-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/bengal-guv-convenes-all-party-meet-to-discuss-pending-bills--cpi-m---cong-non-committal.html
222,13-1-20,3 Hizbul terrorists killed in J&K gunfight,"A joint team of security forces on Sunday neutralised three terrorists of pro-Pakistan Hizbul Mujahideen terror outfit in Tral area of Awantipora.

The operation was launched by the security forces after receiving a tip off about the presence of terrorists in the area.

223,13-1-20,Shringla calls on Trump at Oval Office before leaving for India,"Outgoing Indian Ambassador to the US Harsh Vardhan Shringla called on President Donald Trump at the Oval Office of the White House before leaving the country and thanked him for strengthening the Indian-American relationship.

It is probably for the first time that a US President has met an outgoing Indian Ambassador, which experts say is reflection of the significance Trump attaches to the India-US partnership.

""Amb Harsh Shringla, who is proceeding to New Delhi to take up his assignment as Foreign Secretary, called on Trump at Oval Office of the White House and thanked him for his steadfast support for strengthening the India-US strategic partnership,"" the Indian Embassy in Washington DC said in a tweet on Sunday.

Shringla, 57, is scheduled to take up the next assignment as India's Foreign Secretary on January 29.

Shringla, who arrived in the US on January 9, 2019, and presented his credentials to Trump at the White House two days later on January 11, played a key role in bringing the India-US relationship back on track, especially in the second half of the year.

""I give Harsh Shringla great credit for his tireless pursuit in taking the India-US relations to a new dimension by prudently navigating the highly partisan and complicated US political arena called the US Congress. That's what I would call a real Champion Diplomat,"" New York-based Al Mason, who is an expert on global real estate investment and education, said after attending the farewell that Shringla hosted at his India House on Friday.

""He has been one of the most charismatic, persuasive and result-oriented diplomat representing India in the US. He has spent each hour of his tenure in pursuit of building the most solid bridge between India and the US,"" Mason said.

Before taking Dubai-bound Emirates flight from the Dallas International airport Sunday morning, Shringla tweeted, ""A final goodbye"", along with his pictures, one in the lawns of India House – the official residence – and another at the entrance of the Indian Embassy in downtown Washington DC.

""All the best to my colleague,"" tweeted Emily Haber, the German Ambassador to the US.

In a lighter tone, she said her counterpart in New Delhi, Walter J Lindner, ""is looking forward to meeting you and to giving you a ride in his bright red Hindustan Ambassador!"". Haber posted a picture of the Red Ambassador too.

""Dare say this red Ambassador looks better than the iconic Volkswagen Beatle,"" commented India's Deputy Ambassador to the US Amit Kumar.

""Bon Voyage & best wishes to Amb Shringla as he moves to Delhi for his next imp (ortant) assignment. It has been a privilege to work closely with him these past few months to advance & consolidate the India-US Strategic Partnership,"" Kumar tweeted. ""Bitter sweet moments in Washington this evening wishing. Ambassador Shringla adieu from the US but knowing that he will be shepherding us from Delhi,"" tweeted Sandeep Chakravorty, the Indian Consul General in New York.

Envoys of several diplomatic missions, including those from neighbouring nations and African countries, had attended Shringla's farewell, reflecting his popularity in the Washington's diplomatic community.

Before leaving the country, Shringla met top US Congressional leaders, including House of Representatives Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and thanked him ""for his understanding and support"" of India-US relations. He also called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

""Saying farewell isn't easy, especially when it's to a valued partner & friend,"" tweeted Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Alice G Wells.""It's been a pleasure working with you to make US India relationship the strongest it's ever been. Congrats on FS appointment & looking forward to continuing our partnership,"" she said on the eve of Shringla's departure.

224,13-1-20,Sad people more prone to become chain smokers,"Sadness, and not all negative emotions, lead people to smoking and turn it into an addictive behaviour, a first-of-its-kind set of four inter-woven studies has revealed.

A team of researchers based at Harvard University discovered that sadness plays an especially strong role in triggering addictive behaviour relative to other negative emotions like disgust.

""The conventional wisdom in the field was that any type of negative feeling, whether it's anger, disgust, stress, sadness, fear or shame, would make individuals more likely to use an addictive drug,"" said lead researcher Charles A. Dorison, a Harvard Kennedy School doctoral candidate.

""Our work suggests that the reality is much more nuanced than the idea of 'feel bad, smoke more.' Specifically, we find that sadness appears to be an especially potent trigger of addictive substance use,"" Dorison explained in a new report published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

In the first study, researchers examined data from a national survey that tracked 10,685 people over 20 years.

They found that self-reported sadness among participants was associated with being a smoker and with relapsing back into smoking one and two decades later.

In the second study, the team tried to figure out whether sadness cause people to smoke, or were negative life events causing both sadness and smoking.

To test this, 425 smokers were recruited for an online study who watched video clips.

The findings showedthat individuals in the sadness condition - who watched the sad video and wrote about a personal loss - had higher cravings to smoke than both the neutral group and the disgust group.

A similar approach in the third study measured actual impatience for cigarette puffs rather than mere self-reported craving.

Similar to the second study, nearly 700 participants watched videos and wrote about life experiences that were either sad or neutral.

Those in the sadness group proved to be more impatient to smoke sooner than those in the neutral group.

""The result built upon previous research findings that sadness increases financial impatience, measured with behavioural economics techniques,"" the authors wrote.

The fourth study recruited 158 smokers to test how sadness influenced actual smoking behaviour.

Participants had to abstain from smoking for at least eight hours (verified by carbon monoxide breath test).

They were randomly assigned to sadness or neutral control groups.

The results: smokers in the sadness condition made more impatient choices and smoked greater volumes per puff.

""We believe that theory-driven research could help shed light on how to address this epidemic,"" Dorison said.

Yusaku Maezawa, who sold his online fashion company Zozo Inc to SoftBank Group in September last year, is looking for singletons aged over 20 for a documentary titled ""Full Moon Lovers"" to be aired on the local streaming service AbemaTV.

""The female applicants must be interested in going to space and able to participate in the preparation for it and be someone who wishes for world peace,"" read the information on the AbemaTV website.

Maezawa who is worth $2 billion (according to Forbes) would then select his Moon partner in March. He is the first tourist Musk will send into space.

""Born in Japan. After high school, I made my rock band debut. I then founded a fashion EC aZOZOTOWN'. TSE-listed and gained a market worth of $15 billion. In September 2019, I sold it to Softbank Group and stepped down as CEO. My net worth is now $2 billion (Forbes),"" tweeted Maezawa.

In September 2018, SpaceX unveiled the first private passenger it plans to fly around the Moon. Maezawa, now 43, announced: ""I choose to go to the Moon.""

The flight onboard the Big Falcon Rocket (BFR) -- a launch system that was unveiled by Musk in 2016 -- represented ""an important step toward enabling access for everyday people who dream of travelling to space"".

On New Year's Eve, the online shopping mogul posted a tweet to give away 1 billion yen (around $9 million) to the Twitter users, to see if money improves their happiness.

""In 2019, I did a 100 million yen giveaway on Twitter (1M yen to 100 winners). I hold the record for the most retweeted tweet. In 2020, I did a giveaway of up to 1 billion yen. This social experiment will study the effects of UBI (universal basic income). Will you be happier if you were given 1M yen?"" he tweeted earlier.

All they needed to do was to retweet his tweet before midnight on January 7. Each one of the 1,000 winners received a million yen each (nearly $9,100).

In January 2019, he did the same and distributed 100 million yen ($914,000) to 100 Twitter users. At that time, his tweet was retweeted for a record 4.68 million times.

226,13-1-20,Iran Guards say missiles did not aim to kill US troops,"Iran's Revolutionary Guards said Sunday they did not aim to kill US troops when firing a wave of missiles last week at Iraqi bases hosting American forces.

""Our aim was not really to kill enemy soldiers. That was not important,"" the Guards' commander, Hossein Salami, told parliament, referring to Wednesday's missile operation launched to avenge the killing of a top Iranian general.

""The physical destruction (caused by the missiles) was just because we wanted to say that we are so much more superior to the enemy (and) that we can hit any point we choose,"" he added, in a speech aired on state television.

Iran launched a wave of missiles at bases in Iraq hosting American and other foreign troops on Wednesday.

The US said no American personnel were harmed in those missile attacks on Iraqi soil.

The Iranian operation was carried out in response to the killing of Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Guards' Quds Force, in a January 3 US drone strike near Baghdad airport.

Hours after launching the missiles on Wednesday, Iran shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane soon after it took off from Tehran, killing all 176 people aboard in what it later admitted was a catastrophic error.

The Guards' aerospace commander General Amirali Hajizadeh accepted full responsibility for the downing of the Boeing 737 on Saturday.

Salami was briefing the Iranian parliament about the incidents in a closed session on Sunday after being ordered to testify by President Hassan Rouhani.

Iran has invited experts from Canada, France, Ukraine and the United States to take part in the investigation into the air disaster.

""We didn't touch anything,"" Salami told deputies.

""We didn't move the wreckage of the aircraft, we didn't change the scene, we didn't move the air defence system, and we didn't (alter) the radar readings,"" he said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/iran-guards-say-missiles-did-not-aim-to-kill-us-troops-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/iran-guards-say-missiles-did-not-aim-to-kill-us-troops.html

228,13-1-20,Pope Benedict XVI breaks silence to reaffirm priest celibacy,"Retired Pope Benedict XVI has broken his silence to reaffirm the value of priestly celibacy, co-authoring a bombshell book at the precise moment that Pope Francis is weighing whether to allow married men to be ordained to address the Catholic priest shortage.

Benedict wrote the book, ""From the Depths of Our Hearts: Priesthood, Celibacy and the Crisis of the Catholic Church,"" along with his fellow conservative, Guinean Cardinal Robert Sarah, who heads the Vatican's liturgy office and has been a quiet critic of Francis.

The French daily Le Figaro published excerpts of the book late Sunday; The Associated Press obtained galleys of the English edition, which is being published by Ignatius Press.

Benedict's intervention is extraordinary, given he had promised to remain ""hidden from the world"" when he retired in 2013 and pledged his obedience to the new pope. He has largely held to that pledge, though he penned an odd essay last year on the sexual abuse scandal that blamed the crisis on the sexual revolution of the 1960s.

His reaffirmation of priestly celibacy, however, gets to the heart of a fraught policy issue that Francis is expected to weigh in on, and could well be considered a public attempt by the former pope to sway the thinking of the current one.

The implications for such an intervention are grave, and are likely to fuel renewed anxiety about the unprecedented situation of two popes, one retired and one reigning, living side by side in the Vatican gardens.

The authors clearly anticipated that potential interpretation, and stressed in their joint introduction that they were penning the book ""in a spirit of filial obedience, to Pope Francis.""

Francis has said he would write a document based on the outcome of the October 2019 synod of bishops on the Amazon. A majority of bishops at the meeting called for the ordination of married men to address the priest shortage in the Amazon, where the faithful can go months without having a Mass.

Francis has expressed sympathy with the Amazonian plight. While he has long reaffirmed the gift of a celibate priesthood in the Latin rite church, he has stressed that celibacy is a tradition, not doctrine, and therefore can change, and that there could be pastoral reasons to allow for a exception in a particular place.

Benedict addresses the issue head-on in his chapter in the brief book, which is composed of a joint introduction and conclusion penned by Benedict and Sarah, and then a chapter apiece inbetween.

True to his theological form, Benedict's chapter is dense with biblical references and he explains in scholarly terms what he says is the ""necessary"" foundation for the celibate priesthood that dates from the times of the apostles.

""The priesthood of Jesus Christ causes us to enter into a life that consists of becoming one with him and renouncing all that belongs only to us,"" he writes.

""For priests, this is the foundation of the necessity of celibacy but also of liturgical prayer, meditation on the Word of God and the renunciation of material goods."" Marriage, he writes, requires man to give himself totally to his family.

""Since serving the Lord likewise requires the total gift of a man, it does not seem possible to carry on the two vocations simultaneously. Thus, the ability to renounce marriage so as to place oneself totally at the Lord's disposition became a criterion for priestly ministry.""

The joint conclusion of the book makes the case even stronger, acknowledging the crisis of the Catholic priesthood that it says has been ""wounded by the revelation of so many scandals, disconcerted by the constant questioning of their consecrated celibacy."" Dedicating the book to priests of the world, the two authors urge them to persevere, and for all faithful to hold firm and support them in their celibate ministry.

""It is urgent and necessary for everyone—bishops, priests and lay people—to stop letting themselves be intimidated by the wrong-headed pleas, the theatrical productions, the diabolical lies and the fashionable errors that try to put down priestly celibacy,"" they write.

""It is urgent and necessary for everyone—bishops, priests and lay people—to take a fresh look with the eyes of faith at the Church and at priestly celibacy which protects her mystery.""

The book is being published at a moment of renewed interest — and confusion — in popular culture about the nature of the relationship between Francis and Benedict, thanks to the Netflix drama, ""The Two Popes.""

The film, starring Anthony Hopkins as Benedict and Jonathan Pryce as Francis, imagines a days-long conversation between the two men before Benedict announced his historic resignation — conversations in which their different views of the state of the church become apparent.

Those meetings never happened, and the two men didn't know one another well before Francis was elected to succeed Benedict. But while the film takes artistic liberties for the sake of narrative, it gets the point across that Francis and Benedict indeed have very different points of view — which the new book bears out .",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ex-pope-benedict-rejects-opening-up-priesthood-to-married-men-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/pope-benedict-xvi-breaks-silence-to-reaffirm-priest-celibacy.html
229,13-1-20,Register drones by Jan 31 or face action: Aviation Min,"The Aviation Ministry on Monday announced a scheme providing a window up to January 31 for voluntary registration of all drones and their operators, days after top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani was killed in a US drone attack.

Those who fail to register will face action under the Indian Penal Code and the Aircraft Act.

In a notice, the ministry said, ""The presence of such drones as well as drone operators has come to the notice of the government which do not comply with the CAR (civil aviation requirements).""

""In order to facilitate the identification of civil drones and drone operators, a one-time opportunity for voluntary disclosure of such drones and drone operators is being provided... All persons in possession of drones are required to complete the process (of online registration) by January 31, 2020,"" it added.

The number of illegal drones in India is likely to be between 50,000 and 60,000, co-chair of a FICCI committee on drones, Ankit Mehta, had said on October 22 last year.

Major General Soleimani, 62, the head of Iran's elite al-Quds force and architect of its regional security apparatus, was killed when a US military drone fired missiles at his convoy while it was leaving the Baghdad International Airport on January 3.

A senior Indian government official said the attack ""precipitated the government to take action to regulate hundreds of non-compliant drones"" that are operating in the country.

""What happened at Gatwick airport in December 2018 was already there on our mind,"" the official added.

Gatwick airport, Britain's second-busiest after Heathrow airport, remained closed from December 19-21, 2018, when multiple rogue drones were seen flying over the perimeter fence. During the three-day period, around 1,000 flights had to be cancelled or diverted to prevent any untoward incident.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on August 27, 2018, had issued the CAR to regulate the use of civilian drones in the Indian airspace.

Under these regulations, a process has been prescribed for drone operators to obtain Unique Identification Number (UIN), Unmanned Aircraft Operator Permit (UAOP) and other permissions.

Called the ""No Permission-No Take Off"" regulation, a drone operator has to use the DGCA's software programme DigiSky to obtain valid permissions before operating drones in India.

In the notice issued on Monday, the ministry said, ""On successful submission of voluntary disclosure of possessing drone, a Drone Acknowledgement Number (DAN) and an Ownership Acknowledgement Number (OAN) will be issued online which will help in validation of operation of drones in India.""

However, the DAN and the OAN do not confer any right to operate drones in India if it does not fulfil the DGCA's drone regulations, the ministry clarified.

""Further, ownership of drones in India without a valid DAN or OAN shall invite penal action as per applicable laws. This database will be issued to process each case as per the regulations by seeking further information, if required,"" the ministry stated.

Smit Shah, Director - Partnerships, Drone Federation of India (DFI), said on Monday,""We believe that such a step taken by the Ministry of Civil Aviation will provide an accurate number of existing drones in India.""

""This data should ideally become the base for understanding the scale of drone operations in India and for taking further policy decisions. This may enable flying of drones easily in the future while maintaining high standards of safety, security and accountability.” said Shah.

The Drone Federation of India (DFI) is an association of drone companies such as Asteria Aerospace, Quidich Innovation Labs, AutoMicroUAS, Aarav Unmanned Systems and Indrones.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/register-drones-by-jan-31-or-face-action--aviation-min-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/register-drones-by-jan-31-or-face-action--aviation-min.html

231,13-1-20,"TMC first to protest against CAB, none can question its Credentials : Mamata","West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday claimed that her party TMC was the first to voice its protest to the Parliamentary Standing Committee against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill and none can question its opposition to the amended Citizenship Act.

She claimed that the Parliamentary Standing Committee record clearly states that TMC was the first to air its opposition to the CAB at the committee's meeting and asked the opposition parties who were speaking against her to check it.

Slamming the Left parties and the Congress who blamed her for a ""secret understanding"" with Prime Minister Narendra Modi without naming them, Banerjee said ""None can question or doubt mine and TMC's credentials in fighting against the CAA, the NRC and NPR"".

The two opposition parties had criticised her and charged her with having a ""secret understanding"" with the prime minister for meeting him at the Raj Bhavan on Saturday after his arrival to the state and sharing the stage with him at the inauguration of the sound and light show at the Howrah Bridge by Modi.

The chief minister, who was addressing an anti-CAA protest rally by Trinamool Congress Chatra Parishad (TMC stundents wing) also hit out at BJP saying ""They (BJP) have made PAN, Aadhaar, ration cards invalid. We will not allow them to do that"".

Banerjee, who is a strident critic of the saffron party, iterated her call to ""fight the BJP tooth and nail as they are anti-people"".

Turning to her critics, she said ""Those who are criticising TMC have no credential. They only believe in tokenism like calling a bandh once in a year.""

Lashing out at the Congress and the Left parties, the TMC supremo said ""Have they ever taken the trouble of walking on the streets? Have they ever organised social programmes? Been on the side of the people? Some people launch movements merely to gain publicity.""

About the arson and road blockade in the state on January 8 during the nationwide general strike by trade unions, she said no agitation is successful if the protestors commit violence.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tmc-first-to-protest-against-cab--none-can-question-its-credentials---mamata-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/tmc-first-to-protest-against-cab--none-can-question-its-credentials---mamata.html
232,13-1-20,Modi slams CAA critics,"Says TMC Govt not implementing Central schemes as there is ‘no cut money’

A day after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to scrap the Citizenship Amendment Act, the PM on Sunday slammed the critics of the CAA and took a swipe at the TMC-led State Government for not implementing Central schemes saying the State is doing so as these schemes do not help “syndicates” or involve “cut money”.

Delivering a speech at Belur Math, the headquarters of Ramakrishna Mission order, on the occasion of Swami Vivekananda’s birth anniversary, Modi said, “There are some people who are vehemently opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act… (but) it is not that the BJP Government has brought the Act overnight.”

Reminding how the persecuted sections of the minority communities in Pakistan were coming to India for shelter, he wondered if “the Government should push these persecuted and tortured people back to Pakistan to die there or give them shelter and provide them citizenship!”

Responding to the loud applause, the PM said, “You seem to have understood this very clearly, but the people who are playing politics do not realise this. It is not that they do not understand this but they are purposely refusing to do so … They are misleading the people about the real import of the Citizenship Amendment Act.”

Reminding that the CAA was not meant for taking away the citizenship of the people but to provide them with one, he said, “I repeat again, Citizenship Act is not to snatch, but to give citizenship,” reminding how “after the Independence, Mahatma Gandhi ji and other big leaders of the time all believed that India should give citizenship to persecuted religious minorities of Pakistan.”

At a subsequent function at Neta ji Indoor Stadium organised by the Kolkata Port Trust to celebrate its 150 years, the PM renamed the Kolkata Port as Dr Syama Prasad Mukherjee Port. Attacking the Mamata Banerjee Government for refusing to implement Central schemes like Ayushman Bharat, the PM said, “They (Trinamool Congress Government) have been depriving the people of Bengal from implementing the central schemes because such schemes do not involve syndicates, middle men and cut money.”

Claiming that his Government had transferred Rs 43,000 crore to the accounts of the farmers directly under schemes like PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, Modi said he did not know whether such schemes would get the nod of Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee or not.

Incidentally, the Chief Minister who met the Prime Minister at the Governor’s House on Saturday and inspected a public function together with him at the iconic Millennium Park by the Hooghly River on Sunday skipped the Port Trust programme.

“I announce the renaming of the Kolkata Port Trust as Dr Syama Prasad Mukherjee Port. He is a living legend who was a leader for development and fought on the forefront for the idea of One Nation, One Constitution,” said the PM, adding how “development of waterways has improved Kolkata Port Trust’s connectivity with industrial centres in east India, making trade easier with our neighbouring countries.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/modi-slams-caa-critics-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/modi-slams-caa-critics.html
233,13-1-20,Mamata skips Kolkata Port Trust’s 150th anniv celebrations with Modi,"West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday skipped Kolkata Port Trust (KoPT) 150 years celebrations, ostensibly to avoid sharing dais with Prime Minister Narendra Modi hours after he launched a scathing attack on the critics of the CAA from Ramakrishna Mission, Belur Math.

Minister of State for Shipping Mansukh Mandaviya had personally invited Mamata to attend the event of the 150th anniversary of KoPT.

The Chief Minister on Saturday had shared the dais with Modi at a Government function.

The Bengal Opposition parties, including Trinamool Congress, Left and the Congress, slammed Modi for dragging a “pious and pure religious order” like Ramakrishna Mission into politics by using its holy, apolitical precincts to make political statements.

CPI (M) politburo Member Md Salim wondered how instead of paying tributes to Swami Vivekananda the PM could use Belur Math for political purposes.

“Rama Krishna Mission speaks about religious tolerance and they prefer seclusion from politics. But here is a Prime Minister who has not only broken that tradition but also used its platform to mislead the people of the country.”

Congress leader of Lok Sabha Adhir Chowdhury said “Swami Vivekananda believed in identifying God with humanity. He said God resides in every human being. But here the Prime Minister played a very dirty game by dragging Belur Math in his political games. This is unacceptable. This will hit the Bengali sentiment too. We are not like what Modi ji and his people think we are.”

“It is unprecedented that Belur Math has been used by a PM for the first time in the history of the country for political purposes. He made political statements from the podium of purely religious function which will not be appreciated by the followers of the order.

“Instead of reminding Swami Vivekananda’s greatness, his good messages, his preaching on religious unity, his advice to see God in every human being the Prime Minister used his birth anniversary programme as a playground for politics. This is abominable,” Chatterjee said.

Meanwhile, the overnight protest that erupted soon after the Prime Minister landed in Kolkata on Saturday afternoon continued till late in Sunday evening with people, mostly students from Congress and the Left parties taking hold of the Kolkata streets blockading its roads and protesting against the CAA and Modi.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/mamata-skips-kolkata-port-trust---s-150th-anniv-celebrations-with-modi.html
234,13-1-20,"Rain, snow likely to chill north-west India again","MeT predicts 2 successive western disturbances in a short span

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Sunday predicted another spell of rain from Monday onwards in north-west India, including the National Capital Region (NCR), due to formation of two successive western disturbances in a short span. Weather experts said the changes are going to bring chill in the air.

According to IMD, Himachal Pradesh will see another spell of snow in the coming week and a yellow warning has been issued for low hills on January 13 and an orange alert for middle and high hills. Meanwhile, fresh snowfall in Kashmir threw life out of gear in the Valley on Sunday and disrupted flight operations. Most parts of the Valley received moderate to heavy snowfall on Sunday which continued during the day.

According to Dr Kuldeep Srivastava, a senior scientist of the IMD, the first western disturbance will bring scattered rain or light rain in North West plain, including NCR on Monday. The wind speed is expected to be around 20 km per hours. The second western disturbance is expected to impact the region in quick succession during January 15 to 17 and bring rainfall over the north-western plains, including parts of Uttar Pradesh, with peak intensity on January 16. Due to change in wind direction from North westerly to South-westerly and cloudiness rise minimum temperature by 4 degrees by January 17 more than 2-3 degrees above normal.

Western disturbances are basically extra-tropical storms or low pressure systems which originate in the Mediterranean Sea and move towards Western Himalayan region to bring rain over India during winter months.

In Himachal Pradesh, 629 roads in the State, including five national highways and one State highway, are still blocked and power supply has not been completely restored in snowbound areas. More snowfall has been predicted on January 13 and 14 then again on January 15 and 16 due to western disturbances. On Monday, heavy rainfall and snowfall is likely to occur at few places in mid and high hills. Shimla would also receive snowfall on January 13,14, 16 and 17 along with other places in snowbound areas of the State.

The colour-coded warnings are issued to alert the public ahead of severe or hazardous weather and an orange alert signifies weather that has the capacity to impact significantly.

According to IMD, the plains in Jammu & Kashmir received light to moderate snowfall, the higher reaches of the Valley and Jammu and Ladakh regions experienced heavy snowfall. Srinagar city recorded two cms of snow till 8:30 am, while Pahalgam tourist resort in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district recorded nine cms, he said. Gulmarg ski-resort in Baramulla district of north Kashmir recorded eight cm of fresh snow, while Kupwara, also in the north, received 25 cms.

In Uttarakhand, a student stranded in heavy snowfall in Radighati in Uttarkashi district died while six others were rescued by police and State Disaster Relief Force personnel. 18-year-old Anuj Semwal died on way to a hospital in Badkot on Saturday after being rescued, SHO, Badkot, DS Kohli said, adding the rest of the students are safe. A group of seven students of ITI Badkot had got stranded in snow in Radighati when they were on their way home.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rain--snow-likely-to-chill-north-west-india-again-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/rain--snow-likely-to-chill-north-west-india-again.html
235,13-1-20,Centre to relieve NSG commandos of VIP duty,"CRPF’s special division to be deployed

In a major re-working of the security apparatus, Union Home Ministry has decided to relieve National Security Guard (NSG), the specialised force of black commandos, of the burden of VIP security duties. The elite task force was raised in late 1984 and was used in the security ring of many VIP for the past two decades. At present around 450 commandos are used for the protection of 13 VIPs having Z+ category security.

According to highly placed officials, CRPF’s special division handling VIP security will take over the security cover of the VIPs protected by NSG Commandos.

For the past six months, after Amit Shah became the Home Minister, there have been several major decisions regarding security cover to VIPs and other persons. First was the removal of security cover of persons who were enjoying protection for decades and then the controversial decision of withdrawal of SPG cover of Sonia Gandhi and family members.

At present, NSG Commandos are handling the security cover to Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, former Chief Ministers Mayawati, Mulayam Singh, Chandrababu Naidu, Parkash Singh Badal and Farooq Abdullah, BJP leader and former Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani. CRPF’s VIP Security division will now protect these persons.

Official said the Union Home Ministry wanted the NSG should concentrate on its original charter of handling specific tasks of counter-terrorist and anti-hijack operations. For decades, the NSG Security Cover was seen as a prestige for many leaders and controversies were raised when the leaders did not allow the guards to go back to mandatory training to the force’s head quarters.

The CRPF is currently handling the security of five ex-SPG protectees — former PM Manmohan Singh and his wife, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and her children Priyanka and Rahul. The Central Industrial Security Force protects VIPs like NSA Ajit Doval and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat among others.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/centre-to-relieve-nsg-commandos-of-vip-duty-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/centre-to-relieve-nsg-commandos-of-vip-duty.html
236,13-1-20,"Philippines on alert as volcano spews ash, lava","Lava and broad columns of ash illuminated by lightning spewed from a volcano south of the Philippine capital on Monday, grounding hundreds of flights as authorities warned of a possible ""explosive eruption"".

Fine grit coated homes and streets across the region surrounding the Taal volcano, which burst to life on Sunday accompanied by a series of earthquakes, forcing at least 10,000 people to seek refuge in evacuation centres.

""You could not sleep anymore, because every time you closed your eyes the house would shake,"" restaurant owner Lia Monteverde told AFP, saying the quakes came minutes apart.

""All of us didn't sleep at all. We just prepared to leave."" Taal sits in a picturesque lake and is one of the most active volcanoes in a nation where earthquakes and eruptions are a frightening and destructive part of life.

The Philippines sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide deep below the Earth's surface.

Schools in the region around Taal, some government offices in Manila and the Philippine Stock Exchange were closed as a precaution on Monday.

Dust masks sold out in stores as authorities warned locals that the ash could cause respiratory problems especially in the very young and those with pre-existing lung conditions.

Limited flight operations resumed mid-Monday at Manila's main international airport, nearly a day after authorities halted them due to the safety risk volcanic ash poses to planes.

However, travellers booked on over 240 cancelled flights still faced delays at Ninoy Aquino International Airport.

""I'm disappointed because this (delay) means additional expense for me and it's tiring to wait,"" said stranded traveller Joan Diocaras, a 28-year-old Filipino who works in Taiwan. ""But there's nothing we can do.""

The eruption began with an explosion of superheated steam and rock, but by early Monday ""fountains"" of lava had been spotted on Taal, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said.

Stunning lightning shows have periodically played out above the volcano in a little-understood phenomenon that is attributed to static electricity.

Authorities raised the volcano alert level to its second-highest on Sunday, saying an ""explosive eruption"" could happen in ""hours to days"".

Phivolcs chief Renato Solidum told AFP the lava was evidence of fresh movement in the volcano, but said it was unclear if Taal would ""sustain its activity"".

Government seismologists recorded magma moving towards the crater of Taal, which is located 65 kilometres (40 miles) south of Manila.

Apart from the ash, some particles up to 6.4 centimetres (2.5 inches) in diameter, larger than a golf ball, had reportedly fallen in areas around the lake, Phivolcs said. Taal's last eruption was in 1977, Solidum said.

Two years ago, Mount Mayon displaced tens of thousands of people after spewing millions of tonnes of ash, rocks and lava in the central Bicol region.

The most powerful explosion in recent years was the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, about 100 kilometres northwest of Manila, which killed more than 800 people.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/lava-gushes-from-philippine-volcano-as-ash-spreads-to-manila-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/philippines-on-alert-as-volcano-spews-ash--lava.html

243,13-1-20,1st ODI: Opening puzzle unsolved as India face full-strength Australia,"India will have to make a difficult choice between KL Rahul's consistency and Shikhar Dhawan's experience when they take on a formidable and full-strength Australia in the first ODI of a three-match series here on Tuesday.

At a time when bilateral ODI series are fast losing relevance, the three-match rubber between two top teams could give a fresh lease of life to the format.

The high-voltage rivalries that fans enjoy will be back as Rohit Sharma's elegance will be pitted against enforcer David Warner while the Virat Kohli vs Steve Smith duel will resume in earnest.

India's hungry-for-wickets pace attack led by Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami and Navdeep Saini is ready to test the Australians with subtle variations.

On the other hand, IPL's costliest foreign recruit Pat Cummins, the crafty Kane Richardson and the ever-dependable Mitchell Starc will leave no stone unturned to make life uncomfortable for Kohli and his men.

Alex Carey's gutsy batting and faultless glove-work will face the challenge of Rishabh Pant's flair.

The young Marnus Labuschagne, easily the most exciting talent spreading his wings on the international cricket map with some stellar performances in the Test arena, would like to replicate his form in the shorter formats.

For India though, the main cause of concern will be the choice between Dhawan and Rahul.

If current form is an indicator, Rahul is miles ahead to partner Rohit Sharma at the top of the order but Dhawan has had a phenomenal record in white ball cricket against the Aussies.

In fact, in their last meeting in the ODI World Cup, it was Dhawan's superb hundred that paved the way for an easy victory for the Indians.

But that was a good seven months back and Dhawan, since then, endured a spate of injuries. He also lost form only to regain a bit of it by scoring a half-century in the final T20 against Sri Lanka.

During World Cup, till Dhawan was around, KL Rahul batted at No.4 as a stop-gap solution but with Shreyas Iyer making the slot his own with a string of good scores, it will either be Dhawan or Rahul in the playing XI at the Wankhede.

""It's a good dilemma to have. Rohit is an obvious choice of course. Both of them Shikhar and Rahul are playing well. Shikhar has done well in ODIs (and) Rahul is in great form. The management will sit down and make the choice. I don't see it as an issue and one of them will have to sit out, so that's okay,"" batting coach Vikram Rathour had said on Sunday.

The Wankhede track is usually a belter and India will certainly not go with two wrist spinners considering the fate they met during the last home series in March, which India lost 2-3.

Kuldeep Yadav, who has a hat-trick against Australia, is likely to be preferred over Yuzvendra Chahal.

There is a strong possibility that this will be Kedar Jadhav's last ODI series for India unless the pint-sized Pune right-hander does something extra special.

With buzz being about his reluctance to bowl off-breaks in order to enhance his IPL career, a few good scores will be required to keep Ajinkya Rahane and Suryakumar Yadav out of equation when the Indian team for the ODI series in New Zealand is announced on January 19.

Squads:

India: Virat Kohli (Captain), Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, K L Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Kedar Jadhav, Rishabh Pant (Wicket-keeper), Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Navdeep Saini, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur and Mohammed Shami.

Australia: Aaron Finch (Captain), Alex Carey (Wicket-keeper), Patrick Cummins, Ashton Agar, Peter Handscomb, Josh Hazlewood, Marnus Labuschange, Kane Richardson, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Ashton Turner, David Warner and Adam Zampa.

244,13-1-20,Iran agrees de-escalation 'only solution' to solve crisis with US,"Iran has signalled it favours a de-escalation after 10 days of heightened tensions with the United States during which both sides fired missiles and Tehran accidentally shot down a passenger aircraft.

Security was stepped up in Iran's capital Sunday after a vigil the previous night for those killed in the air disaster turned into an angry protest and police temporarily arrested the British ambassador for being there.

US President Donald Trump warned Iran against harming demonstrators and against a repeat of a deadly crackdown against rallies in November sparked by a fuel price hike.

""To the leaders of Iran - DO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS,"" Trump tweeted Sunday in his occasional all-capitals style.

US Defense Secretary Mark Esper, however, said Trump was still willing to ""sit down and discuss without precondition a new way forward"" with Iran, although Tehran has steadfastly refused to hold talks with Washington unless it lifts sanctions first.

Tehran said it favoured an easing of tensions after its arch-enemy Washington on January 3 killed a revered Iranian general, Quds Force chief Qasem Soleimani, in a Baghdad drone strike.

In a meeting between Iran's President Hassan Rouhani and the visiting emir of Qatar, both sides agreed de-escalation is the ""only solution"" to the regional crisis, the Qatari ruler said.

Qatar hosts the largest US military base in the region but also enjoys strong ties with Iran, with which it shares the world's largest gas field.

""We agreed... That the only solution to these crises is de-escalation from everyone and dialogue,"" Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani said on what was believed to be his first official visit to the Islamic republic.

For his part, Rouhani said: ""We've decided to have more consultations and cooperation for the security of the entire region.""

Iran's president also met with visiting Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, whose country has offered to mediate between Tehran and US ally Riyadh.

In a meeting on Sunday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe warned military conflict with Iran will have an impact on global peace and stability, Japanese foreign ministry spokesman Masato Ohtaka said.

In a briefing to Parliament, Hossein Salami, commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, said the missiles it fired last Wednesday on Iraqi bases hosting US troops were not aimed at killing American personnel.

The US said no American personnel were harmed in the attacks.

Across the border in Iraq, the military said rockets slammed on Sunday into Al-Balad, an Iraqi airbase where US forces have been stationed, wounding two Iraqi officers and two airmen.

The base had held a small US Air Force contingent as well as American contractors, but a majority of these personnel had already been evacuated due to the tensions between the US and Iran, military sources told AFP.

Reacting to the latest attack, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted: ""Outraged by reports of another rocket attack on an Iraqi airbase.

""These continued violations of Iraq's sovereignty by groups not loyal to the Iraqi government must end,"" he added.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Sunday's rocket attacks. The US has previously blamed such attacks on Iran-backed groups in Iraq.

The current crisis claimed a tragic toll when Iran -- on hair-trigger alert just after attacking the Iraqi bases -- last Wednesday accidentally shot down the Ukraine International Airlines plane, killing all 176 people aboard.

After days of denial from Iran, Rouhani on Saturday admitted to ""human error"" in bringing down the Boeing 737, and the Guards' aerospace commander General Amirali Hajizadeh accepted full responsibility.

On Saturday evening, a memorial at Tehran's Amir Kabir University in honour of those killed turned into a demonstration that AFP correspondents said was attended by hundreds of students.

They shouted ""death to liars"" and demanded the resignation and prosecution of those responsible, Fars news agency reported, saying that police ""dispersed"" them.

Around the same time, police temporarily arrested the British ambassador, Rob Macaire, who had attended the vigil, sparking a fresh diplomatic crisis.

Macaire tweeted on Sunday: ""I wasn't taking part in any demonstrations! Went to an event advertised as a vigil for victims of #PS752 tragedy.""

Some Iranian newspapers also criticised the government over the downing of the jet, including how it was handled.

""Apologise, resign,"" the reformist daily Etemad headlined on Sunday, ""Unforgivable,"" the official government newspaper Iran said while Tehran's Hamshahri daily splashed ""Shame"" in blood-red letters across its front page.

Elsewhere in Tehran, tensions appeared to be mounting again, with a heavy police presence notably around the iconic Azadi Square south of the centre.

Riot police armed with water cannon and batons were seen at Amir Kabir, Sharif and Tehran universities as well as Enqelab Square.

Around 50 Basij militiamen brandishing paintball guns, potentially to mark protesters to authorities, were also seen near Amir Kabir.

On the diplomatic front, France, Germany and Britain on Sunday called on Iran to return to ""full respect"" of its commitments under its 2015 nuclear accord with world powers, despite Washington having walked out of the deal.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/iran-agrees-de-escalation--only-solution--to-solve-crisis-with-us-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/iran-agrees-de-escalation--only-solution--to-solve-crisis-with-us.html
245,13-1-20,Phase-I trade deal includes China buying USD 200 bn American products over two years: US,"China's purchase of USD 200 billion worth of additional American products over a period of two years is part of the phase one trade deal with Beijing, the US has said, as the world's two top economic powers look forward to end their bitter two-year tariff war this week.

President Donald Trump has announced last week that the US will sign the first phase of a pending trade deal with China ""probably"" on January 15.

""We're signing, as you know, a very big deal among many other things with China...Probably on January 15,"" Trump told reporters at a White House event.

China's commerce ministry on Thursday last confirmed that Vice Premier Liu will be in the US capital from Monday to Wednesday to sign the ""Phase One"" trade deal with the US.

The phase one deal signals a de-escalation in a trade war pitting the two most powerful economic giants against each other for nearly two years.

The phase one of the trade deal with China includes the country buying USD 200 billion worth of additional American products, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday.

In an interview to ABC News, he said, ""It is USD 200 billion of additional products across the board over the next two years, and, specifically, in agriculture, USD 40 billion to USD 50 billion.""

""This is a big opportunity for our farmers. I think some people have questioned whether they can produce it. The president said they are going to go out and buy more land and produce plenty of agriculture (products),"" he said in response to a question.

Describing it as a ""historic transaction"", Mnuchin said further talks would be held for the remaining phases.

""As we have said, there will be a phase two. But this is the first time we have had a comprehensive agreement with China on technology issues, agricultural issues, financial services, purchases, and has a real enforcement mechanism. So this is a big win for the president,"" he asserted.

Mnuchin said the first phase of the trade deal includes real enforcement provision.

""If they don't comply with the agreement, the president retains the authority to put on tariffs, both existing tariffs and additional tariffs,"" he said.

The language of the trade deal, he said, will be released this week.

""The day of the signing, we will be releasing the English version,"" he added.

According to him, there are very important intellectual property rules in the deal that the US expects the Chinese to adhere to.

""There are cyber concerns that we do have. So let me just be clear. Cyber will be part of phase two,"" Mnuchin said.

""But we have incorporated provisions in phase one that we think are important protections for US companies. So, we have made very clear there can be no forced technology transfer and that China is putting out laws to protect both US technology and other technology,"" he added.

Trump, who has been accusing China of indulging in unfair trade practices contributing to the huge trade deficit amounting to USD 375 billion, had earlier warned that if a deal is not reached by March 1, the end of the 90-day grace period, the US will increase the tariffs on the USD 200 billions of goods from 10 per cent to 25 per cent.

Trump has been demanding China to drastically reduce the trade deficit and ensure Intellectual property rights production for US technology and services.

The escalating trade war raised concerns in China as its economy was on the downward trend amid efforts by the government to rejig the export-dependent economy to that of relying more on domestic consumption.

Last year, the US imposed tariff hikes of up to 25 per cent on USD 250 billion of Chinese goods. The move prompted China to increase tariffs on USD 110 billion of US goods.

China is currently America's largest goods trading partner with USD 635.4 billion in total (two way) goods trade during 2017. Goods exports totalled USD 129.9 billion; goods import totalled USD 505.5 billion. The US goods trade deficit with China was a whopping USD 375.6 billion in 2017.

Trade in services with China (exports and imports) totalled an estimated USD 75 billion in 2017. Services exports were USD 57.6 billion; services imports were USD 17.4 billion. The US services trade surplus with China was USD 40.2 billion in 2017.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/phase-i-trade-deal-includes-china-buying-usd-200-bn-american-products-over-two-years--us-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/phase-i-trade-deal-includes-china-buying-usd-200-bn-american-products-over-two-years--us.html
246,13-1-20,Pak court declares special court's ruling against Musharraf 'unconstitutional',"In a major relief for Pakistan's self-exiled former military dictator, a top court here on Monday quashed Pervez Musharraf's death sentence and termed as ""unconstitutional"" the formation of a special tribunal that tried him for high treason.

The special court of Islamabad on December 17 last handed down the death penalty to 74-year-old Musharraf after six years of hearing the high-profile treason case against him. The case was filed by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government in 2013.

A three-member full bench of the Lahore High Court comprising Justices Syed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, Mohammad Ameer Bhatti and Chaudhry Masood Jahangir unanimously declared the formation of the special court against Musharraf as ""unconstitutional"".

The court also ruled that the treason case against Musharraf was not prepared in accordance with the law.

After Monday's ruling, the special court's verdict stands void, Dawn reported, quoting both the government and Musharraf's lawyers as saying.

The decision came in response to a petition filed by Musharraf challenging the formation of the special court for the high treason case against him.

In his petition, Musharraf had asked the court to set aside the special court's verdict for being illegal, without jurisdiction and unconstitutional, while also seeking suspension of the verdict till a decision on his petition was made.

Additional Attorney-General Ishtiaq Ahmad Khan earlier told the court that the formation of the special court to try Musharraf under Article 6 of the Constitution was not part of the agenda of federal cabinet meetings of the government of then prime minister Nawaz Sharif.

""The special court was constituted without the formal approval of the cabinet,"" Khan said in court. He also maintained that the charges filed against the former president were flimsy since, under the emergency powers of the executive, fundamental rights could be suspended.

Justice Naqvi had asked the federal government on Friday to submit a summary on the formation of the special court and had directed the government's lawyer to present arguments on Monday.

Musharraf ruled Pakistan from 1999 to 2008 and lives in Dubai in self-imposed exile.

The PML-N government had filed the treason case against the former army chief in 2013 over the imposition of an extra-constitutional emergency in November 2007, which led to the confinement of a number of superior court judges in their houses and sacking of over 100 judges.

In August 2008, he finally resigned in the face of impeachment proceedings by the new governing coalition, going into exile until his ill-starred homecoming in 2013, exiling himself once more three years later.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pak-court-declares-special-court-s-ruling-against-musharraf--unconstitutional--2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/pak-court-declares-special-court-s-ruling-against-musharraf--unconstitutional-.html
247,13-1-20,No trace of Army jawan after he slips in snow at LoC,"An Indian Army jawan remains untraceable after he slipped in the snow during routine patrolling and Line of Control dominating exercise in Gulmarg sector of Jammu and Kashmir, Indian Army said on Monday.

It said rescue operation is still on to trace the missing jawan.

The jawan is identified as Havildar Rajendra Singh Negi, who slipped in the snow from the slightly elevated walkway 200 meters from an Army post in Gulmarg sector on January 8, around 7.15 p.m.

Negi is from 11 Garhwal Rifles and is a resident of the Ambiwala Sainik Colony in Dehradun.

The Army said the rescue efforts are hampered by weather conditions. ""The post where it happened is 200 meters from the LoC in Gulmarg sector,"" said a senior Indian Army officer.

""All-out efforts are on to trace him,"" he said.

At the elevated walkway near the LoC, the Army erects markers for winters as snow fills both sides of the passage, making it nearly impossible to walk. The markers also guide a patrolling team, the officer said.

The Army also refuted reports that the missing jawan is in Pakistan.

250,13-1-20,Stir against 29-day Shaheen Bagh road blockade,"Deeply upset over the continued sit-in on a key road between Noida and South Delhi by anti-CAA and NRC protesters in Shaheen Bagh, residents of Sarita Vihar protested on Sunday, demanding lifting of the road blockade.

The protesters said the blockade of the road no 13A through Kalindi Kunj road, between Noida and South East Delhi and further to Faridabad by Shaheen Bagh women and other protesters since December 15 demanding scrapping of CAA has led to hardship for daily commuters and shopkeepers.

With the Delhi Police further closing the road it has resulted in traffic snarls and motorists and commuters are being forced to take longer routes, said residents, who ended their protest after getting assurance from police officials that their complaint will be addressed soon.

DCP South East Chinmoy Biswal said, “We have requested the residents not to protest on the main road which they have agreed to. Our responsibility is to ensure peace is maintained law and order.”

The Delhi High Court on Friday refused to entertain a petition seeking removal of the barricade on the Shaheen Bagh road causing traffic issues. Also, the petitioner had asked for the protesters to be shifted to some other location. Scores of protesters have been agitating in the area against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens (NRC) for over a month now.

Barricades have been put in place to keep the stir in control. The Delhi Police has time and again issued advisory regarding closure or obstruction due to traffic in the area. Also, imams of mosques and RWA have urged the protesters to lift the blockade as it is causing hardship to not only commuters but to businessmen on the road.

The prolong protest has left many commuters deeply upset. Shivani, a Noida resident, said she commutes to work in Delhi’s Sarita Vihar and now takes metro. But even that is becoming difficult as she has to change rickshaw twice during the journey, which costs her around Rs 100 on one side, she said.

“I first have to take a rickshaw to Sector 34 metro station because the metro station closest to my home is not connected with the Delhi Metro. Then I reach Botanical Garden Metro Station and from there change to Magenta Line and reach Kalkaji Metro station and again take a rickshaw to Sarita Vihar,” she said.

Another Noida resident rued that he is spending two to three hours to travel to reach his destination. Normally it took half an hour to reach my office but closure of the road has made it miserable for daily commuters like him. “The traffic has been diverted to DND and Chilla Regulator roads,” said a traffic police official.

Noida traffic police have advised commuters to opt for Delhi-Noida Direct (DND) flyway or the Chilla Regulator route for travel between Delhi and Noida.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/stir-against-29-day-shaheen-bagh-road-blockade-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/stir-against-29-day-shaheen-bagh-road-blockade.html
251,13-1-20,"night Test anywhere in Australia, asserts Kohli","Months after Tim Paine's cheeky dig at him, India captain Virat Kohli on Monday asserted that they are ready to play day/night Test at any venue in Australia later this year.

Kohli was asked about it on the eve of the three-match ODI series opener against Australia.

""We're ready and up for the challenge - whether it's Gabba, Perth... It doesn't matter to us. It's become a very exciting feature of any Test series and we're open to playing day-night Tests,"" Kohli said.

India played their maiden day/night Test against Bangladesh last November, winning the match with plenty of time to spare at the Eden Gardens.

""We played the day-night Test here, we were pretty happy with how it went. We have the skill-sets as a team now to compete against anyone in the world, anywhere, in any format of the game, whether it's white ball, red ball or pink ball, we're ready to play anything,"" Kohli asserted.

Last year, when asked about it, Paine had sarcastically remarked that his Australian team would need to ask Kohli if he was willing to play day/night Test Down Under.

""We'll certainly try and we'll have to run that by Virat (Kohli). We'll get an answer from him at some stage I'm sure. As I said we'll ask Virat and see if we can get his permission to play here and maybe even get a Pink-ball Test if he's in a good mood. Paine had said.

Australian want to play two Tests of the four-match series under lights when India tour next summer. The hosts want to start the series at the Gabba in Brisbane, where they have not lost a Test for a long time.

""India-Australia, it's not a totally new thing that we're going to experience (for) either side. The teams know each other so well, we played each other so much, and the competition has always been good. Having won last year, that gives us a lot more confidence going back,"" said Kohli.

With David Warner and Steve Smith back, the India skipper acknowledged that the upcoming tour will be a different ballgame and took note of Marnus Labuschagne's meteoric rise.

""This time around the series is going to be different, in terms of their batting challenging our bowlers. To be fair, last time around, the players were not that experienced.

""If you take out David (Warner) and Steve (Smith), Marnus (Labuschagne) came in but he played only one game. The way he's shaped up in last summer, it's amazing - so much consistency it always good to watch at the international level - and the hunger and the passion, you can see in his game,"" he added.

Kohli also admitted that it would be a challenge for his bowlers to break through the Australian batting order next summer.

""It'll be a challenge for us to break through that batting order but it's a challenge we should look forward to. We should not look forward to easy games and going to Australia, you should not expect anything easy.

""So, as I said, we want to keep challenging ourselves as a team and we're the top two sides in the table as well, in the world championship.

""I'm sure it's going to be amazing for people to watch because the series will be right up there with any of the best series we've seen in the past five-six years. We're pretty excited for it,"" said Kohli.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-ready-to-play-day-night-test-anywhere-in-australia--asserts-kohli-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/india-ready-to-play-day-night-test-anywhere-in-australia--asserts-kohli.html
