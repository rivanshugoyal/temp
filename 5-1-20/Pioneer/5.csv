SAD siding with murderers: Cong MP Bittu

Ludhiana: Congress MP from Ludhiana, Ravneet Singh Bittu accused the SAD of “siding with murderers” after the party decided to urge the Centre to commute the death sentence of Balwant Singh Rajoana, convicted for killing former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh.

The Congress MP, who is the grandson of the slain leader, lashed out at SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, saying the decision has “exposed his real face”. He said the Akalis have stood with the murderers and it has shown their real mentality among peace-loving Punjabis. He also flayed the SAD chief for visiting the house of Rajoana’s sister Kamaldeep Kaur. “Thousands of people lost their lives during the dark days of terrorism in the state and the Akalis stand in the favour of perpetrators of these crimes. It exposes their real face. It clearly shows that the Akalis led by Sukhbir supported such people, which is sad,” Bittu said. He said the former CM attained martyrdom safeguarding the rights of Punjabis and for maintaining peace and communal harmony in the state.

3,05-1-20,AAP demands arrest of Congress MLA Pritam Singh Kotbhai in Chit fund scam,"Punjab Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday has demanded dismissal of Bhucho Mandi (Bathinda) Congress MLA Pritam Singh Kotbhai from the party and his immediate arrest for alleged involvement in the fresh chit fund scam, to send out a message loud and clear to the chit fund companies in the State.

In a statement issued on Saturday, party MLAs Baljinder Kaur and Rupinder Kaur Ruby demanded that PPCC President, Sunil Jakhar, should immediately expel the party MLA, Kotabhai, from the Congress party for his alleged involvement in the chit fund scam, saying it was necessary so that he could not misuse his Punjab and Madhya Pradesh governments’ connections to evade his arrest.

The AAP leaders have demanded that Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh should order immediate arrest of the MLA and be handed over to the police of other states where cases of fraud had been registered against the MLA’s chit fund companies.

Rupinder Kaur Ruby said like the previous Badal Government, Capt Amarinder Singh Government, had been extending its patronage to the mega chit fund companies, like the Pearl and Crown.

She said that on the one hand, victims of the fraudulent deals were committing suicides for denial of justice, while on the other the owners of Pearl Company, currently under judicial custody, were given VVIP facilities in a 5-star private hospital, alleging it was not possible without the government’s blessings.

AAP MLAs alleged that the case of fraud involving 96 lakh had been registered against Kotbhai by the Jabalpur (MP) police is not the first of its kind. Prior to this the Uttarkhand and Rudarpur police had registered cases worth Rs 20 lakh in October 2018 against the chit fund companies owned by him.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aap-demands-arrest-of-congress-mla-pritam-singh-kotbhai-in-chit-fund-scam.html

6,05-1-20,Obsession with health plays havoc with ranking: Punjab Min,"Punjabis are known for their love for food. But a Punjab Cabinet Minister believed that it is their obsession to stay fit that’s playing havoc with the State’s health ranking.

Brushing aside the rankings in Niti Aayog’s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) India Index wherein Punjab slipped by two points to the 12th rank out of 36 States and Union Territories in India, State Health and Family Welfare Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu on Friday blamed the “health freaks” who go without food to ‘reduce weight’.

Just like his Cabinet colleague, State’s Forest and Social Welfare Minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot too made an inconsiderate statement asking if the people could not even cook rotis for themselves as the State Government was already providing them with atta and dal. At the same time, he advised the people to earn a living for ending starvation.

Both Ministers dismissed Niti Aayog’s report and “insensitively” claimed that nobody is starving in the State.

Notably, Punjab, which is known for its high consumption of ghee, recorded a drop by two notch on the SDG India Index and was placed at the 12th rank in 2019 out of 36 States and Union Territories.

In 2018, Punjab was positioned at tenth place by Niti Ayog in its SDG Index report and had a composite SDG figure of 71 points.

In 2018-19 report, Punjab was in the category named ‘Frontrunner’ in Goal 2 which is the ‘Zero Hunger Goal’, and now it has slipped to a lower group called ‘Performer’.

In 2019, the composite SDG figures declined to 61 and the state did not find a place among the top three States on any of the 17 parameters used for examining the States and Union Territories. Goal 2 is closely related to other goals and affects the State’s performance in those areas.

Asked about the state’s performance, Dharamsot asserted, “Punjab has never suffered from any sort of hunger crisis. Our gurus never let anyone suffer even at the time when the crops weren’t yielding enough.”

“And as far as starvation is concerned, I believe that an employed person will never suffer….Everyone should work…A person who works can never die of starvation in Punjab…These are wrong figures…If a person who is working, and dies of starvation, you can hold me accountable for it,” said Dharamsot.

In an insensitive statement, Dharamsot asserted, “We give atta (flour) and dal (cereals) free, a person can’t even make roti?”

Reacting to the drop in SDG ranking, Health Minister Sidhu completely denied that there is hunger in Punjab. “I don’t think there is anyone in Punjab who sleeps without food…Anyone who does is probably doing it to reduce weight. We, in Punjab, have such a healthy and rich diet, there is no question of anyone sleeping hungry,” he stated.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/obsession-with-health-plays-havoc-with-ranking--punjab-min.html
7,05-1-20,"A time to act, a time to kill","Even as the memories of the Hyderabad encounter of the four accused in the Disha case by the police fade from the public memory a question still arises. Was the action right? More so, in view of the fact that similar crime against women continue to happen at a nagging rate. Why such incidents take place in a country where woman symbolises “Shakti”, the power to slay evil forces. From Delhi to Unnao to Hyderabad and more, unwittingly remind us of the Mississippi courtroom drama of US that transformed a young attorney John Grisham into a world class writer of legal crime fiction. Grisham was witness to the harrowing testimony of a twelve year old rape victim that traumatised him so much that he thought if the only punishment which the rapist deserved was to be killed. And he wrote “A Time to Kill”. The action of Hyderabad police has raised certain issues that led to nationwide debate ranging from justification to castigation. But the all important issue is whether the police was right. That is, if the encounter was stage managed. What if it was not? And there is no clinching evidence to prove this. In fact, the issue of questioning police action would arise only if the encounter was fake. The question of justice is rather too complex to be settled in black and white. Many times, law and justice are in conflict. It is common saying that justice should not only be delivered, it should also appear to be delivered. When people don’t see justice being delivered there is clamor for instant justice and mass approval of the same. For some, this may be a road to anarchy but they need to be reminded that anarchy follows failure of the system of justice. The avowed motto of our criminal justice system is that even if thousand criminals escape, not a single innocent be punished. But what we find is that criminals are largely escaping taking the advantage of the cumbersome legal paraphernalia while the innocent are increasingly victimised. Hindu law giver Manu’s idea of justice needs to be revisited. In Manusmriti, it is clearly stated that in a crime committed willingly and in full knowledge of implications of wrong doing, the punishment should be much more severe than that corresponding to the crime. Rape is one such crime that is always committed willingly and in full knowledge of the implications of wrong doing. Incidentally, the Hindu law book also says that the punishment should be directly proportional to the social status of those committing it. Fair enough indications as to what fate the Unnao accused must meet, given the social hierarchy they belong to. As the demonic tendencies are on the rise, we must realise that the Hindu scriptures clearly showed that even Gods resorted to killing of the demons by unfair means for the cause of justice. Access to knowledge and information has given many people the ability to dodge the laws and the temerity to think they can get away with everything. In the case of the criminals of the infamous Nirbhaya case, the juvenile law came to the rescue of a hardened criminal. For certain types of crime and categories of criminals, then, the famous last words of Jesus Christ need to read thus: “Hang them O Lord for they know fully well what they do.” And hang them high. That is the message that needs to be given.

8,05-1-20,2020: You & your money,"What does this new year have in store for you? Astrologer and palmist, Acharya Praveen Chauhan, shares financial predictions for the year ahead

Aries: You will not only crossover all the hurdles during this period, but your imminent talent will enable you to sum-up into expected success. Stress free personal regimen is suggested. Successful overseas Business tours and new financial connections are in offing.

Taurus: This is a most compatible period for you all to start a new business — one that you have been planning since long. The relations you have built over the years will help you conquer the world. Likewise, resolve to do the same for others and help them even if it is beyond your means.

Gemini: Stars predict that you are in for big success; especially those who are in the field of e-business or related with software and multimedia. Your perceptions of competition with your rivals cannot be fructified, but your own independent vision will bring laurels to you. Compassion towards deprived shall be your boon from the heavens.

Cancer: Your businesses will touch an unexpected high in the later part of 2020. As the dictum states: “Nothing is gained without striving hard”, the Cancerians would witness an exceptional spurt in their endeavour as the year progresses. Zodiac predicts a tremendous success for all first generation entrepreneurs and start-ups.

Leo: Stars suggest that you may start a new venture. They also suggest that the project may not take off as desired. But my predictions for you in 2020 is that fortunes are with you. Though success appears shaky in the beginning, things will look up for real good towards the end of the year. For investors, a pertinent caution is inevitable.

Virgo: Stars suggest that all ventures (whatever those may be) must be initiated. Just go ahead and take the plunge. A word of caution though. Don’t let your ever inquisitive and suspicious nature dampen the spirit and thwart your own brilliant moves. Plan your finances wisely.

Libra: Partnerships are not meant for you. Go ahead if you will, but be careful not to get greedy. Even in the existing partnerships, try to be rational. Never mind the fluctuating profits throughout the year. Better to focus on new ventures. It would do good to devote the year to personal appeasement.

Scorpio: It is a good time to initiate your offspring into business of your dreams. Don’t approach the easy way, follow and comply with the whims of all concerned. Pleasure with work shall be your mantra for success.

Sagittarius: What you value most it is up to you. Choose whatever you may — work, success, gratification, appeasement, relations or financial success — just make sure not to get whimsical. Life and success is not dependent on your personal whims. Follow the rules of life.

Capricorn: Planetary configuration says that you will expand your endeavours in multidimensional spheres, in different channels in 2020. You may be on the top of the world but personal relations may cause you to be miserable, and even hamper your self esteem. Beware! You may be surrounded by a multitude of opportunities. Just stay clear of any trappings of business exigencies.

Aquarius: Don’t be upset by the failures you may have had in the past. All your decisions would be wise. You are overswayed by the sycophantic appreciation which is never in positive perception. Boon in disguise; your collaborators will support you, whether in social life or in finance.

Pisces: Have faith in yourself and not be beguiled by the circumstances as stars appear to point out. You will bounce back and even rule in the second half of the year. Take care of your emotional health and of your own personal image.

9,05-1-20,Top General’s killing delays Arab Spring in Iran,"The assassination of Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani has come at a time when the Iranian political and religious elite have been reeling under the unprecedented protests by the people who are demanding economic and democratic reforms. It has deflected the anger towards the US, but the relief for the cleric-led regime is set to be short-lived

The Islamic Republic of Iran is in a fix. In an unexpected turn of events in the country reeling under raging protests against the economic slump, Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Major General and commander of Quds Force Qassem Soleimani was assassinated by a missile fired by an American drone near Baghdad airport on Friday.

Iran is facing public backlash against a long-standing clerical rule. The writing on the wall is clear: The protest by ordinary people is a stern warning to the political and religious elite as their yearning for change. The Iranian political elite, although inscrutable, may handle the protesters as they have remained generally ruthless towards dissidents, protesters and anti-Government campaigners. But the indefatigable spirit of the commoners despite brutal crackdown is remarkable. Although this kind of resistance to the Government is not new in Iran, it is worth highlighting how such movements took their course in the recent past.

The current protests started in November. People began setting on fire buildings, cars and banks as the price of basic commodities and gasoline went through the roof. The crisis stems from the heavy sanctions imposed by the US and the European Union (EU) after US President Donald Trump backed out of the Iranian Nuke Deal, known as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, on May 8, 2019. The historic deal was signed by then US President Barack Obama on July 15, 2015. Today Iranian demonstrators are clamouring for immediate stepping down of the Mullahs as they are not able to manage the country’s economy. Meanwhile, Trump has upped the ante by saying that these mullahs have turned a prosperous pro-Western economy under the Shah of Iran before the 1979 Islamic Revolution into the current state of deterioration.

Last time people came out on roads at the end of 2017 and at the beginning of 2018 to raise their voice against the austerity budget proposed by the Government of Hassan Rouhani. More than 3,700 people were arrested and nearly 30 were killed by the security forces and intelligence agents. Initially the working class organised the campaign in the city of Mashhad. They primarily raised the issues of poverty and inequality that became rampant across the country. But soon the anti-Government strikes were spread to about 80 cities, forcing millions to descend on the streets. What was noteworthy was that the disenchanted people gradually expanded their protests and included problems such as human rights violations, corruption, women’s empowerment and foreign policy of the Government in their agenda of demands. However, the commoners and the protesters were subjected to the sheer brutality of the security apparatus.

Again in 2009, Iran witnessed a mass uprising against the presidential election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The protest, centred around the theme: “Where is my vote?”, drew millions to the Iranian streets. The protesters were able to generate a nation-wide conviction that the presidential election was rigged. Ironically, this movement came just two years before the beginning of the historic Arab Spring that swept some of the West Asian and North African nations as young people voiced their concerns against their political regimes and demanded the arrival of democratic governments. The Iranian Spring of sort as we could call it, simply registered its mark in the annals of modern political history of the country as the “Green Movement”. This distinctly underlined the anger of the youth and the common people against the deep-rooted signs of corruption and dominance of the clerics in public life.

Now, the killing of elite Quds Force commander Soleimani has aggravated the bitterness in US-Iran relations. The Quds Force is the external wing of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. For the last 20 years, Soleimani had been spearheading Iran’s external operations that included building of security networks and proxies around the West Asian region. In fact, under his guidance, Iran has been able to expand a massive intelligence and security umbrella for its Shia allies around the troubled region. Further, the pro-Iranian militias which were established under him played key roles in the ongoing Syrian civil war. Interestingly, these militias have also fought against the ISIS and its allied groups across the war-torn nations of the region. Many say that these militant Shia armies were at times decisive in driving out the Sunni-led ISIS from both Iraq and Syria.

For the Trump Administration, Soleimani was solely responsible for escalating the “shadow war” between the US, its allies and Iran in the West Asian region. Soleimani’s advanced war games created a new unease in the security network already established by the US allies such as Saudi Arabia and Israel. And his promotion of Shia militias with active support from Tehran has virtually created a new power centre for Iran. Also throughout these years, Soleimani was able to help Iran projecting as the unquestionable Shia hegemon of the region. It must be noted here that in April last year, the US designated the IRGC as a terrorist group and blacklisted the Quds Force. Following the US decision, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia too had declared the IRGC as a terrorist group.

The most interesting aspect of the IRGC is that it solely functions under the command of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as its main objective is to protect the Islamic system in the country. Broadly speaking, the IRGC’s ideology is based on, “Khomeinism, anti-imperialism, Shia Islamism and anti-Zionism”. Thus its very establishment and the way it promotes the Islamic Republic has been creating an atmosphere of distrust and widening the gulf between the major Shia and Sunni nations in West Asia.

Keeping this background of the IRGC in mind, the US and Israel have traditionally developed suspicion over the activities of the IRGC and its allied wings such as the Quds Force. The current tension between the US and Iran has a strong linkage with the recent attack by the pro-Iranian militiamen on the American embassy in Baghdad. And this happened after a US airstrike on the Kataib Hezbollah militia, established by the Muhandis. And all these events have finally led to the killing of Soleimani and his associates in Baghdad.

What all these incidents have to do with the protests in Iran? Of course, now the movement against the Iranian regime, particularly targeting the clerics, will surely be downplayed as it will be taken over by the anti-American protests just started in the wake of the killing of the Soleimani. It will be a great relief for the Rouhani Government for the time being. But what has been gathered from the street protests is that people will be on the road once again. What they want is very clear: They want an immediate retreat of the Islamic rule and religious armies from the public space.

Anti-Americanism is not new in Iran. The death of Soleimani can be a strong pretext to whip up the campaign against America in the country by the fundamentalists and the pro-Government groups. In the long run, the tensions between the US and Iran will continue in the West Asia. Against the backdrop of this incident and the current lashing out at Governments both in Iran and in Iraq, one can easily witness the growing frustration of the public.

The Green Movement to the protests through 2017-18 to the current saga of civil unrests in Iran, all signals the deep divide between the fundamentalists and the people who are demanding a democratic atmosphere in the country. And this time, Khameinei was so impatient that he called on the Government to do whatever it takes to stop the protesters. Last time, during the unrest in 2017-18, he called the protesters who came out across the country and demanded his removal, simply, “the enemies of Iran”. Surprisingly, two weeks later when the strike came down, the spokesman for the judicial system, which functions under Khamenei’s jurisdiction, denied the involvement of Government forces in death of innocent civilians.

It is sad that on many occasions Rouhani has defended Iranians’ right to protest. But it is equally pathetic to see that in no way he is capable of challenging the authority of the Supreme Leader. This indicates that as long as the current arrangement of power dynamics continues, any democratically elected Government will simply be working under the diktats of the clerics only. And in such a situation, the common voters will have nothing but frustration as their voices will not be heard. Like before, Rouhani’s supporters have become infuriated. His silence has long annoyed the common Iranians as well. Today the demonstrators decry their self-declared reformist President of doing nothing and silently watching the killing of the civilians. For many of them, Rouhani is no different from Khamenei. Thus the protesters in the beginning of 2018 shouted: “Reformists, hardliners, your time is up”. This directly indicates that people are equally frustrated with the both the democratic and clerical regimes that are in power now.

For long the IRGC has been regarded as the institutional equivalent of the Nazi SS, the heavily armed militia responsible for enforcing Hitler’s oppressive crackdown on common people in Germany. The IRGC ensures the clerical rule in Iran at any cost. And it also secures the stranglehold of the clerics in business and industry across the country. Iran’s latest crackdown on protesters demonstrates how the Iranians have no say in the rule of the mullah-led administration in the country. The current unrest is considered as the worst since 2017 when the youth of the country literally challenged the clerics. Fearing the repetition of the 2017, the IGRC has already jammed the internet access and preventing protesters from spreading their messages through Facebook and Google. This once again indicates how the Government and the religious leaders are equally threatened by the voices of the common citizens. All what one can see is the coming of a second Arab Spring. And the rulers in the West Asian region are too paranoid about such revivals.

Finally, what Iran is experiencing is the anger inbuilt in the political system. And, the political and the religious elite know very well that they had to face it either today or tomorrow. Simply countering America for a specific act is definitely the choice of the Government. But only whipping up anti-Americanism will not solve the internal problems of the country. People are going to challenge the system and no one today tolerates the dominance of the rule of the mullahs. They are too fascinated by the freedoms enjoyed by the people, particularly in the West and in many other countries across the globe. Much beyond that, they are truly bothered by the absence of basic needs and freedoms in the country. This happens because Iran is under strict surveillance of the IRGC. So none can expect anything beyond what the IRGC permits. This creates long-drawn frustrations among the people.

In an age of globalisation, it could be really difficult for any regime to suppress the feelings of its people. Today, family-run hereditary regimes and semi-authoritarian governments in West Asia are all coming under threat. Iran is one such example. Syria, Iraq and many others have already borne the brunt of public anger. What adds worry in this region is that situation might escalate at any time because of the involvement of the outside powers such as the US. Besides, the rivalry among the nations on sectarian lines adds fuel to the fire in any anti-Government uprisings. This further complicates the movements launched by common people in the region. For Iran, any such civilian protest against the Government may be crushed by the military for sure. What needs to be underlined is that American support to such protests and their leaders will not be able to turn the tide at the moment. But definitely, this kind of external pressure may generate more and more people to come on the streets.

Knowing well about the repercussion of such uprisings, the Iranian Government and the clerics must prepare a roadmap for future. The situation might go beyond their control. It’s time to make concrete strategies to deal with the anger of the public.

10,05-1-20,Anti-CAA protests aim to influence SC verdict,"In the eyes of some people, particularly the paid-up members of India’s small Left-liberal community, the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the yet-to-be-designed National Register of Citizens have acquired mythical status. On the evening of the last day of 2019, social media was witness to many activists in Delhi —these days most also tend to be journalists of one description or another — posing wistfully before a dharna at a place called Shaheen Bagh. They ushered in 2020 by singing the national anthem, an experience that caused some of the romantics to experience goose bumps.

Those who have experienced extended dharnas feel undeniably motivated and charged, especially if the cause is seen to be noble. Anna Hazare’s long dharna at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan evoked similar responses and was the prime factor in the establishment of the Aam Aadmi Party that now governs the city of Delhi. What contributes to the headiness is not merely the bonding of the participants, the shared stories and the inspirational songs. The constant presence of TV cameras and the awareness that some of the footage is likely to be viewed nationally, if not internationally, keeps up spirits. There have been similar dharnas elsewhere too and outside the gaze of TV cameras, but these tend to fizzle out amid angry allegations that the media is heartless.

Outside India, there were the long-drawn protests against the deployment of nuclear-powered missiles in Greenham Common in the United Kingdom in the early 1980s. The protests went on for nearly a year and was marked by the presence of many determined women who made the perimeter of the air force base their temporary home. They were determined but they were also perceived by the outside world to be a bit peculiar. In any case, these protests made not an iota of difference to the way Britons thought and voted. In the British general election of 1983, the Left suffered one of its most crushing election defeats.

It is not always appropriate to believe that the experience of other lands will automatically translate into India. However, certain features of the present round of anti-CAA protests need to be borne in mind.

First, it is by now acknowledged — at least by the discerning — that the anti-CAA protests are led and driven by the Muslim community. The mobilisation has been effected through traditional community organisations, notably the local mosques. Initially, there was an attempt to deny this denominational character of the protests but that has since been given up. Indeed, in Uttar Pradesh at least, the whole issue has been painted as a battle between Muslims and a Hindu state. In West Bengal, however, after the bout of violence by mobs from Muslim-dominated localities between December 13 and 15, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee chose to divert attention by making it a Trinamool Congress versus BJP battle. In the process, she tried to underplay the strategic overweight of the Muslim community in the anti-CAA protests. However, even this has not prevented the protests from degenerating into communal clashes, as happened in Duttapukur, not far from the border with Bangladesh, and in parts of Muslim-majority Murshidabad district.

Secondly, the role of liberal constitutionalists concerned with the alleged dilution of secularism, has so far been confined to according respectability to organisations which had hitherto been regarded as fringe. The Indian Union Muslim League organised a monster demonstration in Kochi on January 1 which led to a section of the English-language media going absolutely gush-gush. More important, the AIMIM and its leader Asaduddin Owaisi, hitherto regarded as a representative of the ghetto in Hyderabad, have now been conferred the honour of being projected as the defender of constitutional values. Indeed, these organisations have played some role — in alliance with the liberals — in successfully presenting the anti-CAA protests as a united front of all minorities against a Hindu Government. In Kolkata, for example, breaking with a long tradition of staying away from all political activity, the church authorities in St Xavier’s College extended full support to a silent march in solidarity with the students of Jamia Milia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University. There was a feeble attempt to disguise the anti-CAA orientation of the march but few were fooled.

Thirdly, the biggest contribution of the liberals has been to create a hostile environment for Indian diplomacy. This has been carefully managed by activist reporters in international publications who have tried to underplay the Muslim dimension of the protests.

Fourthly, although the main motivation behind the CAA was to give citizenship to the many lakhs of Hindus who have left Bangladesh over the years in fear of religious persecution, this aspect has not received as much public attention as it should have. Part of this owes to a general lack of awareness of the fact that Partition in the east was not only as horrific as it was in the west, but that the exodus has been a continuing process. The over-secularism of the Bengali intelligentsia is also responsible for this long-term denial. On its part, owing to organisational weakness, the West Bengal BJP’s attempts to highlight this aspect has been patchy. The situation has also been complicated by the fact that in Assam and the North-eastern States, the anti-CAA stir has taken on a unique dimension and been directed against all foreigners.

Finally, it is also apparent that a large part of the anti-CAA stir has been designed to have a maximum effect on the perception of the judges of the Supreme Court who will hear the judicial challenge to the legislation. The calculation is that judges respond to public opinion and that the impression the country is in turmoil will influence their interpretation of “Constitutional morality.” Whether it does or doesn’t will be interesting to watch.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/anti-caa-protests-aim-to-influence-sc-verdict.html
11,05-1-20,Punjab CM lashes at Akalis,"Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Saturday hit out at the Akalis for what he called as their “shameless” political stunts, in the wake of their threat of agitation over the power hike in the State and their ultimatum in the murder cases of two former SAD sarpanches.

The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has threatened to take to the streets over the two issues, which the Chief Minister dubbed as mere theatrics, aimed at covering up their own trail of misdeeds and misgovernance of 10 years, and their continued efforts to promote their political interests. “But you can’t hide your miserable track record with these pathetic dramas,” he told the Akalis.

Lashing out at the Akali leadership over their threat of agitation if the killers of former Akali sarpanches Baba Gurdeeep Singh and Dalbir Singh Dhilwan are not arrested within two weeks, Captain Amarinder said the Punjab Police, under the present regime, was doing a much better job at solving crime cases than it ever had under the erstwhile SAD-BJP rule.

These kind of churlish ultimatums might have worked under the Akali Government, when many innocent people were thrown behind bars after being charged in false cases, but under his regimen, no innocent person would be victimised for crimes they did not commit, said the Chief Minister.

The police are doing a thoroughly professional job and the investigations in both cases are on track, he said, adding that these cases would also be solved, just as all others had been solved under his Government.

The Chief Minister said the SAD-BJP Government had specialized in transferring all difficult cases to the CBI, be it the serial killings of RSS and Hindu leaders or gangster crimes, or the various Namdhari cases, including of the sect matriarch Mata Chand Kaur. So much so that in its November 2016 report, the National Crime Records Bureau had revealed that the pendency of cases under various sections of IPC was 44.7 per cent in Punjab by the end of 2015 — next only to 3 north-eastern States.

Capt Amarinder also reeled out data to counter the hue and cry raised by the Akalis on the issue of the power tariff hike.

“Why don’t you check out your own track record before lashing out at us,” he told the SAD, citing figures to show that the percentage increase during their regime, from 2007 to 2017, was much more than what his Government had implemented.

Mismanagement and inefficiencies were the norm under the Akali rule, asserted the Chief Minister, adding that, in less than three years, his Government had transformed the face of Punjab from a poor example of governance into a progressive State, with the lawlessness of the past a forgotten chapter.

“Sitting on dharnas and taking to the streets will not help you get back into the good backs of the people, who have seen through your antics and crocodile tears, and are no longer willing to trust you,” Capt Amarinder warned the Akalis.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-cm-lashes-at-akalis.html

The Congress party may not accept it but it is cent percent true.

He alleged that appeasement policy which had adopted in the country has done only injustice and there is no hope that in future also they will open their eyes to see the reality.

23,05-1-20,Protests on CAA-2019 politically motivated: Jai Ram Thakur,"The protest of some States on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) - 2019 is politically motivated and the constitution is very clear that citizenship is not a State subject, said the Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh, Jai Ram Thakur while addressing media persons here on Saturday. He said this when asked to comment on the stance of States like West Bengal and Kerala on the CAA. Thakur said that unnecessary doubts are being created by Opposition parties about the CAA, but the fact remains that the Act has no provision of taking away or stalling citizenship of anyone. The Act is for providing citizenship to the Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Christians and Parsi immigrants to India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. He added that the amendment Act sets up a cut off date of December 31, 2014 for the members of above mentioned religious minorities of these three Islamic countries and eases the process of providing them citizenship of India.

He added that CAA only intends to help minority communities facing religious persecution in the three neighbouring countries and would not take away anyone's citizenship and was in no way against any community.

He recalled that an agreement was signed between the then Prime Minister of Indian Jawaharlal Nehru and his Pakistani counterpart Liaquat Ali in 1950 on protection of minorities in their respective countries. He said that India still abides by this pact but in Pakistan, the condition of minority has remained pathetic. Thakur said that in 1947, Pakistan had 23 percent of minority population which in the census of 2011 has declined to 3.7 percent.

The Himachal Pradesh CM attacked the Congress and other Opposition parties of spreading canard on the issue. He said that it was the Congress party which on December 5, 1947 had passed a resolution on providing Indian citizenship to the persons facing religious atrocities in Pakistan. He said that the Congress party is now opposing the CAA which is unfortunate. Thakur also added that Mahatma Gandhi on September 26, 1947 had publically stated that Hindus and Sikhs of Pakistan should be provided shelter and jobs by India if they come here.

Dispelling the doubts on NRC, Thakur said that the Union Government has clearly stated that it has no plan to bring it.

The Himachal Pradesh CM said that recent incident where a mob attacked the Sri Nankana Sahib Gurudwara in Pakistan is a glaring example of atrocities against the minority communities in that country. Such incidents have happened many times in past against minorities in Pakistan.

Himachal Pradesh CM said that opposition leaders are raising unnecessary hue and cry over the CAA in a desperate attempt to divert the attention of the people from core issues of development.

He said that the country today was safe and secure under dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and is poised to emerge as the world power.

Thakur said that in his second stint PM Modi has taken up many chronic issues like abrogation of article 370 and statute on triple Talaq.

28,05-1-20,Remembering Paramahansa Yogananda on his 127th Birth Anniv,"January 5, 2020 marks the127thbirth anniversary of one of the pioneering fathers of Yoga in the West, Paramahansa Yogananda, author of the modern spiritual classic Autobiography of a Yogi. Widely recognised as one of the preeminent spiritual figures of our time, Yogananda made an indelible impression on the spiritual landscape of the Western world, contributing to a far greater awareness and appreciation of India’s Vedic philosophy through his public lectures, writings and the non-profit spiritual organization he founded, Yogoda Satsanga Society of India/Self-Realization Fellowship (YSS/SRF), which together includes 800 temples, meditation centres, and retreats around the world.

At the heart of Yogananda’s teachings is the sacred science of Kriya Yoga, a form of Raja Yoga, which serves to quiet both body and mind, making it possible to withdraw one’s energy and attention from the usual turbulence of thoughts, emotions, and sensory perceptions. In the clarity of that inner stillness, one comes to experience a deepening interior peace and attunement with one’s true self.

Yogananda’s best-selling spiritual classic, Autobiography of a Yogi, which has introduced millions of readers to the philosophy and practice of yoga meditation, and has been translated into over 50 languages, remains one of the most important, and most readable, works on yoga and Eastern spiritual thought. His highly acclaimed interpretations of the Bhagavad Gita — GodTalks with Arjuna and The Second Coming of Christ: The Resurrection of the Christ Within You), provide ground-breaking insight into the underlying unity of the religious beliefs of East and West.

To the tens of thousands of Westerners who attended his lectures, his discourses on the unity of “the original teachings of Jesus Christ and the original Yoga taught by Bhagavan Krishna” were a revelation. Growing public acclaim prompted President Calvin Coolidge to invite Sri Yogananda for a personal meeting at the White House in January 1927, making him the first swami to meet with a US President.

Many prominent figures in science, business, and the arts became his students, including George Eastman (inventor of the Kodak camera). Later, Beatle George Harrison and pop superstar Madonna each publicly acknowledged Yogananda ji’s influence on their lives. Late Apple founder Steve Jobs brought attention to Autobiography of a Yogi posthumously in 2011 when he arranged for copies of the book to be given to attendees at his memorial service.

Paramahansa Yogananda was born Mukunda Lal Ghosh on January 5, 1893, in Gorakhpur, India, into a prosperous and devout Bengali family. From his earliest years it was evident to those around him that his awareness and experience of the spiritual was far beyond the ordinary. As a youth he sought out many of India’s saints and philosophers, hoping to find an illumined teacher to guide him in his spiritual quest.

In 1910, at the age of 17, he met the revered sage Swami Sri Yukteswar, in whose ashram he spent the better part of the next ten years. After graduating from Calcutta University in 1915, he became a monk of the Swami Order, at which time he received the name Yogananda (signifying bliss, ananda, through divine union, yoga).

Yogananda began his life’s work with the founding, in 1917, of a “how-to-live” school where modern educational methods were combined with yoga training and instruction in spiritual ideals. Visiting the school in 1925, Mahatma Gandhi wrote: “This institution has greatly impressed my mind.”

Mahatma Gandhi and Paramahansa Yogananda met a decade afterwards when the latter made a return visit to India in 1935–36. At the Mahatma’s request, Yogananda instructed him and several of his followers in the spiritual science of Kriya Yoga.

Under his direction, the personal guidance and instruction that he had given to students of his classes was arranged into a comprehensive series of YSS Lessons for home study. Today, YSS/SRF, under the direction of its president, Swami Chidananda, publishes the writings, lectures, and informal talks of Paramahansa Yogananda, and of his close disciples, produces audio and video recordings on Yogananda ji’s teachings, oversees its temples, meditation centres, retreats, and youth programmes, conducts monastic tours and public talks in cities throughout India and abroad, and coordinates the Worldwide Prayer Circle, a network of groups and individuals dedicated to praying for those in need of physical, mental, or spiritual aid, and for global peace and harmony.

Paramahansa Yogananda passed away on March 7, 1952, in Los Angeles, following his delivery of a speech at a banquet honouring Dr. Binay R. Sen, India’s Ambassador to the United States. His passing received widespread coverage in the press, including in The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and Time.

In 1977, on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of Paramahansa Yogananda’s passing, the Government of India formally recognised his outstanding contributions to the spiritual upliftment of humanity, by issuing a commemorative stamp in his honour.

In March of 2017, a second commemorative stamp was issued by the Indian Government, citing the outstanding spiritual achievements of Yogoda Satsanga Society on its centenary. Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated during the official postal stamp release function on March 7, 2017 at the Vigyan Bhavan in New Delhi: “Looking at [Paramahansa Yogananda’s] life, it is evident that he does not merely stress the ways to outer freedom, but focuses on the inner journey . . . . Removing rigid dogma, he made spirituality so approachable and tangible that in these hundred years since he started it, his work has become a world-wide movement, a perennial resource of spiritual understanding.”

Dedicated throughout his life to bridging East and West and fostering peace through cultivating one’s connection with Spirit, Yogananda ji said in his Autobiography of a Yogi, “‘World brotherhood’ is a large term, but man must enlarge his sympathies, considering himself in the light of a world citizen. He who truly understands that ‘it is my America, my India, my Philippines, my Europe, my Africa’ and so on, will never lack scope for a useful and happy life.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/remembering-paramahansa-yogananda-on-his-127th-birth-anniv.html

30,05-1-20,No garbage dumping at Daruthenga soon,"In a huge relief for residents of Daruthenga on the outskirts of State capital who have been protesting for relocation of the city’s dumping yard since long, the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities have decided to stop disposing wastes at the dumping site soon.

The waste disposal would be stopped at the dumping yard at Daruthenga after operationalisation of micro-composting centres, informed BMC Commissioner Prem Chandra Chaudhury on Saturday.

He told reporters, “By the directive of the State Government, we are setting up micro-composting centres at 43 locations. Out of the garbage generated in the city, the wet waste, the biodegradable waste, will be composted at the micro-composting centres and the dry waste will be recycled.”

While only one micro-composting centre has been completed so far, the construction at over 25 locations is underway. Each micro-composting centre has a capacity of five tonnes to transform the waste into compost.

“We are trying to set up the centres as quickly as possible. However, it may take around eight months to one year to make the entire system operational,” said the BMC Commissioner.

Notably, the villagers of Daruthenga panchayat have been opposing garbage disposal after it reportedly created serious health hazards in the locality. The residents complain that the dumping site has become a breeding ground of mosquitoes and the wastes emit foul smell after getting soaked in water during monsoon.

Earlier in 2016, former Sarpanch of Daruthenga Prashant Routray had spearheaded a movement against the BMC by preventing waste transporting vehicles from entering into the dumping yard. He was arrested for allegedly manhandling police personnel during a standoff between villagers and the BMC authorities.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/no-garbage-dumping-at-daruthenga-soon.html

36,05-1-20,CREDA installs free charging point for electric vehicles,"Chhattisgarh State Renewable Energy Development Agency (CREDA) has installed a free fast-charging point for electric vehciles at VIP Road, near Energy Park.

For environment conservation and pollution control, state Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has directed to promote battery run vehicles and in this context an electric car has been procured from Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL). The other departments will be promoted to procure electric-cars in future, which will help to bring down pollution level.

Under National Electric Mobility Plan 2020, use of electric vehicles is being promoted among common people. CREDA has procured from Mahindra 5 electric-auto-rickshaws which is being utilised in the ‘CREDA Reneweable Energy Gardens’ in different prominent cities.

The EESL has provided the vehicles in condition of free maintenance for 5 years. Similarly, solar energy charging stations have been planned in the state which will charge the battery run vehicles.

EESL officers intimated that at one charging the vehicle can cover around 140 kilometres, which saves around 7 to 10 litres of fuel. A vehicle in fast charging station for full charge takes around 80 minutes consuming 16 units of power. Thus the expense for the vehicle is just 90 paise per kilometre. It thus saves around Rs 1.5 lakh per year. Additional to it, the e-vehicle if travels 1 lakh kilometres it saves 10 tonne carbon dioxide release which requires around 500 trees to absorb it. So it is favourable for environment conservation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/creda-installs-free-charging-point-for-electric-vehicles.html
37,05-1-20,Elephant herd kills 24-yr-old at Ichagarh,"A 24-year-old youth was trampled to death by an elephant herd under Ichargarh police station area, Seraikela Kharsawan on Saturday morning. The victim, Laxman Mahto had gone to nearby jungle to meet nature’s call when he came too close to the elephant herd.

A forest officer said that Mahto had gone too close to herd and was subsequently attacked and killed.

“We are investigating the incident. Mahto had gone to relive himself when he came very close to the herd, which resulted in his death,” he added.

Soon after the incident, local MLA Savita Mahto rushed to the spot and promised neccesary compensation to the victim’s family.

An official said following instructions from his office the local range officers held meetings with the local villagers and gave them the guideline how to evade danger if the herds of elephants stray into the human habitat in their bid of searching food.

He pointed out that he was going to take corrective measures immediately so that the elephants may not destroy any more of the paddy crops by straying into the human habitats.

“As we cannot stop the elephants from migrating from one jungle to another, but can safeguard the villages from the tuskers’ attack on the villages as well as the paddy fields, we have set up separate teams for tuskers- driving wherever the chances of the menace is maximum,” said another forest official.

Meanwhile, people are in state of havoc due to such menace. Sometimes villagers migrate to safer places for a week or more to avoid the sudden night-time attacks of the wild elephant herds. “ The villagers have been asked to make red chilly cakes so as to ward off the elephants . We are also providing them crackers and burnt mobile so that they can drive away the pachyderms, “ he said.

38,05-1-20,"BJP fields Chatra MP in Daltonganj to pitch for NRC, CAA","Amidst a feeble voice against NRC and CAA here in Daltonganj, where a proposed rally against NRC & CAA was postponed on December 26 the BJP fielded its most eloquent two term sitting MP from Chatra Sunil Singh to pitch in for NRC and CAA.

Singh held a Press conference here on Friday and tried hard to explain that CAA is not directed against any Muslims of this country and there is no room for any fear and anxiety over it. He talked more about CAA and not NRC there in his press conference.

The MP first took the newsmen back into the Nehru — Liauqat pact to drive his point home that NRC, CAA are not the only brain works of the BJP rather these two had had the grains in the political firmament decades back too.

He said even the then Jan Sangh had envisaged to fish out the infiltrators from the country.

MP had a battery of senior BJP leaders with him on this occasion like Panki MLA Shashibhushan Mehta, district president Narender Pandey, veteran leaders like Prem Singh, Manoj K Singh, Bipin Bihari Singh and others to give him all support in this press conference.

Singh said, “I was one of the members of the Joint Parliamentary Board set up for CAB and I tell you the Congress member then on this Board had not raised even a whimper of protest against CAB report of which was readied after more than two years then but now a malicious and misleading campaign is on in some parts of the country where CAA is presented as a fearful thing for the Muslims which is far from reality.”

Asked if NPR (National population register) is a pre cursor to NRC to which MP Singh said, “Both are different. Let me tell you in times like 1951-52 there used to be Family Register. NPR is no step towards NRC.”

Again pestered that the then state Home Minister Rijuji had on the floor of the Parliament said that NPR is a step towards NRC to which Singh quite intelligently disengaging himself from any more embarrassment said “ I might not be present in the Parliament when Rijuji ji is said to have made this statement.”

The BJP MP had a tough time to explain as to why the suffering Tamils of Sri Lanka under the Sinhalese rule there be not given the same citizenship benefit here in India under CAA which comes too free to Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis, Jains, Buddhists etc coming from three countries Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

The MP had a point that there is no any stir against CAA in many parts of the country but leaders who believe in ‘vote bank’ politics are stoking the fire most dangerously and enflaming the passion of the Muslims. He advised the Muslims to understand the real intention of such leaders.

Sources said the BJP has started too late to dispel fear and scorn for NRC and CAA while a big band of opposition parties has succeeded in driving this point home that NRC and CAA have anti constitutional spirit.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-fields-chatra-mp-in-daltonganj-to-pitch-for-nrc--caa.html

The NHRC passed the order acting on a petition filed by Supreme Court lawyer and social activist Radhakanta Tripathy.

In his petition Tripathy alleged that due to the negligence and failure of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and State officials seven school students have already died and several others suffered critical injuries in road accidents in the district.

On September 10, 2019 two minors were killed in a road accident on National Highway16 near New Bus Stand in Bhadrak town. The students were on their way to school on their cycles. They were hit by a car that fled from the scene after hitting the boys. The deceased were identified as Class VIII student Sumit Sahoo and Class X student Subhankar Mallick, stated Tripathy.

On July 19, 2018, as many as five students were killed while four others suffered critical injuries when they were run over by a truck near Rahanja on NH-16. The incident occurred at around 4 pm when the students were returning from school.

As the school is located close to the NH, the students used to cross the busy junction by risking their lives daily. Four girl students were killed on the spot while another student died while undergoing treatment at hospital, he pointed out.

Neither there is any proper signage nor there regular check of over speeding near the school. To make matters worse, inadequate traffic personnel and lack of infrastructure is another reason behind the increasing number of road mishaps, alleged Tripathy.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/nhrc-seeks-report-from-union-secy--odisha-dgp.html
54,05-1-20,Chilika bird population likely to be 10.7 lakh,"The total bird population of the Chilika lake is expected to be in the range of 10.5 lakh to 10.7 lakh this winter, which would be a good number compared to the last winter, claimed the Chilika Development Authority (CDA) on Friday.

The exact number of population with figures of different species would be provided only after a census done in near future by Chilika Wildlife Division, added the CDA.

The Nalabana water bird sanctuary spread over 15.53 sq km has the largest congregation of 3,74,752 birds of 114 species. Off these, 74 are water fowls and 40 waders.

Most of these water fowls breed outside the sub-continent in the palearctic region and migrates to Chilika lagoon during the winter for roosting and feeding.

The evicted areas from the net gharries to the tune of 162 sq km have not been reconstructed yet.

These areas have become the new place of congregation for the birds and the dolphin population. Areas such as Gurubai and Parikuda have become Important Bird Areas (IBA) with presence of large number of migratory ducks and geese.

The CDA said dolphins are colonising new areas which have become free from encroachments.

The population of wader birds was observed to be less compared to previous years, as they are dependent on mudflats which are dynamic in nature and was affected by the storm surge during the Cyclone Fani.

Notably, the annual monitoring of Chilika lagoon to know the status of flora and fauna and also to estimate the population range of birds in particular, was taken-up by Chilika Development Authority (CDA) with the help of 175 personnel in 29 teams. The survey was carried out from the morning to noon on January 3.

However, the inclement weather hindered the sighting and population estimation of Irrawaddy dolphin. The IBA, which holds significant numbers of one or more globally threatened bird species, were mapped out earlier to facilitate counting of birds.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/chilika-bird-population-likely-to-be-10-7-lakh.html

A forest officer said that Mahto had gone too close to herd and was subsequently attacked and killed.

“We are investigating the incident. Mahto had gone to relive himself when he came very close to the herd, which resulted in his death,” he added.

Soon after the incident, local MLA Savita Mahto rushed to the spot and promised neccesary compensation to the victim’s family.

An official said following instructions from his office the local range officers held meetings with the local villagers and gave them the guideline how to evade danger if the herds of elephants stray into the human habitat in their bid of searching food.

He pointed out that he was going to take corrective measures immediately so that the elephants may not destroy any more of the paddy crops by straying into the human habitats.

“As we cannot stop the elephants from migrating from one jungle to another, but can safeguard the villages from the tuskers’ attack on the villages as well as the paddy fields, we have set up separate teams for tuskers- driving wherever the chances of the menace is maximum,” said another forest official.

Meanwhile, people are in state of havoc due to such menace. Sometimes villagers migrate to safer places for a week or more to avoid the sudden night-time attacks of the wild elephant herds. “ The villagers have been asked to make red chilly cakes so as to ward off the elephants . We are also providing them crackers and burnt mobile so that they can drive away the pachyderms, “ he said.

Forest officials reveal that the elephants are straying into human habitat from different forest area including Seraikela, Kharsawan, Kuchai and Bagmundi forest in neighbouring Purulia district of Bengal.

64,05-1-20,Priyanka meets affected families,"Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who was earlier stopped by the district police from entering Meerut along with her brother Rahul Gandhi, on Saturday made unscheduled visits to Muzaffarnagar and Meerut in western Uttar Pradesh to meet the families who bore the brunt of alleged “police excesses” following violent protests against the amended Citizenship Act or were affected by the clashes.

Priyanka, who was coming from Muzaffarnagar after meeting the victims, was on Saturday again stopped at the border of Meerut and was handed over a notice about enforcement of prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code in the district. However, she was allowed to visit the victim’s family at one place after she assured the officials that she would comply with the prohibitory orders.

She met the families of several victims at Bhurbaral house in Sai colony in Partapur area. She assured the people assembled there that the Congress would stand be them and would fight for their cause.

Earlier, in Muzaffarnagar too, Priyanka reiterated her party’s stand to support the families of those killed in the protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Uttar Pradesh or were being harassed by police to taking part in the protests.

The Congress general secretary alleged that the UP police were implicating innocent people in the violence during anti-CAA protests.

“I have already apprised UP Governor Anandiben Patel through a memorandum how the police have unleashed a reign of terror in the name of anti-CAA protests by beating up innocent people and putting them in jail,” she said.

While talking to media persons after meeting the victims and their family members, Priyanka said, “We would have had no problem had the police behaved in such manner with people involved in violence but the police are harassing innocents and this will not be tolerated at all.”

On Saturday, Priyanka first met Maulana Asad Raza Hussaini who runs a madarasa.

“The maulana said that the police entered the madarasa and beat up children, causing injuries to severely of them. Even minor children were put in jail. The maulana was also beaten up and his hand was broken,” she said.

Later, Priyanka met the family members of Noora Mohammad, who was killed in the anti-CAA violence.

The Congress leader also met Ruqaiya Parveen who was also beaten up by police. Parveen’s marriage is scheduled for February 4, 2020. She alleged that the police ransacked her house and destroyed all the items stored for the marriage.

Priyanka was accompanied by senior party leader Imran Masood and Pankaj Mallik.

Last month, Priyanka had visited Bijnor but was stopped from going towards Meerut along with brother Rahul Gandhi. The state capital also witnessed a high drama when Priyanka took pillion ride on a scooty to meet the family members of activist and retired IPS officer SR Darapuri, who was put in the jail for supporting the anti-CAA protest.

Meanwhile, the Congress general secretary has written condolence letters to all the families of those killed during the anti-CAA protests in the state. In her letter to the bereaved families, she has said, “I know very well how it feels to loose the dear ones. You should not feel alone in this situation and don’t lose your confidence. We are with you every time. We will have to march ahead and strengthen our power to seek justice.”

On the other hand, a Congress delegation led by former parliamentarian and party’s national spokesman Rashid Alvi met one of the victim’s family in Firozabad and consoled them. Later Alvi said they would submit a full report on their visit to Congress general secretary.

The visit was kept secret and not even the district Congress president was aware of it.

69,05-1-20,BJP to get new State chief by end of Jan,"The Jharkhand unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is likely to get a new president by the end of January, and former president Ravindar Rai appears to be the frontrunner for the coveted position, party insiders said on Saturday.

“Some leaders have expressed their interest in taking the responsibility. However, former president and MP Ravindar Rai is leading the race so far,” said a senior office bearer of the BJP. “The party needs someone who can unite the party workers and keep them motivated,” said the office bearer who has been in the thick of events lately. Rai was the State president during the 2014 elections.

Former BJP State President Laxman Gilua stepped down from the position last month taking responsibility of the humiliating defeat of the party in the recently concluded Assembly polls. Gilua, who was the BJP State chief even during the General Elections last year, suffered two consecutive defeats — first in the General Elections and then in the Assembly polls — in the past one year.

Besides Rai, BJP State General Secretary Deepak Prakash and former Minister Amar Bauri are also in the race for the State chief’s chair, sources said. “The role of the party chief will be different in Jharkhand as the party will now sit in the opposition at least for the next five years. At this time, the party needs someone who can point out at the flaws of the ruling party and mobilise the party cadre,” said a BJP legislator who refused to be named.

The national unit of the BJP is likely to get a new president by January 16, and the decision related to the Jharkhand president will be taken once the new party chief takes charge in New Delhi. Sources said that BJP’s National Working President JP Nadda is likely to take charge as the party chief. “The state president will be named within a few days after the new national president takes charge in New Delhi,” said an office bearer of the Jharkhand unit of BJP.

The BJP has had its share of controversies and challenges related to the State president in Jharkhand since 2014. In 2016, the party appointed Tala Marandi — a tribal leader from Santhal Pargana — as the party president in Jharkhand. However, his stint as the party chief could not even last for a year as controversies related to his son and his remarks against the proposed amendments in the tenancy laws drew flak from various corners of the BJP. Gilua replaced him in an extravagant event organized at a private banquet in Ranchi in September 2016.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-to-get-new-state-chief-by-end-of-jan.html

Marandi chaired a meeting with top officials of the State Government in Ranchi and gave necessary instructions related to the first day of the Assembly session.

“Necessary arrangements will be made to ensure that supporters of the newly-elected MLAs are given the due respect. Special passes will be issued for supporters of the legislators. These passes will be given only for January 6 and January 8,” said Marandi.

The first session of the fifth Assembly will be held in the old Vidhan Sabha building as the new Vidhan Sabha building, where the former Government held a special session, is not yet ready for use, officials said. Soon after the meeting on Saturday, Chief Secretary DK Tiwari said that the legislators will also be able to take oath in the local languages and the Government will ensure that every attendee is treated with the due respect.

Foolproof security arrangements have also been made in and around the Vidhan Sabha building to ensure that the sea of supporters, expected to visit the Vidhan Sabha area, do not cause any inconvenience to the common public. “All necessary arrangements have been made,” said Tiwari.

The oath taking ceremony of the newly-elected legislators will also be telecast live on various TV Channels, said Marandi, adding that the people of Jharkhand should get an opportunity to see their legislators take oath on their respective TV sets. “The legislators can take oath in any Constitutional languages of their choice,” said Marandi. Santhali, spoken across the Santhal Pargana belt, is one of the eight Constitutional languages in India.

The Russian Hostel, which has been used as Vidhan Sabha building since the formation of Jharkhand, is all decked up for the first session. The building has been painted and cleaned for the first session on Monday.

JMM and its allies — Congress party and RJD — won the Assembly elections and limited Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to only 25 seats.

A notification in this regard was issued by the Cabinet Secretariat and Vigilance department on Saturday evening. Notably, two other Ministers — JPCC president Rameshwar Oraon and RJD leader Satyanand Bhokta have not been allotted any department.

Sources said the allocation of department has been done on temporary basis till the full fledged Cabinet takes shape in the State. At present the Chief Minister has three Cabinet colleagues, while the maximum no of State Cabinet ministers in Jharkhand is 12 including the Chief Minister. Sources said that another eight Cabinet ministers will be inducted after January 14, the end of inauspicious ‘Kharmas’ period.

Notably, Chief Minister Hemant Soren will also leave one of the two constituencies he has won elections from. Sources said that the CM, who has won elections from both Barhait and Dunka constituencies, is likely to leave the Barhait constituency and retain the Dumka seat, which is considered the centre of JMM’s bastion in Santhal Pargana.

Soren, on Saturday, reached Dumka on a two-day visit where he paid tributes to freedom fighters Sido Kanhu, Bhagwan Birsa Munda, Swami Vivekananda and Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar by garlanding the great personalities’ statues.

We will work in accordance with your expectations. The purpose with which you have carried me forward will be fulfilled. This is my responsibility,” he said.

Soren said that in a couple of days the Government will start functioning fully. “When I come next time, I will bring happiness. Our aim is to move forward with people of all religions. The executive will also work with this objective. Today, I have come to pay respect to my ‘Karmbhoomi’. The whole journey has to be done with complete preparation,” said he.

The CM said the demise of Purohit Bhai at Baba Basukinath Dham a few days ago is sad. “One cannot resurrect a dead person, but one can help his dependents. Today, a job given to the late priest’s brother Amit Ranjan and Rs 2 lakh will be helpful to his life to some extent. May God bless the soul of the late Panda Ji,” he said.

The CM will take part in a meeting with eminent personalities and mediapersons in Dumka on Sunday and will also partake in a Janta Darbar organised at the second Capital of the State.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-gets----all----depts--alamgir-parliamentary-affairs.html

These efforts of the new Government have led to develop a sense of faith in the police department. As a result of these steps, the police of the State have become more alert and vigilant.

Till recent past, 24X7 duty was part of the police personnel. Because of the continuous duty, health related problems and mental depression were being faced by the police personnel. To avoid this situation, the new government decided to give weekly off to the police personnel.

Such a major decision was taken for the first time in the state to safeguard the interest of police personnel.

As many as 25,000 houses are being constructed to provide free housing facility to the police personnel from the level of constable to inspector. The construction of 5000 houses has been completed in the first phase and 5,000 houses under the second phase are being constructed at the speedy pace. Besides, the tender process for the construction of 5,000 house under the third phase is being completed.

An action plan is being prepared for merging SAF constable upto head constable posts in the district police upto 25 percent posts, for the people who have served for 5 years. In this series, the plan for giving the compassionate appointment to the dependents of the deceased police personnel in other departments is in the process on not getting the appointments in the police department.

In order to make women of police families self-reliant, the Police SC /ST Women Welfare committee was registered in 2003 and the training centers, libraries and schools for children were established. These seva kendras had become inactive for the last several years. Now, the kendras have been reactivated and along with the free coaching for the children of the policemen for competitive examinations, training pertaining to the cultural activities are being given.

In order to provide employment opportunities to the dependent women and girls of police personnel of other units, amount has been sanctioned from the Central Welfare Fund at SAF Range Gwalior, Jabalpur and Indore.

I urge PM @narendramodi ji & DrSJaishankar (External Affairs Minister) to ensure Pak stops this barbarity & ensure safety of Pak Sikh community,” she tweeted.

The Union minister also sought to corner Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and the Congress over their stand against the amended Citizenship Act, which seeks to provide citizenship to members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have entered India till December 31, 2014, following religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

“Persecution of minorities in Pak is a reality. Attack on Gurdwara Sri Nankana Sahib has shown its horrible face.

87,05-1-20,Delhi Govt organises mega PTM,"Delhi Government on Saturday organised a mega PTM in its schools to interact with parents about their children's progress and to take their feedback.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal interacted with the parents, guardians and students at Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya, Rouse Avenue.

“The PTM procedures in Delhi Government schools were only on paper. We have started holding regular PTMs in schools. Parents and teachers are satisfied because they get to discuss the progress and growth of students. This way, parents take a keen interest in the studies of their wards. I am happy to interact with parents, and this PTM is also an eye-opener for students,” Kejriwal said.

It may be noted that on Opposition leaders' allegation on organising PTM and being termed this event as a political gimmick by BJP leader Dr Harsh Vardhan, he said, “How can imparting good education to our children be a political gimmick? We have been holding regular PTMs since the last two-three years. They tried to end these PTMs but I don't think politics on schooling and education is justified.”

He said that earlier people had an inferiority complex about their children studying in Government schools because of lack of financial resources.

“Earlier parents wanted to admit their wards in private schools through recommendation, now they want to admit their wards in Government schools through recommendation,” he said.

Launched in 2016, the mega PTM is aimed at opening up communication platform for the teachers and parents of children.

“I have seen that parent-teachers' meet also gives a boost to the confidence of the parents as they get to know about the performance of their kids. They become more supportive,” said Deputy Chief Minister Sisodia, Education Minister interacted with parents at a Government school in Dwarka.

Many parents also shared their feedback on AAP on social media platform.

Surabhi's mother Rupam Suman said, “The PTM gives me an opportunity to know my daughter's progress. Education has improved a lot in the Government schools. I have observed that various activities are conducted in the school which are helpful in releasing stress, especially for her as she has to appear for board exams.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/delhi-govt-organises-mega-ptm.html

92,05-1-20,Cong team meets DGP over Vijayvargiya’s remarks,"To oppose the remark of BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya- “would have set Indore on fire”, the Congress party on Saturday collectively slammed at all possible levels.

A delegation of senior Congress leaders called on the Director General of Police (DGP) of Madhya Pradesh seeking a registration of a criminal case against the BJP leader.

The leaders in a memorandum handed to the senior cop alleged that Vijayvargiya tried to tamper with law and order by holding dharna with party leaders at Indore commissioner’s residence on Friday despite section 144 of CrPC being in force in Indore.

They also referred to his statement, “I would have set Indore on fire if RSS office-bearers were not in Indore.”

The memorandum further read, “His remarks are evident enough to suggest that he is planning to instigate explosive activities against the State Government by inciting illegal and unlawful activities not only in Indore but across the State.”

Saying that Vijayvargiya is known to shelter unlawful and mafia elements in Indore, the Congress leaders also referred to the incident in which Vijayvargiya’s MLA son Akash had beat up a civic officer during anti-encroachment drive.

The MP Congress Committee in the letter sought Vijayvargiya be booked under a criminal case for his violence utterance and instigating intent against the state government.

Vijayvargiya on Friday had got infuriated after he went to meet senior administrative officials but none of them was there to speak to him despite a prior intimation. Later in he had opposed administration action saying those associated with the BJP were being targeted on the pretext of a drive against the land mafia.

A known Vijayvargiya detractor and the PWD minister Sajjan Singh Verma crossed the line while attacking the former.

No impotent could set Indore on fire, It is a city of the intelligent and the musclemen and not of those impotent, he added.

His cabinet colleague Jitu Patwari tried justifying him while saying that the minister meant that hatred was not the nature of the city and Vijayvargiya should apologise for his remarks.

Another Kamal Nath minister Dr Govind Singh slammed RSS for the remarks from Vijayvargiya. “RSS imparts such training from outset to use this kind of language. Where you are born is revered for you but Vijayvargiya is affirming to burn that place, it’s like attacking your mother.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-team-meets-dgp-over-vijayvargiya---s-remarks.html
93,05-1-20,Upholding the thali Tradition,"Long before international cuisine lay claim and ownership, the Indian thali has always been the original chefs tasting. Shreya Soni presents a case for the ‘apparently-humble but wildly-satisfying’ thali

The first distinct food memory I have is of eating a thali. In Hyderabad, with Dad, at Abhiruchi Restaurant, third table to the left of the entrance. The thrill of building a hillock of podi (gunpowder), poking a hole with an index finger, pouring hot ghee into it and mix it with annam (steamed white rice), tomato pappu (traditional Andhra dal with tomato) and eating it with the much treasured and hugely fought over appalam (fried papad). Irrespective of how busy Pop was (continues to be), the tradition of a weekly thali continued.

With the move, the tradition moved to the Canteen at Andhra Bhavan. Relocating to Delhi allowed us to experiment with different regional cuisines, all perfectly presented in a thali. “Go from left to right!” or “Eat with your hands, it’s bliss!” or “Beta, pasta will come and go, thali is eternal!” were dining-advice stated at the dinner table. In fact, my family continues to paroso (serve) Indian food in gleaming stainless steel thalis.

Long before international cuisine lay claim and ownership, the Indian thali has always been the original chefs tasting. Every restaurant worth their salt is imbibing the use of local and seasonal, something executed in a thali since decades. One that displays a wealth of indigenous cooking techniques — fermenting, pickling, smoking, steaming, grilling, deep frying, bhuno, boiling, guthna/ghotna, the list is endless.

Centuries before international chefs added a palate cleanser to their tasting menus, this featured on every Indian thali. While it is commonly understood that the objective is eponymous, a palate cleanser on a thali is scientific. It does aid understanding flavours in a cleaner format, but it is presented to negate the need to drink water. Drinking water with a meal goes against ayurvedic principles of digestion and gut-health.

As unique as our childhoods are, we share some universal truths. As a child, your mind is like wet cement and your preferences are borrowed from your parents. As a teenager, those preferences start deviating and the experimentation tries scratching that cement. But when the parental-laid cement is stronger than the likes of Ambuja and Ultratech, you eventually seek culinary comfort in exactly where the discovery all began — the roots, the nostalgia, the familiarity. The only bite of food that warrants a sigh analogous to the touch and feel of Nani’s old mulmul sari, the lingering whiffs of aftershave as Pop leaves for office, the security of your old hole-ridden sleeping shirt.

I moved to England to study and start a career in management consulting, and no week was sans Indian food. No, lord no, nothing from the strangely popular curry houses. But a Masala Zone Dosa here and a Chor Bizarre Tarami there ensured the greyest of English skies seem blue. Whilst I credit my curious palate for widening my third eye (read, tummy tyre), it is the thali that truly taught me the principles of life.

Life Lesson #1

Balance is everything

American writer, Thomas Merton states that happiness is not a matter of intensity, but of balance, order, rhythm and harmony. It is incredible how aptly interchangeable ‘happiness’ is with ‘thali’ in this quote. The quintessentially Indian thali is the perfectly balanced meal with a rhythmic symbiosis of six flavours — sweet, sour, spice, salt, bitter and astringent. The thali is a harmony of science and art, a scientific representation of a composite culture and a balance of flavours and textures. Like life, the thali is neither too little nor too much. It’s just right, whether you know it or not.

Life Lesson #2

Consume with compassion

It’s getting increasingly hard to ignore our injured planet and there is no urgent time to state that we need to place the planet at the very heart and core of our consumption patterns. Traditionally, thalis endorse portion control, zero-wastage and if served on a banana leaf (my absolute favourite), the leaf is then rinsed and fed to cows to close the loop of sustainable consumption. The composition of food is aligned with the three internal energies as stated in Ayurveda — vatta, pitta and kapha. The thali employs ayurvedic principles to preserve the inherent goodness of seasonal and local ingredients. There is balance, unity and nourishment where each dish finds the sweet spot between science, technique and compassion.

Life lesson #3:

Be in the present

Like life, a thali pulls you in, activates and engages all the senses. I am yet to meet someone who isn’t visibly moved by the visual richness of a thali, or witness more focussed silence when navigating through the different dishes. Invariably the silence is punctuated with people swapping recipes or narrating the traditions of the cuisine. Of how their Kashmiri grandmother always cooks with mustard oil or the traditional way of cooking Makhane Ki Kheer is over a low flame and then gently scrape the khurchan (sticky layer of milk at the bottom of the pan) into this foxnut-based dessert. This rediscovery of legacy and technique tugs at every sense and fibre of attention. As poor as the analogy may be, if there were a meal to match a mammoth KJo production, it would be a thali. Albeit, with substance.

My company, DSSC (Delhi Secret Supper Club), curates and produces dining experiences across the country. We’ve been blessed to work with talented chefs, multiple homegrown brands and some of the globe’s most iconic brands. Every week, our steadfast and skilled team of accountants look puzzled with the invoice-commentary submitted to them. Between raising invoices for Peruvian food festivals to understanding the ROI (return on investment) on influencer marketing bills, an innocuous question was asked about why we never host a thali supper.

Before we applaud their marketing ingenuity (and scepticism towards influencers), please know that this was quietly prompted by Father Dear. The eternal thali lover, the man who has managed to convince poor Mother into finding a thali joint on every local and international holiday. Whether in Pune or Paris or Iceland, the man finds a way to be united with his thali, his happy food.

Suckers for all things local and seasonal, we started studying regional Indian cuisine — the history, the options, the techniques, the cultural context, the business. The excitement that ensued resulted in launching the world’s first curated celebration of the iconic Indian thali, aptly named The Thali Tradition. The complex matrix of the Indian thali transcends beyond satisfying the appetite, it’s a full blown celebration of authenticity, diversity and cultural exploration. After two successful editions, we learnt two things about India’s diners and wealth.

1. The diner seeks familiarity even within experimentation

There’s a lot stated about the fickle diner community today, whether it’s their damaging attraction towards deep-discounts. But then again, who wouldn’t be in a market bursting at the seams with limitless options of restaurants, dishes on the menu (ugh, pet peeve), Netflix-paired delivery joints, deals and so on. However, I do have a take on this. Liberalisation may have given birth to a surge in consumption, but it hasn’t changed basic diner-DNA that seeks familiarity. As avant garde as you would be, solace is often found in a specific ingredient, grain, scent. The Indian diner has evolved dramatically in the last five years, with increased patronage towards global cuisine and food-tech. But it also ensured a thali festival to sell out within three days of going live, in 2018 and 2019.

2. India’s wealth is its diverse people and traditions

Devdutt Pattnaik accurately states that the best way to destroy culture is to destroy the kitchen. Kitchens give birth to community, nurture tradition and preserve important culinary heritage. I am blown away by the fascinating diversity offered by indigenous regions of our land. Forget different states, the very same arhar dal (pigeon pea pulse) is made differently in kitchens 200 metres apart. A Bohri thali teaches us the joy of communal eating, a Bengali thali encourages us to start the meal with shukto (a preparation of mixed vegetables with bitter gourd), a Khasi kitchen gives us the knowledge of smoking and fermenting, a Kayasth kitchen celebrates the Ganga-Jamuni composite culture, the Rajasthani thali showcases dishes with bare usage of fresh produce.

Ritu Dalmia is acclaimed for her Italian fare, but the roots are in her Calcutta-Marwari household. She explains, “Marwaris have always been migratory in nature and most of them settled in Rajasthan, Calcutta, Surat, Nagpur, basically wherever they could make money. While a Rajasthani menu includes gatta, chakki, papad manger, sanger, Marwari food was heavily influenced by the zone they settled in. For example, the famous Aloo Kumda ki Sabzi made in every Marwari household has Bengali influences with the use of panch phoran.”

From homes and kitchens across the country to state bhavans to mass-concepts like Chokhi Dhani, the thali has remained cemented in the pages of culinary history and culture. It would be foolish to state that it’s making a comeback or making a formidable case study in the F&B business. While some are tweaking it to suit the millennial audience (heads up, most of it has always been gluten free, don’t be fooled!), some are presenting a half-baked version of the authentic thali and riding the trend-wave, many across the globe continue their deep love for the apparently-humble, not-too-sexy, but wildly-satisfying thali.

Ask the shauhar. He almost reconsidered the marriage on our post-wedding holiday to Japan while looking at his thali-devouring wife in Kyoto. Like father, like daughter. Like food, must love thali.

94,05-1-20,If one book said it all,"The Bhagavad Gita is not only tempting for its esoteric concepts but also applicable beyond limits of time and lucid in understanding, writes Radhanath Swami Maharaj

The humanly quest for knowledge, survival and pleasure has seen countless books produced in the history of mankind. Apart from being in the bestseller list, some of these books have been truly revolutionary. Among all the books, one book holds truly a special place as being designated as such by Great Adi Shankaracharya.

He says, Eko Shastro Devaki Putra Gitam: Let there be one scripture the song by the son of Devaki, Krishna, and that scripture is Bhagavad Gita. Bhagavad Gita has the knowledge about the absolute truth in his features as a personal reality, localised Paramatma and all-pervading Brahman. It gives knowledge about living entities, the material creation, demigods, the law of Karma, time factor, the three modes of nature, food, lifestyle, nature of mind, and so on.

Krishna himself declares this knowledge to be the best knowledge, knowing which nothing in this world remains to be known since one comes to know Lord Krishna as root cause of everything and even everything being made of his different energies.

As the annual Gita Jayanti was celebrated recently, it is important to understand its glory so that we can truly appreciate it from the hearts and even apply the teachings of Gita in our lives. The special characteristics of Bhagavad Gita are enlisted to bring forth glory of Bhagavad Gita.

Oldest but fresh, and appealing even now

The Bhagavad Gita is not only a multi-millennial classic and tempting for its esoteric concepts but also fresh being applicable beyond limits of time and lucid in understanding. Sages from the past ages to modern scientists, philosophers and politicians like Einstein, Emerson, Thoreau, Huxley, Hesse, Mahatma Gandhi have notably appreciated the glory of Bhagavad Gita.

Indian prime minister Narendra Modi gifted a copy of Gita to Japanese emperor and glorified it with words “Because I don’t think that I have anything more to give [than Bhagavad Gita] and the world also does not have anything more to get than this.”

Comprehensive but distinctive

It’s not only comprehensive to accommodate all levels of understanding of divinity to shelter everyone as per their level and desire of practice but it’s distinctive in terms of presenting the highest understanding of this divinity as a personal God for those who are willing to go for the ultimate.

The Bhagavad Gita discusses Karma yoga, Gyan yoga, Ashtanga yoga to guide practitioners attracted to one these paths and help them advance.

It also proposes various levels of spiritual practice based on the levels of people’s spiritual advancement [BG 12.8-12], but in the end it concludes with a clarion call of full-hearted surrender abandoning all other processes to the personality of Godhead with an assurance of deliverance of surrendered soul to the perfection.

Lofty but practical

It not only provides an intellectually convincing understanding of lofty concepts of absolute reality and compels one to pursue spiritual life, but it provides a practical way for its achievement and love appeal made in it impels one for the path of Bhakti that is, connecting with personal God in loving service.

Many books appeal to mind and intelligence but fail to provide a practical method to achieve the goals mentioned in them. But Bhagavad Gita with its philosophical logic not only presents the progressive understanding of absolute reality but also the proposes practical path (for example, BG 9.26-27) which even could be practiced and perfected by rank and file order of human society as it is mentioned in BG 9.32.

Bhagavad Gita also contains practical teachings regarding type of food, lifestyle, work, charity, behavior, speech, and renunciation etc. conducive for practice of spiritual life.

Short and concise but broad and unrelenting

It’s short and concise to include what all it needs to know and perfect the life still it’s very broad and unrelenting since it describes the unlimited personality of Godhead. The speaker of Gita, Krishna says in BG 7.2 “by knowing this knowledge there shall remain nothing further to be known.”

In 700 verses of Gita, Krishna gives complete knowledge needed to know about the spiritual perfection. Understanding of this knowledge leads one to practice the spiritual culture discussed in it, But since absolute truth is without any cessation and omnipresent, the realisation of it from Bhagavad Gita is always progressive.

As Krishna says in Gita 10.40: “O mighty conqueror of enemies, there is no end to My divine manifestations. What I have spoken to you is but a mere indication of My infinite opulence.”

101,05-1-20,Full Statehood to be part of AAP poll manifesto: Kejriwal,"While Election Commission (EC) is yet to announce the date of Assembly elections in Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that full Statehood status for Delhi will be the part of AAP's manifesto.

Full statehood for Delhi was the main poll plank of AAP in the Lok Sabha elections last year. However, it failed to impress the people of Delhi and AAP candidates lost on all seven seats in the city.

Addressing the fifth Town Hall meeting, anchored by ABP news channel, Kejriwal said full statehood is the only promise the party was not able to fulfil.

“Full statehood for Delhi will be part of the AAP's election manifesto and the party will keep fighting for it,” he asserted. The AAP is expected to release its manifesto between January 15 to 20, Kejriwal had said earlier.

AAP supremo also said that if re-elected he will make roads in Delhi like that of London and Tokyo in the next five years.

“We have hired consultants to identify bottlenecks in the city where traffic congestion takes place. They will submit their plan in the next couple of months and based on their suggestions, we will try to solve the problem of traffic congestion,” he said.

He reiterated his promise to make bus rides free for others if he is re-elected. He had said this earlier in his second town-hall meeting. The meetings are part of AAP's election campaign.

“A lot of work still has to be done in Delhi. Yamuna has to be cleaned, Delhi has to be cleaned, pollution needs to be controlled and transport needs to be improved,” he said.

“We had started about 300 Mohalla Clinics in Delhi and 150 Mohalla Clinics will be opened tomorrow,” said Kejriwal.

Expressing concern over increasing number of fire incidents in Delhi, he said action will be taken if a trend is found in fire incidents.

“I'm concerned about the incidents of fire. We have ordered inquiries into all these incidents and if we find a trend on reasons behind the fires and we can solve them by taking a particular action, then we will definitely implement it,” he said.

102,05-1-20,Where is your shelter?,"If we take shelter in God, we will never be deprived of our basic necessities, including a place of residence, says AJIT KUMAR BISHNOI

The word shelter to a common man usually means the fact of having a place to live or stay, considered a basic human need. Then, there is a philosophical meaning, which is dependence — the state of needing the help and support of something or somebody in order to survive or be successful. For example, a devotee takes shelter in God, as instructed by Him in the Geeta for gaining peace and the eternal abode. (18.62)

Let me start with the physical aspect of shelter, that is, where we normally stay — our residences. Is that your shelter really? Why then are you forced to take shelter in a hospital when you are sick? Because your usual residence is not your real shelter. It is at best a temporary shelter. Don’t we change our places of residences in our lives? Don’t we go and stay in hotels for brief periods? The reality is that what we identify as our shelters/residences have been given to us according to our karmaphalas. In one interesting instance, a person was destined to live in large bungalows, as predicted by his astrologer, and he did till his death.

Let us try to understand this with an example of a person, who has died some time back. Let us imagine that the soul returns to his earlier place of residence in another body; the building, he owned earlier still stands. Will he be allowed to reclaim the property? No, because the soul did not own the property; he was given the facility temporarily based upon his karmaphalas, and this was related to his earlier body. Once someone dies, he takes with himself all his balance karmaphalas, both good and bad; nothing is left behind related to his earlier body. He gets another body, which has no relationship to his earlier body. The property he owned earlier gets transferred to another soul/other souls, and he has no right left over it.

Then what is our permanent shelter? But before I answer this question, let me also discuss the other types of shelters, not residences, those we seek. The most common is money. We feel that when we have adequate amount of money we are okay. Is it true? If it was, then, why do some well off people leave their homes and seek shelter in some ashrama? Because having sufficient money for one’s needs is very nice but that is not really your shelter. The same is true of power. Many strive ceaselessly for gaining power and then what happens when that power, if gained, is taken away from you and you are left ruing. Fame is another shelter desired by many. This proves to be hollow in not so foreseeable future. Beauty, as a shelter, has a date of extinguishment for sure.

Now we are ready to identify our real shelter as many sannyasis, the genuine ones, do. They leave their homes and become totally dependent on God. What does God do? He provides them shelters day after day throughout their remaining lives. It is no wonder that such sannyasis never return to the residences they had left behind. If it wasn’t so, no one will ever opt to become a sannyasi, and the ashrama system will become invalid. It hasn’t so far and will never become because it is God’s creation, and He ensures that what He decrees stays. As a matter of fact, those surrendered to God are never bereft of this basic necessity of a human being. There is the entire creation available to such persons; God ensures that they are always taken care of no matter where they are.

Therefore, let us take shelter in God, as instructed by Him. We will never be deprived of our basic necessities, including a place of residence. Rather those linked with God are blessed to have opulence, victory, wealth and moral principles. The choice is ours.

103,05-1-20,THE BREAK WE NEED,"Vanuatu

Almost 2,000 miles west of Australia, this picturesque archipelago nation is home to rugged islands, deserted beaches and stunning Pacific wildlife. Vanuatu comprises over 80 islands and has the highest density of languages per capita in the world — over 100 native languages are spoken throughout the archipelago. The range of activities on offer are also diverse — from hiking up a volcano to world-class scuba diving.

Cali, Colombia

The world’s salsa capital not only offers energizing local music and dance, its rich Afro-Colombian heritage has also infused the city with a distinctive caleño culture. Cali has a real zest and an unmistakably electrifying atmosphere. This melting pot of indigenous, European and African cultures has a tropical party vibe and energizing nightlife — and at around 1,000 meters above sea level it enjoys a warm and breezy temperature during the day and a refreshingly cool one at night.

Cape Canaveral, FL, US

This Floridian cape is best known around the world as the site of the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station but it also offers an incredible 72 miles of beachfront and three significant protected areas — Canaveral National Seashore, Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge and Sebastian Inlet State Park. In July 2020, Cape Canaveral will be poised once again for the international stage — this time as the launch site of NASA’s Mars 2020 Exploration Programme.

Aberdeen, Scotland

Aberdeen, located in northeast Scotland, is known as the Granite City thanks to the gleaming white stone that much of the city has been built with. Scotland’s third largest city has much to offer besides a striking cityscape: from fine dining, galleries and museums in the city itself, to rugged coastal scenery and romantic ruins in the surrounding countryside. And like many other destinations on our list, Aberdeen has major sustainability plans in place with the aim of drastically reducing carbon emissions.

Courtenay, BC, Canada

Courtenay, set in the charming Comox Valley on Vancouver Island, is the perfect starting point for outdoor adventurers. Surrounded by rolling mountains, alpine meadows and bohemian villages, this charming small city is another favourite with the eco-conscious traveler.

Tokyo, Japan

While Tokyo might not be off-the-beaten track, it has deservedly secured a place in our top trending list thanks in part to the upcoming Summer Olympics. In July and August next year, Japan will play host to the world’s best athletes for the fourth time. The world’s largest metropolitan area has put in place a comprehensive strategy to ensure the Games are an environmentally-friendly event: reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions and using renewable energy, public transport and low-energy vehicles.

Kerala, India

For many travelers, Kerala is South India's most enchanting state. With its palm-lined coast, rolling coffee plantations and stunning Arabian Sea views, Kerala is an oasis of calm in a country that moves at a busy pace. And with an impressive array of beaches, lakes, mountains and waterfalls, Kerala is home to some of the best eco-friendly destinations on the subcontinent.

104,05-1-20,Trump bucked conventional thinking to slay Soleimani,"The US President is not the first American leader to have Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in his sights, but he was the first to pull the trigger

US President Donald Trump is not the first American leader to have Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in his sights, but he was the first to pull the trigger. It’s a pattern that has emerged throughout Trump’s presidency. On a range of national security matters, he has cast aside the same warnings that gave his predecessors in both parties pause.

At times, he has simply been willing to embrace more risk. In other moments, he has questioned the validity of the warnings altogether, even from experts within his own administration. And he has publicly taken pride in doing so.

When Trump moved the US Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a pledge others had made but ultimately backed away from, it was against the advice of aides who argued it would inflame tensions in West Asia. When he became the first US leader to step foot in North Korea, he disregarded those who said he was giving Pyongyang a symbolic victory without getting anything in return.

Trump’s supporters have embraced his willingness to act where others would not, saying he has brought a businessman’s fresh eye to intractable problems. But his high-risk approach has sparked fear in Democrats, as well as some Republicans, who worry that Trump is overly focused on short-term wins and blind to the long-term impact of his actions. “Trump thinks foreign policy is a reality show, and if there aren’t devastating consequences the next day, then they won’t come,” said Ben Rhodes, who served as President Barack Obama’s deputy national security adviser. “They are coming — in some cases, they already have, in others, the situation is getting progressively worse.”

Trump’s willingness to buck conventional thinking has been a defining feature of his political life. As he enters the final year of his first term, aides and allies describe him as increasingly emboldened to act on his instincts. He’s banished the coterie of advisers who viewed themselves as “guardrails” against his impulse. Others, like former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, have left because they disagreed with Trump’s decision-making.

Trump’s approach to national security has been shaped in part by the response to one of his first major actions: airstrikes against Syria in retaliation for the use of chemical weapons in 2017, a few months after he took office. He relished in the fact that both Republicans and Democrats cheered the decision, one that Obama had backed away from.

Obama halted plans for a strike in 2013 in part because he feared it would drag the US into a wider conflict. That

didn’t happen after Trump’s targeted strike — though quagmire in Syria remains and the US still has a small troop presence in the country. The consequences of Trump’s brash foreign policy decisions have indeed been mixed.

His decision to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem did not, in fact, prompt an uptick in violence in the West Asia. But it also did nothing to help the Trump White House ease mounting tensions with the Palestinians, cratering prospects for progress on a peace deal with the Israelis.

Trump’s decision to embrace direct diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, including a meeting at the dividing line between North and South Korea, has resulted in little progress toward dismantling Pyongyang’s nuclear programme. Negotiations have largely broken down, and Kim said this week that his country would soon unveil a new strategic weapon.

The US President also faced fierce backlash from his own party last year when he abruptly announced that he was withdrawing US forces from Syria, clearing the way for Turkey to launch an offensive against Kurdish forces allied with the US. Trump initially dug in on his decision, but ultimately reversed course.

To Trump’s critics, his decision to order a targeted strike against Soleimani may be his riskiest decision yet. Both the Obama and George W Bush administrations passed on the prospect of taking out Soleimani, the leader of Iran’s elite Quds Force who is accused of helping orchestrate attacks on American troops in Iraq. Even Trump advisers acknowledged the risk of Iranian retaliation, which could pull the US and Tehran into a direct military conflict.

“One of these days, he’s going to blunder himself into a real, full-blown crisis,” Marie Harf, a senior adviser to former Secretary of State John Kerry, said of Trump. “The Soleimani assassination may be the reckless move by Trump that sends us into full-scale conflict.”

But to Trump backers, it’s just another hyperbolic response to a warranted action by the President. Nebraska Republican Senator Ben Sasse criticised those who he said were treating Soleimani’s killing like it “was the end of the world.” Sasse said that while he and Trump don’t always see eye-to-eye on policy issues, Trump was right to take this step. “The fact of the matter is, Iran in general and Soleimani in particular had been ramping up attacks,” Sasse said. “There had to be a red line around the loss of American life.”",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/trump-bucked-conventional-thinking-to-slay-soleimani.html

110,05-1-20,2020: You & your money,"What does this new year have in store for you? Astrologer and palmist, Acharya Praveen Chauhan, shares financial predictions for the year ahead

Aries: You will not only crossover all the hurdles during this period, but your imminent talent will enable you to sum-up into expected success. Stress free personal regimen is suggested. Successful overseas Business tours and new financial connections are in offing.

Taurus: This is a most compatible period for you all to start a new business — one that you have been planning since long. The relations you have built over the years will help you conquer the world. Likewise, resolve to do the same for others and help them even if it is beyond your means.

Gemini: Stars predict that you are in for big success; especially those who are in the field of e-business or related with software and multimedia. Your perceptions of competition with your rivals cannot be fructified, but your own independent vision will bring laurels to you. Compassion towards deprived shall be your boon from the heavens.

Cancer: Your businesses will touch an unexpected high in the later part of 2020. As the dictum states: “Nothing is gained without striving hard”, the Cancerians would witness an exceptional spurt in their endeavour as the year progresses. Zodiac predicts a tremendous success for all first generation entrepreneurs and start-ups.

Leo: Stars suggest that you may start a new venture. They also suggest that the project may not take off as desired. But my predictions for you in 2020 is that fortunes are with you. Though success appears shaky in the beginning, things will look up for real good towards the end of the year. For investors, a pertinent caution is inevitable.

Virgo: Stars suggest that all ventures (whatever those may be) must be initiated. Just go ahead and take the plunge. A word of caution though. Don’t let your ever inquisitive and suspicious nature dampen the spirit and thwart your own brilliant moves. Plan your finances wisely.

Libra: Partnerships are not meant for you. Go ahead if you will, but be careful not to get greedy. Even in the existing partnerships, try to be rational. Never mind the fluctuating profits throughout the year. Better to focus on new ventures. It would do good to devote the year to personal appeasement.

Scorpio: It is a good time to initiate your offspring into business of your dreams. Don’t approach the easy way, follow and comply with the whims of all concerned. Pleasure with work shall be your mantra for success.

Sagittarius: What you value most it is up to you. Choose whatever you may — work, success, gratification, appeasement, relations or financial success — just make sure not to get whimsical. Life and success is not dependent on your personal whims. Follow the rules of life.

Capricorn: Planetary configuration says that you will expand your endeavours in multidimensional spheres, in different channels in 2020. You may be on the top of the world but personal relations may cause you to be miserable, and even hamper your self esteem. Beware! You may be surrounded by a multitude of opportunities. Just stay clear of any trappings of business exigencies.

Aquarius: Don’t be upset by the failures you may have had in the past. All your decisions would be wise. You are overswayed by the sycophantic appreciation which is never in positive perception. Boon in disguise; your collaborators will support you, whether in social life or in finance.

Pisces: Have faith in yourself and not be beguiled by the circumstances as stars appear to point out. You will bounce back and even rule in the second half of the year. Take care of your emotional health and of your own personal image.

111,05-1-20,Astroturf,"As the euphoria of New Year celebrations would be over by now, it’s time to get on to the wish list that many of you would have made. Nothing, however, just comes to one’s asking. Remember, we live in a complex world where every being is born unique, each manifesting varying mind-trends. In such a framework, no initiative could go about without being faced with challenges — from within because of own mental inconsistencies or those posed by competing interests and contrarian forces. Braving all these odds, we could still succeed in our mission, if we put in our qualitative best. That, however, would be possible provided we service our mind, following which our profound empowerment tool ‘Buddhi’ — the faculty of discriminate intelligence — shall be in active mode. That will make you discriminate and drop unachievable targets, pick up the right lead, articulate your actions well, and intelligently combat challenges coming in the way. Yet, nothing will go about on expected lines if ever the environmental conditions remain unfavourable.

Let’s therefore, look at the astrological pointers to the probable course, the nation is expected to go through during the ongoing year. Purposely, in order that we are prepared individually and collectively. The first marker would be the legacy of 2019 we have carried forward, coming as it may with Solar eclipse that happened on December 26. For, eclipse charts reflect upon major change in energy dynamics of the cosmos that has related bearing on how the nation as a collective is expected to be headed towards.

The eclipse is happening in a fiery sign Sagittarius, which incidentally is the 8th house of India’s Independence chart, identified with serious difficulties and death. There is a cluster of 7 planets in Sagittarius at the time of eclipse — Rahu, Mercury, Sun, Moon, Jupiter, Ketu, Saturn and Pluto, the last two being natural signifying planets of death. This particular planetary alignment brings in the possibility of increase in incidence of fire leading to mass deaths. Also, people’s discontent and dissension may create upsetting situations. Jupiter conjunct Ketu, incidentally opposite natal Mars in India’s Independence chart, points the possibility of widening of communal divide. Read together with Mercury’s presence in the eclipse sign implies that such policy decisions as would create a sense of distrust, may lead to discontent. Also, the ignorant may loudmouth and harass the intellectuals. All these are already in sight. Sagittarius being a war sign raises serious security concerns at the border. Lot of people of eminence may leave the world. The second marker worth consideration is planetary conjunctions to follow. Towards March end and early April, Mars will be conjunct Jupiter and Saturn, which raises the possibility of communal flare up and possibility of war like situation.

The next marker is Annular Solar eclipse due on June 21, 2020. It is happening on 4th-10th axis of the eclipse chart. It signals loss of government’s credibility because of their own failure to visualise implications of their policy initiatives, as would retrograde Mercury’s presence there imply. Saturn’s opposition to natal Moon in India’s Independence chart implies people’s discontent. Later in November, both Saturn and Jupiter will be conjunct in Capricorn, the natural signifying sign of India. Such conjunctions, termed as ‘Great Mutation’ happens at an interval of 20 years pointing to major change in nation’s polity and societal dynamics likely to follow.

Saturn’s transit to Capricorn sign on 24th January, is by itself enough to indicate serious problems in the offing. For, it would be opposite natal Moon, Mercury, Venus, Saturn and the Sun in succession in nation’s Independence chart. They respectively signify, masses in general, youth, finance, downtrodden, and the head of government. It happened last in 1990. The period thereafter was marked with political instability. Three Prime Ministers changed hands between 1990 end and 1991. Cast clashes following reservation granted to backward classes resulted in death of a large number of youths. Advaniji’s rath yatra excited communal passion, which eventually led to demolition of Babri Masjid. Economy was in shambles forcing us to mortgage Gold to service our debts and manage country’s finance. To overcome financial crisis, economic policy underwent paradigm shift during P V Narasimha Rao’s regime. That gave a fresh impetus to nation’s economy. Terrorism was at its peak in Punjab. Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in a suicide bomb attack in May 1991 during an election rally. This doesn’t necessarily mean a similar repeat, but we seem to be due for serious challenges ahead.

120,05-1-20,Temperature likely to dip from Jan 6 in north India,"After breaking record of 119 years, the worst is yet to come in north India including the national Capital region. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) and a private weather forecaster Skymet has predicted rain and snow in north India from January 6-7. The reason is the formation of fresh western disturbance (WD) over Himalaya hills. This is likely to bring cold wave in the north India and also bring down the maximum and minimum temperature.

Meanwhile, several areas in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir received fresh snowfall on Saturday as the mercury rose marginally across north Indian plains, which had been under the grip of a severe cold spell for over two weeks. Popular tourist destinations Shimla and

Manali in Himachal Pradesh witnessed the first snowfall of 2020, bringing cheers to tourists and hoteliers alike, while cold conditions persisted in the northern plains despite a marginal increase in temperature. Manali in Kullu district received snowfall on Saturday morning, whereas State Capital Shimla witnessed snowfall in the afternoon. The snowfall brought cheers on the faces of tourists and hoteliers alike.

The IMD said that cold wave conditions is expected to return from January 6-7 in north and northwest India due to western disturbance which will change the wind speed from easterly to northwesterly. “Wind will start from Hills to plain area which bring cold wave conditions,” the IMD said. According to Dr Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist of IMD, weather in India is becoming increasingly difficult to predict, both in the short and the long term due to its tropical area.

According to Skymet, a trail of western disturbance would continue through January as rain and snow would pick up pace from January 6 till January 8 after a brief break till Sunday.

Meanwhile, the IMD has issued a yellow warning for thunderstorm accompanied with hail and lightning at isolated places in plains, low and middle hills of the state on January 6 and 7 in Himachal Pradesh. The MeT department issues colour-coded warnings to alert the public ahead of severe or hazardous weather which has the potential to cause “damage, widespread disruption and/or danger to life”. Yellow is the least dangerous among the warnings.

Rajasthan continued to reel under cold weather conditions with Fatehpur town in Sikar district being the coldest place in the state recording a minimum of 3.4 degrees Celsius. This continuous weather activity on account of back to back weather systems would have an impact over the weather of northwestern plains including Delhi-NCR.

With this, winters in January can be touted to be harsher than December. It is not the night temperatures but the cold days which would be main reason for discomfort,” Skymet said. During the month of January and February, rains are slightly heavier in the northeastern states. Arunachal Pradesh is the largest beneficiary and sees 3-4 times higher rains than other subdivisions. While, the least is for Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, and Tripura.

The New Year for North India began on a chilly note with several places recording temperatures below 1 degree Celsius. Rajasthan's Sri Ganganagar, which nearly touched the 50-degree mark last summer, shivered at 1.5 degrees Celsius.

North India including Delhi recorded the coldest December day in last 119 years since the year 1901 when record-keeping began. Delhi also witnessed cold wave conditions as the minimum temperature settled at 2.4 degrees Celsius, five notches below normal.

Three days ago, the national capital experienced its coldest day in December in 119 years with the day temperature recording 9.4 degrees Celsius. The temperature recorded by the Safdurjung laboratory at 2:30 pm was 9.4 degrees Celsius.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/temperature-likely-to-dip-from-jan-6-in-north-india.html
121,05-1-20,"AIADMK, DMK bag 13 districts each, Sivaganga throws out hung House","The age old proverb ‘there’s many a slip ’twixt the cup and the lip’ proved to be true once again as the results of Tamil Nadu’s local body election for 27 districts were announced by late Friday night.

Though the Opposition DMK was ahead of the ruling AIADMK while results from districts were trickling in during the day time, scenario underwent a major change during the last phase of counting.

The AIADMK which was trailing till then surged ahead by late Friday evening and ‘squared up’ for the losses it suffered during the day time.

When the final results of the district panchayat wards were declared, the DMK and the AIADMK shared the honours by winning 13 districts each while Shivaganga yielded a split verdict.

Out of the 515 wards in 27 districts where election was held, the DMK won 217 seats while the AIADMK had to content with 187 seats. Similarly, out of the 5090 panchayat union wards, the DMK walked away with 2000 seats while the AIADMK had to content with 1668 seats .

Though there are 3 districts in Tamil Nadu, only 27 districts went to the polls in December 2 and 30 as per the order of the apex court.

Election to the remaining districts would e held after the process of the delimitation and finalisation of reservation of wards for the scheduled caste are completed. Urban local bodies too would go to the polls in a later stage, according to Tamil Nadu State Election Commission.

Though there were indications of the repetition of the Lok Sabha election in April 2019 when the DMK together with its allies swept the polls, the final results show that the game of politics is still open in the State, according to Sreekumar Balakrishnan, veteran political commentator. “Ill not say it was a big win for DMK and a major loss for the AIADMK. The polls which were due in 2016 got delayed because of the series of cases filed by the DMK. The State Election Commission had completed all formalities including the scrutiny of nomination papers when the Madras High Court stayed the entire process citing the non completion of delimitation and reservation process,” said Balakrishnan.

Interestingly, Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami who remained incommunicado throughout Friday issued a release by late night thanking the voters for the trust they ‘showered’ on AIADMK. Eight months after the setback in the Lok Sabha polls, the party has regained the affection and support of the people.

We consolidated the position of the government, overcoming adversities that were caused by the verdict of the Lok Sabha polls,” said Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam in a joint statement.

M K Stalin, leader of the Opposition and DMK president charged the Government for misusing government machinery and the services of the State Election Commission to make sure that the victory of the AIADMK. Stalin also alleged that the ruling party got the election delayed though it was to be held in 2016. “Had the urban local body election too was held along with this polls, the DMK would have swept the election,” said Stalin.

According to Balakrishnan, Tamil Nadu would see a tight fight in the 2021 assembly election as DMK is in an aggressive mood. “The party has been out of power in the State since 2011 and in the Centre since February 2013. The cadre could be rejuvenated only by winning the assembly election,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/aiadmk--dmk-bag-13-districts-each----sivaganga-throws-out-hung-house.html
122,05-1-20,"Aditya Thackeray opts out of anti-CAA, NRC meet at last moment","Amid a controversy over his sharing a platform with controversial student leader Umar Khalid at the meet, Maharashtra Minister and Shiv Sena leader Aditya Thackeray on Saturday opted out of a national students’ conference on Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) being held in the city on Sunday.

Aditya — who had earlier consented to participate along with the leaders of the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and speak at the anti-CAA-NRC conference to be held at the Yeshwantrao Chavan Centre on Sunday — conveyed to the organisers on Saturday about his inability to attend the conference ostensibly due to pre-occupation with other work.

Confirming the absence of Aditya at the anti-CAA-NRC conference, Chhatra Bharati’s Mumbai unit President Sachin M. Bansode told “the Pioneer”: “Aditya Thackeray has informed us that he will not be able to attend tomorrow’s conference. However, he has not given any reason for his inability to attend the conference”.

Sources said that Aditya might have chosen to skip the anti-CAA-NRC conference to avoid sharing of a platform with Khalid, a former student of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) who was involved in the 2016 JNU sedition controversy. Khalid is one of the key speakers at the meet.

Apart from Khalid, the other prominent speakers at Sunday’s anti- CAA-NRC conference are poet and lyricist Javed Akhtar, Aligarh Muslim University Students Union President Salman Imtiaz, Jamia Milia University student leader Hammadur Rehman, TISSSU chief Bhatta Ram, student leaders Sadiya Shaikh and Richa Singh.

Another reason for Aditya’s absence at Sunday’s conference being cited in the Sena circles is another controversy over some unsavoury allegation made in a booklet on Veer Savarkar brought out by the Congress-affiliated All India Congress Seva Dal as part of its 10-day camp in Madhya Pradesh.

The other key speakers at the conference are Congress leader Cabinet Minister in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government tin the state Varsha Gaikwad, NCP MLA and Sharad Pawar’s grand nephew Rohit Pawar and Lok Bharati chief Kapil Patil.

“Chhatra Bharati” and other anti-CAA-NRC joint action committee of other student and leftist organisations have organised Sunday’s conference.

The other organisations who have teamed up with “Chhatra Bharati” to organise the conference are: AISF, SFI, ASA, TISS Students Unions, Samyak, MASU, SIO, CYSS, PSU, Republican Panther, AIPC, AYW, Vidyarthi Bharati and Mumbai Graduates Forum.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/aditya-thackeray-opts-out-of-anti-caa--nrc-meet-at-last-moment.html
123,05-1-20,AI passengers threaten to open cockpit door; DGCA seeks action,"The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has asked Air India to act against unruly passengers who banged on the cockpit door and misbehaved with crew of a delayed Delhi-Mumbai flight on Thursday (January 2).

According to official, unruly passengers allegedly manhandled cabin crew members and threatened to break open the cockpit door of Air India's Boeing 747 aircraft after their Delhi-Mumbai flight on Thursday was delayed due to a technical problem.

“The AI865 flight on Thursday got delayed as it developed a technical snag. It had to return to the bay. Passengers started knocking on the cockpit door, asking and taunting the pilots to come out,” official said.

“One male passenger even said that he will break open the cockpit door if the pilots didn't come out,” the official said, adding the situation inside the plane “went from bad to worse”.

According to the official, a female passenger allegedly even manhandled a cabin crew member, grabbing her arm in order to open the main exit gate quickly.

Videos have emerged showing some young passengers banging on the cockpit door, asking the pilots to come out. “Captain please one out… Loser come out… Come out or we will break the door…” they yell to the cockpit crew. Cockpit is on the upper deck of B747s where AI has its business class. One passenger in the videos even knows that doing so is against the law and can be heard saying “I do not have a criminal record and don't want one.”

When AI finally asks passengers to alight from the aircraft, another video shows a passenger trying to open the door even as the crew are in the process of doing so. Her co-passengers asked this person to step aside and let the cabin crew open the door. “Don't do this they will open it,” co-passengers are seen telling this person.

Air India spokesperson said the operating crew has been asked to submit a detailed report on the reported misbehaviour by some passengers. “The flight AI 865 of 2nd January was considerably delayed due to technical reasons. Air India management have asked the operating crew for a detailed report on the reported misbehaviour by some passengers. Further action would be considered after getting the report,” the spokesperson said.

An official of aviation regulator DGCA said that they have asked Air India to take action against the “unruly behaviour” of passengers.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ai-passengers-threaten-to-open-cockpit-door--dgca-seeks-action.html

127,05-1-20,Mumbai top cop orders probe into RTI activist assault case,"Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve on Saturday ordered a probe into the attack on RTI activist Yashwant Shinde, allegedly by Deputy Commissioner of Police - Zone III, Avinash Kumar.

Kumar is also the designated First Appellate Authority for RTI.

This was conveyed to a delegation of RTI and social activists who called on him (Barve) to submit a memorandum and demand stringent action against DCP Kumar.

Barve assured them that the probe into the matter - which has triggered outrage among various activists - will be completed by January 10.

The delegation, which included former Chief Information Commissioner Shailesh Gandhi, Sucheta Dalal, G. R. Vora, Dolphy D'Souza, Bhaskar Prabhu and Anil Galgali along with the victim Shinde submitted a memorandum to Barve and Joint Police Commissioner Santosh Rastogi.

The delegation members informed the two top officers that since there was no CCTV camera inside the cabin of the DCP who assaulted Shinde, the police should check the CCTV footage outside his office, Galgali told IANS.

In the memorandum, they said that Shinde had sought certain details under RTI about the police department's functioning from DCP Kumar, but since he was not satisfied with the replies, he filed a First Appeal to the designated RTI official.

When Shinde was called for the First Appeal hearing on December 27 last year, DCP Kumar allegedly shouted at him, and started assaulting, kicking and punching him.

The DCP also asked three other policemen to hold him and continued to rain blows on him and at one point he attempted to strangulate Shinde.

Bleeding profusely, Shinde was taken to the nearby Byculla Police Station, which refused to register a complaint against the DCP. Even the Police Control Room didn't cooperate and he finally went to KEM Hospital for treatment and a medical certificate, Galgali added.

After three days, on December 30, Shinde submitted his complaint to the Police Commissioner's office.

The delegation said that the DCP's behaviour was ""unacceptable"" and ""a gross violation of the RTI activist's fundamental rights"".

They added that ""a laughable story is being circulated"" claiming Shinde fell from a chair and sustained injuries, and urged Barve to immediately access the CCTV footage from the DCP office and take it in his custody, Galgali said.

The delegation also called upon the Police Commissioner to initiate action against those officials in Byculla Police Station and Police Control Room who failed to help Shinde register his complaint in the matter that day.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mumbai-top-cop-orders-probe-into-rti-activist-assault-case.html
128,05-1-20,JNU admin says students ransacked server room; JNUSU says ‘masked' security guards attacked them,"The Jawaharlal Nehru University administration said students agitating over the hike in hostel fees ""ransacked"" the server room and ""intimidated"" the technical staff on Saturday, hampering the semester registration process.

But JNUSU said the administration used ""masked"" security guards to attack students. ""They were shamefully wearing masks. JNUSU president was openly slapped by one of the security guards,"" alleged the students' union, which has called for a boycott of the process over the increase in hostel fees.

The semester registration process will end on January 5.

The university has been seeing a standoff between the students and the administration over hike in hostel fees for over 70 days. Students even boycotted exams in protest, prompting the administration to send question papers to students through WhatsApp and email, a move condemned by the union.

Explaining the events, the university said the technical staff gained access to the communication and information services (CIS) premises Saturday morning, after the servers were made dysfunctional by students on Friday, with the help of security guards and rebooted the servers, the university said.

But a group of ""miscreants"" entered the server room, intimidated the staff, and damaged the systems around 1pm, it alleged.

Around 4pm, the staff once again gained access to the CIS room and were trying to restore the systems.

Appealing to students to continue the boycott of the registration process, the JNUSU claimed the administration is ""extremely rattled"" by the unity of students.

Meanwhile, the RSS-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad said its members protested against the disruption of internet, after which they were attacked by the members of the Left Unity.

129,05-1-20,Priyanka meets CAA stir victims’ kin in Muzaffarnagar,"Congress general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday made several stops, unscheduled visits in western Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar and Meerut to meet the families of those who died or were injured during last month's violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Priyanka arrived in Muzaffarnagar in the morning and met Maulana Asad Hussaini, who runs madrassa Hoz E Ilmia near Meenakshi Chowk, where violence erupted during the protests on December 20. She also went to the house of Noor Mohammad who lost his life during the protests. She spoke with his seven-month pregnant widow and one-and-a-half-year-old daughter.

She also met Rukaiya, who will be getting married on Saturday, and said the police vandalised her house and damaged things bought for her wedding.

After her meeting with Hussaini and other victims, she said all of them accused the police of unleashing a reign of terror and thrashing them for no fault. She said the police entered the madarsa and beat up the maulana and his students. “I will stand with you in this hour of distress,” Priyanka said. She was accompanied by Imran Masood, a party leader from Saharanpur.

Later she told mediapersons that people were beaten up mercilessly and even children and minors were not spared.

“I met Maulana Asad Hussaini, who was brutally thrashed by the police. Students of the madarsa, including minors, were picked up by the police without any reason. Some of them have been released and some are still in custody,” she said. She said she has given a memorandum to Governor Anandiben Patel incorporating the high-handedness of the police during the protests.

Priyanka then proceeded to Meerut where she met the affected families at the outskirts of the town.

In the neighbouring Meerut, the affected families assembled at one place on the outskirts of the town to meet the Congress leader where she listened to their problems.

The UP Police had stopped Priyanka and her brother and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi from entering Meerut town on December 24, citing prohibitory orders, as a result of which they had to return to Delhi, 60 km from there, without meeting the affected families.

At least five people were killed during the protests in Meerut.

131,05-1-20,Discontent among Maha Ministers over portfolios,"Shiv Sena’s newly-inducted Minister of State Abdul Sattar on Saturday evening denied that he had resigned from his post, even as senior Congress Minister Nitin Raut expressed his disappointment over the denial of plum Public Works Department (PWD) portfolio to him.

Sattar’s denial came amid reports that Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had finalised the distribution of portfolios for his Ministers in the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Government. “The MVA Government may come out with a statement on the allocation of portfolios for the ministers in the State Cabinet either late tonight or tomorrow,” a senior Sena minister close to Uddhav said in the night.

Uddhav held one more round of talks with the leaders of the NCP and Congress which are constituents in the MVA Government to give final touches to the distribution of portfolios in his Cabinet, an exercise he has not been able to carry out since December 30 when he expanded his Cabinet to induct 36 new Ministers – including Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and his son Aditya Thackeray — in his team. Meanwhile, it was the speculation over Sattar’s resignation that came into sharp focus in the State capital all through Saturday.

On a day when the Shiv Sena lost vice president’s post in the Aurangabad Zilla Parishad owing to dissensions within the party, there was a strong speculation in the morning that Sattar had resigned from his post.

However, Shiv Sena spokesperson and MP Sanjay Raut said that there was no information about the resignation of Sattar’s resignation from the State Cabinet.

Talking to media persons here, Raut had said in the afternoon: “There are no differences in the State cabinet. If any minister resigns then resignation is sent normally to the chief minister or Raj Bhawan, but both have no information about it yet"".

Later in the evening, Sattar formally denied that he had resigned and said that someone had mischievously spread rumours that he had put in his papers. “I have not resigned. After I meet Chief Minister and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, I will provide answers to all your questions that the speculation about my resignation that was rife all through the day”.

The speculation broke out after the Shiv Sena’s Shubhangi Kajwe was defeated in the elections to the post of vice president of the Aurangbad Zilla Parishad by a margin of four votes. The elections were held through a secret ballot.

Kajwe’s defeat should in the light of the victory of the Congress candidate and ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Meenatai Shelke in the presidential polls of the Aurangabad Zilla Parishad. Shelke and BJP nominee Devyani Dondgaonkar polled 30 votes in the ZP presidential polls. Later in a draw of lots, Congress’ Shelke was elected as the Aurangabad ZP presidential polls.

In the normal course, Sena’s Kajwe expected to poll 30 votes in the polls to the post of ZP vice president. However, Sena’s Kajwe polled only 28 votes against BJP’s winning candidate L G Gaikwad.

Immediately after the ZP elections, senior Shiv Sena leader and former MP Chandrkant Khaire from Aurangabad blamed Sattar – who is also from Aurangabad – for the Sena’s defeat in the polls. Khaire called Sattar as a “betrayer” and said that he should not be allowed to enter Thackerays’ Mumbai residence “Matoshri”.

Meanwhile, senior Congress leader and Minister from Vidarbha region Nitin Raut has made no bones about the crucial PWD portfolio being taken away from the impending distribution of Cabinet portfolios in the MVA government in the state.

Informed sources said that the Congress had decided to allocate the crucial PWD portfolio held by Raut earlier to former chief minister and senior Congress leader Ashok Chavan, while he (Raut) has instead been given relatively insignificant Energy portfolio.

In a related development, Congress’ MLA from Jalna Kailash Gorantyal has threatened to resign as a legislator after having been denied a berth in the State Cabinet. On its part, the state Congress leadership initiated efforts to placate Gorantyal to back out on his threat to resign as an MLA.

132,05-1-20,China starts lifting restrictions on foreign investment,"China has started lifting major restrictions on foreign investment in its financial sector, a move long demanded by the United States as the world’s two biggest economies are locked in a fierce trade battle.

From the start of 2020, foreign banks can now set up wholly-owned branches in China without a local partner holding the majority stake, the banking regulatory authority, CBIRC, announced on Friday.

In the past, foreign banks were required to have a local Chinese partner and not allowed to hold more than 49 per cent of their respective joint ventures.

The announcement could be seen as a gesture of goodwill by China towards the US as Washington says a preliminary trade agreement between the two sides looks set to be signed this month.

The world’s top two economies have been waging a merciless trade war since March 2018, resulting in mutual tariffs being slapped on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of annual trade.

Beijing has long promised to further open up its economy to foreign investment, but it was slow to do so in the financial sector.

In October, China unveiled a timetable for lifting a number of the restrictions.

And in December, the Swiss bank UBS was authorised to take a majority stake in its activities in the country.

But starting from January 1, foreign companies specialising in futures contracts will now be able to invest in China with no limits on the amount of capital held.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/china-starts-lifting-restrictions-on-foreign-investment.html
133,05-1-20,NCLAT reinstates Mistry as chief: TCS moves SC,"Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the flagship company of the Tata group, on Saturday said it has filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the NCLAT that directed the reinstatement of Cyrus Mistry as a director of the company.

In a filing to the stock exchanges, TCS said the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) - vide its judgement on December 18, 2019 - had directed re-instatement of Mistry as director of the company for rest of the tenure.

“...The company, based on a legal opinion, has on January 3, 2020 filed an appeal in the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (i) to set aside the said Judgement qua the company and (ii) in the interim stay on operation of the said judgement to the extent it relates to the company,” it added.

In a major development, the NCLAT had restored Mistry as executive chairman of Tata Sons and ruled that appointment of N Chandrasekaran as the head of the holding company of salt-to-software conglomerate was illegal.

Subsequently, Tata Sons moved the Supreme Court against the December 18 order of the NCLAT reinstating Mistry as the company’s chairman.

After that, Tata Group patriarch Ratan Tata also filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking to quash the company law appellate court order, saying the judgment was “wrong, erroneous and contrary to the record of the case”.

His petition, however, is separate from the one filed by Tata Sons Ltd, the holding company of the $110 billion salt-to-software conglomerate, in the Supreme Court on Thursday.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nclat-reinstates-mistry-as-chief--tcs-moves-sc-2020-01-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/nclat-reinstates-mistry-as-chief--tcs-moves-sc.html
134,05-1-20,"FPIs pull out Rs 2,418 cr in first three trading sessions of 2020","Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) began the year with profit booking as they withdrew a net sum of Rs 2,418 crore from the Indian capital markets in the first three trading sessions of January.

As per latest depositories data, Rs 524.91 crore was pulled out of equities and Rs 1,893.66 crore from the debt segment between January 1-3. This resulted into a cumulative net outflow of Rs 2,418.57 crore.

In 2019, FPIs invested a net sum of Rs 73,276.63 crore in the domestic markets (both equity and debt). Barring January, July and August, FPIs were net buyers for rest of the months in the year gone by.

Umesh Mehta, head of research at Samco Securities said that ""given the massive rally of previous year, FPIs have started booking profits in 2020. It is likely that they are building up their war-chest to enable buying in huge quantities just before the Budget in February.""

Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research at Morningstar Investment Adviser India, said ""there was an apparent cautiousness"" among FPIs.

This could be attributed to some of the negative trends such as political issues in India, re-emergence of trade war between US and China and continuing slowdown in the Indian economy. Besides, year-end profit booking by FPIs could also be one of the factors for relatively low net inflow, he added.

Ajit Mishra, VP research at Religare Broking Ltd, said, ""FPIs were net sellers as they booked profits at higher levels. Going forward, if geopolitical tension between US-Iran escalates further, it could restrict FPI flows.""

However, in the long term, FPIs remain confident about the Indian markets as they are anticipating positive measures and reforms would continue to aid economic recovery, Mishra added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fpis-pull-out-rs-2-418-cr-in-first-three-trading-sessions-of-2020-2020-01-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/fpis-pull-out-rs-2-418-cr-in-first-three-trading-sessions-of-2020.html
135,05-1-20,"Petrol, diesel prices up for 4th straight day as US strike roils oil market","Petrol and diesel prices rose for the fourth straight day on Sunday as global oil prices jumped after the US killed a top Iranian general, fanning fresh fears of conflict in the crude-rich Middle East.

Retail pump price of petrol was hiked by 9 paise per litre and that of diesel by 11 paise, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.

Petrol in Delhi now costs Rs 75.54 per litre -- the highest in more than a year, while a litre of diesel comes for Rs 68.51.

While global stock markets were mixed following the US killing of Qasem Soleimani, oil prices jumped more than 3 per cent on Friday. Oil markets will reopen on Monday after the weekend break.

?The killing of Soleimani represents ""a significant spike in geopolitical risks and could lead to a direct confrontation between the US and Iran,"" Oxford Economics said in a commentary.

India is 84 per cent dependant on imports to meet its oil needs and any spike in global prices has a direct bearing on its economy. Not just imports but even domestic crude oil -- which forms the raw material for making petrol, diesel and other petroleum products -- is priced according to international benchmarks.

Middle East accounts for more than two-thirds of the country's oil imports, with Iraq and Saudi Arabia being the top suppliers.

Even though the import basket has been sought to be diversified with oil being contracted from nations such as the US, pricing in all the regions is governed by international benchmarks and rates went up everywhere following Friday's strikes.

Officials said there is no immediate threat of any supply disruption to India and the only impact would be felt in prices.

For an economy that is struggling to recover from a six-year low growth rate of 4.5 per cent, a spike in oil prices poses significant risk as it will not just stoke inflation but also lead to higher outgo on government subsidies on cooking fuel.

""Nowhere in the world has seen any supply being stopped because of US strikes. Oil continues to flow as normal,"" an official said.

Sunday's price increase is the fourth straight day of retail prices going up. Since ?January 2, petrol price has increased by 38 paise per litre while diesel rates have gone up 55 paise.

Prices were unchanged over the new year. Rates of petrol have been on the upswing since December 26 and that of diesel since November 29, 2019. Diesel prices have increased by Rs 2.78 per litre over this period while petrol has become costlier by 91 paise.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/petrol--diesel-prices-up-for-4th-straight-day-as-us-strike-roils-oil-market-2020-01-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/petrol--diesel-prices-up-for-4th-straight-day-as-us-strike-roils-oil-market.html
136,05-1-20,Iran: US asked for proportionate response to General’s killing,"Washington asked Tehran to respond “in proportion” after US forces killed top Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, the deputy commander of the Revolutionary Guards said.

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps confirmed Soleimani, the commander of its Quds Force foreign operations arm, had been killed on Friday in a US air strike near Baghdad airport.

After the attack, the Americans “resorted to diplomatic measures...

On Friday morning”, Rear-Admiral Ali Fadavi told State television that night.

They “even said that if you want to get revenge, get revenge in proportion to what we did”, he said, quoted on the broadcaster’s website. Fadavi did not say how Iran received the message from its arch-enemy, even though Tehran and Washington have had no diplomatic relations for four decades.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in separate television interview on Friday night that “Switzerland’s envoy transmitted a foolish message from the Americans this morning”.

The Swiss official “was summoned in the evening and received a decisive response in writing... To the Americans’ audacious letter,” Zarif added.

Switzerland’s embassy in Tehran has represented US interests in the Islamic republic since ties were cut in 1980.

But Fadavi said the United States was not in a position “to determine” Iran’s response.

“The Americans must await severe revenge. This revenge will not be limited to Iran,” he said. “The ‘Resistance Front’, with a vast geography, is ready to materialise this revenge,” he added, referring to Iran’s allies across the Middle East.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/iran--us-asked-for-proportionate-response-to-general---s-killing.html
137,05-1-20,Soleimani’s ‘reign of terror’ over: Trump,"Defending the killing of top Iranian commander in a US strike, President Donald Trump on Friday said the “reign of terror is over” and claimed Qasem Soleimani had contributed to “terrorist plots as far away as New Delhi and London.”

General Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite al-Quds force and architect of its regional security apparatus, was killed following a US airstrike at Baghdad’s international airport on Friday. The strike also killed the deputy chief of Iraq’s powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force.

“The recent attacks on US targets in Iraq, including rocket strikes that killed an American and injured four American servicemen very badly, as well as a violent assault on our embassy in Baghdad, were carried out at the direction of Soleimani,” Trump told reporters at Mar-a-Lago in Florida.

“Soleimani made the death of innocent people his sick passion, contributing to terrorist plots as far away as New Delhi and London. Today we remember and honour the victims of Soleimani’s many atrocities and we take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over,” he said.

Trump alleged that Soleimani has been perpetrating acts of terror to destabilize the Middle East for the last 20 years.

“What the United States did yesterday should have been done long ago. A lot of lives would have been saved. Just recently Soleimani led the brutal repression of protesters in Iran, where more than 1,000 innocent civilians were tortured and killed by their own government,” he said.

Amidst escalation of tension with Iran, Trump claimed Soleimani’s killing will not lead to war.

“We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war. I have deep respect for the Iranian people. They are a remarkable people with an incredible heritage and unlimited potential. We do not seek regime change,” Trump said.

“However, the Iranian regime’s aggression in the region, including the use of proxy fighters to destabilize its neighbours, must end and it must end now. The future belongs to the people of Iran, those who seek peaceful co-existence and cooperation, not the terrorist warlords who plunder their nation to finance bloodshed abroad,” he said.

Trump said at his direction, the United States military successfully executed a flawless precision strike that killed the “number one terrorist” anywhere in the world.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/soleimani---s----reign-of-terror----over--trump.html
138,05-1-20,US: Coalition scales back Iraq operations for security reasons,"US-led forces helping Iraqi troops fight jihadists have scaled back operations, a US defence official told AFP Saturday, a day after an American strike killed top Iranian and Iraqi commanders.

“Our first priority is protecting coalition personnel,” the official said, saying the US-led force had “limited” their training and other anti-jihadist operations.

“It’s not a halt,” the source said, adding: “We have increased security and defensive measures at Iraqi bases that host coalition troops.”

The official said the change came after a series of rocket attacks by pro-Iran factions on US troops in recent months.

Surveillance efforts were now focused on potential new attacks instead of the Islamic State group.

The rocket attacks, which killed one American contractor last month, have stoked fears of a proxy war between the United States and Iran on Iraqi soil.

Those worries skyrocketed Friday after a US strike in Baghdad killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps’ Quds Force foreign operations arm.

The strike also killed the deputy head of Iraq’s Hashed al-Shaabi, a network of mostly Shiite factions close to Iran and incorporated into the Baghdad government’s security forces.

On Saturday, the Hashed said a new strike had hit a convoy of their forces north of the capital, with Iraqi state media blaming the United States.

But the spokesman for the US-led coalition denied it.

“There was no American or coalition strike,” Myles Caggins told AFP.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us--coalition-scales-back-iraq-operations-for-security-reasons.html
139,05-1-20,Thousands in Baghdad mourn Soleimani’s killing,"Thousands of mourners gathered Saturday for a funeral procession through Baghdad for Iran’s top general and militant leaders killed in a US airstrike.

Gen Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds force and mastermind of its regional security strategy, was killed in an airstrike early Friday near the Iraqi capital’s international airport.

Many of the mourners were dressed in black, and they carried Iraqi flags and the flags of Iran-backed militias that are fiercely loyal to Soleimani.

Iran has vowed harsh retaliation, raising fears of an all-out war. US President Donald Trump says he ordered the strike to prevent a conflict. His administration says Soleimani was plotting a series of attacks that endangered American troops and officials, without providing evidence.

Soleimani was the architect of Iran’s regional policy of mobilizing militias across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, including in the war against the Islamic State group. He was also blamed for attacks on US troops and American allies over nearly two decades.

As tensions soared across the region, there were reports overnight of an airstrike on a convoy of Iran-backed militiamen north of Baghdad. Hours later, the Iraqi army denied any airstrike had taken place.

The US-led coalition also denied carrying out any airstrike.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/thousands-in-baghdad-mourn-soleimani---s-killing.html
140,05-1-20,Oil PSU unions oppose BPCL disinvestment,"Employee associations of state-run oil companies on Saturday opposed planned strategic sale of Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), stating that it may bring revenue for the government but its long-term impact will be adverse.

The government plans to sell its majority stake in the oil marketeer which can help it raise over Rs 70,000 crore. A senior Finance Ministry official had said this week that the sale might be deferred to the next fiscal. The Confederation of Maharatna Officers Association (COMCO) and Federation Of Oil PSU Officers (FOPO) on Saturday held a joint press conference here.

The two associations claimed that selling off BPCL will result in a loss, because it is valued at 9.75 lakh crore while the government ownership is 53.29 percent for which it will be getting a maximum of Rs 7,50,00 crore.

Cook, who took home $15.7 million in 2018, is paid a base salary of $3 million, in addition to a bonus and various compensations.

His 2019 incentive bonus, which is tied to Apple’s performance, tallied about $7.7 million, and was calculated based on the fact that Apple exceeded its sales target by only 28 per cent.

That compared with $12 million in 2018, based on the company exceeding its sales target by 100 per cent, the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said.

Cook’s 2019 pay was also reported to include another $885,000 worth of benefits, most of which were for security and use of a private jet.

“For security and efficiency reasons, the board requires Mr. Cook to use private aircraft for all business and personal travel,” the filing said.

Apart from his salary, Cook also saw more than $113 million worth of Apple shares become vested as part of his long-term compensation as head of the firm, according to the filing.

144,05-1-20,Russia to resume limited oil supplies to Belarus amid talks,"Belarus has reached an agreement with Russia for limited oil supplies after Moscow earlier this week stopped supplying crude amid stalled talks on strengthening economic ties between the neighbouring countries.

Belarusian state-run oil company Belneftekhim, said Saturday it was in the process of finalizing an agreement with a Russian oil company for a batch of crude oil sufficient to ensure “non-stop operation of the country’s refineries in January 2020”.

Russian pipeline operator Transneft confirmed it would transfer 133,000 tons of oil to Belarus “in the nearest future”.

According to a statement from Belneftekhim, the oil would come at a discounted price while negotiations for resuming regular imports continue.

Russia stopped supplying oil to its post-Soviet neighbour after December 31, as the two countries failed to renegotiate oil prices for this year amid stalled talks on further strengthening economic ties.

The suspension did not affect oil transit to Europe or the supply of natural gas but had consequences for Belarus, which relies on Russia for more than 80 per cent of its overall energy needs.

The country’s two refineries were operating at low capacity, running on reserves. On Friday, Minsk announced it was suspending its own oil exports, which contribute up to 20 per cent of annual GDP.

The Kremlin has recently increased pressure on Belarus, raising energy prices and cutting subsidies. It argues that Belarus should accept greater economic integration if it wants to continue receiving energy resources at Russia’s domestic prices.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko held two rounds of talks in December but failed to reach an agreement on the closer ties and on oil and gas prices.

Putin said Russia was not ready to “subsidise” energy supplies without more economic integration with ally Belarus. Lukashenko insisted he would not sign off on the integration until the issues with oil and gas supplies were resolved.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/russia-to-resume-limited-oil-supplies-to-belarus-amid-talks.html

Speaking at an interactive session organsied by FICCI, he said private investment was necessary for achieving the target.

$5 trillion. We will definitely achieve, there is no doubt. Timeframe, I am not certain. Whether we’ll achieve in five years, it is like, a very difficult question to answer. But $5trillion, we will achieve for sure and again Im saying that it will come on the back of private sector investments revival,” Kumar said replying to a query.

According to him, the government investments alone cannot achieve it and there is a need for huge investments in the infrastructure sector which would result in boosting the GDP.

FICCI president Sangitha Reddy said there is a slowdown in the economy and the government needs to infuse Rs one-two lakh crore to revive the sentiment.

This is one thing that we, industry, believes that notwithstanding any impact it may have on fiscal deficit, the government must find ways to induce at least Rs one-two lakh crore into the economy to boost construction and infrastructureonce again, she said.

According to her, there were pending bills getting piled up at every sector and there is a need for structural reforms for boosting the sentiment which would result in re- accelerating the economy.

148,05-1-20,Karnataka in command against Mumbai,"Karnataka were in control after reducing Mumbai to 109-5 in their second innings on the second day of the Elite Group B Ranji Trophy game at Bandra-Krula complex on Saturday.

Karnataka took a slender 24-run first-innings lead despite a fifer from Mumbai off-spinner Shashank Attarde.

But pacer Abhimanyu Mithun (3-52) rattled the Mumbai top-order to give the southern side an advantage before Sarfaraz Khan (53 batting) and Shams Mulani (31) rallied the hosts with their 83-run stand for the fifth wicket.

Earlier, Karnataka started the day on 79/3 and lost skipper Karun Nair (0) as pacer Royston Dias (1-22) struck on the fourth ball of day. Karnataka were 79/4.

The other overnight batsman R Samarth (86 off 139 balls, 13x4) then found an able ally in all-rounder Shreyas Gopal (31 off 85 balls; 3x4) as the two took Karnataka ahead with their 78-run stand.

Mumbai’s wait for a wicket ended after skipper Suryakumar Yadav took a flying catch at short-midwicket to send Gopal back.

Gopal top-edged Attarde’s (5-58) delivery, only to be caught by Surya, as Karnataka lost their fifth wicket at 157.

Attarde then pegged back the visitors by removing Samarth, who was caught by Sarfaraz Khan at short-leg.

The offie took two wickets in seven balls as Karnataka slumped to 158/6.

Attarde was on fire as he cleaned up Abhimanyu Mithun (2) to leave Karnataka teetering at 166/7, still trailing by 28 runs. Attarde took three wickets in 18 balls.

Left-arm spinner Mulani (3-55) wasn’t to be left behind as he removed Ronit More (4) cheaply to leave Karnataka at 171/8.

Wicket-keeper B R Sharath (46 off 54 balls; 7x4, 1x6) survived a stumping chance off Mulani.

At lunch, the visitors were 179/8.

However, post lunch, Sharath played a responsible knock to give Karnataka the first innings lead.

He swept a six to take Karnataka ahead in company of V Koushik (4).

The duo stitched 42-runs for the ninth wicket.

Sharath’s cameo ended after he tried to pull, but top-edged to keeper Tare off Tushar Deshpande (1-40) in the seventh over after lunch.

Karnataka were 213-9.

Attarde took his fifth wicket as he removed Koushik and Karnataka were bundled out for 218, as they took a slender 24 runs lead.

In Mumbai’s second essay, Ajinkya Rahane (1) opened along with Tare (6) but failed again.

Rahane survived 16 balls before being trapped by Abhimanyu Mithun.

This has been a flop Ranji season for Rahane as he has been able to score only 109 runs from six innings with a lone fifty against Baroda.

Mithun struck again as he lobbed off a return catch of Siddesh Lad (4) with Mumbai at 12/2.

Pacer V Koushik then sent Tare back leaving Mumbai at 12-3.

Skipper Suryakumar Yadav (10) too perished early, becoming Mithun’s third victim as Mumbai were in spot of bother at 26/4.

Then Mulani and Khan did the damage control before Mulani was dismissed on the last ball of the day.

Mumbai lead by 85 runs with two days of play left.

Services take full control

New Delhi: Services seized the upper-hand against Maharashtra on the second day of their Group C match, with the visiting team requiring a further 148 runs to avoid an innings defeat.

Services made 285 in their first innings after bundling out Maharashtra for 44 and then reduced the visitors to 93 for 5 in the second innings.

Resuming at 141 for 4, Services were well-served by Ravi Chauhan’s half-century (65, 180 balls, 6 fours) and useful knocks of 47 each by Vikas Hathwala and AP Sharma as the lead swelled to 241.

Services then left Maharashtra tottering at 93 for 5 to take full control of the match at the Air force Complex Ground in Palam.

Ruturaj Gaikwad fell for a first-ball duck after a first-innings score of 4, while the other opener M S Trunkwala (1) was forced to retire hurt.

The experienced Ankit Bawne, who failed in the first innings, once again cut a sorry figure as he was bowled by Sachidanand Pandey for a six-ball duck.

Chirag Khurana (4) was removed by Pandey, while Rahul Tripathi (11) was dismissed by Diwesh Pathania.

Naushad S Shaik (40 batting, 85 balls, 4 fours) and wicketkeeper Vishant More (33 batting, 80 balls, 6 fours) then defied the Services attack for close to 25 overs and ensured that Maharashtra did not suffer any more setbacks.

Shaw was named in both India A squads for the upcoming New Zealand tour. The team is set to leave on January 10.

“He has been called to NCA. Mumbai Cricket Association got an email from the BCCI. He has left for Bengaluru. He couldn’t even lift his hand. He has a tear in the shoulder. That much is known,” said Ajinkya Naik, Mumbai team’s manager.

“He was not in a position to bat. How serious is the injury will be known at the NCA,” Naik added.

150,05-1-20,Bedi slams Shubman for his ‘unpardonable' behavior,"Spin legend Bishan Singh Bedi on Saturday slammed Shubman Gill for arguing with the on-field umpire after being given out during a Ranji trophy match in Mohali on Friday, terming his behaviour as “rowdy” and “unpardonable”.

The 20-year-old Gill, who is the current white-ball captain of the India A team, got embroiled in a controversy following his refusal to leave the crease after being adjudged caught-behind by medium pacer Subodh Bhati.

An argument with the umpire followed and the batsman was reinstated after a discussion between the on-field officials.

“This kind of rowdy behaviour by anyone is unpardonable, least of all by proposed Captain of India A,” Bedi wrote on his Twitter handle.

Gill was named the captain of India A for the limited overs leg of the New Zealand tour later this month.

Bedi hinted that Gill should be sacked from India A captaincy.

“No matter how talented, no player was ever bigger than the game. Example needs setting — let a more balanced person lead India A before the Referee is intimidated too,” the former spinner tweeted.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bedi-slams-shubman-for-his----unpardonable--behavior.html
151,05-1-20,"Broad, Anderson give England crucial edge","Stuart Broad and James Anderson led a relentless bowling performance as England gained what could prove a crucial advantage on the second day of the second Test against South Africa at Newlands on Saturday.

South Africa were 215 for eight the close, still 54 runs behind England’s first innings total of 269 on a dry pitch which is likely to get more difficult for batsmen later in the match.

More than half of South Africa’s runs came in a 117-run fourth wicket partnership between Dean Elgar (88) and Rassie van der Dussen (68).

But Elgar and Van der Dussen were unable to dominate as England dried up the runs, with Elgar eventually falling to a lofted drive when he tried to lift the scoring rate.

Anderson took three for 34, while Broad and Sam Curran took two wickets apiece.

Anderson took two wickets with the second new ball, bowling from the northern, Kelvin end.

All the other wickets by the fast bowlers were taken from the southern, Wynberg end where they got bounce and some sideways movement.

A crack just outside the line of off stump created uncertainty for right-handed batsmen.

Twelve of the 18 wickets in the match have fallen from that end. Ben Stokes held four catches at second slip, three of them athletic diving efforts.

Off-spinner Dom Bess played an important role, bowling accurately from the northern end while England captain Joe Root rotated his faster bowlers from the more helpful end.

Bess had spells of nine and 14 overs and finished the day with one for 62 off 27 overs.

Bess made a vital breakthrough when Elgar lost patience and sliced the ball to Root, running back from mid-off.

Elgar and Van der Dussen rescued South Africa from a precarious 40 for three.

Broad took the first two wickets in a hostile six-over opening spell before Anderson was given a turn from the Wynberg end and dismissed South African captain Faf du Plessis.

Elgar played solidly in making his runs off 180 balls with ten fours but Van der Dussen had a precarious existence, especially early in his innings.

His first scoring shot was a four edged at catchable height through a gap in the slips cordon.

He was given out leg before wicket to Anderson but was reprieved on review because of an inside edge and gloved a catch behind off Broad only to be called back because of a no-ball.

He also survived a difficult chance to Stokes at second slip off Anderson. Curran took two wickets shortly before the second new ball was due, dismissing the dangerous Quinton de Kock before Van der Dussen fell to one of Stokes’ catches when the second new ball was only four overs away.

England earlier added only seven runs to their overnight total of 262 for nine before Anderson was caught at slip off Kagiso Rabada, leaving Ollie Pope unbeaten on 61.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/broad--anderson-give-england-crucial-edge.html
152,05-1-20,Real start new decade with 3-0 win’,"Defender Raphael Varane scored one goal and helped to force a goalkeeping error for another to secure Real Madrid a 3-0 win at Getafe on Saturday in its first match since the Spanish league’s winter break.

Madrid moved into the league lead, one point ahead of Barcelona before its Catalan derby at last-place Espanyol.

Varane was involved in an own-goal by Getafe goalkeeper David Soria to open the scoring in the 34th minute when the center back challenged Soria for a high ball in the area. The Spanish league credited the goal to Soria.

The France international doubled the lead in the 53rd with Varane left unmarked to head home a free kick by Toni Kroos. The goal was confirmed by a video review, which ruled that Varane had not been offside.

Luka Modrid added a third goal from a pass by Federico Valverde on the break in stoppage time.

Madrid needed a pair of quality saves by goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois to stop first-half shots by Mauro Arambarri and Leandro Cabrera.

The victory ended a run of three consecutive draws in the league by Madrid to end 2019. Zinedine Zidane’s side had failed to score in the final two of those draws.

Getafe, a modest Spanish capital rival of Madrid, was left in seventh place. It had only lost once in nine previous home league games this season — a 2-0 defeat to Barcelona in September.

Madrid will now travel to Saudi Arabia to play in the Spanish Super Cup along with Barcelona, Atlético Madrid and Valencia.

Earlier on Friday, Sevilla needed an own-goal to salvage a 1-1 draw at home against Athletic Bilbao.

Bilbao controlled the match in Seville in the first half and went ahead in the 15th minute when right back Ander Capa received the ball on the side of the area and fired a shot under goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik.

Sevilla increased the pace after halftime and got its reward when Bilbao defender Unai Nuñez deflected a low cross by Lucas Ocampos into his own net with half an hour left.

“They had one scoring chance and put it in,” Ocampos said. “We found our pace in the second half and got the draw. But we leave with a bittersweet taste since we couldn’t get the victory.”

Sevilla will not have Ocampos, its top scorer in the league with five goals, for next round’s match at Madrid after he picked up a fifth booking of the season for a foul in the second half.

Bilbao striker Iñaki Williams had to be substituted for what appeared to be a leg injury late in the match. He walked off the field.

Bilbao, which stayed in seventh place, also earned a 0-0 draw at Madrid in the previous round.

Also, Valladolid striker Enes Unal scored his second goal of a brace with 11 minutes left to earn a 2-2 draw at home against Leganés.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/real-start-new-decade-with-3-0-win---.html
153,05-1-20,"Villa, Brighton crash to shock FA Cup exits","Aston Villa and Brighton suffered FA Cup embarrassment as the Premier League clubs paid the price for making a raft of team changes in their shock third round exits on Saturday.

Villa are languishing just above the relegation zone after a difficult first season back in the top-flight and boss Dean Smith prioritised that survival battle with nine changes against second tier Fulham.

Anthony Knockaert gave Fulham the lead at Craven Cottage with a 54th minute curler as the former Brighton forward grabbed his first goal since September.

Anwar El Ghazi equalised for Villa in the 63rd minute, but the understudies couldn’t hold on as Harry Arter won it with a 30-yard thunderbolt with 16 minutes left.

Midfielder Arter had only been on the pitch for one minute and 45 seconds before scoring his first goal since November 2017.

Brighton endured the same fate as Villa as Albion boss Graham Potter made seven changes from their New Year’s Day draw against Chelsea and second tier Sheffield Wednesday took advantage with a 1-0 win at the Amex Stadium.

Adam Reach blasted Wednesday into the fourth round with a deflected long-range strike in the 65th minute.

Watford blew a three-goal lead in a dramatic 3-3 draw against third tier strugglers Tranmere.

Last season’s FA Cup runners-up were three up by half-time at Vicarage Road as Tom Dele-Bashiru, Nathaniel Chalobah and Roberto Pereyra netted.

But they lost the recent momentum from new boss Nigel Pearson’s arrival as Connor Jennings and Emmanuel Monthe scored in the second half before Paul Mullin’s 87th minute penalty equaliser was followed by a red card for Pereyra.

Newcastle’s wretched FA Cup record suffered a fresh blemish as 40-year-old Aaron Wilbraham gave minnows Rochdale a 1-1 draw at Spotland.

Magpies boss Steve Bruce had declared his determination not to lose to “bloody Rochdale” as he eyed a sustained Cup run for a club that hasn’t won the competition since 1955 and last reached the final in 1999.

But Newcastle’s FA Cup form is so bad that they have not gone beyond the fourth round for 13 years.

Once again they endured embarrassment as Rochdale, who took Tottenham to a fifth round replay in 2018, recovered from Miguel Almiron’s opener to earn a replay at St James’ Park later in January thanks to a late leveller from old stager Wilbraham.

Paraguayan midfielder Almiron opened the scoring with a fierce drive into the top corner from Christian Atsu’s 17th minute pass.

In need of a lift, Rochdale, sitting 18th in League One, opted for experience over the promise of youth at half-time when they sent on Wilbraham to replace 16-year-old Kwadwo Baah.

In the 674th game of his journeyman career, Wilbraham bagged only his second goal in the FA Cup with a close-range finish from Luke Matheson’s cross in the 79th minute.

Norwich’s teenage striker Adam Idah scored a hat-trick — his first goals for the club — in their 4-2 win at Championship side Preston.

Will Smallbone marked his Southampton debut with a second half goal in their 2-0 victory over Huddersfield, while much-changed Burnley beat Peterborough 4-2.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/villa--brighton-crash-to-shock-fa-cup-exits.html
154,05-1-20,No quick fixes for Spurs,"Jose Mourinho says Tottenham will be “intelligent” in the January transfer window and there will be no quick fixes at the Premier League club.

Mourinho has repeatedly said that he will not be overhauling his squad this month and that any business could be dependent on players leaving.

One player who appears to be on his way out of the club is midfielder Christian Eriksen, whose contact expires in June, but it is not certain he will depart this month.

Mourinho, whose side have stumbled in recent weeks, walked into the club with his eyes wide open and said he was on the same page as chairman Daniel Levy.

“That was very clear for me and is very important for me to understand that before I came,” said the Portuguese boss, who took over from the sacked Mauricio Pochettino in November.

“This is our first transfer window, not the last,” he added. “We are going to have one in the summer, we are going to have one in 2021 January, we are going to have another one in the summer of 2021.

“We are going to have to try to be intelligent and we have to try to make the right decisions, not just for now, but for the development of a cycle.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/no-quick-fixes-for-spurs.html
155,05-1-20,Pompeo: Europe not ‘helpful’ as could be over Soleimani killing,"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday that Washington’s European allies had not been “as helpful” as he hoped over the US killing of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in Iraq.

Pompeo called officials worldwide to discuss the attack, which was praised by US President Donald Trump’s Republicans and close ally Israel, but elsewhere met with sharp warnings it could inflame regional tensions.

“I spent the last day and a half, two days, talking to partners in the region, sharing with them what we were doing, why we were doing it, seeking their assistance. They’ve all been fantastic,” Pompeo said in an interview with Fox News.

“And then talking to our partners in other places that haven’t been quite as good. Frankly, the Europeans haven’t been as helpful as I wish that they could be,” he said.

US officials said Soleimani, who had been blacklisted by the US, was killed when a drone hit his vehicle near Baghdad’s international airport. Following the assassination, EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell called on all involved actors “to exercise maximum restraint and show responsibility in this crucial moment.”

Meanwhile French President Emmanuel Macron urged those involved to act with “restraint” while British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said de-escalation would be key.

“The Brits, the French, the Germans all need to understand that what we did, what the Americans did, saved lives in Europe as well,” Pompeo said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/pompeo--europe-not----helpful----as-could-be-over-soleimani-killing.html
156,05-1-20,China replaces Hong Kong liaison office head amid protests,"China replaced its top official in Hong Kong on Saturday, days after President Xi Jinping expressed concern over the continued pro-democracy protests posing a major challenge to the ruling Communist party.

Wang Zhimin, the director of its liaison office in Hong Kong who coordinates between the local Government of the former British colony and the central Government in Beijing, has been replaced, official media here reported.

Wang was replaced by Luo Huining, the former party boss of Shaanxi province, in the first major reshuffle of the office since the city became embroiled in anti-government protests seven months ago.

Though Hong Kong is governed by beleaguered pro-Beijing Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, who so far failed to quell the protests which grew in intensity, much of responsibility over policy and planning has been coordinated by Wang.

China’s liaison office in Hong Kong, which is the symbol of Beijing’s authority, has also become a centre of pro-democracy protests where the protesters have burnt the Chinese flag.

Luo’s appointment came as a surprise as he was named a week ago the deputy director of the financial and economic affairs committee of the National People’s Congress, China’s legislature, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.

The announcement came after Xi in his New Year’s address expressed concern over the situation in Hong Kong where the locals carried out pro-democracy protests.

The disquieting situation in Hong Kong, which continues to witness mass protests, especially by youth that often turned violent figured high in Xi’s customary New Year’s eve address over the national television on December 31.

“The situation in Hong Kong has been everybody’s concern over the past few months,” said Xi, who is regarded as the most powerful Chinese leader after Mao Zedong.

Besides Presidency, Xi also heads the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the military.

“Without a harmonious and stable environment, how can there be a home where people can live and work happily,” Xi said with a tone of exasperation over unending protests, stating that he hoped for the best.

“We sincerely hope for the best for Hong Kong and Hong Kong compatriots,” he said.

“A prosperous and stable Hong Kong is the aspiration of Hong Kong compatriots, as well as the expectation of the people of the motherland,” he said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/china-replaces-hong-kong-liaison-office-head-amid-protests.html
157,05-1-20,China calls for easing UN sanctions on North Korea,"A Chinese-Russian resolution aimed at easing international sanctions on North Korea is a “timely” step in the “right direction”, China’s UN ambassador Zhang Jun said on Friday.

His comments came only days after Pyongyang, deeply frustrated that those sanctions remain in place despite its suspension of nuclear and long-range missile testing, announced it no longer felt bound by the moratorium.

Two previous Security Council sessions on the Chinese-Russian proposal failed to produce agreement, but Zhang said Beijing hoped “that we can build up more consensus”.

“We can really contribute to the political dialogue between the parties concerned, especially between the United States and DPRK,” or North Korea, he added.

Asked when the council might next vote on the draft resolution, Zhang said only that consultations were continuing.

When Pyongyang announced the end of its moratorium on Wednesday, the US response was cautiously worded. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged the North’s leader Kim Jong Un to “take a different course” and stressed that Washington wanted “peace, not confrontation”.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/china-calls-for-easing-un-sanctions-on-north-korea.html

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has a network of sources across the country, said they included around 22,000 children and more than 13,000 women. The conflict flared after unprecedented anti-government protests in the southern city of Daraa on March 15, 2011.

Demonstrations spread across Syria and were brutally suppressed by the regime, triggering a multi-front armed conflict that has drawn in jihadists and foreign powers. The conflict has displaced or sent into exile around 13 million Syrians, causing billions of dollars-worth of destruction.

The Britain-based Observatory’s last casualty toll on the Syrian conflict, issued in March last year, stood at more than 370,000 dead.

The latest toll included more than 128,000 Syrian and non-Syrian pro-regime fighters.

More than half of those were Syrian soldiers, while 1,682 were from the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah whose members have been fighting in Syria since 2013.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/syria-death-toll-tops-380-000-in-almost-9-yr-war--monitor.html
159,05-1-20,HK steps up response to mystery disease from China,"Hong Kong authorities activated a newly created “serious response” level on Saturday as fears spread about a mysterious infectious disease that may have been brought back by visitors to a mainland Chinese city.

Five possible cases have been reported of a viral pneumonia that has also infected at least 44 people in Wuhan, an inland city west of Shanghai and about 900 kilometers (570 miles) north of Hong Kong.

The outbreak, which emerged last month, has revived memories of the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic that started in southern China and killed more than 700 people in the mainland, Hong Kong and elsewhere.

The serious response level indicates a moderate impact on Hong Kong’s population of 7.5 million people. It is the second highest in a three-tier system that is part of a new government plan launched Saturday to respond to infectious diseases of unknown cause.

The city’s health department added an additional thermal imaging system at Hong Kong’s airport on Friday to check the body temperature of arriving passengers. More staff have been assigned for temperature checks at the West Kowloon high-speed rail station that connects Hong Kong to the mainland.

160,05-1-20,"2,200 Af civilians killed in Taliban attacks in 2019","More than 2,200 Afghan civilians were killed in Taliban-related attacks in 2019, the Interior Ministry confirmed on Saturday.

“During 2019, Taliban terrorists conducted scores of suicide attacks, improvised explosive device (IED) explosions and guerrilla attacks, and the attacks left 7,391 civilians killed and injured nationwide during the year,” Xinhua news agency quoted the Ministry as saying in a statement.

According to the statement, 2,219 civilians were killed and 5,172 others wounded last year.

Earlier on Saturday, one civilian was killed and two were wounded after a sticky IED explosion struck a vehicle in Mazar-i-Sharif, capital city of the Balkh province.

The target of the attack was not known immediately.

Taliban militants have been using home-made IEDs to make roadside bombs, landmines and suicide attack vest targeting security forces, but the lethal weapons also inflict casualties on civilians.

The improvised explosive device (IED) explosions, including induced roadside bomb blasts and suicide attacks, were the leading cause of civilians’ casualties in 2019, followed by ground fighting and pro-government forces-related airstrikes, according to officials.

Kamaljeet Kaur, along with her husband Kanwaljeet Singh, has been preparing simple meals of curry and rice for the victims in their Desi Grill restaurant in Bairnsdale in the state Victoria for the last five days as the bushfire crisis in the country worsened.

“We are providing proper meals of curry and rice. We distribute the food at the relief centres as well as give to those who come to our restaurant asking for it,” Kaur told PTI over phone on Saturday.

“The situation is really bad. Initially there was less fire in the area but later it expanded. People have lost their lives, houses, farms and animals,” she said.

Victoria is one of the worst affected areas in the disaster. Other areas are New South Wales and South Australia.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Saturday called up 3,000 military reserve troops to combat the raging bushfire crisis which has so far claimed the lives of 23 people with high temperatures and strong winds threatening to worsen the conditions across the country.

More than 14,000 hectares have been destroyed in South Australia’s Flinders Chase National Park, Kangaroo Island.

Expressing concern over the situation, Kaur said that people had left their houses and were either shifting to relief camps or moving to Melbourne.

163,05-1-20,"I hope the focus is not just on me in ''83', says Kapil Dev","Former India World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev hopes that the focus is not just on him, but on the entire squad in the upcoming film ""'83"" which narrates the story of the historic 1983 World Cup triumph.

In ""'83"", directed by Kabir Khan, features Ranveer Singh as Kapil Dev, who led the team to India's first-ever World Cup win against the mighty West Indies.

Point him out that the focus will be on him in the film, the legendary all-rounder, said, ""I hope not.""

""I am the captain, I am a team man. I think everybody should get their performance to look into at. I don't look at my performance, it is the team's performance.

""That's how the game of cricket is. It is not about one person but everybody. Everybody gave 100 per cent and that's how the team won the World Cup,"" Dev told PTI in an interview.

The movie, also starring Tahir Raj Bhasin, Pankaj Tripathi, Saqib Saleem, Hardy Sandhu, among others, is seen as one of the most anticipated films of 2020.

Dev said his job was to share as much information as possible with the makers.

""We know what we did. It is difficult to judge what they are going to put in and make. So you sit and give your side of the story and let them do it, they are smart people, they had done enough research,"" he said.

The veteran cricketer said he was initially concerned about how the makers will show the historical win on the celluloid.

""When I first heard the story, I was confused, I didn't know how it will happen. There is so much to talk about it. You are concerned about how it will come out. We are a little bit concerned and worried about how the movie will come out but I do hope everything will be ok,"" he added.

Dev also coached Ranveer for the film and the entire cast was trained by former India players Balwinder Sandhu and Yashpal Sharma, who were part of the World Cup winning team.

Asked how important it is to get the formal training in cricket right, Dev said, ""I think it was not easy. You are trying to create something which happened 30 to 40 years back with so many characters. It is not just one Kapil Dev. There is a team of 14 players and to bring them all together, it is quite a tough job.""

""83"", produced by Madhu Mantena, Vishnu Induri and Kabir, and presented by Reliance Entertainment, will release on April 10.

In reality, when asked as a captain how difficult was it then to lead a team that was considered as underdogs, Dev said, ""Nothing is difficult when you are enjoying something. When you are passionate about something it is not difficult. I have never taken it as a difficult thing. Never at all. It was enjoyable and fantastic.

""That's the way I look into life. When you are in love, it is a great time, it is not a difficult time. Similarly, when you are playing for the country it is a good time, it is not a difficult time. If it is difficult time then don't play.""

Competing with two time World Champions West Indies, which had some of the greatest players of all time -- Gordon Greenidge, Desmond Haynes, Clive Llyod, Vivian Richards in the finals at Lord's, didn't seem easy but Dev said for him and his team-mates the aim was to give their best.

India were all out for just 183. So, what was the discussion at the break and according to Kapil, he motivated the team by saying ""they are the best"".

""Basically, we wanted to just enjoy and give our 100 per cent. We had reached here so we must have done something really well, those kinds of chats we had. On the ground, you don't look other team is bigger than you, you say, you are the best team and then you believe in yourself,"" he added.

He further said while playing cricket one shouldn't look at the result but play the game with a positive mindset.

""You have to keep on doing your best. With sports one has to understand that you are not looking for the result, you are looking to play good cricket. We just went in and start saying our team is good enough, we are ready to win every match. You have to think positive. That is the only message I believe in.""

When team India came on the field to ball, Dev believes right from the beginning, every moment was a game changer for them.

""I think from the first wicket from Balwinder Singh Sandhu bowled that was also a game-changer, why only say, the catch (of Richards) changed the game. At every step, we were changing the game,"" he added. Sandhu dismissed Greenidge for 1.

Dev will be turning 61 on January 6 and it is like any other day for him.

""I like to spend the day as simply as possible. Nothing change in that,"" he added.

The team of ""'83"" has recreated Dev's match-winning innings of 175 runs against Zimbabwe at Tunbridge stadium.

Bihar senior BJP leader also said administrative and punitive action would be taken against officials if they refuse to carry out the NPR.

170,05-1-20,Break was not difficult for Bumrah,"The forced four-month break due to a stress fracture “wasn’t a difficult” period for India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah as there was “no pain” and he utilised the time away from the game to work on his strength and conditioning.

“It was not difficult for me as I was never in pain. Not even for a single day. I took it as an opportunity to build my strength,” Bumrah told bcci.Tv after his first training session with the team.

He was always updated about how the team was progressing and did his homework so that he is not found wanting once he is back in action.

“I was always keeping a track on what is happening so when you are back in the team, you shouldn’t be too far away.”

The 26-year-old slinger felt that playing all three formats continuously did affect his fitness, for which the break was necessary.

“When you play continuously, your strength level goes down. Your fitness level can also go down a little bit. So I was looking at how to bring the strength back, how to improve upon the things I wanted to improve.

“So take some time off and return fresh. Be hungry again. So all these things were on top of my mind. I am not looking too far ahead. I wanted to take one match at a time,” said Bumrah.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/break-was-not-difficult-for-bumrah.html
171,05-1-20,Kohli not in favour of four-day Tests,"Indian captain Virat Kohli on Saturday strongly opposed the “four-day Test” proposed by the ICC as he is not in favour of any alterations which hurts the sanctity of the traditional five-day format.

“According to me, it should not be altered. As I said, the day-night is another step towards commercialising Test cricket and you know, creating excitement around it, but it can’t be tinkered with too much. I don’t believe so,” Kohli, one of the biggest names in world cricket, told mediapersons.

The India captain feels that the intent in reducing a day from five can’t be right and then one might talk about having “three-day Tests”.

“Then you are purely only talking about getting numbers, entertainment and you know. I think the intent will not be right then because then you will speak of three-day Tests. I mean where do you end. Then you will speak of Test cricket disappearing,” Kohli was forthright in his answer.

“So I don't endorse that at all. I don’t think that is fair to the purest format of the game. How cricket started initially, and you know five-day Tests was the highest of tests you can have at the International level.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kohli-not-in-favour-of-four-day-tests.html
172,05-1-20,Irfan Pathan says goodbye to cricket,"All-rounder Irfan Pathan on Saturday announced his retirement from all forms of cricket, ending an injury-ridden career that prevented him from realising his true potential.

The 35-year-old’s retirement was on expected lines, considering he last played a competitive game in February 2019 during the Syed Mushtaq Ali trophy for Jammu and Kashmir.

Before turning up for Jammu and Kashmir as a player cum mentor in 2018, Pathan played all his domestic cricket for Baroda.

Though he remains a non-playing mentor to the Jammu and Kashmir outfit, Irfan had not been playing over the past 12 months and did not even put himself in the IPL auction pool last month.

“Today, I am saying goodbye to cricket, about which I thought for day and night. I last represented India in 2012 and after that I tried hard. Today in 2020, a thing comes up on social media ‘make a comeback’, so I want to thank the fans, who never left me alone. It’s a time to start the next journey,” Irfan said at a Star Sports show.

The left-arm seamer’s bowling was like a breath of fresh air when he made his India debut against Australia at the Adelaide Oval in 2003. He was all of 19 back then.

He never had express pace but his natural ability to swing the ball into the right-handers got him instant success, also drawing comparisons with the great Kapil Dev.

It seemed India had found the all-rounder they were looking for since Kapil left the scene.

Talking about his favourite moments, Irfan said getting the blue India cap easily sits on the top.

“There were many moments when I look back. Definitely getting (Mathew) Hayden as my first wicket is there. But when I got the cap, that was a special moment. It is close to my heart because you do everything for the cap.

“No one knows how your career will shape up, but going to play for the country first time, getting the cap from a senior player or the captain, that was special moment for me,” he said.

With his elder brother Yusuf, he made a rare sibling pair to represent India.

Irfan, who last played for India in October 2012, featured in 29 Tests (1105 runs and 100 wickets), 120 ODIs (1544 runs and 173 wickets) and 24 T20 Internationals (172 runs and 28 wickets).

He was also part of the victorious Indian team at the 2007 World Twenty20 and was the man-of-the-match in the final against Pakistan.

One of his best performances came on the tour of Pakistan in 2006 when Irfan became the second Indian after Harbhajan Singh to take a Test hat-trick, removing Salman Butt, Younis Khan and Mohammad Yusuf in the first over of the match held in Karachi.

“It was a memorable event but personally I don’t speak about that hat-trick because we lost the match,” he said.

In 2008, he played a big role in India winning a Test match against Australia on a tough Perth wicket, which offered steep bounce.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/irfan-pathan-says-goodbye-to-cricket.html
173,05-1-20,Labuschagne’s double headlines Aus 454,"New Zealand made a secure start after a Marnus Labuschagne double century lifted Australia to a massive 454 first innings total in the third Test on Saturday.

The rock-solid number three reached his highest Test score of 215 in Sydney with the Australians dismissed just before tea on the second day.

In reply, the Blackcaps grittily batted through the final session without losing a wicket, leaving skipper Tom Latham on 26 and Melbourne Test centurion Tom Blundell at 34 in their team’s total of 63.

There were a couple of close calls — notably a leg before wicket appeal off Nathan Lyon and a possible edge off Pat Cummins — but the Kiwis showed plenty of fight after enduring five tough sessions in the field in sapping heat.

The day belonged to Labuschagne, who sweated on 199 for 20 minutes before he thick edged Colin de Grandhomme through the vacant slips to the ropes to bring up his double ton.

The milestone came off 363 balls with 19 fours and a six and eclipsed his previous Test record of 185 against Pakistan in Brisbane last November.

“They batted really well to finish the day off. I thought we bowled really well,” Labuschagne said.

“The wicket looks like it’s going to go a little up and down and spin a bit but we stuck to our guns there and hopefully the rewards will come tomorrow.

“It’s always a privilege to play for Australia and it was nice to get some runs today and when you’re batting well it’s nice if you can make them count.”

Labuschagne’s prodigious form has notched him a total of 837 runs since November and he has now leapfrogged the great Neil Harvey (834) for most runs scored by an Australian during a five-Test summer. He was also Test cricket’s leading run-getter last year with 1,104 runs.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/labuschagne---s-double-headlines-aus-454.html
174,05-1-20,"Nadal, Novak off to winning starts","Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic kickstarted their build-up to the Australian Open with straight sets wins at the ATP Cup on Saturday, but world number four Dominic Thiem slumped to defeat.

Top-ranked Nadal had little trouble with Georgia’s Nikoloz Basilashvili, racing to a 6-3, 7-5 victory, while long-time rival Djokovic was given more of a test by South Africa’s Kevin Anderson before overcoming him 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (8/6).

Their wins ensured Spain and Serbia clinched their ties at the inaugural 24-nation team event.

France, Argentina, Croatia and Japan also began their tournament in style, winning their ties to join day one victors Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Norway, Russia and Australia.

“I’m super, super happy to be here in Perth for first time in my life. It’s an amazing arena and a great crowd,” said Nadal.

“It was tough first match of the season, not an easy start. But I think I played a great game.”

Earlier, his teammate Roberto Bautista Agut crushed a hapless Aleksandre Metreveli 6-0, 6-0.

Serbian superstar Djokovic needed to produce some of his best tennis to see off the big-serving Anderson, admitting it was a testing encounter.

“What a way to start the year,” he said. “He was on fire tonight — I think the quality of tennis was quite high. “I was very pleased with the way I kind of weathered the storm.”

His teammate Dusan Lajovic outlasted Lloyd Harris 3-6, 7-6 (7/4), 6-3.

Austria’s Thiem forecast this week that 2020 would be the year that the vice-like hold of Djokovic, Nadal and Roger Federer on Grand Slam titles would come to an end.

He is tipped as one of those who could make the breakthrough, along with Alexander Zverev and Stefanos Tsitsipas. But all three have been beaten in their opening ATP Cup clashes.

Thiem, who won five titles last year, had six break points in the third set against Croatia’s Borna Coric, but failed to convert any of them.

Fellow Croat Marin Cilic, a finalist at the 2018 Australian Open, used his experience to down Austria’s Dennis Novak 6-7 (7/4), 6-4, 6-4, and ensure Croatia won the tie in Sydney.

The most dominant win of the day came courtesy of Japan, who are without the injured Kei Nishikori but crushed Uruguay 3-0 in Perth, dropping just 15 games across their two singles and one doubles rubbers.

French duo Gael Monfils and Benoit Paire, both in the top 25, led their country to a 2-1 Group A win over Chile, while Argentina scraped past Poland by the same score.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/nadal--novak-off-to-winning-starts.html
175,05-1-20,Revolution 20-20,"Bumrah boost spices up Indo-Lanka contest in T20 World Cup year

Comeback man Jasprit Bumrah will be cynosure of all eyes during India’s first T20 international against Sri Lanka in the year 2020 where its namesake global meet will gain precedence over everything for the Men In Blue.

Out for four months with a back stress fracture, the 26-year-old Bumrah is that precious diamond in this Indian set-up, which had been wrapped in cotton wool during the rehabilitation period.

So much so that he was even exempted from playing domestic first-class cricket for Gujarat after intervention from BCCI president Sourav Ganguly, keeping in mind the workload he will have to take post international comeback.

If 2019 was all about focussing on 50-over format, the current year will witness the Indian team playing close to 15 games before their T20 World Cup campaign starts against South Africa in Perth in October.

There are slots to be locked and till Indian Premier League ends, a clearer picture is unlikely to emerge. But that won’t stop head coach Ravi Shastri and skipper Virat Kohli to set the ball rolling in this current series.

It all starts here at the Barsapara Stadium today as the biggest city in Assam is slowly getting back to normalcy after protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The Indian team would be checking out how the likes Navdeep Saini and Shardul Thakur react to pressure situations in death overs alongside Bumrah in the absence of frontline speedsters Mohammed Shami (rested), Deepak Chahar (stress fracture) and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (sports hernia).

Washington Sundar is still work in progress and he would like to put up performances that can ensure that only one among Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal can be picked in playing XI at any given point of time.

Shivam Dube is a big hitter for sure but whether his seam up stuff can withstand the onslaught on docile tracks till Hardik Pandya is fully fit and back in action is yet to be seen.

And that lingering question on Rishabh Pant’s consistency with Sanju Samson having already warmed the benches for six straight T20 games and the invisible presence of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, making things a little unsettling.

While Bumrah predictably grabs more eyeballs, the series is also important for Shikhar Dhawan, making a comeback into the team post knee injury.

He will also look to make an impact in absence of rested vice-captain Rohit Sharma with KL Rahul in red-hot form at the other end.

In their last T20I series, Sri Lanka suffered a 0-3 rout in Australia as their batsmen struggled and will be under scrutiny.

They relied heavily on Kusal Perera, who was their leading run-getter with 100 runs from three matches in Australia.

They would also look forward to the return of former Sri Lankan captain, Angelo Mathews, who last played a T20I against South Africa in August 2018.

Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Oshada Fernando and Danushka Gunathilaka were their batting mainstays in their 3-0 win in Pakistan in October as they will look forward to return among runs.

Leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga led the bowling in Pakistan with eight wickets from three matches at an average of 9.87 but was ineffective in Australia as he will also look to contribute.

India lost their only T20 match against Australia on October 10, 2017, which was further marred by stone-pelting on the team bus on post-match return to hotel.

It’s time for Kohli’s men to rewrite their poor record here.

178,05-1-20,JNU Students' Union and ABVP members clash on university campus,"Violence broke out at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Sunday night as masked men armed with sticks attacked students and teachers and damaged property on the campus, prompting the administration to call in police.

At least 18 people were injured and admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).

JNU Students' Union president Aishe Ghosh suffered a head injury.

The JNU administration said ""masked miscreants armed with sticks were roaming around, damaging property and attacking people"".

The Left-controlled JNUSU and the ABVP blamed each other for the violence that continued for nearly two hours.

As chaos prevailed on the campus, JNU registrar Pramod Kumar said in a statement, ""This is an urgent message for the entire JNU community that there is a law and order situation on the campus.... The JNU Administration has called the police to maintain order.""

""This is the moment to remain calm and be on the alert.... Efforts are already being made to tackle the miscreants,"" he added.

The violence occurred while a public meeting by the JNU Teachers' Association was being held.

The students' union alleged that its members, including Ghosh, were injured in stone pelting by ABVP members. But the RSS-backed students' organisation alleged that its members were brutally attacked by Left-affiliated student outfits and 25 of them were injured.

The JNUSU claimed that ""ABVP members wearing masks were moving around on the campus with lathis, rods and hammers"".

""They are pelting bricks...Getting into hostels and beating up students. Several teachers and students have also been beaten up,"" the JNUSU claimed.

The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) alleged that Left student organisations SFI, AISA and DSF were behind the violence.

""Around 25 students have been seriously injured in the attack and there is no information about whereabouts of 11 students. Many ABVP members are being attacked in hostels and the hostels are being vandalised by the Leftist goons,"" the ABVP said.

The opposition Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) latched onto the violence to target the ruling BJP and alleged it was an attempt to scuttle the voice of the JNU students.

A large section of JNU students have been taking part in the protests against the amended Citizenship Act in the national capital.

The university was earlier embroiled in a major row over alleged anti-national slogans being raised by some students in February 2016.

Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal condemned Sunday's violence and said the situation was being ""closely monitored"".

""The violence in JNU against students and teachers is highly condemnable. Directed @DelhiPolice to take all possible steps in coordination with JNU Administration to maintain law and order & take action against the perpetrators of violence. The situation is being closely monitored,"" he tweeted.

The Congress alleged that the attack on JNU students by masked miscreants was ""state-sponsored mayhem"".

Expressing shock over the incident, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said, ""The fascists in control of our nation, are afraid of the voices of our brave students. Today's violence in JNU is a reflection of that fear.""

Delhi Chief Minister and AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, ""I am so shocked to know about the violence at JNU. Students attacked brutally. Police should immediately stop violence and restore peace. How will the country progress if our students will not be safe inside univ campus?""

Kejriwal said he also spoke to the L-G over the issue.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/jnu-students--union-and-abvp-members-clash-on-university-campus-2020-01-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/jnu-students--union-and-abvp-members-clash-on-university-campus.html

Maj Gen Soleimani, 62, the head of Iran''s elite al-Quds force and architect of its regional security apparatus, was killed when a US drone fired missiles into a convoy that was leaving the Baghdad International Airport early on Friday. The strike also killed the deputy chief of Iraq''s powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force.

Reacting to the killing of a top Iranian commander by the US, India had on Friday said the increase in tension had alarmed the world and asserted that peace, stability and security in the region is of utmost importance to it.

182,05-1-20,SGPC to probe Nankana attack,"Sikh body to send team to Pak; Rahul denounces mob attack on gurdwara; BJP cites minorities’ persecution in Pak to justify CAA

The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbhandhak Committee (SGPC), the apex body which manages Sikh shrines, will send a four-member delegation to Pakistan to take stock of the situation following an alleged mob attack on Gurdwara Nankana Sahib, the birthplace of Guru Nanak Dev, which has been dragged into the ongoing controversy involving the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

A day after the incident of mob attack on the Sikh shrine in Pakistan, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi condemned it, while the BJP sought to justify the CAA saying the incident was yet another evidence of atrocities against the minorities in the neighbouring country.

Against the backdrop of widespread protests against the CAA that allows Indian citizenship to six persecuted religious minorities, excluding Muslims, from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, the Nankana Sahib incident has further heated up the running political debate with External Affairs Ministry saying that the members of the minority Sikh community in Pakistan have been subjected to acts of violence at the holy city of Nankana Sahib. Pakistan has, however, denied media reports on desecration of Nankana Sahib.

Congress leader Rahul while denouncing the mob attack said bigotry is a dangerous, age old poison that knows no borders.

Taking to Twitter, Rahul termed Friday attack reprehensible, and said the only known antidote to bigotry is love, mutual respect and understanding. “The attack on Nankana Sahib is reprehensible & must be condemned unequivocally. Bigotry is a dangerous, age old poison that knows no borders. Love + Mutual Respect + Understanding is its only known antidote,” he said in a tweet.

Engaging in the debate, Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri sought to know whether those protesting across the country against the CAA needed more evidence of oppression of minorities in the neighbouring country.

He said the violent mob that besieged the Nankana Sahib Gurdwara had threatened to change the name of the holy place to “Ghulam-e-Mustafa”.

“The violent mob that besieged Nankana Sahib Gurdwara has threatened to change the name of our holy place to Ghulam-e-Mustafa. Do those who are opposing the CAA need more evidence of oppression of minorities in Pakistan,” Puri said in a tweet in Hindi, along with a video clip that showed a mob threatening to change the name of the gurdwara.

Another BJP leader and Lok Sabha member Meenakshi Lekhi said minorities in Pakistan have been subjected to threats for religious conversion, rapes and violence for decades and the Nankana incident shows how minorities there are persecuted and why they need citizenship in India.

Lekhi also said that this incident should open the eyes of Congress leaders such as Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Navjot Singh Sidhu, TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee, the leftists and the “Urban Naxals” who have been opposing the amended Citizenship Act.

Meanwhile, strongly condemning the mob attack on the historic Sikh shrine, SGPC chief Gobind Singh Longowal appealed to the Pakistan Government to take strict action against culprits.

“We will send a four-member delegation to Pakistan to take stock of the situation there,” he said, adding that the delegation would also meet Sikh families in Nankana Sahib.

“The delegation will also meet Pakistan’s Punjab Governor and Chief Minister,” he said. Longowal said the delegation will comprise Rajinder Singh Mehta, Roop Singh, Surjit Singh and Rajinder Singh.

“We have spoken with the Gurdwara Nankana Sahib management committee...They told us the situation is normal now,” Longowal said.

The SGPC chief said the sentiments of the Sikh community were hurt with the attack on Gurdwara Nankana Sahib. Longowal said that the SGPC would also take up this matter with the United Nations.

Punjab’s former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal too condemned the attack on Gurdwara Nankana Sahib.

“We request the Government of India to immediately take steps so that peace and harmony is restored,” said Badal.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sgpc-to-probe-nankana-attack-2020-01-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sgpc-to-probe-nankana-attack.html
183,05-1-20,"Gurdwara Sahib not desecrated, claims Pakistan","Pakistan on Friday rejected the media reports that the historic Gurdwara Nanakana Sahib in Lahore was desecrated in a mob attack, saying the birthplace of founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak remains “untouched and undamaged” and the “claims of destruction” of one of the holiest Sikh shrines are “false”.

The Pakistan Foreign Office in a statement said the provincial authorities in the Punjab province have informed that there was a scuffle in the city of Nankana Sahib on Friday between two Muslim groups.

The altercation happened on a minor incident at a tea-stall and the district administration immediately intervened and arrested the accused, it said.

“Attempts to paint this incident as a communal issue are patently motivated. Most importantly, the gurdwara remains untouched and undamaged. All insinuations to the contrary, particularly the claims of acts of ‘desecration and destruction’ and desecration of the holy place, are not only false but also mischievous,” the Foreign Office said.

The Foreign Office statement has come after some reports in the Indian media said that a mob attack had taken place at the shrine.

The reports suggested that hundreds of angry residents at Nankana Sahib pelted stones at the Sikh pilgrims on Friday.

Police in Pakistan said on Friday that a group of people, led by the family of a Muslim man who married a Sikh teenager, held a day-long sit-in outside the gurdwara to protest the arrest of their relatives who were held for alleged forced conversion of the girl.

The External Affairs Ministry in New Delhi said on Friday that members of the minority Sikh community in Pakistan were subjected to acts of violence at the holy city of Nankana Sahib.

“India strongly condemns these wanton acts of destruction and desecration of the holy place. We call upon the Government of Pakistan to take immediate steps to ensure safety, security, and welfare of the members of the Sikh community,” the ministry said in a statement.

“Strong action must be taken against the miscreants who indulged in desecration of the holy Gurdwara and attacked members of the minority Sikh community,” it said.

The ministry said reprehensible actions followed the forcible abduction and conversion of a Sikh girl who was kidnapped from her home in the city of Nankana Sahib in August last year.

Gurdwara Nankana Sahib, also known as the Gurdwara Janam Asthan, is the site where the first Guru of the Sikhs, Guru Nanak, was born.

It is regarded as one of the holiest Sikh sites.

The Pakistan Foreign Office said the Pakistan government was committed to upholding law and order and providing security and protection to the people, especially the minorities.

It said the opening of the Kartarpur Corridor is a manifestation of Pakistan’s special care extended to the minorities, in line with the vision of the the country’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah.

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) had also expressed concern over reports of the mob attack on the Nankana Sahib gurdwara.

In a tweet, Singh appealed to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan to ensure that the devotees stranded at the gurdwara were rescued from the mob. SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take up the issue with his Pakistani counterpart.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/gurdwara-sahib-not-desecrated--claims-pakistan.html

185,05-1-20,Owaisi slams Pak PM; asks him to worry about his own country,"AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi has asked why losses were not recovered from those who indulged in damage to public property during the Jat agitation in Haryana, while money is proposed to be recovered by the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh in connection with the recent anti-CAA protests.

Owaisi, who was addressing a protest meeting at Sangareddy town near here late on Saturday night against the amended citizenship law, also said Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan need not worry about Indian Muslims.

The AIMIM president also announced that a protest meeting will be held at the historic Charminar here on January 25 against the CAA, adding ""We will hoist the tricolour on January 25 midnight and recite the national anthem. The meeting would be to save the Constitution and the country.""

On January 10, a peaceful march will also be taken out in Hyderabad against the CAA, he said.

Talking about the violent protests against CAA in UP, Owaisi said he condemned violence wherever it occurred but would like to ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi whether the Prevention of Destruction of Public Property Act, 1984 applied to them (UP incidents) or not.

He claimed destruction of properties worth Rs 2,000 crore occurred in the Jat agitation in Haryana in 2015.

""Destruction of Rs 2,000 crore. Modiji, you have taken money from how many? Have you taken money from those people? One paisa was not taken. Why? You did not take because they were not Muslims. Is this not a violation of Article 14 of our Constitution,"" he said.

How much money was recovered for the losses during the Patel agitation in Gujarat, he asked. More than 600 police vehicles were burnt and more than 1,800 government buildings were damaged during the Patel agitation, he claimed.

""Why are (you) doing this injustice that you will not take from Gujaratis, but recover money from Muslims,"" he said.

""...To recover that Rs 14.50 lakh, properties of Muslims were seized, (they were) locked (in UP). This law won't apply,"" he said.

Referring to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan posting a video, Owaisi said Khan has posted a wrong Bangladeshi video claiming it to be from India.

""Mr Khan, you worry about your own country. Mr Khan, we would like to tell you, don't ever remember us. We have rejected the message, the wrong theory of Jinnah. We are proud Indian Muslims and till the day of judgment, Inshallah, we will remain as proud Indian Muslims.""

""No power on earth can take away my Indianness. No power on earth can take away my religious identity. Why because, the Constitution of India guarantees me that,"" he said.

The Pakistan Prime Minister should safeguard the Sikhs and stop those who attacked a Sikh gurdwara in Pakistan, Owaisi said.

According to Owaisi, the CAA was only made towards making India a Hindu Rashtra.

""We are not against granting citizenship to persecuted Hindus, Christians, Sikhs from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh...But why are you doing in the name of religion (by excluding Muslims),"" he said.

He challenged the Prime Minister to let the countrymen know if they plan to make (implement) NRC or not by 2024.

Owaisi further said the protests against CAA, NPR and NRC should continue for another four to five months.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/owaisi-slams-pak-pm--asks-him-to-worry-about-his-own-country-2020-01-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/owaisi-slams-pak-pm--asks-him-to-worry-about-his-own-country.html
186,05-1-20,"After Kota, 111 infant deaths at Guj hospital in December","As many as 111 infants died at a civil hospital in Gujarat's Rajkot district in December last year, an official said on Sunday.

This comes against the backdrop of 100 deaths reported last month at a state-run hospital at Kota in Rajasthan.

""As per official records, 111 infants died at Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Hospital in Rajkot in December, 71 in November and 87 in October last year,"" the hospital's medical superintendent, Manish Mehta, told reporters.

He said the rise in infant deaths at the hospital in December was mainly due to an increase in the number of referral patients with serious ailments.

More infants with low birth weight was also among the reasons for the rise in number of deaths, Mehta said.

""We hold monthly meetings to assess facilities available at the hospital and meet the requirements urgently,"" he added.

Besides, 85 infants died at a civil hospital in Ahmedabad in December, its medical superintendent G H Rathod told reporters.

""As many as 85 infants died in the month of December, 74 in November and 94 in October. The death rate has come down to around 18 per cent as compared to 2018,"" Rathod said, without specifying the previous numbers.

The main reasons for such deaths were pre-mature delivery, low birth weight, as well as infection and asphyxiation in infants referred to the hospital, he said.

Reacting to the figures, state Health Minister Nitin Patel said the infant mortality rate is 30 per 1,000.

""Every year 12 lakh infants are born. Of these, 30 out of every 1,000 infants die due to malnutrition, pre-mature delivery, or because the mothers are not able to reach hospital in time,"" the minister said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/over-100-infants-die-in-two-jodhpur-hospitals--report-2020-01-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/after-kota--111-infant-deaths-at-guj-hospital-in-december.html

Gurdwara Nankana Sahib, also known as Gurdwara Janam Asthan, is a site near Lahore where the first Guru of Sikhs, Guru Nanak, was born.

According to media reports, a violent mob had attacked the Gurdwara and pelted it with stones on Friday. A team of police had to intervene briskly to control the situation.

Breaking his silence on the incident, Khan said that there is a ""major difference between the condemnable Nankana incident and the ongoing attacks across India on Muslims and other minorities"".

""The former is against my vision & will find zero tolerance & protection from the govt incl police & judiciary (sic),"" he tweeted, referring to the Nankana Sahib incident.

Khan claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""vision supports minorities oppression and the targeted attacks against Muslims.""

He also alleged that the Indian police, supported by the government, are leading attacks against Muslims.

India has strongly condemned vandalism at the revered Gurdwara and called upon the Pakistan government to take immediate steps to ensure the safety and security of the Sikh community there.

On Saturday, Indian leaders cutting across party lines and various outfits condemned the mob attack on the historic Gurdwara, terming it as ""cowardly"" and ""shameful"".

191,05-1-20,Pavan Varma asks Nitish Kumar to reject 'divisive CAA-NPR-NRC' scheme,"JD(U) general secretary Pavan Varma on Sunday asked party president and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to categorically reject the ""divisive CAA-NPR-NRC scheme"", saying this has ""nefarious agenda to divide India and create a great deal of unnecessary social turbulence"".

In an open letter to Kumar, Varma expressed his surprise at the ""unilateral"" announcement of Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi, who is from the BJP, that the National Population Register exercise will be carried out in the state between May 15-28 despite Kumar's stand against the National Register of Citizens.

""... In consonance with your own publicly stated views, and long established secular vision, may I request you now to take a principled stand against the CAA-NPR-NRC scheme, and reject its nefarious agenda to divide India and create a great deal of unnecessary social turbulence.

""A clear cut public statement by you to this effect would be a major step towards preserving and strengthening the idea of India to which, I know, you yourself are committed. The politics of principle cannot be sacrificed at the altar of short term political gain,"" Varma said in the letter.

The JD(U) leader has been critical of his party's decision to support the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Parliament, and it has now become a law following its passage in both Houses.

Protests have occurred in different parts of the country against the law, which seeks to give citizenship to minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who had arrived in India due to religious persecution by December 31, 2014.

JD(U) vice president Prashant Kishor has also spoken strongly against the CAA and said this, in combination with the NRC, can turn into a ""lethal combo in the hands of the government to systematically discriminate and even prosecute people based on religion.""

In his letter, Varma said the CAA-NRC combine is a direct attempt to divide Hindus and Muslims, and to create social instability.

The government has categorically stated, he said, that the NPR is the first step to implementing the NRC and since Kumar has said that Bihar will not have the NRC, it follows that he must say no to the revised NPR as well.

The Modi government has dismissed the concerns over the NPR as politically motivated, saying it is a routine exercise and adding that it is yet to take a decision on the NRC.

""The central government needs to focus on the real priorities of governance, such as the disastrous state of the economy, the absence of jobs, and agrarian distress, rather than such schemes whose only aim is to destroy the unity and social cohesion of our great country,"" Varma said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pavan-varma-asks-nitish-kumar-to-reject--divisive-caa-npr-nrc--scheme-2020-01-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/pavan-varma-asks-nitish-kumar-to-reject--divisive-caa-npr-nrc--scheme.html

It was detected that private hospitals were performing these Government reserved procedures and blocking/submitting the same under a different package name or as unspecified package.

According to the statement, cases of fraud were detected by NAFU in August 2019 and shared with Gujarat State Health agency which has disabled the cards and an FIR was lodged on November 8. In Chhattisgarh, such cases were detected initially in May 2019 and the cards have been disabled.

In Madhya Pradesh, cases were detected in August 2019 and shared with state which has disabled the cards and the concerned hospital has been issued show-cause notice. Penalty has also been levied on TPA.

Morrison, who is facing widespread criticism in Australia for his handling of the crisis, said: ""This organisation will be stood up for at least two years.

""I have no doubt they will have a long list of recovery tasks that (the states) will be performing … rebuilding bridges, roads and other critical infrastructure and we will work hand in glove"".

The agency will be modelling its operations closely on the successful response provided to the North Queensland floods, he said.

""That agency will be drawing on a series of support measures that includes mental health. It's important we are addressing the mental health needs as well as the many other health needs that will need to be addressed,"" Morrison said.

On Saturday, he called up 3,000 military reserve troops to combat the bushfires, the first time that reservists were called up in such a large number ""in the living memory"".

Morrison was criticised for taking a family vacation in Hawaii at the start of the wildfire crisis, with many people complaining about the lack of readiness in utilisation of resources.

Last week, he was heckled when he visited a township in New South Wales where houses have been destroyed and one of them belonged to one of the three volunteer firefighters who have died in the crisis.

Fresh warnings were issued to hundreds of people sheltering in New South Wales' coastal town of Eden with authorities urging them to vacate the area immediately.

Australian authorities continued to struggle with the ongoing bushfire crisis across several states including Victoria, South Australia and Queensland.

According to media reports, dozens of people had sought shelter on Eden's wharf, but police said that area was no longer safe.

The police officers warning tourists and those not able to defend their homes to leave, said: ""We cannot guarantee your safety at present under the conditions that we have now here at the Eden Wharf"".

New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said reports of property losses ""likely to be numbering in the hundreds"" as a result of Saturday's fire activity.

Morrison, in a press conference in the Parliament house on Saturday, said it was a very difficult day for Australia confirming 23 deaths for the fire season this year.

One more person died trying to save a friend's home on Sunday.

""I want to start by extending my sincere condolences and sympathies once again to all of those Australians and families who've lost loved ones during the course of these devastating bushfires. Twenty-three confirmed deaths to date and we are facing another extremely difficult next 24 hours,"" the Prime Minister said.

The bushfire crisis has taken a very heavy toll with more than 1,500 homes already lost throughout the course of this fire season, which has been running since September, Morrison said.

""I also want to acknowledge the outstanding work that is being done by all of those who've been turning out and responding to these natural disasters, not just in the states currently impacted most dreadfully, in New South Wales and Victoria today, but also up in Queensland, across in Western Australia, down in Tasmania, even today South Australia. This has been touching the entire country,"" he said.

In Victoria, warnings on several fires were downgraded but there were still four emergency level warnings for fires and two evacuation warnings in place.

Nearly 40 fires, over 923,000 hectares have been burned across Victoria and 110 homes have been confirmed lost, 220 outbuildings destroyed.

Meanwhile, expected rainfall and cooler weather conditions on Sunday in the state including Gippsland region were said to bring no relief to the crisis.

Emergency services minister Lisa Neville said rainfall of 200 mm over a few days would be needed to directly impact the flames, and that is ""not on the horizon"".

Emergency Management Commission Andrew Crisp said the rain could in fact make it harder to access remote areas for back burning or other assistance.

In NSW, 18 people lost their lives in 150 bushfires burning, 64 un-contained across the state. More than 3.6 million hectares have been burned with over 1300 homes destroyed.

In Victoria, two people are confirmed dead while in South Australia three people are confirmed dead with 15 bushfires burning.

No loss of life has been reported from Western Australia where 30 bushfires are burning. Queensland has 30 bushfires while Tasmania 23 bushfires burning.

Over 3,000 firefighters are on the frontline, with 31 specialist strike teams in place across NSW.

Australia's military has been assisting with aerial reconnaissance, mapping, search and rescue, logistics and aerial support for months.

196,05-1-20,At least 28 dead in raid on Tripoli military school: ministry,"At least 28 people were killed and dozens injured on Saturday in an air strike on a military school in the Libyan capital Tripoli, a ministry spokesman said.

""An air raid on the military school of Tripoli killed 28 cadets and injured dozens more,"" Amin al-Hashemi, spokesman for the health ministry of the Government of National Accord (GNA) said.

At the time of the strike the cadets were gathered on a parade ground before going to their dormitories, he added.

The military school is in al-Hadba al-Khadra, a residential sector of the Libyan capital.

The GNA health ministry called for blood donors to go to hospitals and blood banks to help those injured.

The southern part of Tripoli has seen fierce fighting since last April, when military strongman Khalifa Haftar began an offensive against the GNA.

Libya was plunged into chaos with the toppling and killing of longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi in a 2011 NATO-backed uprising. It has since become divided between the GNA and rival authorities based in the country's east.

GNA forces accused those loyal to Haftar of the strike, posting photos of the victims and the wounded on Facebook.

However, pro-Haftar forces have not claimed responsibility for the attack.

More than 280 civilians and more than 2,000 fighters have been killed since the start of Haftar's assault on Tripoli, according to the United Nations. The fighting has also displaced some 146,000 people.

The UN Security Council last month renewed its calls for a ceasefire in Libya, and urged foreign actors to honour an arms embargo on the country -- which Jordan, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates have regularly violated, according to a confidential UN report seen by AFP.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/at-least-28-dead-in-raid-on-tripoli-military-school--ministry-2020-01-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/at-least-28-dead-in-raid-on-tripoli-military-school--ministry.html
197,05-1-20,'Iranian hackers' claim breach of US govt website,"A group claiming to be hackers from Iran breached the website of a little-known US government agency on Saturday and posted messages vowing revenge for Washington's killing of top military commander Qasem Soleimani.

The website of the Federal Depository Library Program was replaced with a page titled ""Iranian Hackers!"" that displayed images of Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Iranian flag.

""Martyrdom was (Soleimani's)... Reward for years of implacable efforts,"" read a graphic depicting US President Donald Trump being punched by a first emanating from Iran as missiles fly by.

""With his departure and with God's power, his work and path will not cease and severe revenge awaits those criminals who have tainted their filthy hands with his blood and blood of the other martyrs,"" it said.

""This is only small part of Iran's cyber ability !"" another caption on the page read in white text on a black background.

The killing of Soleimani in a drone strike in Iraq early Friday brought a furious vow of revenge from Tehran.

Described as the second most powerful man in Iran, Soleimani oversaw wide-ranging interventions in regional power struggles.

Trump has said Soleimani was planning an ""imminent"" attack on US personnel in Baghdad.

The president has warned that Washington is targeting 52 sites in Iran and will hit them ""very fast and very hard"" if the Islamic republic attacks American personnel or assets.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-iranian-hackers--claim-breach-of-us-govt-website-2020-01-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/-iranian-hackers--claim-breach-of-us-govt-website.html
198,05-1-20,Al-Shabaab jihadists attack US-Kenya military base,"Jihadists from Somalia's Al-Shabaab group on Sunday attacked a military base used by US and Kenyan forces in Kenya's coastal Lamu region, the army spokesman said.

The strike on the base known as Camp Simba in Manda Bay is the latest by the group in Kenya since Nairobi sent troops across the border in 2011.

Kenya's army spokesman Colonel Paul Njuguna said in a statement that at 5:30am ""an attempt was made to breach security at Manda Air Strip."" ""The attempted breach was successfully repulsed. Four terrorists bodies have so far been found. The airstrip is safe. Arising from the unsuccessful breach a fire broke out affecting some of the fuel tanks located at the airstrip.""

He said the fire had been brought under control ""and standard security procedures are now on-going."" Lamu County Commissioner Irungu Macharia also confirmed there had been an attack and said the militants ""have been repulsed."" ""We are not sure if there are still remnants within,"" he said.

Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement, saying it had ""successfully stormed the heavily fortified military base and have now taken effective control of part of the base."" The group said there had been both Kenyan and American casualties, however this could not be immediately verified.

Al-Shabaab said the attack was part of its ""Al-Quds (Jerusalem) shall never be Judaized"" campaign -- a term it first used during an attack on the upscale Dusit hotel complex in Nairobi in January last year that left 21 people dead.

The Somali jihadists have staged several large-scale attacks inside Kenya, in retaliation for Nairobi sending troops into Somalia as well as to target foreign interests.

Despite years of costly efforts to fight Al-Shabaab, the group on December 28 managed to detonate a vehicle packed with explosives in Mogadishu, killing 81 people.

The spate of attacks highlights the group's resilience and capacity to inflict mass casualties at home and in the region, despite losing control of major urban areas in Somalia.

The Lamu region, close to the Somali border, has been plagued by attacks from Al-Shabaab, with frequent strikes along the frontier notably targeting security forces with roadside bombs.

In their November report, a UN panel of experts on Somalia noted an ""unprecedented number"" of homemade bombs and other attacks across the Kenya-Somalia border in June and July last year.

On Thursday at least three people were killed when suspected Shabaab gunmen ambushed a bus travelling in the area.

According to the Institute for Security Studies, the United States has 34 known military bases in Africa, from where it conducts ""drone operations, training, military exercises, direct action and humanitarian activities.""

US military strikes in Somalia surged after President Donald Trump declared the south of the country an ""area of active hostilities."" In an April statement, US military command for Africa, AFRICOM, said it had killed more than 800 people in 110 strikes in Somalia since April 2017.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/al-shabaab-militants-attack-us-kenya-military-base--govt-official-2020-01-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/al-shabaab-jihadists-attack-us-kenya-military-base.html
199,05-1-20,Soleimani's body arrives in Iran as Trump issues new threats,"The body of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in a US drone strike, arrived on Sunday in Iran to throngs of mourners, as President Donald Trump threatened to bomb 52 sites in the Islamic Republic if Tehran retaliates by attacking Americans.

Soleimani's death on Friday in Iraq further heightens tensions between Tehran and Washington after months of trading attacks and threats that put the wider Middle East on edge.

The conflict is rooted in Trump pulling out of Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, an accord likely to further unravel as Tehran is expected to announce as early as Sunday it will break another set of limits.

Iran has promised ""harsh revenge.""

Already, a series of rockets launched in Baghdad late Saturday fell inside or near the Green Zone, which houses government offices and foreign embassies, including the US Embassy.

Trump wrote on Twitter afterward that the US had already ""targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture.""

Trump did not identify the targets but added that they would be ""HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.""

After thousands in Baghdad on Saturday mourned Soleimani and others killed in the strike, authorities flew the general's body to the southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.

An honour guard stood by early Sunday as mourners carried the flag-draped coffins of Soleimani and other Guard members off the tarmac.

Officials brought Soleimani's body to Ahvaz, a city that was a focus of fighting during the bloody, 1980-88 war between Iraq and Iran in which the general slowly grew to prominence. After that war, Soleimani joined the Guard's newly formed Quds, or Jersualem, Force, an expeditionary force that works with Iranian proxy forces in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.

Authorities also plan to take Soleimani's body to Mashhad later Sunday, as well as Tehran and Qom on Monday for public mourning processions, then onto his hometown of Kerman for burial on Tuesday.

Soleimani was the architect of Iran's regional policy of mobilizing militias across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, including in the war against the Islamic State group. He was also blamed for attacks on US troops and American allies going back decades.

Though it's unclear how or when Iran may respond, any retaliation was likely to come after three days of mourning declared in both Iran and Iraq. All eyes were on Iraq, where America and Iran have competed for influence since the 2003 US-led invasion.

After the airstrike early Friday, the US-led coalition has scaled back operations and boosted ""security and defensive measures"" at bases hosting coalition forces in Iraq, a coalition official said on condition of anonymity according to regulations.

Meanwhile, the US has dispatched another 3,000 troops to neighbouring Kuwait, the latest in a series of deployments in recent months as the standoff with Iran has worsened. Protesters held demonstrations in dozens of US cities Saturday over Trump's decisions to kill Soleimani and deploy more troops to the Mideast.

In a thinly veiled threat, one of the Iran-backed militia, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, or League of the Righteous, called on Iraqi security forces to stay at least a kilometer away from US bases starting Sunday night. However, US troops are invariably based in Iraqi military posts alongside local forces.

Iraq's government, which is closely allied with Iran, condemned the airstrike that killed Soleimani, calling it an attack on its national sovereignty. Parliament is meeting for an emergency session Sunday, and the government has come under mounting pressure to expel the 5,200 American troops who are based in the country to help prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group.

Also Saturday, NATO temporarily suspended all training activities in Iraq due to safety concerns, Canadian Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan said.

The US has ordered all citizens to leave Iraq and temporarily closed its embassy in Baghdad, where Iran-backed militiamen and their supporters staged two days of violent protests in which they breached the compound. Britain and France have warned their citizens to avoid or strictly limit travel in Iraq.

No one was hurt in the embassy protests, which came in response to US airstrikes that killed 25 Iran-backed militiamen in Iraq and Syria. The US blamed the militia for a rocket attack that killed a US contractor in northern Iraq.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/soleimani-s-body-arrives-in-iran-as-trump-issues-new-threats-2020-01-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/soleimani-s-body-arrives-in-iran-as-trump-issues-new-threats.html
200,05-1-20,Naughty tiger gets freedom after confinement,"Ten-year-old Bengal tiger Bittu spent six years in a cage in the Delhi Zoo before he could step out in his enclosure and breathe fresh air.

But the Christmas Day was not the first time the Zoo administration let B2 or Bittu out of the cage.

He was released in the enclosure twice before, so that he could take a stroll and relax in the sun. But his “mischievous” behaviour cost him his “freedom”, Zoo Director Suneesh Buxy says.

B2 or Bittu was 4-year-old when he was brought to Delhi from Bhopal’s Van Vihar National Park under an animal exchange programme in 2014.

Range Officer Saurabh Vashishtha says when Bittu was first released in the enclosure, he climbed a tree. “It could have been a security threat to visitors,” he says.

“We released him in the enclosure again after a few days, but he tried to climb over the cage. Sensing danger, we put him inside the cage again,” Vashishtha says. Bittu was released in the enclosure again on December 25.

This time, the zoo administration has raised the height of the fences, pruned the branches of the trees inside the enclosure so that he cannot climb them and added an extra layer of barricading for visitors.

The zoo also got a 3-year-old white tiger, Vijay, recently.

Though Vijay was brought from Lucknow in July in exchange of a female tiger named Geeta, he was released in the enclosure on Wednesday, Buxy says.

“The aggressive, 9-feet tiger was observed closely for 6 months before he was released in the enclosure,” he says.

At present, the zoo has seven white tigers — three female and four male — and two male Royal Bengal tigers.

The zoo is likely to acquire a pair of ostrich from Chandigarh’s Chhatbir Zoo and a chimpanzee within next three months.

It had in September lost an eight-year-old Bengal tiger, Rama, due to kidney failure.

In October, it lost India’s “oldest” chimpanzee, Rita, 59, following multiple organ failure.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/naughty-tiger-gets-freedom-after-confinement-2020-01-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/naughty-tiger-gets-freedom-after-confinement.html

According to the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 following religious persecution there will get Indian citizenship.

Their message was loud and clear,"" said Indian American Dr Bharat Barai, one of the organisers of the rally.

The participants signed a memorandum supporting the CAA and thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian government for the humanitarian help to religiously persecuted minorities in three neighbouring countries.

202,05-1-20,And they won,"Bombshell

*ing: Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman, Margot Robbie, John Lithgow, Kate McKinnon, Connie Britton

Rated: 8/10

In #MeeToo times, Bombshell comes in handy for women fighting their wars in office. The film has been made with candour, showing the problem of sexual harassment at office as an intrinsic trap into which women continue to fall and how the magnet of power and stardom propels often them through the sheets even if it is with utmost disgust.

Bombshell portrays the scandal that happened in pro-Trump Fox News channel with its larger than life CEO has his juices flowing in utter disregard of women working for him. Now an aged patriarch who walks with a stick but is never hesitant in exploiting the next girl in line with ambition, John Lithgow portrays Fox’s life and breath Roger Ailes who has created Fox and is in many ways even bigger than its owner Rupert Murdoch.

Shit happens and it happens to the best in the business. In this case it is the star anchor and Trump bete noir Megyn Kelly played skillfully by Charleze Theron. As it turns out much later in the film, she too had passed through the Ailes room on Fox office’s iconic Second Floor inhabited by Ailes. He keeps tabs on every single thing that is happening in the newsroom, including the length of the presenters’ skirt, which incidentally had to be way above the knee. “It is the need of the visual medium,” he would tell every girl aspiring to come before the camera. That, and the threat that nothing that happened between him and the girl had to always stay in his room. Untill, of course, an aged and sidelined Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) is sacked and she decides to sue him for sexual harassment.

The good thing about the film is that it unfolds as it would have in real time. Theron, Kidman and even the young Margot Robbie who is exploited by Ailes while she is in tears play their parts to perfection, as does Connie Britton the closet lesbian in a conservative Fox environment.

The film throws up issues that are way beyond one man and is perversions. It throws up the issue of safety, corporate mechanisms allowing such horrors, the glass ceilings, the gender bias, the women against women story, the wife is always by the side angle and many other thoughts that make you angry at the state of affairs in the global corporate zone.

A lot needs to be done, not just by women who bow to the pressures to reach where they want to, but also men who are yet to give up their fiefdoms in the cocoon of patriarchal societies. Also, not all battles are brought to the book and not many cases are won, which is a worrying thing, not to mention how stated zero tolerance to sexual harassment turns out to be a farce in many an office, with the complainant being sacked or “silently removed” or “bought off”.

For the India release, meanwhile, Lionsgate tied up with the women-only social network Sheroes to throw up the bright side of victory where sexual harassment is concerned. The film was followed by a panel discussion on the issue which was decked by women professionals from all the high- pressure professions in today’s world.

In short, a movie for all to see and mull over, gender no bias.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/and-they-won-2020-01-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/and-they-won.html

Ashnoor admires Priyanka’s career choices — right from playing a character with negative shades quite early on in movies to the way she has carved her career graph.

“I have followed Priyanka didi since I was small. I like to see her interviews whenever I am free. She is really inspiring with the way she began her career as a model, won beauty pageants, then became a mainstream heroine in Hindi cinema, and now an international star. She has made it on her own, without a Godfather. I can relate to her. Moreover, I am also choosing roles that resonate the same thought. Even my character, Mini, is someone who is young and ambitious in life. So, I hope to follow Priyanka didi’s footsteps. And, I can only try, the rest is up to destiny,” said Ashnoor.

The young actress further added that she is really impressed by PeeCee’s philanthropic activities as a Goodwill Ambassador with the UNICEF. “One day, I also hope to give back to the society that has given me so much,” she says.

209,05-1-20,Apple can make 2020 its strongest year in India,"The year 2019 saw a complete turnaround in Apple's market share and presence in India, fuelled by attractive price drops on previous generation iPhone models (iPhone XR), affordable newer flagship premium models (iPhone 11) and attractive schemes on other products.

Not only older and new-generation models but also Apple Watches, AirPods Pro and Mac desktops witnessed a great adoption in the country.

Going forward, thrust on manufacturing high-end iPhones locally along with the first-ever flagship retail store would give Apple a booster in the price-sensitive smartphone market in 2020, say industry experts.

""Apple recovered in the Indian market in 2019 after a sharp decline in 2018. 2020 is going to be important, as this is the year when Apple has strongest-ever portfolio -- iPhone XR, iPhone 11 and iPhone 8 -- that will be very much relevant for the growing Indian market. There is also a lot of speculation about iPhone SE2 coming this year,"" Tarun Pathak, Associate Director at Counterpoint Research, told IANS.

To recall, Apple supplier Wistron assembled low-end iPhone SE (now discontinued) and is now assembling iPhone 6S and iPhone 7 at its Bengaluru facility. The highest-selling iPhone XR is now being manufactured at Apple supplier Foxconn's facility in Sriperumbudur, Chennai.

Media reports say that the Cupertino-based tech giant may launch two iPhone SE 2 models with 5.5-inch and 6.1-inch displays. Famed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also suggests that there could be a second iPhone SE2 model -- dubbed as iPhone SE2 Plus -- but only in the first half of 2021.

Another Eureka moment for Apple would be a flagship branded store in India.

Apple is expanding its retail footprint and India appeared on its global map last year in August when the company said it looks forward to welcome customers at its first branded retail store in India soon.

""We appreciate the support and hard work by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his team to make this possible and we look forward to one day welcoming customers to India's first Apple retail store,"" said the company, welcoming the government's decision to ease the 30 per cent local sourcing norm in single-brand retail (SBRT).

Pathak said that a revamped channel strategy and local manufacturing will ensure duty benefits and much streamlined operations for Apple in the country.

According to Upasana Joshi, Associate Research Manager, Client Devices, IDC India, for the coming quarters, Apple should continue to focus more on the $700-$850 (Rs 50,000- Rs 61,000) segment.

""That is the sweet spot for iPhones in India with added attractive offers for making the new model lineup a little more affordable, however, continuing to focus on older generation portfolio for volume growth,"" she elaborated.

Apple topped the premium smartphone segment by garnering a massive 51.3 per cent share in the Rs 35,000 and above price segment in the third quarter (July-September period).

Apple also regained top position in the premium segment in India in the second quarter with an overall share of 41.2 per cent.

Mac desktops helped Apple register record growth in the India market in the July-September period, according to the company.

""2020 is likely to be a strong year for Apple in India,"" Pathak said.

210,05-1-20,Indian millennials fall in love with true smartwatches,"Smartwatches do tell the time -- like smartphones that still make and receive calls -- but this particular wearable segment has come of age with real-life use cases in areas like health and fitness along with a connected app ecosystem that has made them a preferred choice for the Indian millennials.



According to the International Data Corporation's (IDC) ""Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker Q3 2019"", 3.07 lakh watches were shipped during the third quarter into India -- registering 47 per cent growth quarter-on-quarter and 127 per cent growth year-on-year.

Among the watches, the country saw the arrival of 1.87 lakh smartwatches in the third quarter, registering 28 per cent QoQ growth and 93 per cent YoY growth.

With a strong millennial base with rising disposable income, India now offers immense growth potential for the smartwatch players, currently being dominated by the Apple Watch Series.

Here, one has to understand the difference between a true smartwatch and a basic one.

Apple, Fitbit and Fossil are true smartwatches while the rest of the crowd comes under the basic watch (with smart features) category.

To make it simpler, a basic watch is like an entry-level smartphone -- brands like Huami's Amazfit, Huawei etc. -- while smartwatch -- that can run third-party applications on the device itself -- is considered truly ‘smart'.

""Basic watch includes devices resembling traditional wrist-worn watches and/or devices where timekeeping is a primary function. Timekeeping and a default watch screen, or watch face are a requirement for a device to be considered as a basic ‘watch',"" Jaipal Singh, Associate Research Manager, Client Devices, IDC India, told IANS.

In a price-conscious market like India, several brands have entered the basic watch category with smart features, especially related to health and fitness.

""The mid-range segment or entry-level watch (basic watch) segment is growing very fast as more and more Indians realise the importance of staying fit. People who wore fitness bands for years are now switching to such watches, and, eventually, true smartwatches. We will see more brands entering this segment in 2020,"" elaborated Singh.

Earlier, in the second quarter of 2019, the India market for wearable devices grew 30.9 per cent sequentially -- reaching an all-time high of 30 lakh shipments in a single quarter, according to the IDC.

Smartwatches saw a healthy 99.6 per cent (YoY) and 42.9 per cent (QoQ) growth in the second quarter in the country.

At the rate of 30-40 lakh wearables each quarter, we can easily see India consuming in between 1.2 crore and 1.5 crore wearables in a year which is still small compared to globally but the growth is stupendous.

The wearable market is expected to reach global shipments of 222.9 million units in 2019, with earwear and watches accounting for more than 70 per cent of all wearable shipments by 2023.

According to Ramon T. Llamas, Research Director, wearables team, IDC, smartwatches ""will move deeper into health and fitness and connect with multiple applications and systems, both at work and within the home.""

213,05-1-20,Pompeo: US military would only hit lawful targets in Iran,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that any target the US military may strike in Iran, in the event Iran retaliates against America for killing its most powerful general, would be legal under the laws of armed conflict.

Pompeo was asked on ABC's ""This Week"" about President Donald Trump's assertion Saturday on Twitter that the United States has 52 Iranian targets in its sights, ""some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture.""

The laws of armed conflict prohibit the deliberate targeting of cultural sites under most circumstances.

""Every target that we strike will be a lawful target, and it will be a target designed with a singular mission — defending and protecting America,"" Pompeo said.

He also said the Trump administration has abandoned the previous US administration's focus on countering Iranian proxy groups and suggested the U.S. Strike in Baghdad that killed Iranian Gen Qassem Soleimani was an example of the new strategy.

""We're going to respond against the actual decision-makers, the people who are causing this threat from the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" Pompeo said.

In Baghdad on Sunday, the US coalition combating the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria announced that it has ""paused"" training of Iraqi security forces in order to focus on protecting coalition personnel.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pompeo--us-military-would-only-hit-lawful-targets-in-iran-2020-01-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/pompeo--us-military-would-only-hit-lawful-targets-in-iran.html
214,05-1-20,Tableaux rejection: History repeated,"Politics over selection of the Republic Day tableaux is nothing new. What the UPA Government did earlier, the BJP-led NDA regime is repeating now. During the UPA regime, Narendra Modi-ruled Gujarat never got tableaux selected for the R-day celebration. Now that Modi is the Prime Minister, tableaux from his home State has never been omitted during the last five years, while Opposition-ruled States have been routinely left out of the celebration.

The Opposition has alleged that West Bengal, Maharashtra and Kerala, which aggressively protested against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, have been omitted for obvious political reasons.

The data of Ministry of Defence shows that the Centre always used Republic Day tableaux as tools to target States ruled by the Opposition. This is true for the past six years of the Modi Government as well as 10 years of the UPA rule. Tableaux selected for the R-Day parade offer a unique opportunity to witness the culture, heritage and other unique aspects of various States.

Under the UPA regime, Gujarat failed to qualify for the five continuous years between 2009 and 2014. The State tableaux, however, qualified in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 during the NDA regime led by Modi who came to power in May 2014.

West Bengal failed to qualify for the R-Day Parade this year. The Bengal Government had proposed the theme of Kanyasree for the tableau. The State has failed to qualify for fourth straight years. The State, however, qualified in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2019. West Bengal was adjudged best in 2014 when UPA II was in power at the Centre, and in 2016 the State was adjudged the best during NDA regime.

The Bihar Government's theme of Jal-Jivan-Hariyali Mission was rejected as ""it does not fulfil the criteria for that"". Bihar was not included in the Republic Day parade in 2019 as well. BJP-JD(United) alliance is ruling in the Bihar. The JD(U) did not protest while the RJD termed it Bihar's humiliation. The data shows Maharashtra tableaux qualified for Republic Day parades on nine occasions in the past 13 years but they failed to qualify in 2008, 2013, 2016 and 2020. In all other years when Maharashtra didn't qualify, the Centre and the State were ruled by the same party. In 2008 and 2013, the Congress-NCP alliance was in power in Maharashtra and the same parties shared power at the Centre. In 2016, BJP-Shiv Sena alliance shared power in the State and the same parties shared power at the Centre. In 2020, Shiv-Sena, NCP and Congress are sharing the power in the State while BJP is in the power at the Centre. Maharashtra was adjudged the best tableau in 2015 and 2018 when BJP-Shiv Sena Government was in power in the State and the Modi Government at the Centre. The State was on the third spot in 2017.

Kerala's tableau for the R-Day parade was also rejected for the second consecutive year this year by the Centre. The theme proposed by the State for its tableau was the State's art and architecture, which would comprise the traditional art forms of Theyyam and Kalamandala.

The tableau showed Kerala's backwaters, Kathakali, Mohiniyattam dancers and percussionists playing the tradition instrument of Chenda (drums). Kerala tableau was adjudged best in 2013 when UPA-II was in power at the Centre. Kerala, ruled by the CPI(M) Government was leading the protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act, Abrogation of Article 370 and Ram Temple.

Interestingly, Jammu & Kashmir is the only State whose tableau was selected for the parade every year (15 times) from 2005 to 2019. Next in line is Karnataka whose tableaux were selected 12 times during the last 14-year period. The tableaux of Assam & Chhattisgarh were selected 11 times each.

This year, the Government has selected 22 tableaux — 15 States, 1 Union Territory, and six Government departments — from a total of 56 applications (32 from States and UTs, 24, departments).

The 16 States and UTs, whose tableau proposals have been accepted, are: Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, J&K, Karnataka, MP, Meghalaya, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and UP. Tableaux of several Opposition-ruled States including Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha and Punjab have been selected for this R-Day parade. Last year too, there were 16 States and UTs that were part of the parade. In 2018, the number was 14, and in 2017 and 2016, 17.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tableaux-rejection--history-repeated-2020-01-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/tableaux-rejection--history-repeated.html

The 35-year-old singer made his relationship with bodybuilder Amelia Tank Instagram official over the New Year after the pair were first linked in September 2019, reports aceshowbiz.com.

Speaking on the UK breakfast TV show ""Good Morning Britain"", the ""Troublemaker"" singer said how taking a break from social media while recovering from a knee operation helped him reconnect with the realities of life and connect with Tank.

""It was important for me to focus on myself. During that process I was very fortunate to meet my girlfriend as well. After my operation we got in contact again... I was away from this world of showbiz and just at home.""

""I had my hair shaven, I had one leg, a big belly -- I don't know why she's with me,"" the star added.

Murs thinks people should stop spending so much time on the internet if they are struggling in their personal life.

""If you're having a difficult time, get off social platforms, just for a little while. Be in love with the people around you, your friends and family.""

""Sometimes we disconnect ourselves from having a normal conversation and opening up about our feelings and we're quite quick to go on a social media platform and write about it. But actually speak to people.""

Vikrant is looking forward to ""Chhapaak"", featuring Deepika Padukone as an acid attack survivor. The film, directed by Meghna Gulzar, is inspired the life of Laxmi Agarwal.

The actor, who was earlier supposed to collaborate with Meghna on ""Raazi"", says he is happy to have got the opportunity to be part of her latest venture.

Vikrant says with ""Chhapaak"" their aim is to create awareness about acid violence. ""It is a heinous crime and no living being deserves this. No one has the right to have an impact or influence on anyone else's life in such a life-altering way.
