0,18-2-20,Pay taxes for a developed nation,"The Government needs to proactively create the culture of paying taxes in order to be able to fulfil the dream of us becoming a $5 trillion economy in five years

The Indian Government aspires to take the economy to the $5 trillion level over the next five years. It is a difficult goal by its own admission but not an impossible one. Given the current economic slowdown, many experts had hoped for a much stronger fiscal stimulus than what is contained in the recent Union Budget. That being what it is, some experts believe that the Government has missed an opportunity. However, the Centre seems to think differently. While acknowledging the need for growth-enhancing measures, the Niti Aayog’s Vice-Chairman, Rajiv Kumar, had hinted prior to the Budget on using “alternate” measures in the face of limited fiscal headroom. Subsequently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in its monetary policy, used unconventional tools to give the economy a shot in the arm. Without getting into the debate on what’s an optimal dose of economic stimulus and what combination of fiscal and monetary policy could deliver it, Government spending does have an important role in the revival of the economy. The Centre believes that a decent dose of fiscal stimulus is already contained in the Budget.

Be that as it may, growth revival is closely tied to Government spending, which in turn is closely tied to revenues and taxes are an important source of it.

It is startling to note some income tax statistics that have recently been cited: That only 8,600 individuals have reported incomes above Rs 5 crore and only 2,200 professionals (doctors, chartered accountants, lawyers and so on) have declared professional income above Rs 1 crore in the entire country in the fiscal year 2018-19. These figures don’t match well with some other statistics, such as the number of premium cars sold or the total people travelling abroad. There seems to be significant scope for improving tax compliance, which is essential to India achieving its $5 trillion goal.

No rationale for tax avoidance: Tax evasion or underreporting may have been justified when corruption in public administration ran high. But now that the Narendra Modi Government has been able to provide a cleaner administration, this justification is no longer valid.

Further, the taxpayers can be reasonably certain that their money is being used responsibly. Indeed, the Modi Government has a vision of creating a “New India” and is focussed on the economic development of the entire country.

The Government’s focus on the development of the North-east region, on “aspirational” districts and on Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities is all aimed at unleashing economic development across the entire country. Furthermore, several policies and programmes such as Skill India, Mudra Yojana, Start-up India, doubling of farmers’ income with the promotion of agriculture and allied activities such as animal husbandry and so on are aimed at benefiting all sections of society.

Additionally, the Government is working towards ease of paying taxes. It is simplifying the taxation system and making it citizen-centric. It has taken or is taking several steps such as simplifying laws, reducing the tax burden, making tax assessment faceless, bringing taxpayers’ charter and so forth that should instil trust and confidence among tax-payers. But trust and confidence alone are not sufficient to persuade people to pay taxes honestly. The culture of tax avoidance developed over the last few decades will need to be changed consciously.

Promote tax-paying culture: The Government needs to promote the culture of paying taxes in the country. This can be done through a combination of measures. First, the example of clean administration at the national level needs to percolate down to the sub-national level too. Second, it’s not enough for the Prime Minister or Chief Ministers to be clean. Every Minister as an individual tax-payer ought to set an example. Third, the Government needs to run media campaigns to inform the public of their civic duty and also to connect the dots transparently on how their taxes are contributing towards nation-building. Fourth, the Government needs to rope in popular personalities with a large fan following to drive home the message of paying taxes — pretty much the same way as it has been doing for some other social campaigns. The culture of paying taxes honestly has to be instilled consciously and pro-actively.

India has a rich tradition of people donating to social organisations involved in helping the needy. However, in a well-functioning system, the Government, through its various programmes and initiatives, ought to be taking care of the needy. Although people are free to continue giving private donations, they don’t necessarily have to, as long as they are paying their taxes and holding their Government accountable for its performance, including its welfare role.

Tax culture essential: India is considered to be a lower-middle income country as per the World Bank’s country classification which is based on income per person. Even if India becomes a $5 trillion economy by 2025, it would still be considered as a lower-middle income country as per the World Bank classification.

The changes in the taxation system that the Government has or is introducing can help it generate revenues to fuel economic growth. Achieving a $5 trillion economy in the next few years is not difficult. India may take a year or two longer but the goal is within reach.

However, to become a truly developed economy, India will need to change the mindset of its people. It will have to consciously and proactively create the culture of paying taxes.

1,18-2-20,‘Ekal Abhiyan’ proves service not medium of any trade: CM,"Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that the ‘Ekal Abhiyan’ proved that service was not the medium of any trade but a part of series of programmes to present the experiences of our conscience, retrieved from Sanatan tradition, to the world through our values.

He said that the campaign, which was launched by Ashok Singhal, had today crossed the one lakh-mark and it was working selflessly to spread education as envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The chief minister said this at the inaugural ceremony of Parivartan Kumbh organised by Ekal Abhiyan in Lucknow.

Yogi said that when the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh pracharaks go to every nook and corner of the country and dedicate everything to the motherland, they rise above themselves and their family to serve the nation.

“This spirit takes such campaigns to new heights,” he said.

The chief minister said that if the pace of facilities provided in the last five years had been in place since 1947, today everyone would have got the benefits of government schemes. “But this did not happen,” he said.

In the last five years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has provided the facility of housing to 2.5 crore poor, free electricity connections to 4 crore poor families, free cooking gas connections to 8 crore poor families, toilets to 10.5 crore poor families, Rs 6,000 per annum to 12.5 crore poor farmers through Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, financial support to 15 crore youth every year, linked 46 crore poor families with banking facilities, and provided free health insurance cover of upto Rs 5 lakh to 50 crore poor families.

The chief minister said that after 70 years of Independence, a total of 12 medical colleges were built in the state while the present UP government was constructing 28 new medical colleges. “This is a change. At the government level, comprehensive programmes are being run for the betterment of Uttar Pradesh. ‘School Chalo Abhiyan’ is one such major campaigns of UP.” he added.

“We have sent 50 lakh children to school in Uttar Pradesh in the last three years. A total of 1.80 crore children are studying in schools of Basic Shiksha Parishad. The curriculum of the Basic Shiksha Parishad has been made on the lines of NCERT,” he said.

The government has taken measures to ensure that no teacher takes the support of a proxy teacher. The photograph of the appointed teacher has also been put up in the schools so that children recognise their teacher. To ensure the presence of teachers in schools, we have connected 1.58 lakh schools with Prerna App,” the chief minister said.

Yogi said the path was being paved for the construction of Lord Ram’s temple in Ayodhya. “All obstacles have been removed and now this work will be done on a war footing. The construction of Lord Ram’s temple is also a work of recognising the faith of the country as well as the tribal life,” Yogi said, adding that Thousands of years ago, Lord Shri Ram had given recognition to tribal life.

Along with the formation of the Tribal Affairs Ministry for the forest dwellers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave new momentum to the development of those areas, Yogi said, adding that in addition, plans were in place to set up tribal museum and carry forward various government schemes for them.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---ekal-abhiyan----proves-service--not-medium-of-any-trade--cm.html

3,18-2-20,UP Budget: Yogi govt faces uphill task to bridge deficit,"Facing the unenviable task of promises to keep and deficits to bridge, the Yogi Adityanath government will present its fourth budget in the UP Assembly on Tuesday.

Finance Minister Suresh Khanna will present the budget for next fiscal 2020-21.

The UP government in its fourth budget faces the tough task of balancing infrastructure and socio-economic development with populism. The challenge is further compounded from the fact that the 15th Finance Commission is likely to reduce the state’s share in divisible pool of the total revenue of the Centre.

The landslide victory of the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi on the plank of socio-economic development, freebies and mixing populism with social welfare has also added to the pressure on the UP government as assembly elections are not far away.

The economic slowdown has taken its toll on the state’s industrial growth and consequently collection of taxes which is further putting strains on its finances.

UP collected about Rs 80,000 crore in taxes during the first eight months (April-November) of 2019-20, which is 58 per cent of the target of over Rs 1.40 lakh crore during the current fiscal. The shortfall has prompted the state government to pull the taxation department and plug tax evasion.

The state government has set a target of expanding the tax base under Goods and Services Tax by enrolling as many as 50 lakh traders in the next few years against the present 14 lakh traders.

The shortfall in collection of its own tax revenue coupled with the drop in state’s share in Central taxes has aggravated the financial situation for the state government. UP, in the first six months of the current fiscal, has received only Rs 56,000 crore or 36 per cent of the target of Rs 1.50 lakh crore. The state also got less than 20 per cent of the promised Central grants of Rs 68,000 crore in first half of the current fiscal.

The UP government faces an uphill task of financing mega infrastructure projects like Purvanchal Expressway, Bundelkhand Expressway, Gorakhpur Link Expressway , Ganga Expressway linking Meerut with Prayagraj, Jewar international airport, Kanpur metro rail project.

Though the Purvanchal Expressway is likely to be opened for traffic by the year end, the government will have to manage finance for other projects to get them going before the 2022 UP assembly elections.

Liberal finance for the social sector is another challenge before the government. The government needs huge money for education, health, women and child welfare and law and order. The government needs finance for this sector to battle the opposition onslaught of ignoring the poor and deprived sections of society. However, the shortfall in revenue and limited option of borrowing from the market gives little leeway. The total debt burden on UP government by the end of March next will cross Rs 5 lakh crore-mark, which is almost likely to be same as the budget size of 2020-21.

The annual burden of debt servicing on UP government is also likely to be over Rs 1.5 lakh crore by the end of 2020-21.

The power sector remains the Achilles heel of the Yogi Adityanath government. In the last three years, nothing much has been achieved for the turnaround of the ailing sector. Despite the bailout package of UDAY (Ujjawala Discom Assurance Yojana) the losses of the UP Power Corporation continue to mount. The state government itself is the biggest defaulter as its departments owe over Rs 15,000 crore to the power utility by the end of March 2019. The power tariff from November 30, 2017 to September 1, 2019 has increased by 27 per cent yet there is no let up in losses of the UPPCL.

The UP government has fixed a target to achieve one trillion dollar economy by 2024 to contribute to the country’s target of five trillion dollar economy.

Official sources said that the budget would be infrastructure-centric, with the government providing funds for the major projects.

“The government however could introduce new measures for additional resource mobilisation,” said an official of the Finance department.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-budget--yogi-govt-faces--uphill-task-to-bridge-deficit.html
4,18-2-20,Sunni Waqf Board’s crucial meeting on February 24,"The Sunni Central Waqf Board has called a crucial meeting on February 24 in which a decision is likely to be taken on accepting alternative land for a mosque in Ayodhya.

All the eight members of the board have been invited to take part in the meeting.

The Uttar Pradesh government has allotted a 5-acre plot for the mosque at Dhannipur village in Sohawal tehsil of Ayodhya district, nearly 25 kilometres away from the Ram Janmabhoomi temple complex.

Sources said the Sunni Central Waqf Board would not only decide whether to accept the land but also about the usage of the land if it decides to take possession. There are several proposals like building a hospital or school at the site.

A senior member of the Sunni Central Waqf Board said, “All the members have been informed and called to the key meeting. The board will first decide whether it should accept the land or not, after which it will be discussed if the board wants to construct a mosque or a public utility like a hospital or school on the land.”

The sources said that two out of the eight members — Syed Imran Khan and Abdul Razzaq — were not in favour of accepting the alternative land for the mosque as it violates Sharia However, Sunni Central Waqf Board Chairman Zufar Ahmad Farooqui is confident that the proposal to accept the land will be passed by the members.

Meanwhile, litigants in the Babri case said that the land allotted by the UP government was too far from Ayodhya town and the government should find some other land closer to Ayodhya otherwise they would be left with no alternative but to approach the Supreme Court once again.

“The site for the mosque is too far from Ayodhya. It will be difficult for people to go that far to offer Namaz. The decision should be reconsidered and land must be allotted nearby,” said Haji Mahboob, one of the litigants.

Iqbal Ansari, son of Hashim Ansari, one of the main parties in the case, also said that the alternative land should be close to the temple-mosque site. “The allotted land is quite far from Ayodhya. It should be within the municipal limits of Ayodhya. It is now up to the Sunni Waqf Board to accept the land or not,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sunni-waqf-board---s--crucial-meeting--on-february-24.html
5,18-2-20,"Rs 7,900 cr plan okayed for FY ’20-21 for HP","The State Planning Board of Himachal Pradesh on Monday approved Rs 7,900 crore annual plan for the year 2020-21, which is Rs 800 crore more than last year with about 11 percent increase, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said.

Presiding over the meeting of State Planning Board held here, he said that social services sector has been accorded priority by allocating Rs 3487.24 crore, which was 44.14 percent of the total annual plan. He said that transport and communication sector has been allocated Rs 1394.89 crore, whereas agriculture and allied activities had been allotted Rs 974.29 crore. Similarly, irrigation and flood control has been proposed Rs 508.05 crore, while Rs 499.05 crore has been earmarked for energy sector.

The Chief Minister said the State has made remarkable progress in various spheres, but still a lot more could be achieved, adding that the meeting of Planning Board would go a long way in making the planning for State more effective and result oriented.

Thakur said that the life expectancy rate of State was better than the national average, which speaks of better health services being provided to people of the State. He, however, said that the low productivity rate was also an area of concern.

The per capita income of State was better that the national average and most of other states, which was Rs 1,76,968 in 2018-19 and had shown increase of 10.12 percent from 2017-18. He said that Himachal Pradesh was second state after Sikkim to achieve the target of ODF.

Chief Minister said that since 90 per cent population lives in rural area, emphasis should be laid on increasing crop production and strengthen the farm income for betterment of state economy. He said that stress must be laid on research in the farm sector, so that the farmers could be motivated for cultivation of high yielding crops. He said that the farmers should also be promoted for adopting natural farming as this would not only fetch them better price of their produce, but also help in improving the health of the soil.

Thakur said adequate funds have been provided under the backward area Sub Plan and out of the 3226 Panchayats, only 80 remains to be connected with roads.

Emphasising that the state government was committed to make Himachal a favourite tourist destination of the country, he said the government was ensuring that work on four-laning projects was expedited so as to ensure better connectivity in the state. He directed the officers to ensure that all bottlenecks in road projects must be removed at the earliest. He said that in order to ensure better air connectivity, all the existing three airports were being expanded and improved.

The Chief Minister said that the success of Global Investors' Meet has ensured active participation of private sector in development of the State pointing out that MoUs worth Rs 96,000 crore have been signed and ground breaking ceremony of Rs 13,500 crore has been performed.

Cabinet Ministers Mahender Singh, Suresh Bhardwaj, Sarveen Chaudhary, Ram Lal Markanda, Vipin Singh Parmar, Virender Kanwar, Bikram Singh, Govind Singh Thakur and Rajiv Saizal, MLAs and non official members gave their suggestions in the meeting to make it more effective and result oriented.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rs-7-900-cr-plan-okayed-for-fy----20-21-for-hp.html

7,18-2-20,Pseudo-Caliphate and India,"By throwing his weight behind Islamabad on the Kashmir issue, Erdogan unambiguously signalled his intention to emerge as the imam of the new Caliphate he hopes to lead

Even if we overlook the facts about which nation is “occupying” Kashmir, by stating that there is “no difference between Gallipoli and occupied Kashmir”, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan unambiguously signalled his intention to emerge as the “imam” of the new (pseudo) Caliphate he hopes to lead by 2023, the centenary of the Turkish Republic. Addressing a joint session of Pakistan’s Parliament (February 14), he lauded sacrifices made by it in the war on terror and the “positive contributions” it made to the Afghanistan peace process and promised support during the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) meet in Paris (February 16-21, 2020). His denunciation of US President Donald Trump’s Mideast plan hints at an eventual challenge to Riyadh in the region.

Erdogan’s determination to restore the Caliphate has created a visible schism between the Arab States formally led by Saudi Arabia and the non-Arab States led by Turkey. A nascent axis is discernible between Turkey, Malaysia and Pakistan; Iran and Qatar complete the anti-Riyadh alignment. Erdogan declared in February 2018, “The Republic of Turkey is a continuation of the Ottoman Empire… the essence is the same, soul is the same…”

Unsurprisingly, Ankara has emerged as the new hub for anti-India activities by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Unknown to most people, Turkey has universal jurisdiction laws as part of its domestic laws. Article 13 of the Turkish Penal Code states, “Turkish law shall apply to” the crime of torture “committed in a foreign country whether or not committed by a citizen or non-citizen.”

Khalistanis tried to invoke these laws. Sikhs for Justice, a group working for a referendum (“Referendum 2020”) to create Khalistan, is believed to be funded by the ISI. In October 2018, its legal advisor, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, filed a case against Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh when he visited Turkey to pay homage at Gallipoli to soldiers from the First Patiala Infantry Regiment (now 15 Punjab), who lost their lives in World War I, on the centenary of the Great War.

Pannun went to Gallipoli to secure an arrest warrant and restrain the Punjab Chief Minister from leaving Turkey. As the Captain was on a non-official trip, he lacked diplomatic immunity as under the Vienna Protocol, only the Prime Minister and External Affairs Minister are “protected persons” when abroad in personal capacity. In Pakistan, Erdogan lauded a 1915 rally in Lahore, led by Allama Iqbal, where people from present-day Pakistan supported the Turkish people and blatantly ignored the sacrifices made by Indian soldiers at Gallipoli (Battle of Çanakkale), possibly because the bells tolled for the Ottoman Empire.

Turkey’s domestic laws explain why ex-IAS officer Shah Faesal was going to Turkey on August 14, 2019, soon after the Centre abrogated Article 370 and divided the State of Jammu & Kashmir into the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. It is possible that some foreign mentors asked Faesal to invoke these laws in Turkey. He was to file a case of human rights violations against Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, the then Chief of Army Staff Gen Bipin Rawat and others, on behalf of his political party, Jammu & Kashmir People’s Movement (JKPM).

Media reports stated that from Ankara, Faesal was likely to try to take the Kashmir issue to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague, the Netherlands. But this would not take off for want of jurisdiction; no individual can file a case in the ICJ, only States can. Of course, his arrival in the Netherlands would be embarrassing for India.

But if Faesal really wanted to go to The Hague, he could have taken a direct flight to Amsterdam. His plan was to exploit Turkey’s Article 13 universal jurisdiction law. Some human rights NGO would receive him at Ankara, where he would be lionised as a civil service topper (2010) and Harvard alumni who quit a Government job to protest against the activities of the Indian State in Kashmir. Actually Faesal resigned from the service in January 2019 in order to enter politics. However, the sudden split of Jammu & Kashmir and freeze on political activity nixed his unborn political career, leaving NGO activism his only alternative.

Had he reached Ankara, the international media would have splashed Kashmir on the front pages of all important newspapers and magazines and the Indian media would follow suit, thus making Faesal the global face of the anti-India Islamic movement. Once he managed to file a case in Turkey, Islamabad would almost certainly have followed up by filing a case against India at the ICJ, where it has suffered reverses in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case.

However, Faesal’s mentors could not anticipate the lookout notices for Kashmiris trying to leave the country; he was caught at the airport, sent back to Srinagar and placed in preventive custody. He has now been booked under the Public Safety Act (February 15).

This argument can be corroborated from Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s tweet on August 15, 2019, where he invoked Srebrenica, site of the 1995 genocide of over 8,000 Bosnians by the Bosnian Serb Army led by Ratko Mladic. Khan tweeted: “Will the world silently witness another Srebrenica-type massacre and ethnic cleansing of Muslims in IOK? I want to warn the international community if it allows this to happen, it will have severe repercussions and reactions in the Muslim world setting off radicalisation and cycles of violence.” The talk of “massacre and ethnic cleansing” of Kashmiri Muslims is, of course, pure bunkum but the tweet suggests an ISI hand in the aborted Turkish escapade.

Meanwhile, Erdogan has been cultivating separatist, religious and business leaders and Islamic groups in Kashmir after the tweaking of Article 370; this goes deeper than his traditional support to Pakistan at the Organisation of Islamic Conference. Previously also, he supported Pakistan in the FATF. While addressing the UN General Assembly on September 25, 2019, he chided the international community for not paying proper attention to Kashmir over the past seven decades.

Interestingly, soon after the FATF and UNGA meetings, the Indian Overseas Congress headed by Rahul Gandhi loyalist Sam Pitroda opened an office in Istanbul in November 2019. Possibly the Congress hopes to recover its once-committed Muslim vote bank by cultivating the emerging Caliphate; the repercussions on India’s internal affairs will need careful observation.

8,18-2-20,Lead from the front,"SC allows women officers to get command positions in the Army and quashes use of gender stereotypes as an argument

Thanks to the Supreme Court, women officers in the Army can now get command positions at par with male officers and break the glass ceiling in the forces. In non-combat roles for the time being. However, the sad part is that they had to fight for it legally rather than being naturalised in the just order of things, considering that they were inducted in the Army in 1992, a long 28 years ago. An entire generation has grown up in between. In this sense, the ruling is more than significant, it is a landmark. For it reminded the armed forces that as part of an institution that codified discipline, values, honesty, decency and honour, their despotic version of patriarchy, preventing women from leading men beyond event parades, was “discriminatory” and “disturbing.” In fact, it went against the very principles of equality and fairness that the Army professes from time to time. In the process, the court also underlined the need for a mindset change in the evolutionary flow of changing times, not just in the Army but everywhere. It said that deep-rooted stereotypes, that men are dominant and women are primary caretakers, need to go away. It even dismissed the argument of women being unfit physically and compromised by family duties as creating an “artificial” distinction, considering that they have still not been cleared for active combat. The court demolished all chauvinist arguments that can be used as a precedent in deciding similar cases of gender parity, tersely: “To cast aspersions on gender is an affront to their (the women’s) dignity and to the country. Time has come that women officers are not adjunct to their male counterparts. Physiological features of women have no link to their rights. The mindset must change. Women work shoulder to shoulder with men.” With these words, Justices DY Chandrachud and Ajay Rastogi upheld the equality of opportunity for all citizens, elevating functionality above gender and treating human resource in any discipline as deserving of respect than either an entitlement or a consolation prize. It also implied that cultural arguments have no place when it comes to the larger duty of protecting the nation. The court, knowing the tendency of institutions to not follow its orders, said permanent commission would be available to all women, regardless of their years of service and that the judgment had to be implemented within three months. What all this means is that service conditions of men and women officers will be exactly the same and that the latter shall also be provided with choices of specialisation like their male counterparts. A woman can rise to the rank of Colonel and even lead battalions. Women officers, who have been retired, will also get pension benefits.

If the court had to admonish one of the highest institutions of the land — one that is expected to rise above societal ills and be progressive and liberal — on gender injustice, then clearly it is confirmation of inherent biases among the privileged, too. Where women officers can be test cases but not decisive enough, where they may be relegated to staff duties but not challenge the male bastion. The Government’s regressive stand on limiting women’s role in the Army is hypocritical considering its own departments have had all-women marching contingents in Republic Day parades, the Indian Air Force (IAF) allows them to become fighter pilots and the Army has even sent them to tough UN peacekeeping missions globally. Unless they were just tokenism to boost propaganda than really honour winners of the Seva medals and Vishisth Seva medals. The next question, therefore, is should the buck stop with just entrusting greater responsibility to them? Are women just worthy of being included in non-combat roles only? In actuality, like their male counterparts, they, too, give up on all familial commitments to be part of the Army. They, too, undergo the same rigorous selection and training procedures as their male peers. None is arguing that the Army lower its standards. But if women have made it through all kinds of selection criteria, then they should at least be given a chance to prove their mettle. For they are often made a scapegoat for the failure in upgrading standards and changing the status quo. The issue is not only about whether women can be inducted in combat roles but how to make it happen with a radical overhaul of personnel policy. Other nations, including the US, Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany and Israel, allow women to be part of certain combat units. By resisting change, the Army wouldn’t want to be out of sync with an India that is resetting itself. Certainly, it doesn’t suit its image when the court has to prod it all the time. It needs to be the initiator, not a follower.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/lead-from-the-front-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/lead-from-the-front.html
9,18-2-20,Smashing heads,"Young people will always find innovative ways of getting hurt for thrills. But the latest game craze is plain stupid

When you are young, you feel invincible. And because death feels so far away, you tend to take physical risks that you never will once you cross the 30s. Nobody is saying that older humans are boring and refuse to take challenges. But the physical ability to take risks is far reduced by simple physiology. There is a reason why an average infantryman is 22 years old; you would not want to go to war with a physically old army. But thanks to young people pulling off crazy stunts, we have seen the proliferation of adventure sports and some death-defying feats of human achievement. This has been the story ever since human beings gained cognisance of the idea of “self”, which after all, separates us from animals. Until the dare tempts death.

From every generation, some activity or the other emerges that the adventure sports X-Games might take up. But the latest challenge by the young, called the “Skull breaker” is downright stupid and has parents across the world in a state of panic. As the name implies, the challenge is not a smart one. It involves a trio of teens, who stand in a line and jump, and when the central participant’s feet leaves the ground, his/her companions on either side attempt to knock his/her feet out from under them. The prospect of the central participant making a headfall backwards, with chances of smacking his/her head besides injuring other parts of the body, looms larger. Some children have already been fatally injured and many are suffering the impacts of a concussion. It is beyond one’s rational understanding as to why would anyone want to get a concussion deliberately. However, there are a few things that we must understand: Banning this practice will not end it. The best way to deal with this is to talk to adults at social media firms and actively prevent the widespread sharing of videos. The second way is for parents, teachers and doctors to talk to children and explain what a concussion is and how it can have long-term ramifications. One can get a concussion or an injury while playing sports, particularly contact sports. That is accidental; this stupid activity causes self-harm and it must be classified as such. We must ensure that it is one that is ended and not emulated by future generations while ensuring that the creative physicality of the next generation continues. Just like an army of youth needs a grizzled veteran to maintain discipline and order, this army of children needs some common sense from adults.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/smashing-heads-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/smashing-heads.html
10,18-2-20,Make your choice,"If demand doesn’t improve, firms might retain the tax cut bonanza instead of investing. It would've been better to put more cash in the pockets of individuals by giving more IT relief

Amid an atmosphere of gloom and doom (triggered by growth plunging to a low of less than five per cent during the current year and muted projections for next year), it is necessary to closely scrutinise tax proposals in the Union Budget for 2020-21 to assess whether or not these will generate the much-needed growth impulses.

The four major factors impinging on a surge are private consumption, investment, export and spending by the State. The Modi Government has kept up the tempo of expenditure by way of building infrastructure and spending on welfare schemes. On the export front, given the all-round depressed growth and international trading environment, there is little that it can do in terms of using this lever for providing the much-needed fillip.

Therefore, much of the focus has to be on the first two levers, i.e. private consumption and investment. The big question is whether the tax proposals will help in boosting demand. First, let us look at the changes in personal income tax (PIT).

At present, a person having an income of Rs 2,50,001-Rs 5,00,000 per annum pays a tax of five per cent, those earning more than Rs 5,00,000 but less than Rs 10,00,000 pay 20 per cent tax whereas, someone having an income higher than Rs 10,00,000 pays 30 per cent. Accompanying this are a plethora of exemptions and deductions viz. Section 80C (annual investment, expenses, life insurance premium and so on, up to Rs 150,000), Section 80D (health insurance premiums), Section 24 (interest on home loans), Section 80CCD (including extra NPS contribution up to Rs 50,000), Section 80E (education loan interest) and Section 16 (standard deduction on salary income) and so on.

This Budget, even while retaining five per cent tax for annual income in the Rs 2,50,001-Rs 5,00,000 range, on income higher than Rs 5,00,000, proposes a differentiated structure with five slabs against two under the existing scheme of things. The proposed slabs and corresponding tax rates are 10 per cent for Rs 5,00,001-Rs 7,50,000; 15 per cent for Rs 7,50,001-Rs 10,00,000; 20 per cent for Rs 10,00,001-Rs 12,50,000; 25 per cent for Rs 12,50,001-Rs 15,00,000 and for those earning above Rs 15,00,000 a tax of 30 per cent. A person who decides to avail lower tax rates under the new scheme will have to forego most exemptions and deductions. In other words, he can either continue with the existing scheme or go for the new regime. No cherry picking is permitted.

For a person availing of most tax breaks, switch-over to the new regime won’t yield any savings. He could even be worse off depending on the income profile and deductions/exemptions availed. For instance, a person having an annual income of Rs 15,00,000 and availing tax breaks aggregating Rs 3,75,000 (Section 80C:1,50,000; Section 80D: 25,000; Section 24: 2,00,000) or net income Rs 11,25,000 will have to pay Rs 1,56,000 as tax. In case however, he opts for the new scheme i.e. taxable income remaining at Rs 15,00,000 but lower rates, his tax liability will be Rs 1,95,000. This being Rs 39,000 higher, he would prefer to continue with the old scheme. However, the reality on ground zero is that an overwhelming number of assesses are unable to avail of the tax breaks. This is because people in the early stages of their family life have high expenditure commitment and hence need more cash in hand, leaving little surplus to invest which is necessary for availing deductions. Then, there are people at the fag end, say age 55 years plus, who are under no compulsion to save (he has already built a house or nearly completed education of the children). Such people who are unable or unwilling to invest — due to economic circumstances facing them — and hence, unable to avail exemptions and deductions would stand to gain by switching over to the new dispensation. In the above example (annual income Rs 15,00,000), the tax liability of such a person under the old regime would be Rs 2,73,000, which is Rs 78,000 higher than under the new regime (Rs 1,95,000). Without doubt, he/she will be inclined to go for the latter. That apart, the FM’s proposals empower assessees to take their own decisions instead of being constrained by available tax breaks. Someone wanting to have more cash in hand can opt for the new scheme whereas another person keen to save more can continue with the old regime.

According to an internal exercise by the Union Finance Ministry, the proposal will entail a loss of Rs 40,000 crore to the exchequer, which means that much extra cash in the hand of tax payers which they can spend, thereby giving a boost to demand and in turn, growth.

Another proposal expected to put more cash in the hands of individuals, especially those earning less than Rs 10,00,000 per annum, relates to the manner of levying dividend distribution tax (DDT). At present, a company is required to deduct tax (known as DDT) at the rate of 20 per cent (including surcharge and education cess, this comes to 20.35 per cent) from the surplus/profit set aside for distribution of dividend to shareholders. The Budget proposes to substitute this by taxing dividends in the hands of recipients/shareholders.

This substitution means that retail investors, whose earnings are in the Rs 500,001-Rs 750,000 and Rs 750,001- Rs 10,00,000 range, will stand to gain as they will pay tax on dividend at 10 per cent and 15 per cent respectively, as against 20 per cent they pay currently. This will also be a booster to foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) who will be able to claim offset for the tax paid on dividend received from companies here in their respective jurisdictions (this is not possible under the subsisting dispensation of levying tax before distributing profit).

Implementation of this proposal will entail an annual loss of Rs 25,000 crore to the exchequer. This much extra money in the hands of investors will also help augment purchasing power. Coming to corporate tax, on September 20, 2019, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced steep reduction in the rate of corporate tax for “new entities” incorporated from October 1, 2019 in the manufacturing sector and start production by March 31, 2023 from the existing 25 per cent to 15 per cent. Such companies won’t have to pay minimum alternate tax (MAT) (levied on book profit of firms which have no taxable profit courtesy, exemptions and incentives).

Furthermore, the tax rate on existing companies was reduced from 30 per cent to 22 per cent (for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) annually with a turnover of less than Rs 400 crore. This was reduced from the already preferential 25 per cent to 22 per cent) sans exemptions and deductions. These firms are also exempt from MAT. For companies who decide to continue with the old regime viz. tax at 30 per cent with tax breaks, MAT was reduced from existing 18.5 per cent to 15 per cent. In the Budget for 2020-21, the FM has extended the benefit of 15 per cent rate to “new” power companies. Besides, “cooperatives” are eligible for the 22 per cent rate sans exemptions and deductions. The steep reduction in tax rate (for new enterprises, it is at 15 per cent. This is lower than other major countries viz the US 21 per cent, China 25 per cent; even for existing firms at 22 per cent, this is comparable) is a major structural reform aimed at making Indian firms more competitive and leaving more resources with them for increasing investment. The FM has given a choice, enabling them to choose either the old regime (higher tax rate with exemptions) or new regime (lower tax rate sans exemptions).

The Budget proposals (September 2019 and now) entail a mammoth giveaway of about Rs 1,50,000 crore per annum. This should help in spurring investment demand. However, considering that at present, consumption is subdued and already, surplus capacity exists in several sectors (major investment by way of setting up new projects can come only after existing capacities are fully utilised), its impact on growth in the short-term may not be much.

Unless private demand improves significantly, companies might be inclined to retain the tax cut bonanza instead of investing. It would have been better if the Government had put more money in the pockets of individuals by giving extra relief in PIT (say, by applying 10 per cent tax to the entire income range Rs 5,00,001- Rs 10,00,000 instead of limiting this up to Rs 7,50,000) as the need for resurrecting growth now is far more pressing.

To conclude, tax proposals in the 2020-21 Budget are in the right direction. However, a lot more needs to be done in terms of further reducing and simplifying the PIT. With regard to corporate tax, the Government should aim at 15 per cent rate applicable uniformly to enterprises in all sectors, new and existing (sans exemptions).

11,18-2-20,A win-win for Modi and Trump,"While India will benefit from stronger defence ties and technology, the US President will gain from his pro-India image in an election year

On February 24, US President Donald Trump will inaugurate the world’s largest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad. He will also be welcomed with resounding calls of “Kem Cho, Trump” while participating in a seven-kilometre long roadshow from the airport to the Sabarmati Ashram accompanied by Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi. Celebrating the close ties between America and India, this will be the first visit of a US President since 2015 and Trump’s first foreign tour after his impeachment trial. The palpable excitement over the visit is evident, with Modi underscoring that this would “go a long way in further cementing India-US ties.”

The tour is expected to overtake the obvious optics and engage in serious discussions on broad, strategic ingredients that bring India and the US together. On February 25, the Trumps will be accorded a ceremonial welcome in the second leg of their trip to New Delhi. Defence cooperation is expected to occupy the centrestage and India is set to give a final approval for the $2.6 billion 24 MH-60R Seahawk helicopters equipped with torpedoes and submarine-detection capacities for the Indian Navy. Additionally, there is a US approval already in place for the sale of an Integrated Air Defence Weapon System (IADWS) or the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System-II to India estimated at $1.8 billion. This will strengthen Indian defence capabilities and aid the modernisation process of its armed forces.

This will build upon the Trump Administration’s previous decisions to ease the controls for high and sensitive technology product sales to India. This will grant to India the same access as NATO allies through the Strategic Trade Authorisation-1 status, as well as sale of armed drones and integrated air and missile defence technology. India would demonstrate its will to modernise its armed forces and strengthen military capabilities and bilateral defence cooperation through the agreements with the US that guide the sharing of sensitive military and communications technology and reciprocal use of facilities.

Trump’s maiden visit to India as the US President will strengthen the respective countries’ Indo-Pacific policies and witness a synergy in their pushback strategies against the China-Russia alignment in Asia. It would be of relevance to see if the Blue Dot network finds mention at the leadership level. This network, launched by the US Government in November 2019 is a global certification for projects as market-driven, financially-sustainable and transparent and is a reaction to the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative. It needs to be highlighted that Australia and Japan — the other two members of Quad (apart from the US and India), have already signed up for the network.

In an endeavour to push for deeper trade and business ties, the two countries have been trying to reach a modest trade deal with lower tariffs. But the long-awaited “mini” trade deal may not see the anticipated fruition as talks have run into problems due to concerns over data privacy and e-commerce controls. Add to this the recent withdrawal of India from the list of “developing countries” — a status given in line with the WTO’s system of Generalised System of Preferences, on February 10. This would emboss the issues of increased tariff barriers, which could act as an impediment for India getting favourable trade terms. So far, Indian exporters benefitted from the tariff-free access to US markets and receiving the “developed country” tag would subject exports to scrutiny regarding the harm they do the US industry. Despite this, Indian Inc is optimistic about higher investments from US companies, demanding exemption from high duties imposed by the US on certain steel and aluminium products from India and greater market access for its agricultural, automobile, auto components and engineering products.

Reflecting the strong personal rapport between Trump and Modi, this visit will be the fifth meeting between the two leaders in the last three years to elevate bilateral strategic relations. It would demonstrate the two countries’ affirmation of the shared values of commitment to democracy and rule of law and to a more peaceful and open Indo-Pacific, plus the US’ acknowledgement of India as its major partner in maintaining the international global order.

Trump’s visit to India is possibly the final major foreign tour before the presidential elections in November 2020. Given the fact that Indian-Americans constitute a huge population and voter base in the US, if Trump reaffirms America’s commitment to diversity, inclusion and immigrants, this visit would steer a significant number of their votes his way as it will showcase his close ties with their home country. In fact, Modi already blew the US election bugle at the Howdy Modi event in September 2019 in Texas. Swarmed by Indian-American crowd, he endorsed Trump for a second term saying, “Abki baar Trump sarkar.”

16,18-2-20,MCD to finalise new protest site by weekend,"The Municipal Corporation of Dehradun is expected to finalise the new protest site in a week. Demonstrations at the existing protest site near the Parade Ground have been causing public inconvenience and traffic jams among other issues.

This and the planned development of the Parade Ground area under the smart city project are the reasons for the authorities deciding to shift the protest site to another location. In the recent past the Dehradun mayor Sunil Uniyal ‘Gama’ had stated that the protest site would be shifted away from its current location near the Parade Ground.

According to deputy municipal commissioner of Dehradun, Rohitash Sharma, “For now, the locations at Nanoorkheda and Ekta Vihar on Sahastradhara Road are being considered for the new protest site in the city. Though the new site has not been finalised yet, the new site will probably be finalised by the end of this week.”

However, the protesters on the site do not agree to the decision of shifting protesting site to these locations. According to one of the anti-CAA protestors Sardar Khan, “We have been told verbally to vacate the protest site but nothing in writing has been given to us by the official of any department.

Our protest will not shift to any other location till we are given a protest site near the Clock Tower or near the center of the city.” “What is the point of protesting in a location which is far from the centre of Dehradun? The protest is done so that the voice of people can be heard by the authorities.

Who will come to these areas to hear or support the protestors? Protesting against the wrongdoing of the government is the right of every citizen in a democratic country so it is the duty of the MCD to provide a place which is satisfactory to everyone,” said another protestor Mohammad Ishad. According to one of the members of Devbhoomi e-rickshaw welfare society, Satyaveer Arya, “We are not protesting here for now but we are not leaving the site either as we will be commencing our license camp here.

19,18-2-20,VASSM against us due to drop in their extra income: e-rickshaw drivers,"The members of Vikram-Auto Sanyukt Sangharsh Morcha (VASSM) do not want e-rickshaws to operate on the main roads because they are not earning extra by overcrowding their vehicles as in the past, alleged the members of Devbhoomi e-rickshaw welfare society.

VASSM has warned to go on a strike if any amendments are made in the gazette notification issued by the state transport department in which the entry of e-rickshaws is banned on the main roads. As per the members, if the department will allow the e-rickshaw drivers on the main roads they will protest against it.

On this, the members of e-rickshaw union said that the members of VASSM are infuriated since the operators of buses and Vikrams are not getting to overload their vehicles as much as they did before the operation of e-rickshaws started in the city.

According to the secretary of the e-rickshaw union Santosh Kumar, “Everyone is earning sufficiently, be it drivers of the Vikrams, auto rickshaws or city bus operators but the point is they are not earning extra as they were accustomed to by overcrowding their vehicles or charging extra from the passengers. Since an electric rickshaw cannot accommodate more than four passengers at a time, we do not wait for it to get overloaded and immediately head off to the destination after picking up passengers.”

“We do not have any problem with any member of other unions, we want to operate our e-rickshaws beside them but if they want to protest against us then we cannot do anything. The department has allowed us to operate and the department itself will take care of the other unions too. We hope the right decision will be taken by the state transport department,” said a member of e-rickshaw union Satyaveer Arya.

He further added that Vikrams do not have stage carriage permit but they still pick up the passengers in between stops across the city. Besides this, there are number of rules which are being violated by the members of VASSM and hopefully the department will look into this matter too, he said.

However, according to one of the members of VASSM, Vijay Vardhan Dandriyal, the members of e-rickshaw union are lying about getting the permission from the department to operate the electric rickshaw on trial basis for one week on the main roads. He said that the union members will meet the Superintendent of Police (SP), Traffic, on Tuesday and will hear out his take on the matter and only after that, they will decide whether to go on strike or not.

He said he is hopeful that the SP, Traffic, would not have permitted e-rickshaws on the main roads because according to him the police do not have the rights to ignore the gazette notification.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/vassm-against-us-due-to-drop-in-their-extra-income--e-rickshaw-drivers.html

Under this statewide drive, the authorities were checking overloading, the fitness of vehicles, fire extinguishers in buses, first-aid box, among other things. Authorities were also checking private vehicles like three-wheelers, arranged by parents on their own, for sending children to schools.

“Taking cognizance of Longowal school van fire tragedy, the State Transport Department on the directives of Chief Minister on Monday checked 4504 vehicles, of which 1649 were challaned besides impounding 253 vehicles for not complying with the requisite parameters of the Motor Vehicle Act,” said an official spokesperson.

The spokesperson said that the drive would continue further to ensure that all such vehicles must adhere to the stipulated norms for the security and safety of the school children.

The Chief Minister, in a tweet, assured that the Administration will keep a strong vigil with respect to school buses and vans.

22,18-2-20,Aap demands regulatory body to ensure safety to school children,"Demanding the dismissal of Punjab Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla over Sangrur school van accident, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday demanded to set up a regulatory body to check the maintenance of vehicles, their fitness and road worthiness and ensuring safety measures, among other things.

AAP’s senior leader and the Leader of Opposition in Vidhan Sabha Harpal Singh Cheema also slammed the Capt Amarinder Singh Government for being “insensitive” to the safety and security of school children travelling in private school buses or vans.

Expressing deep shock over the loss of four innocent lives of children who were charred to death in an old and ramshackle school van in Sangrur district, Cheema sought dismissal of Education Minister by the Chief Minister.

Cheema said that it was unfortunate that the government had been insensitive to the cause of the safety and security of the school children by giving a free hand to the transport mafia, jeopardizing their lives. The incidents like those had touched a new high in the State while the government was maintaining a stoic silence over the rising malaise, he added.

Terming Singla as the “most inefficient education minister of the state by far”, Cheema said that the horrific incident was not the first of its kind. Earlier also, recurring incidents of crime against children in the Education Minister’s home district had been pouring in, day in and day out.

Urging the State Government to form a regulatory body to check the maintenance of vehicles, their fitness and roadworthiness and ensuring safety measures, et al, Cheema said that the Government should wake up from its deep slumber to take an urgent call on the safety and security of school children by enacting stringent laws to deal with those flouting safety norms with impunity.

He also sought to bring in a permanent transport policy to keep a constant watch on the entire gamut of hiring private vans or vehicles by the school management.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aap-demands-regulatory-body-to-ensure-safety-to-school-children.html

31,18-2-20,"Snake man rescues serpents, brings relief to people","Due to the close proximity of Haridwar city to the Rajaji national park and other wooded areas, various wild animals moving in areas populated by humans is not uncommon here. Apart from the mammals, there are also different species of snakes in the region.

It is here too that the forest department is playing a proactive role by rescuing snakes that enter human habitations. The timely action of the department staff prevents harm to both the humans and the serpents.

One of the major responsibilities of the divisional forest office is to take necessary action on reported conflict situation between a human and a snake or a wild animal.

When it comes to snakes, Bhola Ram is the person who attends to the calls from citizens.

He used to look after routine work in the forest department office in the past but after learning the necessary skills has become known as ‘snake man’ among the locals.

Talking to The Pioneer, he said, “I used to the work in the department office. However, once when I accompanied the snake catching team, it occurred to me that I too could do this task. After learning the basics among experienced officers, I too started catching snakes. Now, I rescue an average of two to three snakes a day or about 100 snakes a month due to which some people know me as ‘snake man’.”

Bhola Ram routinely rescues various venomous and non-venomous snakes including the Russell's viper, cobra, common krait and other species. The forest division has also felicitated him in the past for efficiently rescuing snakes and resolving human-wildlife conflict situations.

Talking about him, the Haridwar divisional forest officer Akash Verma said that Bhola Ram is a capable person who is playing an important role in the department.

Currently, he is working on a contract basis and has been given a place in the rescue squad.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/snake-man-rescues-serpents--brings-relief-to-people.html

They demanded before CM Naveen Patnaik to delegate power of caste correction in RORs to all district Collectors. Over 6,000 women participated in the rally. The agitators from the poor Sabar tribe warned of continuing the stir for an indefinite period if their genuine demand was not be fulfilled.

Notably, 11 years ago on June 12, 2009, a letter on proposal of rectification of all land RORs from “Saara” to “Sabar” had been submitted by the then Principal Secretary in ST and SC Development Department to the Commissioner-cum-Secretary in Revenue and Disaster Management Department to delegate the power of Member of Board of Revenue to Collectors, so that erroneous recording of caste in RORs could be rectified at lower level. Unfortunately, the proposal was still pending.

Hota alleged that for the deliberate negligence, the poor “Sabar” tribals were deprived of all types of Government benefits as they were not given the status of ST.

“Even if in some places, the father’s caste is recorded as Saara and his son’s recorded as Sabar.

The move is planned to restrict the movement of the CPI-Maoist naxals who are active in the Seraikela-Kharsawan district, the camps have been set up at strategic locations in Kharsawan block, Chowka block and Nimdih block of the district.

Revealing about the initiative, Seraikela-Kharsawan superintendent of police S Karthik said that they have launched an intense operation against the naxals in Kharsawan, Chowka jungles and also in the foothills of Dalma close to Ranchi district.

After recent arrested of ultras we received information that the squads of naxal leaders Anal and Maharaj Pramanik were active in Kharsawan and Chowka since the past one year in Kharsawan and Chowka beside the foothills of Dalma. We have set up the CRPF camps keeping in view of the Dalma foothills, Chowka and Kharsawan in view so that the CRPF personnel can conduct random operation against the rebels effectively,"" said Karthik.

Karthik said while one of the camps were set up at Raijama in Kharsawan block, Gomadih in Chowka jungle and at Nuakuli under Nimdih thana area close to the border of Ranchi district before launching a massive operation against the naxals.

In Seraikela-Kharsawan the naxals have shown their presence by triggering serial IED blasts before and after the Lok Sabha elections in Kuchai and Kharsawan. The Maoist rebels had also massacred five policemen a weekly market under Tiruldih thana area in June last year.

According to an intelligence source, the naxals usually shelter inside densely forest only. But if the joint operation is carried out effectively from either side, the naxals have no choice but to bow down the pressure. Meanwhile, operation has been intensified in the naxal infested areas of Rangamaati and Bachadera under Seraikela Kharsawan district.

Another official informed that the drive is based on the input that the rebels are moving in small groups and are trying to reorganise. “Every effort will be made to maintain law and order and to ensure security of the people. This time all security forces have also been alerted to remain vigilant, particularly against IEDs and landmines,"" said the official.

35,18-2-20,Mixed response of Doonites to e-rickshaws on main roads,"The people in Dehradun are divided in their opinion regarding the operation of electric rickshaws on the main roads of the city. “I prefer e-rickshaws to Vikrams or auto rickshaws because they don't make as much noise as the other public transport vehicles. I'll prefer them to pick me up from my home rather than the main road.

We have other options on the main roads but I also understand the point of e-rickshaw drivers that one cannot earn much only driving through the lanes and colonies,"" said a senior citizen Brijeshwar Prasad.

Anshu Prajapati, a housewife said, “I used to send my two kids to school in e-rickshaw when the school was near to our house but when we admitted them to a new school, we had to hire a cab. E-rickshaws seem to be risky for long distances.

They are not as sturdy as Vikrams or cabs. Children play, tease and sometimes nudge each other; the e-rickshaws can be quite risky with naughty kids on board. According to me, the e-rickshaws should be used only for short distances.”

Alay Khan, a college student said, “E-rickshaw really made my college mornings easy because I could catch it nearby my house and it drives me direct to the entrance of the college. Buses wait till it doesn't get congested with passengers, but e-rickshaws are ready to go even with two passengers during college time.

When the e-rickshaw drivers went on strike, I had to walk to the main road to get an auto or the bus or book a cab. How will they serve people from internal lanes if the government will not allow them to pass through the main roads? Nobody wants to change multiple vehicles to reach the place as near as Doon hospital or MKP College.""

However, some people also expressed their views on limiting the number of public transport vehicles in the city. “I think the government should really limit the number of public transport vehicles on the roads of the city. These days most of the people have their own vehicles and the facility of hiring a cab online.

So there is no need for several public means of transport in Dehradun. There are thousands of three-wheelers besides the buses which just add to the city’s air pollution, noise pollution and traffic. The electric rickshaws at least do not contribute to the pollution of the city’s environment,” said a local.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mixed-response-of-doonites-to-e-rickshaws-on-main-roads.html

42,18-2-20,"‘Hungry, aged tigress could not have won fight with bison’","With empty stomach this aged tigress could not have afforded to give any fight to the bison and her tragic end was inevitable.

Dr Ajay Kumar a renowned vet of the Bhagwan Birsa Biological Park Ormanjhi, who was a part of the 5 member team of vet docs which conducted the autopsy of this tigress in National Park Betla on Sunday where near road number 2 she was found lying dead said, “Her stomach was empty. There was nothing in it. However, she had five quills of the porcupine which were lodged in her lower jaw, sternum region and neck rendering her life further miserable.”

What Dr Ajay said has been corroborated by the Ranger Betla Prem Prasad who also said, “This aged tigress was too incapable of going for any big prey and as such was depending upon small rodents like porcupine.”

The ranger further said there was no kill or leftover of her prey but her presence, pug mark and camera trapping all were evident since November last year.

Dr Ajay said her gum was swollen. Her canines were just half an inch when it should have been 3 inches long. Her pre molar and molar teeth were in a State of utter decay as well. The left eye of the tigress had hematoma which meant few blood clots and the right portion of the spinal cord had the lacerated wound and that emanated neuro genic shocks that took her toll of life added Dr Ajay.

He said the major death hastening factor was the severe impacting of her spinal chord as it is guessed this tigress must have been flung in air say up to 10 feet in air by the bullish bison in sheer anger and then this aged tigress fell on the ground with a big thud and that was the end of her.

A tiger or tigress loses its supremacy if it has dental attrition and this tigress had had this symptom most visible reminded the vet doctor.

He said the temptation of any baby bison to this tigress just proved her tragic undoing as the herd of the bison took it as a challenge and in the fight between the aged tigress and the militant bison the tigress had to finally lick the dust.

The 5 vet docs who performed the autopsy were Ajay Kumar, Jojo, M Kalam, C G Deb and Hareylal Mahto.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---hungry--aged-tigress-could-not-have-won-fight-with-bison---.html
43,18-2-20,Asur Mobile Radio makes tribal voices echo in J’khand hinterlands,"As the sound of ‘Dhan- Dhan Turr..Dhand Tanatang Turr…Noa Hake Asur Ahada Radio Enegabu Degeabu Siringabu Urrarr’ (Come sir, dance and talk…This is Asur Mobile Radio) reverberates through the hustle- bustle of the weekly market ‘haat’ in Netarhat, a crowd gathers around to listen to the local news, songs and gather other information relevant to them - all in their local dialect.

Around 200 Kms from Ranchi, nestled in the dense forests of Jharkhand, the Asur mobile radio is the first programme of its kind started by the members of the Asur community that is among the few Primitive Tribal Groups in the State to preserve their language.

The first broadcast of the pre recorded 30 minute programme was aired on January 19 in the Kotia haat and since then about 16 more have been aired on different locations in the Latehar district.

“The programme on an average is generally between 30 to 45 minutes and the mode of transmission is a public address system. A radio broadcast involves a large amount of money and many legal formalities which we cannot afford. So we decided to record pre record the broadcast packed with incidents from across the globe and also with news and songs related to the community, transfer it on a pen drive and play it through sound boxes,” said Sushma Asur who has been at the forefront of the mobile radio.

Due to the lack of resources and transportation facilities, the broadcasters generally trek across the forests and mountains to reach the market and play the recordings.

Asur radio programme leader and General Secretary, Jharkhand Bhasha Sahitya Sanskriti Akhra Vandana Tete feels that the initiative has received over whelming response from the locals. “This is something the people of the region relate to. The primary objective it to protect the language and also popularize it amongst the coming generations as the new generation is getting detached from its language People around the area are keen to participate in the programme and also request us to organise the event at their place,” said Tete. Natives of the Latehar and Gumla districts, the tribe has a population of around 23,000 with only about 10,000 well versed in the Asur language.

“Since their language is at risk, there is also a threat to their survival. This is because their land has been acquired and they have no traditional means of livelihood. There are plans of starting similar programmes for the Birhor and Birjia communities as well,” added Tete.

The Asur tribe is among the nine PVTGs — Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups found in Jharkhand while the language features in the UNESCO list of definitely endangered languages. Retired Principal Chait Toppo, Melan Asur, Roshni Asur, Manita Asur, Ajay Asur are the others actively involved in creating the programme.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/asur-mobile-radio-makes-tribal-voices-echo-in-j---khand-hinterlands.html

“The BJP is not shying away from any kind of probe, but when old files are being reopened and probed the JMM bribery case should also be reinvestigated on the directions of Supreme Court in 2014.

The JMM general Secretary presents the matters with incomplete information. Meinhardt issue was not during the tenure of former Chief Minister Babulal Marandi but he referred to it as Babulal's tenure. In fact, JMM has got upset due to the merger of Jharkhand Vikas Morcha with BJP and its leaders are saying anything,” said Shahdeo.

“Apart from the JMM bribery case, there is no other instance when Rs 3 crore of bribe has been kept in Punjab National Bank's Narora branch in New Delhi. JMM should tell about the amount of bribe on which they got a notice to pay income tax, in the light of this, whether they have paid income tax on bribe money or not,” he added.

Pratul said that the JMM while referring to Babulal as the Wholesaler of MLAs, forgets that the term horse trading in Indian parliamentary history had its origin from the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha when its four MPs voted to save the government at the Centre by taking money from Congress.

Addressing a Press conference at the party headquarters, Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee (JPCC) Spokesperson, Alok Kumar Dubey said it is not mega merger but it is merger of disappointment. Taking a dig at Union Home Minister, Amit Shah the party Spokesperson said that Shah is seeing the day when he had to come to the State Capital to include a single MLA.

Terming BJP as sinking boat, Dubey said that changing the navigator could not save the boat. “BJP is losing its ground and the party has included Marandi who lost several elections in the pasts then he won this time. Out of total three MLAs of his party two MLAs joined Congress already. The party workers and officials already left him. This is third merger of Marandi’s party in BJP. Since last 14 years Marandi is helping BJP. In the last Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections BJP gained in the State only due to Marandi, he helped in distributing anti-BJP votes,” he added.

Meanwhile, reacting on Marandi’s merger at a press meet, JMM General Secretary, Supriyo Bhattacharya said that returning home after 14 years of long time Marandi is thinking that he will celebrate Dipawali then it will be his blunder as the State BJP is divided in many groups and many leaders of the State unit of the party internally opposing his returning in BJP.

Taking a dig at Marandi, the party General Secretary said that on one hand BJP brought Local Policy based on year 1985 and Marandi had raise Local Policy based on year 1932 during his tenure. Now he should explain which side he will go, he added.

Hitting hard on former Chief Minister Raghubar Das’ statement during the merger programme, in which Das said that law and order situation is completely in bad condition, Bhattacharya said that Das forgot his tenure when a person killed on the Court premises, killing happened just in front of main entrance of his residence. “A total of 12 persons killed under mob lynching, 18 persons killed for child theft, crime against women and cases of rape registered in record numbers,” he added.

Bhattacharya further said that Marandi should also remember that during January, 2001 to February, 2002 in Marandi’s tenure as Chief Minister, Jharkhand High Court had said that there is situation of complete anarchy in the State.

Bhattacharya said that the State Government is not working with revenge policy; it is only reviewing former Government’s work. There is example that the workers of State Government were not getting their salary since three months, they got their due salary on December, 16 only because the State’s treasury is empty and there is no money to pay salary to the workers, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/congress--jmm-mock-at-marandi---s-homecoming.html

65,18-2-20,BJP protests PMAY houses named after Biju,"The State Assembly on Monday witnessed heated exchanges of words between the Opposition BJP and the ruling BJD over naming of rural housing projects on physical structures.

Raising the issue during the Zero Hour, Leader of Opposition Pradipta Naik severely criticised the State Government saying that houses constructed under the Prime Minister Awas Yojana (PMAY) are being named as the Biju Pucca Ghar Yojana, a State-scheme.

“The State Government has not allocated a single pie to provide houses under the Biju Pucca Ghar Yojana. It is disappointing that the State Government has named all houses constructed under the PMAY as BPGY houses,” resented Naik.

He urged the Speaker to give a ruling to resolve the issue at the earliest. Soon, other BJP members joined the LoP in demanding a ruling. At this time, Government Chief Whip Pramila Mallick raised a Point of Order to speak on the issue. The Speaker said that Treasury Bench members should also be allowed keep their views.

“While the State Government is providing 60 per cent share, the State Government is providing 40 per cent share and is employing administration for implementation of the PMAY. What is the problem in naming the projects as BPGY,” wanted to know Mallick. She also demanded that the houses constructed under the PMAY as BPGY.

BJD member Debi Prasad Mishra said BJP members should not be impatient by the move. “Till 2014, the Union Governments had been funding rural houses 100 per cent. After the BJP-led NDA Government came to the power in 2014, it slashed the Central share to 60 per cent. If the State Government will not bear 40 per cent of expenditure, the houses can’t be constructed. All should have patience,” he said.

The Leader of Opposition protested it again and said let there be written “Central share 60% and Stage share 40%” on the walls of the houses. The Re-1-a-kg Rice schemes should also bear “Rs 27:Rs2:Re1” as Central Government, State Government and beneficiary’s shares, respectively, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-protests-pmay-houses-named-after-biju.html

68,18-2-20,Demands of sending Priyanka to RS heard in MP,"While talks of Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra eyeing a nomination for Rajya Sabha gaining momentum, demands of sending her to the Upper House of the parliament are heard in Madhya Pradesh.

Three Rajya Sabha seats of Madhya Pradesh quota are going to be vacant in April this year and the ruling party is hopeful of retaining two of them.

The sitting RS Member of Parliament, Digvijay Singh, is eager to have another term in office while his close rival Jyotiraditya Scindia too is vying for a berth in the Upper House. Both lost the Lok Sabha polls in year 2019.

In case, Priyanka Gandhi opts for the RS route via Madhya Pradesh, either Singh or Scindia might have to opt for any other State to get elected for the Rajya Sabha.

Meanwhile, Congress leaders in the past have demanded Gandhi be brought to the State at the time of several elections in the past have started to reiterate the demand.

State PWD minister Sajjan Singh Verma who is considered close to Chief Minister Kamal Nath, on Sunday openly claimed that Gandhi be brought to Madhya Pradesh for RS nomination.

Saying that late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had brought CM Kamal Nath to Chhindwara 40 years ago and got him elected as an MP, so in the current political scenario, it was high time Nath brings Priyanka Gandhi to the state.

This would start a fresh politics in Madhya Pradesh, he claimed.

Parliamentary Affairs minister Govind Singh commenting on RS nominations claimed that the party had the required majority to bag two of the three seats and the party high command would finalise the names.

Verma’s statement came a day after CM Kamal Nath visited New Delhi and called on senior party leaders including interim president Sonia Gandhi.

Sources claim that Scindia who had suffered shocking defeat in his parliamentary seat Guna in 2019 lok sabha polls is eager to each Rajya Sabha.

However, if at all, the party fields Priyanka Gandhi from MP for Rajya Sabha, his road to the Upper House of the parliament could be an uphill task.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/demands-of-sending-priyanka-to-rs-heard-in-mp.html

Urging his own Government to reject NPR, Masood told media persons that a massive agitation would be launched if the NPR was not rejected.

Masood said like the Centre, MP Government also has issued a gazette notification on the commencement of National Population Register (NPR). “It’s a wrong thing which happened and should be clarified. NPR is just a small form of NRC,” said the MLA.

The BJP will not be able to implement NRC in the country but it still got it in force through the NPR, claimed Masood who had been vocal critic of NRC and CAA since the Centre formulated the twin legislations.

Earlier the census was done simply where the Government staffers used to visit homes and returned after entering details of family members but the Modi government has modified the NPR and census on the basis of fresh system would require details of the ancestors to be entered into records, claimed the MLA.

The NPR has been tagged with six sub rules and we oppose this, said the MLA, adding that a campaign of scripting the slogan ‘Hum Kagaz Nahin Dikhayenge, No NRC, No CAA and No NPR would be started in the city shortly.

The Congress legislator claimed that in the first phase a mega protest would be organised in the last week of this month and would be attended by national figures and a memorandum would be handed to Chief Minister Kamal Nath.

He also urged the Congress Government to reject the NPR claiming even after first phase of agitation, if the state government fails to act on the issue, we would be moving the protest path.

It is not either an idle piece of ostentation meant for displaying the vain glory of prodigality of the State ex-chequer. It is an essential need for bridging of the digital divide in providing e-empowerment to the bottom of the pyramid in our society. This will act as a stair to every youth to climb the ladder of success. This will ensure an intersection of the four emerging trends of the 21st century: digitisation, virtualisation, mobilisation and mass-personalisation. The man here at the helm of affairs is Dr Manoranjan Puthal. Success has dawned upon him like no fluke. A senior management executive achieving sanguine success year after year with revenue profit, and business growth objectives within startup, turnaround, and rapid-change environments, he follows his lofty goals from morning to midnight by making whirlwind tours to the nook and corner of the State the year around. A keen planner with expertise in project appraisal, evaluation, resource planning and deployment, project estimation, scheduling, tracking and implementation, he is an expert in strategic partnerships, leadership development, team leadership, operations management, customer relationship management and organic business growth.

In an interview to The Pioneer, Dr Puthal spoke to Sugyan Choudhury.

What’s unique about Odisha Knowledge Corporation Limited?

The main mission of the OKCL is to create new paradigms in education, governance and empowerment of people at large in the context of an emerging knowledge-based society and knowledge-based economy. It attempts to bring about the mainstreaming of this unique educational transformation through a continuous blend of pedagogic, technology and business innovations. This will create a unique blend of four mega trends of 21st century -- digitisation, virtualisation, mobilisation and mass-personalisation. It aims at bridging the digital divide through universalisation and integration of information technology in all walks of life. Its uniqueness is being a Special Purpose Vehicle promoted by the Government, yet a self-sustaining autonomous company. Its DNA is PPCP (public, private and community partnership). Government support and community participation is essential to fulfil its mandates given by the Government.

What are the challenges you face in striving towards the mandate?

The major challenge is to offer education, governance and empowerment solutions and services to a large and diverse population with world-class quality at an affordable cost with widest accessibility from cities to rural, tribal and hilly areas. Over these years, the OKCL has built an image among its 400+ entrepreneur partners who established 400+ IT training centres across the State. It has created a positive impact through its digital literacy programme, OS-CIT. With its presence in all districts, the OKCL has remarkably improved the access to high-quality computer education at affordable costs to masses. It has built a huge workforce; and more than 1.5 l youths are ready for 21st-century workplaces through the OS-CIT digital literate programme. It has also impacted school education in 4000 ICT computer labs in Government and Government-aided schools which has direct benefit to bridging the digital divide and make computer literacy and computer-aided education possible for 25 lakh students within a period of five years. The project has been evaluated by the Programme Performance & Outcome Monitoring Unit (PPOMU). The evaluation report states, “This project has visibly enhanced the level of motivation and engagement of students which has elevated the learning curve. The scholastic accomplishments of students, especially the slow learners, have increased due to greater clarity of students on the different subjects.”

How have your products and technologies been beneficial for youths and for the society?

All its products and services deploy state-of-the-art eLearning, eGovernance and eEmpowerment technologies in collaboration with the MKCL, which has many proven technologies and been working for years since 2000. All the OKCL technologies, products, solutions and services are comparable to the best options in the global context in terms of architecture, performance and customer satisfaction. The need of the time is to create a sustainable local self-employment for semi-urban and rural youths who cannot afford to migrate to cities. I am sure our effort to create workforces to grasp the opportunity for people has a potential to develop 2.5 million online freelancers. India has a potential to earn 20 billion US$ through online freelancing by 2025.

What is your experience working with the Government?

It is always a wonderful experience to be part of the Government and its policies to reach the rural and semi urban masses. The mandates given to us enable our presence in all rural belts to empower the “Last Person First” with our eEmpowerment programmes. Since its incorporation, our Chairmen and Board Members have guided us rationally to grow organic. Till date, the OKCL has paid Rs 90 lakh to the Government as dividend and contribution to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. Besides, it has contributed over Rs 7 crore to the Government exchequer in different forms during last seven years. In fact, by setting up the OKCL, the Government has benefited the State in making available a huge pool of digital citizens and creating new opportunities for employment generation for the last-mile person.

What is your corporate culture like?

Our corporate culture is a happening thing evolving all the time naturally. We are not building it commercially. Our leaders are seeing the possibilities with the last-mile people to ignite their growth engine. We are not sitting on somebody’s will; we are investing our time and energy to explore the possibilities with somebody to happen. Our corporate growth culture is to determine how many people’s lives we are touching and how deep is our operation to reach the last person of our society. All our employees, network partners and learners are tuned to openness of exploring all ideas from every member; and we are proud of the decent culture that our organisation carries with integrity.

Seven MLAs of the party said to be close to former chief minister, Harish Rawat would hold a meeting at Khatima in Udham Singh Nagar district on February 29.

These MLAs have invited many former MLAs and other leaders of the party for the meeting. The deputy leader of the Congress legislature party in Vidhan Sabha, Karan Mahra said after the meeting, the Congress MLAs would hold meetings with the senior leaders, Harish Rawat, Pritam Singh, Indira Hridayesh and Kishore Upadhyaya.

He said that if the things don’t improve then the MLAs would meet the party high command. Interacting with media persons, Mahra said that due to infighting, the party is getting denigrated. He added that the leadership of the state party don’t take the MLAs into confidence on important issues. Mahra said that the seven MLAs of the Congress party can go to any extent to save their pride and Uttarakhandiayat.

He said that Rawat is seasoned campaigner and has a vision for development of the state and Congress can return to power in the year 2022 if Harish Rawat is used properly.

The speaker told the media persons at his residence that it is the government’s prerogative to decide on the place and the duration of the sessions of the Vidhan Sabha. He however added that he shares the concern about short duration of the budget session this time and added that he would hold talk with the CM on the subject.

Expressing concern over less sittings of Uttarakhand Vidhan Sabha, the speaker said that reducing the gap between two sessions of Vidhan Sabha would result in increasing the total sittings.

Later, talking to The Pioneer, Mahra said that organising a session of only four days is very unfortunate. He said that on first day, only the address of the governor is scheduled and for budget presentation and department wise discussion the time allotted for the session is very less.

Giving the example of neighbouring Uttar Pradesh (UP) where budget session would last for more than a month, the Congress leader said that the Uttarakhand Government is not serious about its parliamentary obligations.

Mahra also claimed that in Vidhan Sabha never starts on Monday and Tuesday due to which the departments headed by chief minister never come up for discussions. It is convention that questions concerned with the chief minister are listed on Mondays and Tuesdays. The budget session this time is slated to start on Tuesday (March 3) but since the governor addresses the house on day one, this time also the questions related to the departments headed by CM are not expected to come up.

87,18-2-20,"After ‘missing' for months, Sidhu finally appears","Amidst speculations that firebrand leader Navjot Singh Sidhu may start new innings in the wake of Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) resounding win in Delhi elections, the cricketer-turned-politician made a public appearance in an event attended by his political rival and SAD MLA Bikram Singh Majithia on late Sunday night.

Coming out of his ‘self-imposed’ political exile after he resigned from the Capt Amarinder Singh led Cabinet in July 2019, Sidhu made his first major public appearance after months at a cultural event regarding musical album release at Majitha in Amritsar, sharing stage with Majithia, besides other prominent leaders including Congress Amritsar MP Gurjeet Singh Aujla, SAD Taksali leader Ranjit Singh Brahmpura, among others.

Sidhu greeted Akali veteran Brahmpura, and was also seen chatting with Congress MP Aujla during the event. However, he maintained a distance from his bête noire Majithia.

The sudden appearance of motor-mouth Sidhu at an event after eight months of exile has created a stir in the Punjab political circles, especially after he abstained from campaigning for the party in the recently concluded Delhi assembly polls despite being Congress’ star campaigner.

It has been learnt that Sidhu deliberately avoided campaigning in Delhi as there are apprehensions that he might part ways with the Congress, and join any another political party, like AAP, ahead 2022 polls.

AAP’s massive win in Delhi has led to conjectures regarding Sidhu’s possible entry into the party which has set it next target on Punjab. In fact, AAP has also started sending feelers to Sidhu in a move to restructure the party organization in Punjab.

Notably, Sidhu has been absenting himself from the session of Punjab Vidhan Sabha besides skipping public meetings ever since he resigned as the Cabinet Minister in protest against changing his portfolio.

Sidhu has been keeping his cards close to the chest and has not spoken to media about his future move.

However, AAP Punjab unit president Bhagwant Mann has given indication of roping in Sidhu in Punjab. “Our party can talk to him (on the issue of his joining the party),” Mann had stated in January adding, “We will welcome good politicians. But there is no official communication so far with him”.

Earlier, Akali Dal Taksali leaders also offered the Chief Minister's post to Sidhu “if he joined the party”.

There are also speculations that political strategist Prashant Kishor, who has close proximity with both Arvind Kejriwal and Sidhu, could play a crucial role in bringing Sidhu to the AAP fold ahead of the state polls. The beleaguered AAP is also looking for a CM face in Punjab.

Kishor was also instrumental in getting Sidhu to join the Congress ahead of the Punjab Assembly election in 2015.

Used to swear loyalty to Rahul Gandhi, Sidhu had to exit from the government after differences with party veteran and Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh. At loggerheads with the Chief Minister since long, Sidhu formally resigned on July 14, and has limited his public appearances since then.

At the same time, seeing the tone and tenor of Capt Amarinder’s assertions, Sidhu's “rehabilitation” in political circles is not seen in the ruling dispensation.

In his latest development, with the Pakistan Railway Minister Sheikh Rashid's disclosure that Kartarpur Corridor was the brainchild of their Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, the Punjab Chief Minister had urged Sidhu to be more cautious in his dealings with the Imran Khan government.

He had advised Sidhu not to allow his personal friendship with the Pakistan Prime Minister to cloud his judgement in any way, as that could be harmful for India's interests.

The Congress had won 77 seats in the 117-member state assembly in 2017 after projecting Amarinder Singh as its chief ministerial nominee, only one short of 78 figure required for a two-thirds majority.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/after----missing--for-months--sidhu-finally-appears.html

As the House met at 10.30 am, BJP Chief Whip Mohan Charan Majhi stood up at his seat and alleged that questions being put by members are not being selected through lottery system for discussion in the House. Rather, they are being chosen by concerned Ministers to suit their wishes, he alleged.

State BJP president Samir Mohanty told reporters that the GSDP in the State has been decreasing constantly from 7.94 per cent in 2015-16 to 7.14 per cent in 2016-17.

Mohanty told that the contribution of the services sector to the economy too has decreased from 45.25 per cent in 2018-19 to 40.51 per cent in 2019-20. Similarly, the contribution of agriculture and allied sector too is 19.90 per cent. While 62 per cent of the population of the State is farmers, the negligible contribution of the farming sector has pointed out their wretched conditions, told Mohanty.

He also flayed the galloping loan burden which is calculated to be Rs 1,6,526 crore by the end of this financial year. Mohanty told that though the per capita income has increased compared to the previous year, but it is still less than the rate of other States and national average.

95,18-2-20,Punjab to renegotiate Power Purchase Agreements,"Under attack from all sides over the costly electricity in the State besides the demand of annulling the “anti-government” power purchase agreements (PPAs) with private players, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday announced that the State Government would “renegotiate” the power agreements which the erstwhile Akali-BJP Government had signed to “defraud the State and its people”.

The Chief Minister also warned the private players against messing with Punjab’s finances. Given the shortfall in production by the State-owned power plants at Lehra Mohabbat and Ropar, the Chief Minister said that the State Government would work around the existing arrangements with the private players to make the power rates more affordable while ensuring that the peak demand of 13,000 mega watt is effectively met.

Notably, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has all along been targeting the State Government for not fulfilling its election promise of scrapping or reviewing the PPAs with private thermal power plants.

In fact, AAP’s Sunam MLA Aman Arora has even written to the Congress national president Sonia Gandhi seeking her intervention in the matter by directing the Chief Minister to fulfill the election promise and scrap the agreements.

Not even the Opposition, the demand to cancel the PPAs in the interest of the state and its people was also raised by the Congress leaders including the Cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, former Power Minister Rana Gurjit Singh, state Congress chief Sunil Jakhar, along with other legislators and Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa corning their own Government over the issue.

The Chief Minister, addressing the newly elected Punjab Youth Congress (PYC) office bearers, said that the state's financial position was on its way to consolidation as a result of the State Government’s efforts of the last three years and any attempt to scuttle the momentum would not be tolerated.

Exhorting the young PYC members and office bearers to play a proactive role in safeguarding the nation’s cherished ideals of secularism and pluralism, Capt Amarinder described the positivity and energy exhibited by the youth against the nefarious divisive designs of the BJP was reassuring.

Capt Amarinder asked the youth wing to support various initiatives in a mission mode to ensure that their benefits percolate down to the masses, and to thwart the Opposition’s negative propaganda against the government.

The Chief Minister hoped that the exuberance shown by young leaders would further enhance penetration of the State Government’s various path-breaking pro-people policies at the grassroots. He also assured them of his proactive support at all levels for any work in the interest of the State and its youth.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-to-renegotiate-power-purchase-agreements.html
96,18-2-20,Punjab sets 15-day deadline for ULBs to make cities ‘garbage-free’,"To make Punjab’s cities ‘garbage-free’ by ensuring 100 per cent lifting of garbage heaps from every nook and corner of the cities, Punjab Local Bodies Minister Brahm Mohindra on Monday set 15 days deadline for all the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).

The Minister also directed the ULB authorities to check the menace of stray cattle by bringing other stakeholders, social organisation and NGOs on board.

The directions by the Minister came while he was presiding over a high-level review meeting of the Department.

Mohindra directed all the Mayors and Municipal Commissioners to lift every bit of garbage from the jurisdiction of the cities, and set a 15-day deadline for them to make cites ‘garbage-free’.

At the same time, he assured them full support from the Government in this work but demanded a reciprocal commitment from them to complete this task within 15 days.

“The UBLs, who would achieve this target in lesser time, would be rewarded by the State Government in a befitting manner whereas the authorities at those ULBs, who would fail to execute the task in the stipulated time, would have to face the music,” said the Minister.

The Local Bodies Minister, highlighting the virtues of ‘one time settlement policy’ for the recovery of arrears of water and sewerage charges in the Urban Local bodies, which has recently been notified by the department, called upon the various authorities at the ULBs to launch aggressive awareness campaign to sensitize the citizen to urge them to pay their outstanding amount.“By doing so, the ULBs could generate adequate revenue at their end,” he said.

Similarly, the Minister asked them to realize the pending revenue from the building department. The Minister asked them to plug the gap in collecting the property tax by making a point that in the recent past around one lakh new electricity connections were given in the urban area of the State but the estimation of property tax was not increased in that proportion.

He directed the ULBs to immediately float the tenders for putting up an advertisement at designated places of the ULBs which would garner bountiful revenue for them.

Mohindra also gave a clarion call to the ULBs to check the stray cattle menace which is posing serious socio-economic danger before the civilized society and daily claiming innocent lives across the State.

He directed the officers at ULBs to personally visit the gaushalas in their districts and to make an accurate inventory of the stray cattle housed therein. He said that the government is providing Rs 32 per cattle as maintenance charges to the gaushalas as per the headcount of stray cattle providing by the management of the gaushalas, so the headcount of cattle must be crosschecked by the officers of the ULBs.

The Minister said that illegal constructions in the cities must be checked and it should be ensured that fee should be paid for every new construction as per the Government policy.

The Minister asked the ULBs to make the norms easy for the benefit of citizens so that they coordinate with the Government by paying taxes and fee in time for executing welfare schemes for them.

Saying that the ULBs share a big chunk of responsibility in providing civic amenities to the citizen in a time-bound manner, the Minister directed the ULBs to float tenders of all pending development works till March 31, 2020, and ensure execution of work within the stipulated time frame.

He instructed the officers to ensure the quality of work in terms of material used, which cannot be compromised at any cost.

Addressing to the problem of delay in getting the approval of development works, the Minister asked all the ULBs for e-submission of all the resolutions using an online portal. At the same time, 10 days deadline was fixed for the officers at the head office for giving technical approval and financial approval.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-sets-15-day-deadline-for-ulbs-to-make-cities----garbage-free---.html

He claimed that eight million people have been brought out of poverty in the last decade. He termed the KALIA scheme as unique and said the Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana is providing free healthcare services to all citizens irrespective of their income, or status in all Government medical facilities.

He said empowerment of women is very close to his heart. The ""Mission Shakti"" and the Women Self Help Group movement is spread in every corner of the State. More than 40 lakh mothers have been assisted under MAMATA, he said.

Our intervention in providing education to more than 5 lakh ST and SC students with hostel facility is unprecedented in scale.

“My Government is determined to work hard for the complete transformation of the State by implementing the ""5T Mantra,"" he said.

98,18-2-20,"Marandi ends 14 year-vow, joins BJP","First Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, who headed Jharkhand Vikas Morcha ( (Prajatantrik) since 2006, on Monday ended his 14 years Vanvaas as he made ‘ghar wapsi’ to BJP. Marandi, the 61-year-old leader having political experience for more than three decades, merged his party JVM (P) with BJP in presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP national general secretary OP Mathur and senior BJP leaders at Jagarnath Maidan.

Shah, welcoming Marandi said, “The party will become stronger with expertise of Marandi as he is one of the leaders in State who can understand the pulse of people.” Shah, for the first time publicly admitted that BJP was working on the mission since 2014 to bring back Marandi in Saffron party fold.

Shah said, “In 2014 when I became the national president of BJP I tried to bring back Marandi having RSS background in BJP fold, but Marandi due to his stubborn attitude rejected BJP’s offer. But, today we are happy that Marandi has decided to return home.” The Union Home Minister also indicated that Marandi will be given top posts in State BJP equal to both Arjun Munda and Raghubar Das.

Shah said, “From today Raghubar Das, Arjun Munda and Babulal Marandi will work together for strengthening the party at grass root level. Not only Marandi but all JVM leaders will be given respectable posts in the organization.”

Marandi too praised BJP saying that though he was out from party for 14 years but he never joined any other party. The former chief minister revealed how BJP leaders tried to bring him back in saffron party since 2006. The former chief minister disclosed how Prime Minister Narendra Modi had sent his emissary to him with an offer to join BJP in 2014.

Marandi also said that he had joined the party without any offer and is ready to discharge any responsibility that the party bestows to him.

Marandi also said how BJP is different than other parties as the Saffron party is cadre based disciplined organization. He also supported Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) saying that some political parties are spreading wrong information about CAA especially among minorities.

Marandi, an affable, suave and soft in nature politician has been a loyalist of RSS and it was his closeness to RSS that he was made first CM of Jharkhand when it became a separate state on November 15, 2000. However, his stint as the CM could not last for a long time and he had to step down on March 17, 2003.

In 2006, Marandi formed his own party and since then he has been trying to find a base in the State. In 2009, his party won eleven Assembly seats, which were reduced to eight in 2014. In 2019, his party managed to win only three seats.

Former chief minister Raghubar Das and Union Tribal Affairs minister Arjun Munda on the occasion welcomed Marandi terming him as popular leader. Das said, “Babulal jee fought against Left Wing Extremism (LWE) menace and he had to even sacrifice his son fighting against LWE.” Reacting on JVM merger with BJP, Chief Minister Hemant Soren said, “My best wishes to Marandi for his new innings.”

With Marandi’s home coming to BJP, the party aims at once again getting back its tribal vote bank as in last Assembly election the party’s biggest disappointment was in tribal reserved seats. Out of 28 tribal seats in Jharkhand, the BJP won only Khunti and Torpa seats.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/marandi-ends-14-year-vow--joins-bjp.html

Speaking at a Press conference here, AICC Odisha in-charge Jitendra Singh said the BJD Government has failed to provide required quota to OBCs and Socially and Economically Backward Classes (SEBC)s in last 20 years.

While over 94 per cent of Odisha's population is eligible to get caste-based reservations, only six per cent are getting all benefits, he said, adding some States are providing total quotas much higher than 50 per cent.

While Tamil Nadu provides a total quota of 69 per cent, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra have raised it to 67 per cent, he claimed.

He demanded that the State should immediately implement 27 per cent reservation for OBCs and 38.5 per cent quota for SCs and STs in employment and education.

Hitting out at the BJP, he said the BJP Government is misleading the entire nation and the Parliament. Instead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi apologising to the country for their conspiracy and correcting the historical wrong being done to the SC, ST and OBCs, the BJP is trying to shift the responsibility by leveling false allegations.

Also the BJP permitted the Schedule Castes and Schedule Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989 to be quashed in the Supreme Court and it was only after the Congress blocked the Parliament, the act was restored. Dalit atrocities as per NCRB data has reached 43, 2033. Even the backlog in SC, ST and OBC jobs continues, he added.

A Bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar was initially of the view that the petitioner ought to have filed a civil suit if he was seeking compensation as the claims made by him would have to be proved through evidence which cannot be done in a writ petition.

""These are matters of evidence. Why are you not filing a suit for damages? On the basis of annexures in a writ, claims cannot be proved,"" the court said and added that ""it has become a fashion in Delhi to file a writ for everything"".

However, the bench subsequently issued notices to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the university, the Delhi government and the police seeking their stand on the plea in which the student has alleged his both legs got fractured in the ""brutal violence carried out"" by security personnel.

In his plea filed through advocate Nabila Hasan, Shayaan Mujeeb has contended that he was in the university library on December 15, 2019 studying, when police personnel entered the building and allegedly beat up the students there.

Hasan told the Bench available CCTV footage show the police entering the library and beating up the students.

Apart from seeking a Rs 2-crore compensation for the injuries suffered, Mujeeb has also sought registration of an FIR for the offences allegedly committed by the police.

The petitioner has also sought reimbursement of Rs 2 lakh, claiming he spent the amount on treatment of his broken legs, in one of which a rod has to be inserted due to the severity of the fracture. Earlier, another student, Mohd Minhajuddin, had moved a plea seeking a probe into the incident and demanding compensation for injuries he suffered.

Minhajuddin, according to his plea, lost vision in one eye in the incident. On December 15 last year, a protest against the CAA near Jamia turned violent, with demonstrators pelting stones at police and setting public buses and private vehicles on fire.

131,18-2-20,Jamia videos trigger Cong-BJP verbal jousting,"A major political row broke out on Monday over some videos clips showing purported thrashing of Jamia students in the university library by security personnel in December, with the BJP accusing the Congress of giving ""political colour"" to the incident and the Opposition party alleging that the Government was ""misusing"" the police force as its ""muscle men"".

The controversy is triggered by a 'video vs video' war with the Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC) releasing a CCTV footage of alleged ""police brutality"" in old reading hall, only to be countered by a 'leaked' Delhi Police Crime Branch video which purportedly showed some ""rioters"" hiding in the library on December 15. However, veracity of these videos could not be ascertained.

""Congress party is continuously supporting antisocial elements and those who indulge in violence. It raises voice against the security forces and police personnel of the country,"" BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said at a press conference here.

A 48-second video released by the JCC purportedly showed some seven to eight paramilitary and police personnel entering the Old Reading Hall and beating up students with batons. The paramilitary and police personnel are also seen covering their faces with handkerchiefs.

In a second video, running around 5.25 minutes, people are purportedly seen entering the university's library in a rush. Some have their face covered.

Rao asked why were students wearing masks and what were they studying with stones in their hands.

""Which academic discipline requires students to wear masks and hold stones while studying?"" he asked.

""The Congress party always choose to stand with those who are inimical to the country and rile up security forces,"" the BJP spokesperson added. Hitting out at the BJP, Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill said the ruling party had been caught ""red-handed"".

""They are guilty of misusing the police force as their muscle men. The BJP government is the accused and the culprit in the case of attack on innocent students. A court-monitored investigation is the need of the hour to probe this Jamia violence,"" he said.

Congress leader Kapil Sibal also lashed out at the government for alleged ""police brutality"", saying when policemen hide the truth and there is no dialogue with the youth, democracy will slowly weaken at its roots.

""Police brutality in Jamia library, December 15 (Tape). When policemen hide the truth. When there's no dialogue with the youth. When speeches are uncouth. When government becomes a sleuth. And data is full of 'jhooth' (lies). Slowly democracy will weaken at its roots,"" Sibal said in a tweet.

The video released by the JCC, a group comprising Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) students and alumni that was formed after the alleged police brutality on the campus on December 15, was also shared on Twitter by Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday.

Priyanka Gandhi had said that if no action is taken even after the video, then the government's intentions will stand exposed.

She had also accused Home Minister Amit Shah and the Delhi Police of ""lying"" that Jamia students were not beaten up inside the library.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jamia-videos-trigger-cong-bjp-verbal-jousting.html

133,18-2-20,BJP Govt disrespected women by arguing they don’t deserve command posts in Army: Cong,"The Congress on Monday said that the BJP Government disrespected Indian women by arguing in Supreme Court that women Army officers did not deserve command posts or permanent service because they were inferior to men.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attack on the Government came after the Supreme Court directed the Centre to grant permanent commission to all women officers in the Army within three months, terming the Centre’s argument of physiological limitations and social norms for denying them command posts “disturbing”.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on her part said the historic judgment of the Supreme Court has given new wings to the flight of women in the country. “Women are capable -- in the Army, in valor, in water, land and sky. This is a befitting reply to the prejudiced Modi Government, which is opposed to women’s power,” the Congress general secretary said.

Rahul Gandhi, in a tweet, also lauded the women for standing up and proving the Government wrong. “The Government disrespected every Indian woman, by arguing in the SC that women Army officers didn’t deserve command posts or permanent service because they were inferior to men,” he said.

He also attached a news report that said the apex court asked the government to grant permanent commission to women in the Army. A Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud said there will not be any absolute bar on giving them command postings.

It said women officers in the past have brought laurels to the country and change of mindset is required on the part of the Government to put an end to gender bias in armed forces.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-govt-disrespected-women-by-arguing-they-don---t-deserve-command-posts-in-army--cong.html
134,18-2-20,Bihar becomes 4th State to have bird tagging station,"Bihar has become the fourth State in the country to have a bird ringing (tagging) station wherein rings will be placed on legs of winged wonders to study their migration pattern, mortality, territoriality and other behaviour with the help of encrypted codes embedded in the attached tracking device.

The other three ringing stations are in Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Odisha.

A pact was inked between representatives of the Bihar Government and the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) at Gandhinagar in Gujarat on the first day of the opening of the CMS — COP13 (conservation of Migratory species — Conference of Parties) attended by over 2,500 delegates from 111 countries.

“This will be fourth ringing station in India and the first in North India. The pact is for five years in which our Government will dole out almost Rs 5 crore,” Bihar Principal Secretary, Environment and Forests, Dipak Kumar Singh said,

adding the station will monitor the areas where large no of migratory birds visit such as Nagi Nakti (in Jamui District), Kusheshwarsthan (in Darbhanga District), Barailla jheel (Vaishali), Kanwar lake (Begusarai).

He added it is also the first ringing station to be set up with the support of a State Government. The pact was signed by Director BNHS, Pradeep Apte and Bihar’s Chief Wildlife Warden, Prabhat Kumar Gupta.

The ringing station will be manned by trained scientists and other technical manpower from BNHS. For monitoring the migratory birds, rings are used which have chips containing the details about their origin, route taken by them etc.

Bhagalpur will be the main centre as the Ganges and its Diyara are favourite destination of migratory birds. Significantly, Bhagalpur is also one of the only three known breeding places of Greater Adjutant in the whole world, apart from Cambodia and Assam.

At these stations, rings are placed on legs of birds. The rings come with chips which help in tracking the origin of the birds and the route taken by these during migration.

An official from the BNHS explained that the ring’s encrypted BNHS code numbers ensure that wherever a ringed bird dies, is shot or is spotted with binoculars or photographed, the data can be sent back to the organisation and the bird’s migration is charted. BNHS has ringed over a million birds at different places in the Indian subcontinent, with the initiation of bird ringing study in India in 1950s.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bihar-becomes-4th-state-to-have-bird-tagging-station.html

The top court said the old practices of “human sacrifices” and ‘sati’ amounted to murder under law and could not be saved on ground of “essential religious practice”.

The Constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde, made these observations as it commenced hearing to deliberate upon the issues pertaining to the scope of freedom of religion as also of judicial scrutiny into “essential religious practices” of separate “religious denominations”.

The Bench is also examining the issue whether a person, who does not belong to a particular faith, can file a PIL questioning the religious practice of another religion or sect of a religion. The questions have arisen out of a judgement in the Sabarimala case.

“The IPC can be read as the guard against the practice of human sacrifices, because it is murder under the IPC. Likewise ‘sati’ also amounted to murder...

140,18-2-20,HRD to pursue action against Prof Jena,"nWith the electioneering process over in the national Capital and Arvind Kejriwal back at the helm, the Union HRD Ministry is now planning to pursue the initiation of administrative action against a former Central Government employee, currently working as Professor and Dean at Ambedkar University Delhi (AUD), falling under the purview of the Delhi Government.

The don, Professor Sitanshu Shekar Jena, was held guilty of sexual harassment at workplace by HRD Ministry’s Internal Complaints Committee during his tenure as Chairman of National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS). Subsequently, IGNOU, parent cadre, had punished him by reducing his pay band and increments.

There are allegations in the complaints to the HRD Ministry and the Delhi Government that Jena concealed the punishment fact when applying for the post at AUD. Further, he also did not inform his parent department while applying to AUD. And to facilitate his appointment in AUD, he applied for VRS from IGNOU.

Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, as Education Minister in his last tenure, had initiated a probe a year ago and a report was to be submitted within seven days but which hasn’t been done so far. The inordinate delay in the proceedings has now led the HRD Ministry to pursue the matter as it has received complaints against the AUD Professor.

Jena was appointed by the Delhi Government as Professor and Dean in the AUD School of Vocational Studies almost two years ago. A senior official said now that the elections are over and the Delhi Government is in place, the matter will be expedited and taken up in the first meeting of Education Ministry.

For his part, Jena said he was not aware of the complaints and such matters against him. “I am not a Central Government employee anymore as I have already taken VRS from IGNOU three years ago. When the case, which is being talked about now, has already been settled then no controversy stands,” Jena told The Pioneer over phone.

Under the Government rules, sexual harassment invokes a major punishment which includes dismissal from service. IGNOU recently took strict action against an official found guilty of sexual harassment by immediately suspending him and then awarding a major punishment.

“As per the allegation of manipulation against Dr Jena, it was also stated that he was given undue favour by awarding a minor punishment and that too retrospectively which is against rules. Jena also has an inquiry of financial irregularity pending against him when he applied. The Delhi Government probe is expected to look into the role of AUD officials too,” sources said at the HRD Ministry.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/hrd-to-pursue-action-against-prof-jena.html

The ED claimed that the action under Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) has led to detection of “huge evasion” of customs duty, GST as well as Income Tax.

“The ED received reliable input that Maharaja Jewellers (proprietor Tara Chand Soni), Bhagwati Jewellers (owner Ram Gopal Soni) and Ladiwala Associates (owner Honey Ladiwala) of Jaipur were purchasing smuggled gold bars from Harsh Bothra of Chennai and Banka Bullions Pvt. Ltd etc,” the agency said in a statement.

While acting on the information, it was found that various individuals were involved in smuggling of gold bars and subsequent dispatch of those to Jaipur. Gold bars were mainly arriving in Jaipur via Kolkata and had high purity level, it said.

The suspects used to remove the foreign mark of manufacturer or bank engraved or embossed on the gold bars and then smuggle those into the country, the ED said. These bars were then dispatched to various domestic markets by different modes of transportation to evade action from the law enforcement agencies.

The accused jewellers did not account for jewellery manufactured from smuggled gold and illegal funds generated were then transferred through hawala agents based in these cities, the agency said.

Hawala denotes the illegal manner of transferring funds by skirting banking channels and dealing in cash through agents.

“Searches at various premises in Jaipur, Kolkata and Chennai resulted in seizure of unaccounted Indian and foreign currency worth Rs 3.75 crore, gold bar and jewellery weighing 26.97 kg and silver weighing 12.22 kg along with incriminating documents.

In a strongly worded statement, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said Erdogan’s remarks reflected neither an understanding of history nor of the conduct of diplomacy and that they will have strong implications on India’s ties with Turkey. MEA Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said India rejected the repeated attempts by Turkey to justify the cross-border terrorism “practised so blatantly” by Pakistan.

In an address to a joint session of Pakistan’s Parliament on Friday, Erdogan compared the “struggle” of Kashmiri people with that of the fight by Turkish people against foreign domination during the World War I, and threw his weight behind Islamabad on the Kashmir issue.

“India has made a strong demarche with the Turkish government on the remarks made by President Erdogan on the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir during his recent visit to Islamabad. These remarks reflect neither an understanding of history nor of the conduct of diplomacy,” Kumar said in a statement.

He said the Turkish President’s remarks “distorted” events of the past to advance a “narrow minded” view of the present. “This recent episode is but one more example of a pattern of Turkey interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. India finds that completely unacceptable,” Kumar said.

In the letter to the President, the citizens urged the Central Government to look into the ongoing protests with all seriousness and safeguard the democratic institutions of the country, and take stern action against those people behind them.

The citizens, including11 former judges of different high courts, 24 retired IAS officers, 11 former Indian Foreign Service officers,16 retired IPS and 18 former Lieutenant Generals, said “fear” is being spread across the length and breadth of India which appears to be “motivated and with a sinister design” to harm the nation.

They said the campaign is being carried out in a “coordinated manner” leading to violent protests in which public and private property has been destroyed.

The citizens said there has been a “false and nefarious narrative” about the recently enacted legislations like the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the idea of the National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

They said that while the CAA has been enacted, the idea of NPR and NRC which has been a part of the Indian discourse since Independence remains to be implemented.

“This (protests) has grave security implications and does not bode well for our motherland.

“These protests, while ostensibly claiming to oppose the policies of Government of India, are in effect designed to destroy the very fabric of this country and harm the nation’s unity and integrity,” they said.

The citizens claimed that they strongly feel that there is also an external dimension to the disturbances being created.

According to CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014, facing religious persecution there will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship.

145,18-2-20,MHA-appointed panel suggests 1951 cut-off for ILP in Assam,"Union Home Ministry appointed committee has suggested that 1951 should be the cut-off year for defining the indigenous people of Assam and introduction of the Inner Line Permit (ILP) to control the movement of people from outside the State.

The committee has also suggested two formulas for the reservation of seats for the indigenous people in the Assam Assembly and Lok Sabha constituencies of the State, including 67 per cent quota for them.

The high-level committee was set up by the Ministry to suggest ways to provide constitutional safeguards to Assam’s indigenous people. The sources said the 13-member panel, headed by Justice (Retd) Biplab Kumar Sharma, finalised its report last week conveyed to the Home Ministry that it was ready to submit it to Union Home Minister Amit Shah and sought an appointment with him. The report is expected to be submitted this week itself.

The committee, according to the sources, unanimously recommended that those who were residents of Assam in 1951 and their descendants, irrespective of community, caste, language, religion or heritage, will be considered as indigenous people of the state.

Besides, the panel suggested that the ILP should be introduced in Assam so that movement of people from outside the State could be controlled.

As per the rules, outsiders have to take permission from designated authorities before entering the areas where the ILP is applicable.

In case of State Government jobs, the committee recommended 80 per cent reservation for the locals. A number of other recommendations were also given for the protection and growth of Assamese and other indigenous languages.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mha-appointed-panel-suggests-1951-cut-off-for-ilp-in-assam.html

Tweeting this message he also said, “A historic decision to allow women in field operations came earlier when the then Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that women will be inducted into the Military Police. The recruitment process has started in 2019. The plan was to recruit women in roles ranging from probing crime cases to assisting the army in field operations wherever required,” Raksha Mantri said.

“There have been instances where certain women officers have been in the job for nearly 20 years, while SSC term terminates in 14 years. In 2019, the Defence Ministry granted a permanent commission to women in all 10 branches of the Indian Army, including Signal Corps, intelligence, aviation, engineering, service corps and ordinance corps,” Singh added.

Before 2016, women made up just 2.5 per cent of India’s armed forces, working in mainly non-combat roles. As of January 2019, 3.89 per cent of the army personnel comprised women, while 6.7 per cent of the navy and 13.28 per cent of the air force personnel respectively were women as of June 2019. As of June 2019, women were inducted in all branches of the Indian Air Force, with terms and conditions for women officers being issued from time to time.

Singh said, “The Government is working to strengthen the ‘Stree Shakti’ in our Armed Forces and we stand committed to move forward in this direction.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/rajnath-singh-welcomes-sc-ruling.html

Section 62 of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019 mentions a fresh delimitation exercise to redraw J&K’s parliamentary and Assembly constituencies.

According to the EC, following a request from the Government, Arora named Chandra as his nominee for the proposed commission. Besides, two retired EC officials — Shingara Ram and RK Srivastava — have been engaged to help in the delimitation process. Both have contributed in the past delimitation exercise.

Delimitation of constituencies is necessary for elections, and the process could take several months or even a year.

The total population would be divided over the 114 seats to get an average number of electors per constituency.

The boundaries of the constituencies would then be drawn while ensuring that administrative units are not split as far as possible.

As per law, 24 seats of the Assembly continue to

remain vacant as they fall under Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).

“...the number of seats in the Legislative Assembly of Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir shall be increased from 107 to 114, and delimitation of the constituencies may be determined by the Election Commission in the manner hereinafter provided,” according to the J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019.

The law also said the Lok Sabha will have five seats from the UT of J&K, while Ladakh will have one seat “On and from the appointed day, there shall be allocated five seats to the successor UT of J&K and one seat to UT of Ladakh, in the House of the People, and the First Schedule to the Representation of the People Act, 1950 (43 of 1950) shall be deemed to be amended accordingly,” it said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cec-nominates-sushil-chandra-for-proposed-j-k-delimitation-commission.html

Since these by-polls are going to take place on party lines the mainstream political parties are keen on taking the plunge to test political waters at the grass roots.

Addressing a press conference here at party headquarters in Jammu, Jammu & Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee Chief, GA Mir told reporters, ""The Congress party is ready to participate in the Panchayat by-polls, as they are being held on party lines, but it is not possible for them to contest the same by remaining indoors"".

He said, those who want to participate in the polls even they are not being allowed to roam around freely and meet people. ""They are being prevented to visit their constituencies and carry out political activity"", he alleged.

Seeking immediate release of political leaders, detained since August 5, and freedom to campaign without any roadblocks and security restrictions, GA Mir appealed to the J&K administration to facilitate their participation in the polls by creating conducive atmosphere otherwise they won't be able to participate in these polls.

He said, ""the Government is compelling us to boycott the polls but we will not boycott them"". ""Even if we are not allowed by the Government to participate in the polls i appeal to the common voters to expose evil designs of BJP and elect good candidates to fully empower them at the grass roots"".

152,18-2-20,BJP likely to move pro-CAA resolution in Karnataka Assembly,"The ruling BJP in Karnataka is Likely to push for a resolution in favour of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) during the ongoing Assembly session, top sources said on Monday.

The resolution is expected to be moved towards the end of the special discussion on the Constitution, scheduled for March 2 and 3, the sources said.

The move is bound to face stiff resistance from opposition parties - the Congress and JDS - in the Assembly.

Assembly Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri has decided to hold a special discussion on the Constitution on the two days to commemorate 70 years of the adoption of the Constitution.

Though the Speaker has expressed hope that the discussion will focus on the Constitution and legislators would take part in it rising above party politics, there are apprehensions in some quarters that issues like CAA and NRC may figure in the debate.

Gujarat in January passed a resolution, congratulating Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah for securing the passage of the CAA, amid opposition from the Congress.Several opposition-ruled states like Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan and West Bengal have passed anti-CAA resolutions in their state assemblies.

Joining the ranks of anti-CAA states, the Telangana government has also decided to pass a resolution in the assembly against the act. Like in other parts of the county, Karnataka too has witnessed a series of pro and anti-CAA protests and demonstrations.

On December one, an anti-CAA protest turned violent in the coastal city of Mangaluru, resulting in the death of two in police firing. According to the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities, who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014, and facing religious persecution there, would not be treated as illegal immigrants, but given Indian citizenship.

The Shahs, always vocal about their opinions, say they are firm in their belief that the educated young give them hope in troubling times.

The couple was speaking at an event titled ""India My Valentine"" here on Sunday.

According to Ratna Pathak, the ""khalbali"" (churning) she saw in the 60s and 70s is back but the young and educated give her hope.

""During that time everyone was thinking about the progress of India. How to make the nation ours, what kind of nation it should be. Because my family has always been associated with performing arts, we used to have discussions on these topics,"" she said at the event featuring musical performances, stand-up comedy acts and speeches to celebrate love and unity in the country.

Over a dozen artistes, including Naseeruddin Shah, Vishal Bhardwaj, Rekha Bhardwaj and Swanand Kirkire, came together on one stage at the event.

Ratna Pathak, the daughter of the late actor Dina Pathak, said questions related to nation building were on everyone's mind in the decades past. Now, there is ""a possibility of the nation breaking, changing"", she said.

""The 'khalbali', the brainstorming of that time, can be seen reflected today. Of course, things have changed, the situation is extremely serious. What I saw and heard today, what I see around me, it definitely increases hope.

Never before has India had so many young, educated people alive at one time. It's making a difference and we are seeing it all over the country,"" she said.

The churn is not limited to Shaheen Bagh or Mumbai Bagh but spread across, she said, referring to the anti-CAA protests in several places in the country.

""Again, art is showing the way. This kind of 'khalbali' is producing such wonderful writing, music, performances,"" she said.

Naseeruddin Shah said he can't help but wonder about the current situation when he looks around at the state of the nation.

""At a time when a lot of us are grappling to understand what's going on around us, I think I'm not alone in agonising over a question: whether all this was always latent and has finally burst forth, not being able to contained any longer.

""Or has there been in the last decade a complete change in our country... I'm not a social scientist, so I don't know the answer.""

The actor then read selections from Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's ""The Discovery of India"" and said the book can shed some light.

""May be it'll show you the direction. I've also in these times felt the need to re-examine, rediscover what it is that is unique about this country, what it is that has always been our pride and has won the admiration of the entire world,"" he added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/young--educated-people-give-hope-in-troubling-times--ratna--naseeruddin.html

Delhi’s top diplomat was the guest of honour as EU foreign ministers met in Brussels with an eye to renewing relations and boosting trade with the south Asian giant.

EU president Ursula von der Leyen’s new Commission wants to give Brussels a more “geopolitical role” and as part of that hopes to host a March summit with powerful Indian leader Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“India and the European Union share a lot of things,” said Europe’s high representative for foreign policy Josep Borrell, citing climate change, the digital revolution and rise of China as shared challenges.

Jaishankar, standing by Borrell, noted that the new government in India and the new commission in Brussels are “both quite fresh” and that they hoped to take relations to a “new level”.

He said he hoped the lunch talks would confirm the “strategic partnership.”

Taken together, the EU member states are Delhi’s biggest trade partner, with India’s imports and exports to and from the bloc each representing about 45 billion euros a year ($49 billion).

158,18-2-20,TN CM blames extremist organisations for riot-like situation,"Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami blamed various Islamist organizations for the riot like situation prevailing in some parts of the State and complimented the Police for showing restraint despite severe provocation from trouble makers.

Making a statement in the Assembly on Monday, Palaniswami said that there were no untoward incidents anywhere in the State despite the demonstrators staging rallies without permission from the police. “Many policemen including officers were grievously injured in the stone pelting by demonstrators when they were asked to disperse from the venue of protest.

The Social Democratic Party of India, Popular Front of India, Towheed Jamaath and some Islamic political parties were hand in glove with the trouble makers.

Many policemen injured in stone pelting have been admitted to various government hospitals in the city,” said the Chief Minister.

He said though nearly 100 trouble makers who went on a rampage were taken into custody by the police and put in various marriage halls in Chennai, all of them were released after filing charges against them.

“A fake news spread by the forces behind the agitation that an old man died in the police action aggravated the situation. It was found that the old man who was ailing for some time breathed his last at his house which is far away from the spot. Nobody has been injured in the lathi-charge by police,” said Palaniswami.

He disclosed that all those who fomented trouble in front of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant against the commissioning of the plant and who led the sit in at Marina Beach in early 2017 against the Supreme Court ban on Jallikattu were seen participating in the demonstrations at Chennai.

“Right now, a sit in is going on at the Washermenpet street with 150 persons shouting slogans against CAA. We have deployed sufficient police force to prevent the situation from going out of control,” the chief minister announced.

The DMK and other opposition parties led by M K Stalin staged a walk out claiming that they were not content with the statement made by the Chief Minister.

“We want Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly to pass a resolution asking the Centre to negate the CAA. Nothing less that that would make us happy,” he told reporters outside the assembly.

This is the first time the Tamil Nadu Government named the Islamist organisations and their role in the anti-CAA agitations across the State. Sunday night saw the Chief Minister holding a high level meeting which was attended among others by the Chief Secretary, Home Secretary, State Police Chief and heads of various intelligence wings.

“The Government has clear picture and evidence about the role of various political organisations in the demonstrations being held in the State .

We will come out with more details in the days to come,” said a senior source in Fort Saint George (Tamil Nadu Government’s seat of power, the secretariat).

The Washermenpet sit in on Monday witnessed a novel protest by the Islamists as they held a marriage in the venue and offered sumptuous lunch to those who staged the rally.

It may be remembered that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, had told the Kerala Legislative Assembly that extremist organizations like PFI and SDPI had infiltrated into the anti-CAA agitations staged in the State under directions from religious clergy and the Mahuls.

Since then, the anti-CAA agitations promoted by the CPI(M) has come to an end in Kerala.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/tn-cm-blames-extremist-organisations-for-riot-like-situation.html

It is the first time that tax, announced in the State's Budget tabled in the Assembly on February 6, will be levied on the popular Goan beverage made from fermented and distilled juice of cashew apples, or from coconuts.

Momo is the mythical king of carnivals and is chosen by the state's tourism department, with Sardinha getting to head the float parade for the second time, the first being in 2016.

""The Budget announcement about tax on feni will result in prices going up. It will affect the tourism industry in a big way,"" he said.

On the first day of the Carnival, which will culminate on February 25,

King Momo issues a decree asking people to ""eat, drink and be merry"", with Sardinha adding that ""when we say drink, we mean drink responsibly"".

He called for a ban on drugs as well as electronic dance music festivals and other events that promote this vice, pointing out that three youngsters lost their lives during one such festival recently.

Queried on the ban on floats making statements on political issues like the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act, he said the Carnival was a festival to celebrate unity so ""we should avoid controversial topics which can lead to hatred"".

The organisers of the Carnival have already issued a warning that any float having messages on such issues as CAA would be disqualified.

""CAA is an act due to which people are fighting. We are trying to promote social harmony. Thus, the government disallowing CAA protesters is a good move,"" he added.

161,18-2-20,EPS completes 3 yrs in CM office,"nWhen he was sworn in as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu on February 17, 2017, even Edappadi Palaniswami would not have thought that he will survive in the chair at least for one year.

Why the post of Chief Minister was thrusted on him was because of a Supreme Court verdict which upheld the judgment of the Special Court in Bangalore which had sentenced VK Sasikala , the then general secretary of the AIADMK and her two close relations to four years imprisonment in the Disproportionate Asset Case in which the former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa was the prime accused.

Since Jayalalithaa went to meet her maker on December 5, 2016, she was saved from the ignominy of being seen as a convict marching to the Parappana Agrahara central Jail near Bangalore. Sasikala, who had been elected “unanimously” as the Chief Minister after the ouster of O Panneerselvam, instead of driving down to the Centenary Hall of Madras University for the oath taking ceremony had to travel all the way to Bangalore to surrender before the jail officials on her day of reckoning.

But before proceeding to Bangalore to server her term, Sasikala had nominated Edappadi Palaniswami, her long term confidante, as the Chief Minister.

To keep Palaniswamy under a tight leash, Sasikala had also nominated TTV Dhinakaran as the deputy general secretary of the party, much to the shock of the AIADMK cadre. Dhinakaran was a non-entity in the party when Jayalalithaa was alive but had managed to sneak into Veda Nilayam (Jayalalithaa’s privare residence in Poes Garden) after Amma was admitted to Apollo Hospital in Chennai in an unconscious condition in September 2016.

With Dhinakaran breathing down his neck on a round-the-clock basis, Palaniswamy had to perform a tight rope walk in governance and the party.

No one had given him a chance of survival and things worsened further when Dhinakaran decided to contest the by election from R K Nagar assembly constituency, a seat held by Jayalalithaa at the time of her demise. By the time Dhinakaran won from R K Nagar constituency, Palaniswamy had joined hands with arch rival O Panneerselvam and the duo succeeded in easing out the Mannargudi Mafia (as Sasikala and her relations were known in Tamil Nadu) from the AIADMK.

Though there were tense moments about the majority of the AIADMK in the House as some of the MLAs mdecided to cast their lots with the Dhinakaran faction, Palaniswamy has proved that he is a wonderful survivor. The setback the AIADMK had suffered in the Lok Sabha election of 2019 is long forgotten as the party has wrested two assembly seats in by-elections held recently.

“More than Palaniswamy, it is Stalin who is tense and nervous now. The DMK has been out of power in the State since 2011 and from the Centre since 2013. If he fails to win the 2021 assembly election, it is going to be the end of the road for Stalin,” said T Ramakrishnan, author and commentator.

Tamil Nadu is seeing a resurgence in industrialisation and development over the last two years thanks to the silent manoeuvring by Palaniswamy from the Secretariat.

Other than the anti-CAA agitation, the Chief Minister has no major issues haunting his Government for the time being.

164,18-2-20,Guj Cong warns of protest at stadium,"Unhappy over a recent Supreme Court order on reservation, the Gujarat Congress on Monday threatened to stage a protest on February 24 outside the newly built cricket stadium here where US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take part in a mega event.

On February 24, the stadium at Motera would be inaugurated by Trump and Modi, and the two leaders will also address a gathering on the occasion. The opposition party said it will not hesitate to hold a protest against the BJP outside the stadium if the Centre fails to take appropriate decision over the apex court's ruling on reservation in jobs for SC/ST communities.

The Gujarat Cong on Monday organised a 'Save Constitution' rally in the Sarangpur area over the last week's SC judgement which says states are not bound to provide reservation in appointments and there is no fundamental right to claim quota in promotions.

The Congress demanded that the NDA Govt file a review petition against the SC ruling or bring a Constitution amendment to nullify the order.

""The Congress will not let the rights of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Castes taken away. No one can snatch reservation rights till the Congress is there.

""This protest is just the beginning. In coming days, we will reach out to people in small towns and villages.

If needed, we will hold protests at Motera and Delhi,"" Gujarat Congress president Amit Chavda said while speaking at the rally.

In his address to party workers, All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for Gujarat Rajiv Satav said the BJP has always ""conspired"" against the marginalised sections and tried to take away reservation rights.

""Both the BJP and the RSS are trying to remove reservation since many years now. It is their agenda to remove reservation, which was introduced by our great leaders so that the marginalised sections of the society get equal opportunities,"" said Satav.

The rally was attended by several senior Congress leaders and MLAs, including former party state unit chiefs Bharatsinh Solanki and Arjun Modhwadia.

MLAs Shailesh Parmar, Himmatsinh Patel, Lakha Bharwad, Kanti Kharadi, Babu Vaja, Gyasuddin Shaikh, C J Chavda and Vimal Chudasama, among others, also took part in the rally.

From Sarangpur, party leaders went to collector office and handed over a memorandum asking the ruling BJP to file a review petition against the SC ruling or bring a Constitution amendment to nullify the quota order.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/guj-cong-warns-of-protest-at-stadium.html

168,18-2-20,RBI Guv: Govt must continue reforms; green shoots of recovery need to sustain,"Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on Monday said the government will have to use structural reforms to revive demand and support the sagging economy, and green shoots of the recovery visible now need to be sustained to pull India out of its worst slowdown in 11 years.

In an interview with PTI, he said the fallout of the outbreak of coronavirus in China needs to be closely monitored by “every policymaker” to tailor a swift response.

While Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget for 2020-21 and recent steps have created a facilitating eco-system for reviving demand and consumption, it is necessary to undertake land and labour reforms, bring efficiencies in agri marketing and focus on skill development, he said.

Das said the RBI saw an imminent slowdown in growth early in 2019 and used the space that was opened up by the moderation in inflation to cut interest rates on five consecutive occasions.

He cited global trade and business uncertainties together with sluggish domestic demand leading to lower capacity utilisation at factories and twin balance sheet crisis of rising non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans on the one hand, and heavily indebted corporates on the other, for the slowdown in the economy.

“There are certain positive evidences visible ... Things slightly picking up but we have to wait and see whether these positive trends are sustaining themselves and we have to see how durable they are,” he said.

He refused to say if the growth slowing down to 4.5 per cent in July-September was the bottom of the pit that the economy can see. “As I have said there are evidences of positive developments. But we have to see how durable are these positive developments before we pass a judgment that from here on it is an upward trajectory.”

“By and large, if you look at our projection which we have given, things should start improving in the next financial year. For next financial year, we have projected 6 per cent of GDP growth against 5 per cent for the fiscal that ends in March.”

In its update on Global Macro Outlook, Moody’s Investors Service said India’s economy has decelerated rapidly over the last 2 years and economic recovery is likely to be ‘shallow’.

“While the economy may well begin to recover in the current quarter, we expect any recovery to be slower than we had previously expected. Accordingly, we have revised our growth forecasts to 5.4 per cent for 2020 and 5.8 per cent for 2021, down from our previous projections of 6.6 per cent and 6.7 per cent respectively,” Moody’s said.

Moody’s growth projections are based on calendar year and as per its estimates, India’s GDP grew 5 per cent in 2019.

The rating agency had in November 2019 projected economic growth in 2020 and 2021 at 6.6 per cent and 6.7 per cent respectively. In its latest update, Moody’s said the reduction in India’s growth rate reflects domestic challenges rather than external factors.

For the first time, facilities have been provided for digital pre-tagging of baggages of Haj pilgrims, he said.

Linking SIM card to the mobile app ensures Haj pilgrims immediately get the latest information regarding Haj in Mecca-Medina on their mobile phone, he said.

Haj Group Organisers (HGOs) have also been connected with the 100 per cent digital system which has ensured transparency in their functioning and this has also led to better facilities to Indian Haj pilgrims. A portal (http://haj.Nic.In/pto) for Haj Group Organisers has been developed. It contains details of HGOs and their packages, he said.

171,18-2-20,NCP mulls SIT probe,"Upset with the Shiv Sena over Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s decision to let the NIA take over the investigations into the 2018 Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case, the ruling NCP is keen on setting up a parallel inquiry into the case by a Special Investigation Team (SIT). It is seeking a legal opinion in the matter before going ahead with its plan.

Four days after Uddhav overruled its reservations on the issue and decided to let the NIA take over the probe into the Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case, NCP – at a meeting of the party’s Ministers in the Shiv Sena-MVA Govt -convened by its chief Sharad Pawar on Monday – decided to explore the possibility of ordering a parallel inquiry by the SIT.

Talking to media persons after the meeting, State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said: “The Maharashtra Govt may have let the NIA carry out the investigations in the Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case to the NIA.

But we will seek a legal opinion if we can institute an SIT to investigate the case”.

“There is insistence within the NCP to set up an SIT probe into the case – independent of the one being done by the NIA. We will also consult the chief minister in this regard,” Deshmukh said.

If the NCP—which holds the Home portfolio in the state – decides to go ahead with the SIT probe into the Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case, it will send a clear cut message to its ruling ally –Shiv Sena that the chief minister – can ill-afford to “overrule” his party’s allies in the MVA on crucial matters like the one in the case. Simultaneously, the NCP is bound to trigger a confrontation between the State and Centre over a parallel probe on the Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case. Monday’s development should be seen in the context of the statement made by Pawar on Friday last, disapproving Uddhav’s decision let the NIA take over the investigations into the 2018 Bhima Koregaon case.

Expressing his displeasure to the chief minister’s decision, Pawar had said: : “Under the Constitution, maintaining law & order is a state subject. In the first place, it was improper on the Centre to encroach upon the rights of the state and take over the case from the Pune police.

It was much more improper on the state government’s part to support the Centre’s move (to ask the NIA to take over the case).

It may be recalled that on January 25 --a day after the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) handed over the investigations in the Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case to the NIA, a miffed Pawar had charged that the ruling BJP – with an acute fear of being exposed in the case – had hurriedly handed over the investigations to the NIA.

“The re-investigations are necessary in the case, because the Centre’s move has aroused suspicions...The Centre might have apprehended that if a re-investigation is ordered into the case, the previous BJP government and its hand-picked officials might be exposed.

Only an independent probe will bring out truth in the case,” Pawar had said,

The investigations handed over to the NIA relate to the cases registered against 23 activists in connection with the violence that erupted on January 1, 2018 at a gathering of thousands of Dalits at Bhima-Koregaon in Pune district who were celebrating 200th anniversary of January 1, 1818 victory of British troops over Peshwa Bajirao at Bhima Koregaon in Pune district, and the provocative speeches delivered by the activists at an Elgaar Parishad held in Pune on December 31, 2017, a day before the celebrations at Bhima Koregaon. Nine of the accused hare been booked for their alleged links with the CPI-Maoist links.

The police had arrested ten CPI (Maoist) activists in two batches in connection with the Elgaar Parishad-cum- Bhima-Koregaon riots case. They were among the 15 activists against whom the police had registered cases. The five are still absconding.

All of the accused have been booked for serious offences under unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), 117 ( abetting commission of offence), 120-b ( conspiracy) read with 34 (common intention), 121, 121 (A) (Waging or attempting to wage a war, or abetting waging of war, against the Government of India) 124A (sedition), 153 –A (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot..) and 505-1b (statements conducing public mischief) of Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Among other things, they have been charged with involvement in a conspiracy to kill Prime Minister Narendra Modi and overthrow the democratically elected Government in the country.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ncp-mulls-sit-probe.html

Upping the ante over a video clip containing Indurikar Maharaj’s questionable claim that has gone viral on social media, MANS has written to Ahmednagar’s District Police Superintendent and Civil Surgeon, making a strong case for booking the controversial preacher under the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act.

In the video, Indurikar Maharaj is seen telling a large gathering of his followers that if a man has intercourse with a woman on an even date, a male child is born, while he does it on an odd date, a girl child is born.

""If intercourse is done at inauspicious time, the child that is born would bring a bad name to the family. If the timing (of intercourse) is missed, the quality of the output (child) will be sub-standard,"" Indurikar Maharaj also heard telling his followers, at a religious gathering held in a village in Ahmednagar district last week.

Objecting to Indurikar Maharaj’s claims which he described as ""scientific, outlandish, irresponsible"", ""insulting to women"", and against the law and Constitution"", MANS executive president Avinash Patil—in his representation to the district police superintendent and civil surgeon – said that the controversial preacher had violated the PCPNDT Act, which was enacted with an aim of stopping female foeticide and curb the declining sex ratio in the country.

The PCPNDT Act prohibits determination and disclosure of the sex of foetus . It also prohibits any advertisements relating to pre-natal determination of sex and prescribes punishment for its contravention. The person who contravenes the provisions of this Act is punishable with imprisonment and fine.

In his representation, Patil said that Indurikar Maharaj, through his baseless exhortations to his followers, had also violated the anti- Black Magic Act, Patil alleged.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/action-sought-against-marathi-preacher.html

179,18-2-20,Vodafone Idea's Birla meets Anshu Prakash on relief,"With the government mulling the possibilities of invoking bank guarantees of the telcos to recover the statutory dues, Vodafone Idea chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla on Tuesday met Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash on the AGR payment issue after paying Rs 2,500 crore on Monday.

The details are not known as none of the sides -- government or VIL spoke on it, but sources said Birla has raised the ability on sustainability of Vodafone Idea again with DoT in view of the immediate large-scale payments dues on AGR without any relief and also sought non-invokation of bank guarantee.

According to DoT calculations Vodafone Idea owes Rs 53,000 crore. The company is currently self assessing the DoT demand. The company has said it would pay another Rs 1,000 crore this week. On Monday, Supreme Court refused to accept telecom firm Vodafone Idea's proposal to pay Rs 2,500 crore by Tuesday and Rs 1,000 crore by Friday against adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues and that no coercive action be taken against it.

The company had urged the court that the bank guarantee deposited with the government by Vodafone Idea should also not be encashed. Birla has maintained that without relief on the AGR payout, it may not be possible to continue as a going concern.

Tata Teleservices, which had sold its mobile business to Airtel, has made a payment of Rs 2,197 crore to the government against estimated dues of around Rs 14,000 crore. But there are reports of Tatas having made the full and final payment.

180,18-2-20,99 more cases on Japan cruise ship: Media,"An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said on Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry.

That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately.

It was also not clear whether the figures included 14 US citizens who tested positive for the virus but were allowed to board evacuation flights home.

The Diamond Princess vessel moored in Yokohama near Tokyo has become the second-largest cluster of coronavirus cases outside the epicentre in China.

Passengers have been largely confined to quarters since February 5 with only brief and occasional breaks to take air on deck — with face masks.

The quarantine period is over on Wednesday but many countries have decided to repatriate their citizens after an alarming climb in cases on board.

The US was the first country to evacuate its citizens from the ship but Australia, Canada, Italy and Hong Kong have indicated they will follow suit.

On land, cases in Japan have risen to 65, with authorities warning that the outbreak is entering a “new phase” and advising people to avoid large gatherings.

182,18-2-20,Donald Trump calls for Russia to stop backing Syrian ‘atrocities’,"President Donald Trump has called for Russia to end its support for the Syrian regime’s “atrocities” as he expressed US concern over violence in the Idlib region, the White House said.

In a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Trump “expressed concern over the violence in Idlib, Syria and... Conveyed the United States’ desire to see an end to Russia’s support for the Assad regime’s atrocities.”

President Bashar al-Assad’s forces made new gains Sunday in their offensive against the last major rebel bastion in the northwest region of Idlib.

Backed by Russian air strikes, Syrian government forces have kept up the assault in Idlib and areas of neighbouring Aleppo and Latakia provinces since December.

On Sunday, after clashes and air strikes, regime forces “were in control of all the villages and small towns around Aleppo for the first time since 2012,” the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

The Russian-backed offensive has triggered the largest wave of displacement in Syria’s civil war, with 800,000 people fleeing since December, the United Nations says.

In the Saturday phone call with Erdogan, Trump also “reiterated that continued foreign interference in Libya would only serve to worsen the situation.”

Libya has been mired in chaos since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising killed longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi, with two rival administrations vying for power.

186,18-2-20,Pradhan says does not believe top court’s AGR ruling applies to non-telecom PSUs,"Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday said he believes non-telecom PSUs are not covered by the Supreme Court order that asked telecom licence holders to pay statutory dues after including non-telecom revenues.

Following the October 24 Supreme Court ruling that non-telecom revenues of telecom firms such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea should be included for considering payments of government dues, the telecom department sought Rs 1.83 lakh crore from gas utility GAIL India Ltd, about Rs 48,500 crore from OIL, Rs 21,953.65 crore from Power Grid Corp and Rs 15,020 crore from Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd.

The Government’s demand from such companies was many times more than their net worth.

“The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has served notice to Government oil companies due to some communication gap. We have placed our side after doing all legal consultations,” Pradhan told reporters here.

He went on to state that neither of the public sector undertakings (PSUs) slapped with huge demand has any core work in the telecom business.

“Telecom is not the core business of either GAIL or OIL or PowerGrid,” he said, adding that they came into the telecom business thinking of multi-utility for internal consumption.

“The overall comment by the Supreme Court, I believe, these two-three PSUs should not come under its ambit... We are holding talks with DoT,” he said.

Following the Supreme Court ruling of October 24, 2019 that non-telecom revenues should be included for considering payments of government dues by firms holding any sort of telecom license, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) slapped Rs 1.47 lakh crore demand on mobile phone operators such as Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd, and another Rs 2.7 lakh crore on non-telecom firms.

Non-telecom firms such as OIL, GAIL and PowerGrid filed a clarificatory petition on the applicability of the October 24 order on them, but the apex court on February 14 asked them to approach the appropriate authority.

In an interview with PTI, Das said so far no red flags have been raised but the central bank continues to monitor the situation closely.

The Supreme Court last week rejected a plea by mobile carriers such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd for extension in the payment schedule and asked them to deposit an estimated Rs 1.47 lakh crore in past dues for spectrum and licences by March 17.

However, one will have to wait till March 16 — the payment deadline — before the picture gets clear, they said.

After facing the Supreme Court’s ire over non-compliance with its AGR order, the telecom department is pressing for the payment of dues by the telcos.

“The fiscal arithmetic will change significantly post March 16, 2020, (the date till which telecom companies have to pay their AGR dues). If we assume that the government is able to collect Rs 1.20 lakh crore through AGR dues, the fiscal deficit for

190,18-2-20,Market ends lower for 3rd day as macroeconomic worries persist,"Domestic equities clocked losses for a third session in a row on Monday as worries over economic slowdown and financial impact of coronavirus outbreak continued to play in the minds of investors.

At the closing bell, the BSE gauge Sensex was down 202.05 points, or 0.49 per cent, at 41,055.69. The index swung about 390 points during the session.

The NSE barometer Nifty fell 67.75 points or 0.56 per cent to close at 12,045.80.

On the Sensex chart, ONGC led the fall with a 3.20 per cent drop after the company posted halving of its December quarter net profit.

Other top laggards on the index were Sun Pharma, NTPC, Bajaj Auto and HDFC -- slipping as much as 2.37 per cent.

On the other hand, Titan, Nestle, TCS, Kotak Bank and Tata Steel emerged as major gainers, rising as much as 1.86 per cent.

Of the Sensex constituents, 19 closed in the red and 11 in the green.

Sectorally, oil and gas index fell the most (2.39 per cent), followed by utilities (2.07 per cent), power (1.76 per cent), realty (1.53 per cent) and healthcare (1.50 per cent).

In contrast, consumer durables, IT and teck emerged as gainers.

In the broader market, BSE Midcap and smallcap indices fell 0.91 per cent and 1.02 per cent, respectively. Further weakening investor sentiment, Moody’s Investors Service has slashed India’s growth forecast to 5.4 per cent for 2020 from 6.6 per cent projected earlier on slower-than-expected economic recovery.

Meanwhile, worries over rising death toll and the economic fallout from the novel coronavirus continued to haunt investors globally.

The coronavirus epidemic that emerged in central China has now killed nearly 1,800 people and spread around the world.

The latest figures from China show there are more than 70,000 people infected in the country.

“Domestic growth concerns seem to be back in the market as indicated by a recent downgrade by Moody’s. Banks having significant exposure in telecom players continue to be in the limelight as lack of funds could delay the payments and degrade the quality of banks balance sheet,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said.

Continuous rise in coronavirus cases has forced major Asian peers to downgrade their growth outlook which could cause a ripple effect in other nations in the first quarter while recovery is expected from the second, he said.

In fresh developments on the AGR matter, Vodafone Idea and Tata Group have made part payment of about Rs 2,500 crore and over Rs 2,190 crore, respectively, to the telecom department towards statutory dues, a government official said on Monday.

191,18-2-20,"SC refuses to accept Voda’s proposal to pay Rs 2,500 cr","The Supreme Court Monday rejected telecom firm Vodafone’s proposal to pay Rs 2,500 crore by the end of the day and Rs 1,000 crore by Friday against Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues, while also refusing its plea that no coercive action be taken against it.

A bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra declined to accept the proposal given by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Vodafone, after he mentioned the matter.

Rohatgi said they are willing to pay Rs 2,500 crore today (Monday) and another Rs 1,000 crore by Friday but no coercive action be taken against the company.

He urged the bank guarantee deposited with the government by Vodafone should also not be encashed.

The top court had on Friday warned of contempt proceedings against top executives of Bharti Airtel, Vodafone-Idea and other telecom firms for failing to comply with its directive to pay an estimated Rs 1.47 lakh crore in past dues, and asked whether there was no law left in the country.

With the apex court’s rap, the Government came down heavily on telcos following which Bharti Airtel on Monday said it has paid Rs 10,000 crore to the telecom department towards statutory dues.

The company said it will make payment of balance amount after self-assessment exercise.

“The...Amount of Rs 10,000 crore has been paid on behalf of Bharti Airtel, Bharti Hexacom, and Telenor,” the Sunil Mittal-led company said in a statement.

In the Friday order which will have a far-reaching implications for the telecom sector, the apex court expressed displeasure at the “temerity” of a desk officer in the Department of Telecom for “scuttling” its order by issuing a written directive to not take any coercive action against firms for not depositing dues by the January 23, 2020, deadline.

The Bench, also comprising Justices S Abdul Nazeer and MR Shah, said the companies have violated its order “in pith and substance” and asked them to clear dues before the next date of hearing on March 17.

Following the apex court rap, the Department of Telecom withdrew its January 23, 2020 order that had called for no coercive action against defaulting firms and started issuing notices to telcos asking them to deposit dues before midnight of Friday.

Expressing displeasure over an order passed by the DoT’s desk officer, which virtually stayed the effect of its verdict, the apex court said this is nothing “but a device to scuttle” its judgment and this case projects a “very disturbing scenario”. It issued a notice to the officer.

The bench noted that the desk officer “has the temerity to pass the order “to the effect of issuing a direction to another constitutional authority, the accountant general, “not to insist for any payment pursuant to the order passed by this court and not to take any coercive steps till further orders.”

The top court made it clear that in case its order is not complied with, the desk officer of the DoT and top executives of these companies “shall remain personally present” before it on March 17.

The court had on October 24 last year ordered that non-telecom revenues should be included in the AGR for calculating statutory dues such as license fee and spectrum charges.

The DoT calculated that Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and others owe as much as Rs 1.47 lakh crore in past dues, including penalties and interest, while non-telecom firms, who had taken some licence from it, owed another Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

On January 16, a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra dismissed petitions of telecom firms seeking review of that order saying it did not find any “justifiable reason” to entertain them.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-refuses-to-accept-voda---s-proposal-to-pay-rs-2-500-cr-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/sc-refuses-to-accept-voda---s-proposal-to-pay-rs-2-500-cr.html

194,18-2-20,The show must go on,"Climate change activists brought flares, wore gas masks, stopped traffic with a street protest as they demanded the cancellation of the five-day style extravaganza, London Fashion Week

Climate change activists stole the show on the opening day of London Fashion Week, stopping traffic with a street protest as they demanded the cancellation of the British capital’s five-day style extravaganza. Dozens of protesters from the Extinction Rebellion group drew attention — and anger from some drivers — as they fired colorful smoke flares into the air and blocked busy intersections in central London near the fashion events. Some protesters wore gas masks and dresses made from chains, while others carried placards reading “no fashion on a dead planet.”

They called on the British Fashion Council to take more action to lobby for environmental policies. It was an eventful day at London Fashion Week, which brings crowds of style editors, photographers, models and celebrities to the city twice a year. Burberry, Victoria Beckham, Tommy Hilfiger, Erdem and Christopher Kane are among the leading fashion houses and designers showcasing their latest fall and winter creations over the next few days.

Organisers of London Fashion Week have said they want to help promote sustainability and create positive change within the industry. This season, the trade show is featuring a “Positive Fashion” exhibition and a “swap shop” where visitors will be able to exchange used clothes for donated items.

Most fashion week attendees, however, will have their eyes firmly trained on new season offerings. On Saturday, Temperley London staged four catwalk shows that were open to the public as part of a wider drive to make the displays — traditionally only accessible to fashion insiders and VIPs — more public-facing and instantly available to the masses.

The brand, adored by fans for its romantic evening and bridal wear, showcased summer dresses with bold prints and an array of opulent and ultra-feminine evening gowns featuring plenty of ruffles, jeweled embellishments, sheer fabrics and show-stopping sequins.

Gale force winds and a deluge of rain may be causing havoc to much of Britain, but for the fashion crowd the show must go on. Storm Dennis didn’t stop models, celebrities and fashion insiders from donning their finest to attend the fashion week. American streetwear designer Tommy Hilfiger also made a guest appearance, showing neon yellow tracksuits and luxury sportswear in a collaboration collection with Formula One racing driver Lewis Hamilton.

Cameras flashed as the Beckham family turned out in style to support Spice Girl-turned-designer Victoria Beckham, who staged her catwalk show at central London’s grand Banqueting Hall. Her sons Romeo and Cruz shared the front row with father and former soccer star David Beckham, while 8-year-old Harper got a comfy seat in her father’s lap.

On the catwalk, models wore checked shirts, smart tailored coats, culottes and velvet blazers, all paired with skin-tight, thigh-high leather boots in shades from blue to bright red. Beckham said “we’re using the boot to throw things off in a little bit of a strange way.”

Elsewhere, French designer Roland Mouret turned to 1980s London under Margaret Thatcher for inspiration. There were double-breasted blazers, exaggerated shoulders and androgynous suits; a sugary pink boxy blazer, worn with matching culottes, stood out in a mostly austere palette of greys, khakis and monochrome.

The fashion industry has come under increasing scrutiny from green groups, and Mouret — who counts Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, among his celebrity fans — was keen to respond to calls for more transparent and environmentally-friendly practices. Sustainable fashion “is at the heart of my collection in a time where the process of creating clothes carries with it a personal responsibility,” he said, and emphasised that he aimed for the brand to be carbon neutral within the year.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-show-must-go-on-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-show-must-go-on.html
195,18-2-20,Social media war on Filmfare,"The latest Filmfare Awards have disappointed some netizens. People have taken to social media to express their dissatisfaction with the winners and #BoycottFilmfareAwards has been trending on Twitter since Monday.

Some argue that the earthy song of the pro-Right Kesari should have been chosen over Gully Boy, which celebrates protest poetry against social inequity, others cried nepotism. Luckily, the war played out in social media that allows a democracy of opinions. Unluckily, it also gave vent to political biases.

While fans tweeted their ire, lyricist Manoj Muntashir declared that he is heartbroken over not winning an award for penning the heart-wrenching track Teri Mitti from Kesari. He took to Twitter to announce that he would not be attending any award ceremonies for the rest of his life. Manoj penned an emotional note, “Dear Awards, even if I try all my life, I won't be able to write a better line than Tu Kehti Thee Tera Chaand Hoon Main Aur Chaand Humesha Rahta Hai. You failed to honour the words which made millions of Indians cry and care for their motherland. It would be a great disrespect to my art if I still continue caring for you. So here I bid you a final good bye. I officially announce that I won't attend any award show till I breathe my last. Alvida.”

Netizens came up in support of him because Teri Mitti is a song that touched hearts of almost all Bollywood buffs, especially due to its lyrics. Commenting on his post, a user wrote, ""@filmfare and @jiteshpillaai, you literally killed faith of many Indians and lyricist by not giving award to #TeriMitti. This song is best of the decade.”

The mood has been similar for many fans. Accusing the awards of propagating nepotism and awarding actors and filmmakers who are star kids, a user wrote, “They have to promote betis some renowned people Akhtar, Bhatt and Pandey. Nepotism rules in Bollywood. It’s so sad that quality cinema does not matter. #BoycottFilmfareAwards.”

196,18-2-20,Memories on canvas,"For artist Ganesh Haloi, working on a piece is like cultivating crops on a part of land. It’s the reason why nature’s true essence can be found in his works, says Uma Nair

Man needs colour to live; it’s just as necessary an element as fire and water,” said the great Fernand Léger in The Aesthetics of the Machine, Geometric Order and True (1923).

The quaint and curious little space at the Akar Prakar Contemporary, showcasing minimal colour field landscapes by the great master from Bengal, Ganesh Haloi, reminds one of this. Haloi has been brought into the limelight by director Reena Lath. His solo will be unveiled at the Asia Art Week, New York in March.

In these landscapes, the modernist you see suffuses fertile pastures tinted by tiny strokes of colour, the splendour of which, all of a sudden, transforms into a bouquet of earth songs. It’s one of the reasons why Haloi was handpicked by Documenta 14 curator Adam Szymczyk in 2014.

Tranquility of colour fields

Haloi plays with the tranquility of colour fields as he creates a study of his homeland, which is intense, in-depth and unexpected. In one of them, one could spot a golden yellow rapture, while in another, a vigorous tenor of mud brown. One can also find a voluminous ochre that could belong to a paddy field or an autumnal evening in Shantiniketan. Whatever the case maybe, Haloi creates a counterpoise, aptly balancing space and volume.

In a life that has found the graceful gravitas of pure abstraction, Haloi’s works at Akar Prakar are both joyful and dynamic. In 2006, at his home in Kolkata, he said in an interview, “Colour is not just a vital necessity in the hands of an artist. It is like a raw material, which is primary as well as essential in life. It is like air, water and fire. If I am thinking of my experiences and memories, I cannot imagine it without the mood of the atmosphere. When you look at a pond, at the plants, fishes and birds around you, you are also thinking of all that is natural in colour tones. When we look at nature in its purest form, we are recording what is linked to light. The memory becomes an intensity which we can either strengthen or soften. This process for me is the abstraction that I engage in.”

Fragmented homogeneity

His tiny strokes look as though light is vibrating and moving along the rhythms of the wind. Musical breadths and deeper understandings of abstract expressionism — all come into play in Haloi’s works. He is a scholar, who is content to create something within the orbit of his own oasis. He is the reflective traveller content within the conventions of time and space and happy to venture into terra incognita. His canvases speak a language, where each portion takes on a novel, fresh and moving meaning.

One morning in 2006, in the silence of his flat and company of artist Sudip Roy, Haloi said, “A work of art is like a land I cultivate. It grows progressively but quietly. Abstraction is neither a technique nor geometry. It is born of one’s own residue of memory and experience. The stories, events and spectacles I saw in my childhood come back to me. The sadness of the Bengal famine and the helplessness of people, engulfs me. The sunset at the pond in the village... everything accumulates as associations with the past. When I put paint to paper or canvas, I want to create something that is fresh and full of the sap of fertility. Like the poet who sits down to write, I gaze at my canvas or paper for some time. Yes, I want the trigger of a vital energy and a zest. The beginning is quiet but once the first swish of the pliant brush or the pen touches the canvas, it flows. Some stimulus must accumulate within me so that I can create the unexpected symphony. It’s like one of the compositions from the Gitabitan — moody, rhythmic and full of resonance. That resonance must happen.”

When asked if he likes to be alone when he paints, Haloi said his wait in front of his canvas or sheet of Nepali paper is a combination of silent patience and the gesture of poise. These landscapes are tinged with grace and dreaminess, populated by strokes that resemble the rustling of leaves or just riverine tributaries, bathed in harmonies of green or tan or an indigo. They are rooted in the ethos of his own world.

In the density of depth and the melody of motion, Haloi’s exhibition is a paean to poetic patterns, prismatic haikus that lull the senses long after we have gone through an immersive experience of dulcet tunes of the yesteryear. It would be intriguing to know how New York responds to India’s resonant master even as he brings alive the words by Aldous Huxley: “There are things known and there are things unknown, and in between are the doors of perception.”

198,18-2-20,The illusion of reality,"Through different media of printmaking like lithography, wood engraving, etching and enamel paintings, artist Ajit Seal showcases his journey of 40 years of art practises and how he has experienced many transformations over time. By Team Viva

In trying to articulate the thoughts about artist Ajit Seal’s works, one examines not only them but also the relationship the artist has with the works. It’s after all a long process — from their fabrication till the time they get their final shape. The exhibition, Idioms & Images, directs the viewers to understand the variety in his artworks by dividing them into different phases. First, the regional periphery, and second, the idioms and images where Ajit’s printmaking process has much to say about the route, conceptual diversion and the process of growth an artist undergoes.

The images also usher the audience in three directions — of complex metaphysical ideas, towards the path of simplicity, and towards an artistic quest, where the artist’s works represent how man and society can perpetually renew and transcend themselves by the self-transcending meanings, values and purposes in life. Ajit’s experiments and display of the different media of printmaking such as lithography, wood engraving, etching, plate lithography and enamel paintings showcase his journey of 40 years of art practices and how he has experienced many transformations in his artistic journey.

His works have gone through many artistic phases and the show portrays the different varieties of the printmaking process. On the face of it, the works show a versatile technique and imagery for which Ajit has been known well. They also seem to have a unique feature in the unconcealed reference to the Indian mythology and auspicious symbols which he derived from religious conviction. He had said earlier, “Although there are mythological references in my works, they are predominated from my personal experiences.” It is on this wider background that his works echo at the very heart of contemporary art practices and the issues of self-identity.

There are three major objectives that Ajit explores. First, the visual language that he uses. Second, the thought-process he uses to guide the making of his artworks. Third, the wider chronological framework through which he both produces his works as well as thinks the work will occupy a significant place.

At the very first sight of Ajit’s printmaking works, one becomes aware of his images and they speak volumes about his thoughts and beliefs. With the help of strong narratives, his works reflect his own musings which keep transforming, sometimes static, veiling, unveiling and changing as he progresses.

The images and prints are the silhouettes of his inner self. His works communicate expressions of everyday experiences, along with the belief that its identity is made up of a body, of thoughts, feelings, ambitions, plans, ideas, values, impulses, desires, actions, qualities, and so on.

Ajit’s works are an approach where he presents a traditional and spiritual morality into visual perspective. His works emerge from a personal quest, for which the most suitable media and materials that express his ‘self’ are lithographies, wood engraving as well as etching. His work process goes with the flow of his thoughts. He says, “Sometimes ideas emerge gradually through the everyday things I am engaged in and other times, it takes a long thinking process for days before I start exploring the visual concepts on different printing media.”

The illusion of reality is one of Ajit’s prime objectives and he seems to be moving around the circumference of a time circle for which his art is governed by much aesthetic austerity. He tries to communicate with the viewers through his private emotions and sensations — not so much as his eyes see, but rather as the effect on his inward being when he looks at particular things. His works forsake representational images but aim to communicate personal sensations. His works certainly need to be looked into deeply because his narratives act as a way for the viewers towards a course of perseverance.

He says, “I am inspired by the movements of the flora which surround me and the movements of life, be it of the inner self or the outer world.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-illusion-of-reality-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-illusion-of-reality.html
199,18-2-20,The art of fostering relationships,"Musicians from Goa have always been at the forefront and now artists from the state are more confidently stepping into new festival spaces

With a view to build upon the community of creative people residing in Goa, the maiden edition of the Goa Open Arts Festival aimed to foster collaborations and relationships among participants, who may not have previously known each other but are all living and making work in the state.

Talking about the public festival, Sitara Chowfla, independent curator and spokesperson of the festival recalled that the it was prompted by the idea that there are a significant number of creative people — artists, writers, designers, poets, musicians, who had come from around the country and the world to make Goa their home.

“The intention was also to encourage and provide a platform for creating new work and for artists to retain control over what and how they show. This is a point of difference from many other festivals that it is organised by artists and the content is driven by the selected artists and not by curators,” she said.

Stressing that the underlying thought behind the three-day festival was premised on the idea of “openness”, Chowfla elaborated that they have included a diverse range of practices in the arts — music, performance, visual arts, poetry — and also opened up different interpretations of art. “For example, we had chefs who used food to awaken sensory experiences and a mental health initiative that used creative design to reach out to adolescents. There was artists conducting workshops for children from the village schools, thus, opening up space to a different audience. One important aspect of being open is that it is for anyone to apply, whether an emerging artist or an established practitioner,” she said.

The festival showcased a wide discipline of artists and makers. The visual arts exhibition included works by Orijit Sen, an interactive textile art project by young Goan artist Rujuta Rao, multimedia installations by artists Gopika Chowfla, Dheer Kaku, Mustafa Khanbai and Rajaram Naik. There were also many interactive projects including the Travelling Library by Bookworm trust, a special exhibit on mental health by Goa-based NGO Sangath in collaboration with Quicksand Design Studio, and a polaroid photo studio set up by photographer Bharat Sikka.

The main stage witnessed acoustic music and poetry acts by the likes of Rochelle D’Silva, Shyamant Behal, Govez, and late-night music ranged from Sufi music by HAWA, jazz and funk by the Coffee Cats, and a Fado concert by Sonia Shirsat. “We also created a lot of opportunities for local schools to interact with our programme — clay-making, theatre and printmaking workshops for students in the area,” said Sitara and added, “Our focus was on deepening the engagement with the community with more sustained programmes through the year and through fostering cross-collaboration between our current participating artists.”

Talk to her about Goa’s growing popularity among artists from across the country, and she said, “The state’s inherent natural beauty, culture and people — there is a particular energy here that attracts creativity. It seems to be a natural fit perhaps that’s why more and more cultural events are being planned in Goa. Goan musicians have always been at the forefront and now Goan artists are more confidently stepping into these new festival spaces.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-art-of-fostering-relationships.html
200,18-2-20,Church pastor among 24 killed in Burkina Faso attack,"Gunmen killed 24 men, including a church pastor, and kidnapped three others on Sunday in Burkina Faso, an official said. It was the latest attack against a religious leader in the increasingly unstable West African nation.

The mayor of Boundore commune, Sihanri Osangola Brigadie, said the attack occurred in the town of Pansy in Yagha province. The roughly 20 attackers separated men from women close to a Protestant church. At least 10 other people were injured.

“It hurt me when I saw the people,” Brigadie said after visiting some of the victims in the hospital in Dori town, 180 kilometers (110 miles) from the attack. The gunmen looted oil and rice from shops and forced the three youth they kidnapped to help transport it on their motorbikes, he said.

Both Christians and Muslims were killed before the church was set on fire, said a government security official in Dori who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media.

Attacks have targeted religious leaders in the area in the past. Last week, also in Yagha province, a retired pastor was killed and another pastor was abducted by gunmen, according to an internal security report for aid workers seen by The Associated Press.

Extremist violence has dramatically escalated in once-peaceful Burkina Faso.

Analysts are concerned

that attacks against civilians, including against Christians, are increasing “at an

alarming rate,” said Corinne Dufka, West Africa director for Human Rights Watch. “Perpetrators use victims’

links to government or their faith to justify the killings, while others appear to be reprisal killings for killings by the government security forces,” she said.

More than 1,300 civilians were killed in targeted attacks last year in Burkina Faso, more than seven times the previous year, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, which collects and analyzes conflict information.

The insecurity has created a humanitarian crisis. More than 760,000 people are internally displaced, according to the government.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/church-pastor-among-24-killed-in-burkina-faso-attack.html
201,18-2-20,Rwandan dissident singer found dead in custody: police,"A popular Rwandan singer whose music was banned by the ruling regime “committed suicide” in custody, police announced Monday, three days after he was caught trying to flee the country.

Kizito Mihigo, a survivor of the Rwandan genocide whose songs angered the government of strongman President Paul Kagame, was found dead in a police cell in the capital Kigali around 5am (0200 GMT).

Mihigo, who was sentenced to 10 years’ jail in 2015 for conspiracy against the government but later released on pardon, was captured trying to cross the border in Rwanda’s south.

Police spokesperson John Bosco Kabera said he was visited by family members and his lawyer during his detention.

“Investigations have begun to ascertain why he committed suicide,” he said.

Mihigo fell foul of the ruling RPF in 2013 after composing songs that questioned the government’s tight control of the legacy of the 1994 tragedy.

His music, once popular by ruling elites, was swiftly banned. Two years later he was accused of terrorism and raising support for an opposition political movement and sentenced to 10 years in prison.

His lawyers said prosecutors had little evidence to jail him. He was released on presidental pardon in September 2018.

206,18-2-20,One love is all we need,"Designer duo Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla’s collection at Blenders Pride Fashion Tour was a passionate call to action for inclusivity and the celebration of difference. By Team Viva

What was this year’s theme for Blenders Pride Fashion Tour?

The milestone 15th edition of Blenders Pride Fashion Tour unveiled a new face of fashion by bringing the universe of pride to life, with ‘My Blend, My Pride’ being the theme for the Delhi chapter of the tour. The concept represents our creative and spiritual vision. Blend is an amalgamation of multiple textiles, techniques, embroidery, colours and silhouettes, each one distinct and a reflection of the rich and living cultural, historical, art and craft legacy of India. With India as muse, we have imagined this new collection as an original style standard for now and for the future. Blend is also an ode to the concept of ‘One Love’. And it’s many, many forms. It is a passionate call to action for inclusivity and the celebration of difference.

How did you blend modern silhouettes and Indian traditions and aesthetics through your designs?

The proof of the pudding is in the tasting. The collection revealed its ability to carry traditions and classical sensibilities in a thoroughly modern avatar. We believe in breaking boundaries, in crossing borders when it comes to creativity.

What inspired the collection?

Our collection is always inspired by multiple influences and is essentially a celebration of the sheer diversity, that is India. We have always worked intensively with Indian textiles, be it block printing, khaki or cotton. Our intention is to elevate these crafts to works of art. Natural fabrics, weaves, dyes were used as a canvas for the finest embroideries and accents. Multiple motifs, too, inspired by flora, fauna and architecture. Every range is distinct and blends multiple elements together in decidedly original silhouettes to create a tribute to craftsmanship and design at their highest level.

Some of your collection seems to be inspired by Indian architecture. How did you weave architecture in your designs?

Architecture has always played an important role as a personal passion and creative inspiration. Be it Mughal monuments or South Indian temples, we have used these extensively as motifs in our collections. We also designed collections of architectural furniture. We incorporated gothic and art deco architecture in our fashion and interior designs.

This has been your signature style. How has it evolved over the years?

One’s core sensibilities and aesthetics remain the same. As artists and designers, we have always committed ourselves to creating original, impossibly refined, exceptional and timeless pieces. We believe in constant experimentation and in challenging ourselves to break our own bar. We are always learning, striving to dream and achieve bigger. The circle of creativity must always expand. Each time we fashion a new dream, with new eyes.

Fabrics, initially seen as hierarchical symbols, have evolved to be accepted and recognised as an art form. What is your take on this? Which fabric did you use?

Our textile legacy is an art form. It is labour and skill-intensive. From weaving to block printing, we are beyond blessed in India to have artisanal quality within our reach. These 33 years have seen us work with myriad fabrics and textiles. Our mission has always been to make these textiles high fashion — the standard of couture. Bandhani, khadi, ajrak, silk, georgette, satin and cotton feature extensively in this collection.

Can you tell us in detail about your colour palette this time?

The colour palette as always is extensive. Every range features signature colours, inspired by the ones found in both nature and in our tradition. From whites, beige and nudes to rust, brown, green, Indigo. The palette included even the jewel hues like fuchsia, orange, emerald and red.

208,18-2-20,Dortmund defence key against PSG,"Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre says how his team defend against Paris Saint-Germain stars such as Neymar and Kylian Mbappe will be the deciding factor in today’s Champions League clash.

Dortmund host PSG in the last 16, first leg at Signal Iduna Park.

“They’re a dangerous team,” Favre said in Dortmund on Monday.

“When you lose the ball, they move very fast up front. The key will be how we defend.

“It’s important that we’re very strong on winning the ball and then, when in possession, that we stay calm.”

Under former Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel, PSG are looking to break their last-16 jinx having failed to progress past the first knock-out stage for the last three seasons.

Dortmund are looking to emulate their run to the 2013 Champions League final and have some serious attacking prowess of their own.

New signing Erling Braut Haaland, 19, has scored nine goals in six games and forged a successful partnership with England winger Jadon Sancho, also 19.

“He’s (de Villiers) a discussion in the media and in the public but he is no discussion for me. I have had chats with him and we will probably know pretty soon what’s going to happen with him,” Boucher said after team’s 1-2 defeat to England in T20 series at home.

“Like I said from day one when I took over, if we are going to a World Cup, I would like to have our best players there.

211,18-2-20,Faf quits as SA captain,"Senior batsman Faf du Plessis on Monday stepped down as captain of South Africa’s Test and T20 teams with immediate effect, citing “the need to facilitate the emergence of next generation of leaders”.

The 35-year-old Du Plessis, who stepped aside from the ODI captaincy to make way for Quinton de Kock during the recent series against England, said he took the decision to help South Africa start a new era.

“In a perfect world I would have loved to lead the team in the Tests for the rest of the season as well as the T20 World Cup,” du Plessis said in a statement.

“But sometimes the most important attribute of a leader is to be selfless. I am healthy, fit, energised and motivated and certainly see myself playing an important role in the squad for as long as I continue putting in winning performances for the team,” he added.

“As the team heads into a new direction with new leaders and a young crop of players, I feel it will be in the best interests of South African cricket to relinquish the captaincy in all formats.”

Du Plessis termed the decision as one of the toughest but said he remains fully committed to help de Kock in the transition phase.

“This was one of the toughest decisions to make, but I remain fully committed to supporting Quinton, Mark (Boucher) and my teammates as we continue to rebuild and re-align as a group,” said the 35-year-old.

Rabada return for T20s

Faf du Plessis and fast bowler Kagiso Rabada will return to the South African squad for a three-match T20I series against Australia, starting at the Wanderers on Friday.

Fast bowler Anrich Nortje, one of South Africa’s successes in a losing Test series, has also been included in the squad.

213,18-2-20,It’s going to be very big if we win T20 WC: Harman,"The void left by legends such as Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami is not easy to fill, India captain Harmanpreet Kaur conceded on Monday but also asserted that her young side has grown substantially to be a top contender for this month’s women’s T20 World Cup.

Mithali retired from T20 cricket last year while Goswami previously played in the format before the 2018 edition. The average age of India’s squad in Australia is 22.8 with Harmanpreet being among the seasoned ones.

“We already miss the experience they share with us, but these young girls and showing their talent and ability,” said the 29-year-old, while speaking at the captains’ media day at Taronga Zoo.

The ICC Women’s T20 World Cup will open with a mouth-watering clash between India and defending champions and hosts Australia in Adelaide on February 21.

“In the last two years...I’ve gone from being the youngest one to one of the oldest in the team,” she said.

“They (her teammates) never show us that they’re young, they can always do what we expect of them. The team is looking in really good shape and showing what they can do with extra responsibility,” she added.

She is still not over the disappointment of missing the ODI world title in 2017 and Harmanpreet said the T20 World Cup trophy would go a long way in making up for that debacle.

“Our team is growing day by day, everyone is looking so positive,” Harmanpreet said.

“It’s going to be very big if we win, I was very surprised at all the reaction from 2017. My parents didn’t tell me, they didn’t want us to feel the pressure. If we win, it’s going to be very big for us. We will try to give our best.”

Harmanpreet is well aware of what a long run in an ICC tournament can do for her country.

“Over the last two years, we have already had a few games as part of the Women’s T20 Challenge and this year we are looking forward to more,” said the aggressive batter, who became the first Indian cricketer to join an overseas league by signing up with Women’s Big Bash League side Sydney Thunder in 2016.

“If we win the World Cup, there’s no doubt things will change. That tournament would bring a lot of confidence to the girls.

“If we get a women’s IPL that will be really good for us. If we win the World Cup, it’s going to be very big for us as a team, so we will try to give our best,” she said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/it---s-going-to-be-very-big-if-we-win-t20-wc--harman.html
214,18-2-20,Italy receive new SMS,"Lazio topple Inter 2-1 to go 2nd behind Juventus

Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi gave warning his side are ready to fight for their first Serie A title since 2000 after moving into second in Serie A on Sunday, just one point off leaders Juventus after a come-from-behind 2-1 win over Inter Milan at Stadio Olimpico.

Juventus reclaimed pole position thanks to Paulo Dybala and Juan Cuadrado’s goals as the Turin giants rediscovered their winning form 2-0 at home against Brescia.

Inter Milan dropped from top spot to third — three points behind the eight-time reigning champions — after falling to just their second defeat of the season.

“We need to stay humble and focused but I’m sure we will succeed. We have nothing to lose,” said Inzaghi.

“We know that Juventus and Inter are two great teams and we will do everything to fight to the end, knowing that it will be very difficult.”

In a fiery clash in the Stadio Olimpico defender Ashley Young broke through just before the break with his first Serie A goal for Inter Milan after his move from Manchester United.

The 34-year-old got his foot to tap-in off a rebound after Thomas Straskosha had cleared from former Lazio player Antonio Candreva.

A Stefan de Vrij foul on Ciro Immobile allowed the Serie A top scorer to slot in his 26th goal in 24 games this season, five minutes after the break.

Sergej Milinkovic-Savic snatched the winner after 69 minutes amid confusion in front of goal.

“We gifted Lazio two goals,” said Inter coach Antonio Conte as the northerners fell to their second defeat after Juventus in October.

Lazio extended their unbeaten run to 19 games as they target their second Scudetto, with a return to Champions League football on the cards for next season.

Mertens lifts Napoli

In Sardinia, Napoli got back to winning ways with a Dries Mertens’ 65th-minute goal sealing a 1-0 success over Cagliari.

The Belgian completed a give-and-go with Elseid Hysaj with the ball curling in with a deflection off the post.

It was the 32-year-old’s 120th goal for Napoli, one short of Marek Hamsik’s all-time record, and five ahead of club legend Diego Maradona.

“Dries is a phenomenon, a champion who makes difficult things seem simple,” said coach Gennaro Gattuso.

215,18-2-20,"Punia, Vinesh lead Indian challenge","Defending champion Bajrang Punia will look to retain his 65kg freestyle title while six-time medallist (3 Silver and Bronze each) Vinesh Phogat will aim to upgrade the 53kg Bronze she won in the 2019 edition at Xi’an, China to Gold when the Asian Wrestling Championship begins here at Indira Gandhi Arena today.

The six-day event at the KD Jadhav Wrestling Stadium will act as a platform for the Indian wrestlers to test their skills against the best in Asia ahead of the Tokyo Olympics.

The championship has been classified as a ranking tournament for the Tokyo game by the United World Wrestling.

Besides Punia and Vinesh, the 30-member India squad will also feature Deepak Punia, Ravi Kumar Dahiya and 2016 Rio Olympic Bronze medallist Shakshi Malik.

Anshu Malik, Ashu and Sonam Malik are the three youngsters who would look to make a mark in the tournament.

The tournament will be played in three categories — men’s freeStyle, Greco-Roman and women’s wrestling. The first two days will see Greco-Roman competition, followed by women’s wrestling (next two days) and men’s freestyle (last two days).

There was initially uncertainty over the participation of four Pakistani wrestlers and two officials due to political tension but they have been cleared by the government to take part in the championship.

However, a 40-strong Chinese contingent will not be taking part in the championships as they have not been granted visas by the government due to the novel coronavirus outbreak there.

The Senior Asian Championship is returning to India after a gap of two years. India last hosted the championship in 2017. In the 2019 edition, India had won 16 medals, including the lone Gold from Punia in 65kg category.

World No 2 and India’s leading medal hope, Punia said, “It is a great opportunity for all of us. We will be playing in front of our home fans. Though to many it might seem as pressure, but I believe it will work as an advantage and I am hopeful that large numbers will be coming in to fill the stands and support us.”

Dahiya, who has already qualified for the Olympics courtesy his Bronze medal-winning performance at the 2019 World Championships, echoed Bajrang’s feelings.

“We are excited about the tournament. I am personally looking at ensuring that in my weight category I end up winning Gold. 57 kg is a tough weight category and has probably the stiffest competition but losing is not an option when you are playing in your home ground,” he said.

Fresh from her Gold medal at the Ranking Series in Italy, Vinesh is India’s brightest medal prospect in the women’s category.

“We have a strong contingent in both men and women’s category. Asia has a very good set of wrestlers and being the Olympic year everyone will be looking to get as many wins as possible heading to the Tokyo Games. Personally, I am looking at this competition as a launch-pad for my upcoming competitions,” said Vinesh.

One of the dark horses of the tournament will be Sakshi (65 kg) who has not done anything of note last year. While she is not competing in her regular weight category, she could utilise the tournament to redeem herself.

Sakshi had won a Bronze in 62kg in the last edition.

Apart from the Indians, there will be a number of top international wrestlers as well, like Kenichiro Fumita, Gold medallist at 2019 World Wrestling Championships, and Nurislam Sanayev from Kazakhstan in freestyle.

In Greco-Roman, wrestlers like South Korea’s Ryu Han Su (a two-time world champion) and Uzbekistan’s Elmurat Tasmuradov (a five-time Asian Championship Gold medallist) will be in action.

216,18-2-20,Coronavirus impact: No entry for Chinese wrestlers in Delhi,"Chinese wrestlers will not compete in the Asian Championships beginning here today as they have not been granted visas by the government due to the novel coronavirus outbreak there, a top official of the national federation said on Monday.

Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) assistant secretary Vinod Tomar said that the government has denied visas to the 40-strong Chinese contingent.

“We have got to know that the government has not granted visas to the Chinese contingent and so they are not taking part in the Championships,” Tomar said.

“The world is grappling with the issue of coronavirus and so health of the athletes is the primary concern now. It is understandable why the government has not given visas to them,” he added.

Asked what could be United World Wrestling’s reaction on the denial of visas to the Chinese wrestlers, Tomar said, “We do not see any issues here, it is not something which happens in normal times. We are dealing with a grave health issue facing the world.

“It is not happening just in this championship, other countries have also done the same to Chinese athletes in other sporting events. Moreover, the UWW has not told us anything or given any direction about the Chinese wrestlers in the past week or so.”

Talking about the granting of visas to the Pakistani wrestlers, Tomar said, “There could be issues had we not granted visas to the Pakistani wrestlers. So, we tried hard to get it done. But in case of Chinese wrestlers, it is for the health and safety of the participating athletes.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/coronavirus-impact--no-entry-for-chinese-wrestlers-in-delhi.html

Four-time Grand Slam champion Clijsters, 36, had been out for seven years before the clash with world number 16 Muguruza, who reached the final of the Australian Open last month.

Spain’s Muguruza, herself a two-time Grand Slam winner, will play one of Veronika Kudermetova and Dayana Yastremska in the next round.

She found herself a two breaks down early in the second set after being swept aside in the first but fought back gamely to lead 5-4 after nine games.

The Indian duo has been inconsistent in 2019 and didn’t enjoy a good start to the new year.

While Saina has crossed the first round in only one of the three events in 2020, Srikanth has lost in the opening round in all three tournaments that he has played so far this year.

Saina and Srikanth are currently ranked 18th and 15th respectively, while being placed 22nd and 26th in the Race to Tokyo rankings, which takes into consideration only the points accumulated from the tournaments played in the last one year.

According to the BWF Olympic qualification rules, only two players from each singles category can qualify if their ranking is within the top-16 by April end.

Among the Indians, world champion P V Sindhu and B Sai Praneeth and men’s doubles pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty have almost secured their berths for the Tokyo Games.

With the Olympic qualification cut-off date ending in April, there are only seven tournaments, including the Barcelona Spain Masters, left in the calender and the Indian duo will have to produce consistent performances to earn a ticket to Tokyo.

London Bronze-medallist Saina, who is looking to make her fourth Olympics, will begin her campaign here against Germany’s Yvonne Li.

Third seed Srikanth, on the other hand, will face fellow Indian Subhankar Dey, who notched up a morale-boosting win over world No 20 Indonesian Shesar Hiren Rhustavito in the Asia Team C’ships on Saturday.

221,18-2-20,Celta put brake on Real,"Real Madrid’s winning streak ended when they conceded a late goal to draw 2-2 at home to Celta Vigo and finish the weekend with their lead over Barcelona down to one point.

Real manager Zinedine Zidane was philosophical.

“There’s nothing to explain, it’s just the way things are, it’s football,” he said.

“I’m not worried about it, but I’m disappointed, as always when you drop two points at home.”

On Sunday they welcomed back Eden Hazard, who had been out since November. Coach Zinedine Zidane also recalled his other 100 million euro player Gareth Bale to complete an all-star attack with Karim Benzema.

Yet Celta leapt into the lead after seven minutes. A pass from Iago Aspas sent Fedor Smolov galloping clear up the middle and he shot low past Thibaut Courtois.

“There were mistakes, especially for the first goal,” said Zidane.

“We were not well positioned, it happens, and it’ll happen to us again.”

Real levlled n the 52nd minute, Marcelo, not for the first time, found space on the left. His low cross deflected to Toni Kroos following the attack. The German drilled in the equaliser. It was the sixth straight season Kroos had scored against Celta.

In the 65th minute, goalkeeper Ruben Blanco pulled down the impressive Hazard. Ramos slammed the penalty into the bottom corner of the net.

However Celta responded by rediscovering their attacking nerve.

With four minutes left, a sharp pass from Denis Suarez, who had come on in the 71st minute, caught the Real back four rigid on the edge of their own area. Santi Mina, who had been on for just two minutes, raced onto the ball and drilled a shot past Courtois.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/celta-put-brake-on-real.html
222,18-2-20,Legendary Tendulkar receives best Laureus sporting moment,"Batting great Sachin Tendulkar being carried on the shoulders of his teammates after India's World Cup triumph at home in 2011 was voted the Laureus best sporting moment in the last 20 years.

With the backing of Indian cricket fans, Tendulkar got the maximum number of votes to emerge winner on Monday.

Tendulkar, competing in his sixth and last World Cup, finally realised his long-cherished dream when skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni smacked Sri Lankan pacer Nuwan Kulasekara out of the park for a winning six.

The charged-up Indian cricketers rushed to the ground at the Wankhede Stadium and soon they lifted Tendulkar on their shoulders and made a lap of honour, a moment etched in the minds of the fans.

Former Australian skipper Steve Waugh handed the trophy to Tendulkar after tennis legend Bros Becker announced the winner at a glittering ceremony.

""It's incredible. The feeling of winning the world cup was beyond what words can express. How many times you get an event happening where there are no mixed opinions. Very rarely the entire country celebrates,"" Tendulkar said after receiving the trophy.

""And this is a reminder of how powerful a sport is and what magic it does to our lives. Even now when I watch that it has stayed with me.""

Becker then asked Tendulkar to share the emotions he felt at that time and the Indian legend put in perspective how important it was for him to hold that trophy.

""My journey started in 1983 when I was 10 years old. India had won the World Cup. I did not understand the significance and just because everybody was celebrating, I also joined the party.

""But somewhere I knew something special has happened to the country and I wanted to experience it one day and that's how my journey began.

""It was the proudest moment of my life, holding that trophy which I chased for 22 years but I never lost hope. I was merely lifting that trophy on behalf of my countrymen.""

The 46-year-old Tendulkar, the highest run-getter in the cricket world, said holding the Laureus trophy has also given him great honour.

He also shared the impact the revolutionary South African leader Nelson Mandela had on him. Tendulkar met him when he was just 19 years old.

""His hardship did not affect his leadership. Out of many messages he left, the most important I felt was that sport has got the power to unite everyone.

""Today sitting in this room with so many athletes, some of them did not have everything but they made the best of everything they had. I thank them for inspiring youngsters to pick a sport of their choice and chase their dreams. This trophy belongs to all of us, it's not just about me.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/legendary-tendulkar-receives-best-laureus-sporting-moment-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/legendary-tendulkar-receives-best-laureus-sporting-moment.html

224,18-2-20,'Infected': Data shows how China criminalized Muslim faith,"For decades, the Uighur imam was a bedrock of his farming community in China's far west. On Fridays, he preached Islam as a religion of peace. On Sundays, he treated the sick with free herbal medicine. In the winter, he bought coal for the poor.

But as a Chinese government mass detention campaign engulfed Memtimin Emer's native Xinjiang region three years ago, the elderly imam was swept up and locked away, along with all three of his sons living in China.

Now, a newly revealed database exposes in extraordinary detail the main reasons for the detentions of Emer, his three sons, and hundreds of others in Karakax County: their religion and their family ties.

The database obtained by The Associated Press profiles the internment of 311 individuals with relatives abroad and lists information on more than 2,000 of their relatives, neighbours and friends.

Each entry includes the detainee's name, address, national identity number, detention date and location, along with a detailed dossier on their family, religious and neighbourhood background, the reason for detention, and a decision on whether or not to release them. Issued within the past year, the documents do not indicate which government department compiled them or for whom.

Taken as a whole, the information offers the fullest and most personal view yet into how Chinese officials decided who to put into and let out of detention camps, as part of a massive crackdown that has locked away more than a million ethnic minorities, most of them Muslims.

The database emphasizes that the Chinese government focused on religion as a reason for detention — not just political extremism, as authorities claim, but ordinary activities such as praying, attending a mosque, or even growing a long beard. It also shows the role of family: People with detained relatives are far more likely to end up in a camp themselves, uprooting and criminalizing entire families like Emer's in the process.

Similarly, family background and attitude is a bigger factor than detainee behaviour in whether they are released.

""It's very clear that religious practice is being targeted,” said Darren Byler, a University of Colorado researcher studying the use of surveillance technology in Xinjiang. “They want to fragment society, to pull the families apart and make them much more vulnerable to retraining and reeducation.”

The Xinjiang regional government did not respond to faxes requesting comment. Asked whether Xinjiang is targeting religious people and their families, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said “this kind of nonsense is not worth commenting on.”

Beijing has said before that the detention centres are for voluntary job training, and that it does not discriminate based on religion.

China has struggled for decades to control Xinjiang, where the native Uighurs have long resented Beijing's heavy-handed rule. With the 9/11 attacks in the United States, officials began using the spectre of terrorism to justify harsher religious restrictions, saying young Uighurs were susceptible to Islamic extremism.

After militants set off bombs at a train station in Xinjiang's capital in 2014, President Xi Jinping launched a so-called “People's War on Terror”, transforming Xinjiang into a digital police state. The leak of the database from sources in the Uighur exile community follows the release in November of a classified blueprint on how the mass detention system really works.

The blueprint obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which includes the AP, showed that the centres are in fact forced ideological and behavioral re-education camps run in secret. Another set of documents leaked to the New York Times revealed the historical lead-up to the mass detention.

The latest set of documents came from sources in the Uighur exile community, and the most recent date in them is March 2019. The detainees listed come from Karakax County, a traditional settlement of about 650,000 on the edge of Xinjiang's Taklamakan desert where more than 97 percent of residents are Uighur.

The list was corroborated through interviews with former Karakax residents, Chinese identity verification tools, and other lists and documents seen by the AP.

Detainees and their families are tracked and classified by rigid, well-defined categories. Households are designated as “trustworthy” or “not trustworthy,"" and their attitudes are graded as “ordinary” or “good.""

Families have “light” or “heavy” religious atmospheres, and the database keeps count of how many relatives of each detainee are locked in prison or sent to a “training centre.""

Officials used these categories to determine how suspicious a person was — even if they hadn't committed any crimes.

“It underscores the witch-hunt mindset of the government, and how the government criminalizes everything,” said Adrian Zenz, an expert on the detention centres and senior fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington, D.C.

Reasons listed for internment include “minor religious infection,” “disturbs other persons by visiting them without reasons,” “relatives abroad,” “thinking is hard to grasp” and “untrustworthy person born in a certain decade."" The last seems to refer to younger men; about 31 percent of people considered “untrustworthy” were in the age bracket of 25 to 29 years, according to an analysis of the data by Zenz.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-infected---data-shows-how-china-criminalized-muslim-faith-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/-infected---data-shows-how-china-criminalized-muslim-faith.html

Abrahams, who chairs a British parliamentary group on Kashmir, was denied entry into India upon her arrival at the New Delhi airport on Monday, with officials saying she was informed in advance that her e-visa had been cancelled.

""The deportation of Debbie Abrahams by India was indeed necessary, as she is not just an MP, but a Pak proxy known for her clasp with Pak govt and ISI. Every attempt that tries to attack India's sovereignty must be thwarted,"" Singhvi tweeted.

Singhvi party colleague Shashi Tharoor had, however, tweeted in support of Abrahams on Monday.

""I find it ironic that some of the same people who applauded me for going to Britain as an Indian MP & telling them off about their colonial misbehaviour, are attacking me for wanting India to grant a British MP the same privilege!

226,18-2-20,New Friends Colony anti-CAA violence: Delhi court sends Sharjeel Imam to judicial custody till Mar 3,"A Delhi court Tuesday sent Sharjeel Imam, named as an ""instigator"" by Delhi Police in its charge sheet on violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at New Friends Colony here last year, to judicial custody till March 3.

Imam was arrested on sedition charges last month in a separate case.

The police has filed the charge sheet before Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Gurmohina Kaur, naming Imam as an instigator of the violence.

It said it has attached CCTV footage, call detail records and statements of over 100 witnesses as evidence in the charge sheet.

The court had on Monday sent Imam to one-day custody of Delhi Police in the case as it wanted to quiz him because an accused - Furkan - in the December 15, 2019 violence case has alleged in his disclosure statement that he was provoked by Imam's speeches.

The police had earlier told the court that Furkan was arrested on the basis of a CCTV footage which showed him carrying a container allegedly containing petrol.

Four people were arrested in the case on December 16 and sent to judicial custody. Furkan was arrested later.

Imam, who came into the limelight during the ongoing protests at Shaheen Bagh here against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens, was arrested from Bihar's Jehanabad on January 28 in a separate case for allegedly making inflammatory speeches at the Jamia Millia Islamia University here and in Aligarh.

A case had been registered against him on sedition and other charges on January 26.

Protestors had torched four public buses and two police vehicles as they clashed with police in New Friends' Colony near Jamia Millia Islamia during the demonstration against the CAA on December 15, leaving nearly 60 people including students, cops and fire fighters injured.

The police used batons and teargas shells to disperse the violent mob. They entered the Jamia university campus, saying that rioters had taken shelter there. However, the Jamia students had denied that they were involved in the violence and had alleged police brutality.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) Chinmoy Biswal had said groups of people, who were coming from the Jamia side, gathered near New Friends' Colony and blocked the road. The protesters, around 1,500, did not pay heed to the police appeals to clear the area.

The protest was being held against the contentious law which seeks to provide citizenship to non-Muslims religious minorities from three neighbouring countries who arrived in India to escape religious persecution before 2015.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/new-friends-colony-anti-caa-violence--delhi-court-sends-sharjeel-imam-to-judicial-custody-till-mar-3-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/new-friends-colony-anti-caa-violence--delhi-court-sends-sharjeel-imam-to-judicial-custody-till-mar-3.html
227,18-2-20,Dedicated to free metro rides for women: Delhi Minister,"Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will remain committed to the free metro ride scheme for the women here.

Speaking to IANS, Gahlot said the Delhi government will pursue the Central government for the implementation of the scheme.

""We are dedicated to all our promises. The government has also started working. We will be pursuing the Centre to allow us to implement the scheme. We will bear the cost burden of the scheme. We will be paying the amount to the Delhi Metro,"" Gahlot told IANS.

Last year on June 3, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced that women can ""enjoy free rides on public transport"" in the national capital, including the Metro and DTC buses.

While the AAP implemented the free ride scheme for women in the DTC and cluster buses in Delhi in October, the same for Delhi Metro is yet to take place.

The Delhi and the Central governments equally own the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation and for any decision, the two need to be on the same page.

Delhi went to polls this month and the AAP was re-elected. The Cabinet Ministers remained unchanged with minor changes in their portfolios.

Gahlot continues to have the Transport Department in the new government as well.

He said his party got a clear mandate as the party had worked for the people in the last five years.

""We have been loved by the people for our work. This was the first election where votes were given for work. We have started the work already and the focus will be on the promises we have made in the elections,"" said the Minister and the MLA from the Najafgarh Assembly constituency.

Gahlot has set a new record by being elected for a second time from the seat.

229,18-2-20,Affidavit case: SC reserves verdict on plea of Fadnavis to review order asking him to face trial,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday reserved its verdict on former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis' plea seeking review of its 2019 judgement asking the BJP leader to face trial for allegedly failing to furnish details of pending criminal cases against him in his 2014 poll affidavit.

Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing Fadnavis, told a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra the issue will have very far reaching consequences for other candidates fighting elections and the top court needs to re-examine its October 1, 2019 decision.

In its judgment last year, the apex court had set aside the Bombay High Court order which gave a clean chit to Fadnavis and held that he did not deserve to be tried for the alleged offence under the Representation of Peoples Act (RPA).

During arguments, Rohatgi said a candidate can be criminally prosecuted for violating the two conditions of not disclosing cases where charges have been framed and where he or she has been convicted.

""This will seal my fate. It is an important question as it affects Article 21. This is a matter which requires a re-look,"" Rohatgi told the bench, also comprising justices Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose.

The apex court's verdict had come on an appeal by one Satish Ukey, who had challenged the high court's order.

On July 23, 2019 the top court, while reserving the verdict on Ukey's plea, had said that the alleged ""omission"" by Fadnavis of not disclosing information about two criminal cases in his election affidavit may be decided in the trial.

The apex court had said that it was concerned with a limited issue whether prima facie Section 125A of the RP Act is attracted or not.

The provision deals with the penalty for ""filing false affidavit"" and says that if a candidate or his proposer fails to furnish or gives false or conceals any information in his nomination paper on issues like pending criminal cases then the person may be awarded six months jail term or fine or both.

Ukey had contended the BJP leader filed a false affidavit by not disclosing two criminal matters and yet the trial court and the high court held that no prima facie case was made out for prosecution of the chief minister.

He had said that a candidate was under mandatory legal obligation to disclose details of all cases, in which either charges have been framed or the trial court had taken cognizance, in nomination papers.

The petitioner had alleged that Fadnavis, in his election affidavit filed in 2014, had failed to disclose the pendency of two criminal cases against him.

It was contended that the chief minister did not disclose the information as required of him under the election law and the non-disclosure of these two pending criminal cases was in violation of Section 125A of the RP Act and constituted an offence in itself.

The two cases of alleged cheating and forgery were filed against Fadnavis in 1996 and 1998 but charges were not framed.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/affidavit-case--sc-reserves-verdict-on-plea-of-fadnavis-to-review-order-asking-him-to-face-trial-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/affidavit-case--sc-reserves-verdict-on-plea-of-fadnavis-to-review-order-asking-him-to-face-trial.html
230,18-2-20,Poonam's three wickets help India edge out WI in World Cup warm-up,"Spinner Poonam Yadav claimed three wickets as India geared up for the ICC women's T20 World Cup with a thrilling two-run win over the West Indies in a low-scoring warm-up match here on Tuesday.

Electing to bat, India posted a lowly 107 for eight in their stipulated 20 overs before returning to restrict West Indies to 105 for seven.

Chasing 108 to win, West Indies were comfortably placed at 57 for one in 13 overs when Deepti Sharma struck, cleaning up opener Lee-Ann Kirby (42) to trigger a collapse.

Soon skipper Stafanie Taylor (16), Chedean Nation (0) and Deandra Dottin (1) were back in the hut as West Indies slipped to 67 for five in the 17th over.

Hayley Matthews (25) and Chinelle Henry (17) blasted three fours and a six in the 19th over to leave them with 11 to get off the last six balls.

Henry blasted Poonam for a four but the Indian dismissed Matthews in the fourth ball.

West Indies needed three runs off the last ball but Henry was caught by Veda Krishnamurthy.

Earlier, India's top-three failed to fire as they were reduced to 17 for three in 3.1 overs.

Opener Smriti Mandhana (4) lasted just six balls, while Jemimah Rodrigues (0) failed to open her account. Young Shafali Verma blasted a couple of fours before being caught by Britney Cooper off Shamilia Connell (2/20).

Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (11), too, didn't stay long, while Krishnamurthy was cleaned up by Afy Fletcher (1/26), as India slumped to 52 for five in 11.2 overs.

Deepti Sharma made a 32-ball 21 before becoming a victim of Anisa Mohammed (2/16), while Pooja Vastrakar (13) was removed by Aaliyah Alleyne (1/9). Stafanie taylor then got rid of Taniya Bhatia for 10.

Shikha Pandey finally smashed a 16-ball 24 to give some respectability to the total.

Brief score:

India women: 107 for 8 in 20 overs (Shikha Pandey 24; A Mohammed 2/16) West Indies women: 105 for 7 in 20 overs (Lee-Ann Kirby 42; Poonam Yadav 3/20).",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/poonam-s-three-wickets-help-india-edge-out-wi-in-world-cup-warm-up-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/poonam-s-three-wickets-help-india-edge-out-wi-in-world-cup-warm-up.html

The world famous Goa carnival begins on February 22.

The opposition parties earlier questioned imposition of Section 144 of CrPC in the coastal state, saying such a move would adversely affect the tourism industry.

236,18-2-20,Godse or Gandhi?'' Kishor dares Nitish,"Poll strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor on Tuesday mocked Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for aligning with the BJP in his quest for power, and said the JD(U) leader cannot be wedded to Gandhian ideals and stand with those who support Godse at the same time.

Addressing a crowded press conference here, the first since his expulsion from the JD(U), which Kumar heads, Kishor asserted that the chief minister has been a ""father figure"" to him even before he formally joined the party and so he wished to speak no ill of him.

Kishor, however, acknowledged that he had differences with Kumar over the contradiction in his avowed commitment to the principles of Gandhi and his tie-up with the BJP, the party the poll strategist sought to identify with the Mahatma's assassin Nathuram Godse.

""Nitish ji has always said that he cannot leave the ideals of Gandhi, JP and Lohia... At the same time, how can he be with the people who support the ideology of Godse? Both cannot go together. If you want to stay with the BJP, I don't have any problem with it but you cannot be on both sides,"" Kishore said.

""There has been a lot of discussion between me and Nitish ji on this. He has his thought process and I have mine. There have been differences between him and me that the ideologies of Godse and Gandhi cannot stand together. As the leader of the party you have to say which side you are on,"" he added.

He also said that unlike the JD(U) rank and file for whom the chief minister's accomplishments in governance had become the ""gold standard"", he had been candid enough to point out that being a better performer than the past RJD governments will not suffice since the state still lagged behind most others in terms of development.

Kishor, whose first claim to fame was his handling of Narendra Modi's prime ministerial campaign of 2014, seemed to be still smarting under Kumar's statement that he was inducted into the JD(U) on the recommendation of Amit Shah.

""My association with various political parties as a strategist is well known. I have never kept it a secret. But I had not joined the JD(U) as an agent of some other party. If speaking a lie makes things easier for Nitish Kumar, then I grant this to a man who is like a father figure to me,"" he said.

Kishor said that in 2014, when Kumar had fought the Lok Sabha polls alone after having parted ways with the BJP and was drubbed, returning with only two seats, ""he was still the pride of Bihar"".

""Compare that with the situation today when a Gujarati leader from another party (an allusion to Shah) has to give the assurance that Kumar will be the NDA leader in the assembly polls as if he was not the leader of the people of the state but a manager of a firm,"" Kishor said.

""Bihar cannot bear to see its leader becoming a 'pichhlaggu' (piggybacking). Nitish Kumar, who had once famously thwarted Narendra Modi from campaigning for the BJP in Bihar, cut a sorry figure recently when he spoke at rallies in Delhi assembly polls like a mere sidekick while Shah and J P Nadda were running the show,"" he lamented.

Kishor also rubbished the contention that a tie-up with the BJP was in the interest of Bihar, a claim Kumar has been making to defend his realignment with the saffron party after a four-year estrangement.

""Did the state get a special status, a demand he has been making for so long. He is so helpless that when he begged for grant of central status to Patna University with folded hands, Modi did not deign to acknowledge,"" he said, recalling the prime minister's visit to the city in October 2017.

Spelling out the failures of Nitish Kumar during his 15-year stint as chief minister, Kishor said he provided students free uniforms and bicycles but failed to ensure good educational standards.

Kumar got roads built but could not help the people prosper so they could own vehicles. He improved electricity supply but most cannot afford beyond a light bulb and a fan, Kishor said.

""He gloats over the states budget having risen from Rs 30,000 crore to Rs 2 lakh crore. Without taking away the credit from him, we must remember that much of this has happened because of inflation,"" he said.

Kishor said Kumar should be asked why people from Bihar migrate to other states for better education and career prospects, and when will the state rise to a level that people from other parts of the country would come here looking for greener pastures.

Kishor, whose collaboration with leaders such as Mamata Banerjee and Arvind Kejriwal fuelled speculations about his political course in Bihar, made it clear that he was not thinking in terms of floating a new political party.

He, however, unveiled an ambitious ""medium to long- term campaign"" for pulling the state up by its bootstraps and named it ""Baat Bihar Ki"".

He claimed that enrolment of volunteers for the project was already under way and more than 2 lakh young people, many of whom are active members of political parties, have signed up.

""We intend to enroll up to one million people in the next 100 days. This is an aspirational drive aimed at transforming the state's politics and not an attempt to build a new party.

""In fact, the political leadership of the current generation be it Nitish Kumar or Sushil Kumar Modi (deputy CM and BJP leader) or anybody else are welcome to lend their support if they identify with the cause,"" Kishor said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/prashant-kishor-questions-nitish-kumar-s-development-model-in-bihar-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/--which-side-are-you-on---godse-or-gandhi----kishor-dares-nitish.html
237,18-2-20,11 attack as ''Hindu terror'': Maria,"Former Mumbai police commissioner Rakesh Maria has claimed that the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) had planned to project the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack as a case of ""Hindu terror"" and Pakistani terrorist Mohammed Ajmal Kasab to die as Bengaluru's Samir Chaudhari.

In his memoir 'Let Me Say It Now' released on Monday, Maria mentioned about the investigation helmed by him in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack, which was planned by LeT and Pakistan hand was also unearthed.

According to excerpts from the book, (Pakistan's) ISI and LeT were striving to eliminate Kasab in the jail as he was the key evidence linking them with the attack and Dawood Ibrahim's gang was tasked with eliminating him.

While describing LeT's plan to project the 26/11 attack as ""Hindu Terror"", Maria wrote, ""If everything went according to plan, Kasab would have died as Chaudhari and the media would have blamed 'Hindu terrorists' for the attack.""

The terror organisation had also reportedly planted fake ID cards with Indian addresses on the terrorists, he mentioned.

On a photograph of Kasab released after the terror attack, Maria mentioned ""it was the handiwork of central agencies. The Mumbai Police tried hard to not disclose any details to media fearing for the security.""

In the photograph, Kasab was seen wearing a red thread on his right wrist, which is believed to be a sacred Hindu thread. This led many to believe the theory that the perpetrators were planning to blame the 26/11 attacks as 'Hindu terror'.

""There would have been screaming headlines in newspapers claiming how Hindu terrorists had attacked Mumbai. Over the top TV journalists would have made a beeline for Bengaluru to interview his family and neighbours. But alas, it had not worked that way and here he was, Ajmal Amir Kasab of Faridkot in Pakistan,"" Maria wrote in the book.

He also said that martyred Mumbai constable Tukaram Omble's heroic feat of capturing Kasab alive was key to foiling this plan.

According to the book, ""Kasab joined the ranks of LeT to commit robberies and had nothing to do with jihad. Such, however, was the indoctrination, that Kasab was made to believe that Muslims were not allowed to offer namaaz in India.""

He was, thus, shocked when his visit to a mosque near Metro cinema was facilitated, Maria mentions in the book.

238,18-2-20,"Now, Nirbhaya rapists to hang on March 3","Death warrant issued for third time even as convicts’ bids on to exploit legal lecunas

A Delhi court on Monday issued fresh death warrants against the four death-row convicts in the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case. The four convicts will be now hanged to death on March 3 at 6 am. This is the third time that death warrants have been issued against them.

Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Dharmender Rana issued fresh warrants against death row convicts Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31).

The first date of execution, January 22, was postponed to February 1 by a January 17 court order. Then the trial court on January 31 stayed “till further orders” the execution of the four convicts as they had not exhausted all their legal remedies.

Mukesh on Monday told the court that he didn’t want to be represented by advocate Vrinda Grover, after which advocate Ravi Qazi was picked to represent him.

The court was also informed that Vinay is on hunger strike. Vinay was assaulted in jail and has head injuries, his lawyer told the court, adding that he was suffering from acute mental illness and hence the death sentence cannot be carried out. The court directed the Tihar Jail superintendent to take appropriate care of Vinay as per law.

Pawan’s counsel informed the court that he wanted to move curative petition and the mercy plea against the death sentence before the President.

Pawan is the only one among the four convicts who has not yet filed the curative petition — the last legal remedy available to a person, which is decided in-chamber.

Akshay’s counsel informed the court that he has prepared a fresh mercy petition to be moved before the President.

The court was hearing the applications by Nirbhaya’s parents and the Delhi Government, seeking fresh death warrants for the convicts after the Supreme Court granted liberty to the authorities to approach the trial court for issuance of fresh date for the execution of these convicts.

Last Thursday, the court had appointed Qazi to represent Gupta after being informed by Tihar jail authorities that the death row convict refused to choose a lawyer offered by Delhi Legal Services Authorities (DLSA).

A day before that the court had expressed displeasure over the delay in the process from Gupta’s side, after convict’s father informed the court that he had removed his earlier lawyer and would need time to engage a new one.

The 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who came to be known as ‘Nirbhaya’ (fearless), was gang-raped and savagely assaulted on the night of December 16, 2012, in a moving bus in South Delhi. She died of her injuries a fortnight later in a Singapore hospital.

Six people, including the four convicts, Ram Singh and a juvenile, were named as accused.

The trial of the five adult men began in a special fast-track court in March 2013. Ram Singh, the prime accused, allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself in Tihar jail days after the trial began. The juvenile, who was said to be the most brutal of the attackers, was put in a correctional home for three years.

The juvenile was released in 2015 and sent to an undisclosed location amid concerns over a threat to his life. He, when released, was 20 years old.

Mukesh, Vinay, Akshay and Pawan were sentenced to death in September 2013 by the trial court which was challenged by them in higher courts.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/now--nirbhaya-rapists-to-hang-on-march-3-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/now--nirbhaya-rapists-to-hang-on-march-3.html
239,18-2-20,"Protest a right, but can’t block roads, SC tells Shaheen Bagh","Court asks senior advocate Hegde to persuade anti-CAA protesters to shift

Blockade of the public road at Shaheen Bagh is “troubling us”, the Supreme Court said on Monday and suggested that the anti-CAA protesters go to another site where no public place would be blocked.

The SC asked senior advocate Sanjay Hegde to “play a constructive role as an interlocutor” to persuade the protesters to move to an alternative site. People have a fundamental right to protest “peacefully and lawfully” but blocking public roads and public places is a matter of concern as it might lead to “chaotic situation”, the apex court said, stressing that there has to be a “balancing factor”.

“Democracy works on expression of views but there are lines and boundaries for it,” a bench of Justices SK Kaul and KM Joseph said, adding, “The question which is arising is where to protest.”

“Our concern is if everybody starts blocking public areas then where will it end,” the bench asked.

The SC said Hegde can take assistance of advocate Sadhana Ramachandran and former Chief Information Commissioner Wajahat Habibullah for talking to the protesters.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Delhi Government and the Delhi Police, told the court that the solution is to remove these protesters from the site. “We will not go that far but the problem is that they (protesters) are keeping children and women as shield. We have held a series of meetings with the local resident welfare associations, priests of mosques there and we are trying to persuade them that this is not the way to keep entire city to hostage under the garb of protest,” Mehta said.

When the bench asked Hegde to talk to protestors, Mehta said, “Let a message not go that every institution is kneeling on its knees in trying to persuade them... I do not want a message to go that we are praying to them to remove”.

The Bench, however, observed, “We want to solve the problem and we have expressed our opinion. If nothing works, we will leave it to the authorities to deal with the situation”.

The bench also asked Mehta whether an alternative site can be given to the protesters to hold their agitation. “It is unfortunate that we have to make designated area for protests like Jantar Mantar. We have so many professional protesters,” Mehta said.

“It is important to allow people to protest,” the bench said, adding, “The right to protest is recognised world over, more particularly in India. There is a fundamental right to assemble peacefully to protest”.

At the outset, the bench said people or any section of the society have a right to protest against a law and they also have the right to express their grievance against it. “Whether traffic flow can be managed from here or there is not the issue. Today, it is protest against a legislation. Tomorrow, there may be protest against different legislation. The issue is if people start blocking roads and public places, what will happen then,” the bench said and posted the matter for hearing on February 24.

The bench also dealt with an intervention application filed by Bhim Army chief Chandra Shekhar Azad and two others, including Habibullah. The counsel appearing for the interveners told the court that protest has been going on and it is not that people of only one faith are agitating there.

The bench said a “lot of heat” has been generated on the issue and protesters have made their point as the agitation is going on for quite some time. When the bench was informed that children were not able to go to schools due to the protest, the bench said, “There must be a balancing factor. You may protest, may be, somewhere else. If this (blockade of public place during protests) applies to other places, this may lead to chaos”.

“Somebody who may not be on the same page as you may get an idea to start a protest somewhere else? Then where do we end?” the bench said, adding, the people may “emulate” Shaheen Bagh also. “It is not a pleasant task which we have taken upon ourself,” the bench said, adding, “It should have been done by the executive”.

The top court also said in an age of social media, there is a tendency for anyone to go overboard. When the bench asked Hegde to talk to protesters, the senior advocate said he would be glad to assist retired apex court judge Justice Kurian Joseph on this. At this, Mehta said a former judge of the top court should not be asked to persuade protesters.

The counsel for one of the petitioners said interim directions should be passed so that school vans and ambulances could be allowed to ply on the road which has been blocked by the protesters since December 15 last year. Restrictions have been imposed on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch and the Okhla underpass, which were closed on December 15 last year due to protests against CAA and National Register of Citizens.

The apex court was hearing an appeal filed by advocate Amit Sahni, who had approached the Delhi High Court seeking directions to the Delhi Police to ensure smooth traffic flow on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch, which was blocked by anti-CAA protesters on December 15 last year.

Separately, former BJP MLA Nand Kishore Garg has filed a plea in the apex court seeking directions to authorities to remove protestors from Shaheen Bagh.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/protest-a-right--but-can---t-block-roads--sc-tells-shaheen-bagh-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/protest-a-right--but-can---t-block-roads--sc-tells-shaheen-bagh.html
240,18-2-20,"UK MP, leading anti-India Kashmir opinion, lands at IGIA, packed off to Dubai","British MP Debbie Abrahams — at the forefront of creating opinion against India on the Kashmir issue after the special status to the State under Article 370 was abolished — was stopped at the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) in Delhi on Monday and deported to Dubai.

The Labour Party parliamentarian, also the chairperson of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Kashmir in Britain, was not allowed entry into India and was told upon her arrival at the airport that her e-visa had been rejected.

The British MP said in a statement that she arrived in Delhi on Monday morning and was informed that her e-visa, which was valid till October 2020, had been cancelled. Countering her claims, the Union Home Ministry spokesperson said the British parliamentarian had been duly informed that her visa was cancelled and she arrived in Delhi despite that.

Reacting to Home Ministry’s clarification, she said she had “not received any emails before February 13”. After that, she had been travelling and was away from office. In her statement, Abrahams said she had presented herself at the immigration desk along with her documents and e-visa.

“...The official looked at his screen and started shaking his head. Then he told me my visa was rejected, took my passport and disappeared for about 10 minutes. When he came back he was very rude and aggressive shouting at me to ‘come with me’. I told him not to speak to me like that and was then taken to a cordoned off area marked as a Deportee Cell. He then ordered me to sit down and I refused. I didn’t know what they might do or where else they may take me, so I wanted people to see me,” the British MP said.

The immigration officer disappeared again, she said, adding that she phoned her sister-in-law’s cousin who she was going to be staying with. “Kai got in touch with the British High Commission and he tried to find out what was going on,” she wrote on Twitter. She said later several immigration officials came to her but none of them knew why her e-visa was cancelled. “Even the person who seemed to be in charge said he didn’t know and was really sorry about what had happened.”

The British MP said she was waiting for her deportation. “So now I am just waiting to be deported ... Unless the Indian Government has a change of heart. I’m prepared to let the fact that I’ve been treated like a criminal go, and I hope they will let me visit my family and friends,” she said before being deported to Dubai in the evening.

According to senior officials, she was well aware that her e-visa was cancelled and tried to test her fortunes by landing from Dubai. “From her statements it is clear that she was caught by Immigration officials after checking the computer. This itself shows that her e-visa was cancelled and the computer showed it,” said senior officials from the Bureau Immigration.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/uk-mp--leading-anti-india-kashmir-opinion--lands-at-igia--packed-off-to-dubai.html

O'Farrell, 60, will succeed Harinder Sidhu who has been in the office since 2016.

""Barry O'Farrell is Australia's next High Commissioner to the Republic of India - one of our closest and most significant partners in the Indo-Pacific. Thanks to outgoing HC Harinder Sidhu,"" Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne tweeted on Tuesday.

The minister said that apart from his new role, O'Farrell will also have non-resident accreditation to Bhutan.

“Australia and Bhutan enjoy a warm relationship, built on strong people-to-people links and cooperation on international education” she said.

O'Farrell served in the NSW Parliament from 1995-2015, including as the state's 43rd premier.

244,18-2-20,Boult back for India Tests,"Fit-again senior pacer Trent Boult has been named in the 13-member New Zealand squad for the first Test against India starting at Basin Reserve on February 21.

According to a media release issued by New Zealand Cricket, the 6 feet 8 inch giant pacer Kyle Jamieson, who made his ODI debut against India in the recent series, has also earned his call up in the Test squad, which will have slow left-arm orthodox Ajaz Patel as the only spinner.

Boult’s comeback is a big boost for the New Zealand side as he missed the entire limited overs leg due to a fractured right hand.

“It’s terrific to have Trent back with us and we’re looking forward to the energy and experience he adds to the group alongside his obvious class with the ball in hand,” head coach and chief selector Gary Stead said.

Jamieson, on the other hand, has been included in a pre-series Test squad for the first time.

“Kyle will offer us a point of difference with the bounce he could extract on what is traditionally a good surface in Wellington,” Stead said.

Mumbai-born Patel was chosen over leg-spinner Ish Sodhi because of his consistency.

“We’re excited to welcome back Ajaz (Patel) who has done a great job for us overseas and has a proven domestic record in New Zealand conditions,” the coach said.

Daryl Mitchell of Northern Districts is also in the squad as a batting all-rounder.

“Daryl showed his batting prowess in his Test debut against England in Hamilton and he naturally offers us great versatility with the different roles he can play,” Stead said.

Tom Blundell will continue to open the batting along side Tom Latham following his breakthrough century in Melbourne.

The Wellington Test will also be Ross Taylor’s 100th Test, joining ranks with his former teammates Brendon McCullum, Daniel Vettori and Stephen Fleming.

Taylor will become the first cricketer in the world to complete 100 games across three international formats.

“To play 100 Tests for your country is an incredible achievement and a testament to his work ethic and complete professionalism,” Stead said of Taylor.",dont-miss,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/dont-miss/boult-back-for-india-tests.html

Special Judge Ajay Kumar Kuhar granted the relief to Karti while asking him to share his itinerary with the investigation agencies.

Karti's lawyer Arshdeep Khurana had said in the application that his client wanted to travel to the United Kingdom and France between February 17 and March 1 to attend tennis tournaments and also attend some business meetings.

Karti's daughter is a student at the University of Cambridge, UK, and he is required to visit her, the application had said.

The court, while granting anticipatory bail to Karti, had imposed various conditions, including that he will not leave the country without its prior permission.

The court had on January 28 ""revived"" the Aircel-Maxis cases filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate against Chidambaram and his son that were earlier adjourned 'sine die'.

The probe agencies had submitted the status report of the ED's investigation in a sealed cover on the directions of the court.

""As far as the ED probe is concerned, active investigation is going on in the case. As far as the CBI's investigation was concerned, charge sheet has been filed,"" ED's special public prosecutor Nitesh Rana had said.

The CBI status report had stated that LR has been sent to Malaysia and there has been development, adding that it was also probing a new lead.

The case was adjourned 'sine die' -- without fixing any date for hearing -- on September 5 last year with the court noting that the two probe agencies were seeking ""adjournment after adjournment"".

The court had also granted anticipatory bail to the father-son duo. It has been challenged in the Delhi High Court, which will hear the matter on March 4.

The trail court took up the matter on its own on January 28 and sought the status report from the CBI and the ED. They however sought more time and the court granted them two weeks.

It had on September 5 last year granted anticipatory bail to Chidambaram and Karti in the corruption case filed by the CBI as well as in the money laundering case lodged by the ED in relation to the Aircel-Maxis deal.

The probe agencies were investigating how Karti Chidambaram received clearance from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) for the Aircel-Maxis deal in 2006 when his father was the Union finance minister.

The CBI and the ED had alleged that P Chidambaram, as finance minister during the United Progressive Alliance rule, granted approval to the deal beyond his capacity benefitting certain persons, and received kickbacks.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/aircel-maxis-case--court-allows-karti-chidambaram-to-travel-abroad-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/aircel-maxis-case--court-allows-karti-chidambaram-to-travel-abroad.html
250,18-2-20,Women in non-combat command,"SC also orders permanent commission for women in Army within 3 months

In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court on Monday opened the way for women in command positions in the Army and directed the Centre to grant permanent commission to all women officers within three months. The apex court orders, on grounds of the need to end gender bias in the Armed forces, will directly benefit more than 300 women officers, including making them eligible for pension.

The women officers, however, will not be inducted into the combat arms such as the infantry, artillery and armoured corps as the Supreme Court clarified that their deployment is a matter of policy as held by the Delhi High Court and the competent authority has to look into it.

While directing the Centre to grant permanent commission, the court termed the Government’s argument of physiological limitations and social norms for denying them command posts as “disturbing.”

The court said women officers in the past have brought laurels to the country and change of mindset is required on the part of the Government to put an end to gender bias in Armed forces. A Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud said there will not be any absolute bar on giving women command postings.

The top court said despite there being no stay on the 2010 Delhi High Court verdict allowing grant of permanent commission to women officers, the Centre showed scant regard in implementing the directive in the past one decade.

“There is no reason and justification for the union of India not to act as per the Delhi High Court verdict. On September 2, 2011, the Supreme Court clarified this aspect and said there is no stay on the High Court verdict. Despite that scant regard has been paid to the verdict of the HC and the order of Supreme Court as well,” the Bench said.

The SC said it is of the opinion that physiological features of women have no effect in granting permanent commission and they have to be given equal opportunity on a par with their male counterparts in the armed forces.

It said the Centre’s submission of physiological limitation is based on flawed notion and there is no constitutional basis to deny them equal opportunity. The SC said permanent commission can be given to women officers in the Army irrespective of their tenure of service.

On February 9, serving women officers in the Indian Army had countered the Centre’s stand in the SC on denying command posts to women on the ground of their physiological limitations, terming it not only “regressive but also completely contrary to the demonstrated record and statistics.” In their written submission to the court, the women officers had sought rejection of the submission of the Centre and said it is unfortunate that such grounds have been raised, which are completely contrary to the demonstrated records of the case.

The women officers had said they have been serving in the 10 Combat Support Arms, for the last 27 to 28 years and have proven their mettle and courage under fire. The written submission had also said the women officers have demonstrated that they do not lack in any manner in the roles that have been assigned to them.

The women officers had said according to the policy letter dated February 25, 2019, permanent commission to women officers is being confined to “staff appointments only”, as against “criteria appointments/command appointments”.

They had contended that no such confinement of women officers to staff appointments only, has ever been contemplated or notified in any of the advertisements or policy decisions since 1992, when women were first inducted into the Indian Army.

The Centre had submitted a written note in the apex court, containing the proposal of the government, that points out to several issues, including “physical prowess” and “physiological limitations” as challenges for women officers to meet exigencies of service in the Army.

In its written note, the Centre had said women officers up to 14 years of service would be considered for permanent commissions and further career progression in staff appointments only. It said women officers above 14 years of service would be permitted to serve up to 20 years without consideration for permanent commission and would be released with pensionary benefits subject to meeting disciplinary and medical criteria.

Women Army officers welcomed the Supreme Court order, saying it will help in uplifting women across the country and not just in the Armed forces.

Talking to reporters outside the court premises here after the SC order, a woman officer, who was accompanied by some other women colleagues from the Army, said whoever qualifies for the job should be given the opportunity to command.

Advocate Meenakshi Lekhi, who appeared for women officers, said the apex court judgment has given equal rights to the women officers as their male counterparts.She said a long-pending right has been given to women officers through this order.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/women-in-non-combat-command-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/women-in-non-combat-command.html
251,18-2-20,5 theatre commands for modern warefare by 2022,"With the objective of fighting modern-day warfare, India will roll out two to five theatre commands by 2022 to take care of security challenges along the western (Pakistan) and northern (China) borders.

While Jammu & Kashmir will be a separate theatre, the western and eastern Navy commands will operate as one and known as peninsular command to guard the strategically important Indian Ocean, Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat said here on Monday.

Stressing that his charter as CDS is clearly enunciated, he said the mandate is to achieve jointness and synergy between the three Services by undertaking these reforms.

Rawat said the theatre commands will be geographically defined and demarcated and a study will be conducted from March 31 onwards. The study will be submitted for scrutiny by the end of next year and hopefully the commands will roll out by 2020, said Rawat, adding the study groups will evaluate the options of number of commands which could vary from two to five. At present, the three Services have their own commands and operate in silos.

The proposed theatre commands will see assimilation of assets of three services to fight the war. The US and China have similar commands but the CDS said India need not follow those examples and instead have own models to meet our requirements.

Interacting with a group of journalists here, Rawat also said he favoured staggered procurement of weapons and equipment so as to take care of the needs of the Army, Navy and IAF.

Elaborating upon the procurement issue, he said the focus is on prioritisation given the Budget and he was for buying weapons in tranches. Giving an example, he said if the Navy said it needs 10 submarines, the IAF wants aircraft and the Army 1,000 tanks, one option is that only one service will benefit if we go for large numbers in one go. However, if procurement is prioritised, then all the services can procure limited number of weapons at regular intervals, thereby, maintaining operational readiness, Rawat said.

Asked about the IAF’s proposed acquisition of 114 aircraft, the CDS said a new approach of staggered acquisition was getting firmed up. Similarly, he favoured buying submarines instead of the third aircraft carrier.

Justifying his philosophy, Rawat said an aircraft carrier takes seven to ten years to build. Moreover, the second aircraft carrier INS Vikrant will be ready by next year and let the Navy evaluate its performance and then a call will be taken about the third carrier as mooted by the Service, he said.

On the proposed peninsular command to be formed by merging the Indian Navy’s eastern and western commands, he said it is likely to take shape by end of 2021. The tri-services command under a naval commander will have air assets as well as support of the Army, and it will take care of entire responsibility of maritime security challenge in the Indian Ocean Region.

“The security of Indian Ocean region has to be dealt with by one commander and he will not be required to get approval from Delhi for operational matters including movement of ships,” said Rawat. He said the proposed air defence command is likely to be rolled out by middle of next year and certain air assets like missiles of the Indian Army and the Navy will be part of it. He also said it the first priority right now and the IAF will be lead agency. A study group headed by the IAF Vice Chief on this issue will submit its report by April and the command will come into being within a year, Rawat said.

The CDS also said the Government plans to have a separate training and doctrinal command modelled on similar structure in the US, while a separate command will be set up to take care of logistical requirements of the three services. Similarly, the IAF is studying the feasibility of training fighter pilots of various type of aircraft at its Gwalior instead of training at different locations at present. Also efforts are to enhance the pilot-aircraft ratio by even deploying those now working in administration wing of the IAF, the CDS said. His department is also looking at a proposal for having a logistics command to supply common equipment used by all the three services.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/5-theatre-commands-for-modern-warefare-by-2022-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/5-theatre-commands-for-modern-warefare-by-2022.html
252,18-2-20,Secret to good sleep,"A safe, non-toxic mattress determines whether your child sleeps well. PANKAJ GUPTA tells you things to look out for

One of the most important decisions a parent can make is choosing an organic kids mattress. Sleep is critical to your child’s health and well-being, and since kids spend more than one third of their lives in direct exposure to their mattress materials it’s crucial to their health that those mattress materials be safe, organic and non-toxic.

A safe, non-toxic mattress can determine whether your child sleeps well or not. Kids are more vulnerable to the toxins in mattresses since their fragile organ and elimination systems are developing and they can’t easily detoxify. During sleep, children’s bodies work to recover from the accumulation of toxins and stress from their day. The cells attempt to regenerate and the body tries to eliminate toxins. The last thing you want to do is introduce more toxins from your child’s mattress.

The way to ensure a non-toxic sleep environment is to avoid polyurethane foam, memory foam and other synthetic materials. Also avoid mattresses with fire retardants. Your kids need a mattress with good quality organic, non-toxic materials.

While firm support for your child is the most important feature in a safer mattress for kids, comfort counts too! Many mattresses contain conventional cotton fiber (treated with pesticides), synthetic filling materials made with harmful chemicals, or polyurethane foam for comfort.

Pay attention to how your child sleeps to help you select the ideal comfort and support levels needed in the best organic mattress for their needs.

Side Sleepers: If your child sleeps on their side, they need a little more cushion to reduce tension and pressure on their developing skeletal system. Check out the Naturepedic Verse with encased coil support if your child is older or a side sleeper. You can also get a quilted mattress pad to provide extra comfort.

Tummy Sleepers: For kids who sleep on their stomachs, a firm mattress is important to help reduce pressure on the back and shoulders.

Back Sleepers: If your big kid sleeps on their back, this is the best position for spinal health! Medium or cushion firm support is great for back sleepers, but remember that kids need a little more firmness than adults.

Be careful of what you pay for. A cheap bend may not necessarily be the safest option for your child. When buying a bed for your toddler, it is important to consider their weight and age. The changeover from cot to a regular bed should occur between 18 and 36 months.

One of the most important things that matter for a sleeping child is their spine support. Both the neck and spine must be in a neutral position. This reduces stress and encourages spinal growth.

The spine of a toddler can grow up to 1.5 cm at night, and this comes from filling of the intervertebral discs between the vertebrae with water. This means the mattress should be soft enough to make them comfortable, yet stable enough to prevent sinking in.

It can be tempting to save money by going with the smallest mattress for a small child, but consider the big picture. Children grow quickly, and the ideal mattress will be one with a long lifespan that can adjust to a child’s needs as he or she gets bigger. To avoid having to go through the process again in just a year or two, it’s best to buy the highest quality you can afford with the long-term in mind.

253,18-2-20,Poor sleep can increase heart disease risk in women,"Women who sleep poorly tend to overeat and consume a lower-quality diet, say researchers, adding that poor sleep quality can increase the risk of heart disease and obesity.

Previous studies have shown that people who get less sleep are more likely to develop obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease--and that the relationship may be partially explained by diet.

The current study, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, was designed to get a more comprehensive picture in women by examining associations between overall diet quality and multiple aspects of sleep quality.

""Women are particularly prone to sleep disturbances across the life span, because they often shoulder the responsibilities of caring for children and family and, later, because of menopausal hormones,"" said Indian-origin researcher and study senior author Brooke Aggarwal from Columbia University Vagelos.

For the findings, the researchers analysed the sleep and eating habits of an ethnically diverse group of 495 women, ages 20 to 76.

The study looked at sleep quality, the time it took to fall asleep, and insomnia.

The women also reported on the types and amounts of foods they typically eat throughout the year, allowing researchers to measure their typical dietary patterns.

Similar to previous studies of sleep and diet, the study found that those with worse overall sleep quality consumed more of the added sugars associated with obesity and diabetes.

Women who took longer to fall asleep had higher caloric intake and ate more food by weight, the researchers said.

And women with more severe insomnia symptoms consumed more food by weight and fewer unsaturated fats than women with milder insomnia.

""Our interpretation is that women with poor-quality sleep could be overeating during subsequent meals and making more unhealthy food choices,"" said Aggarwal.

""Poor sleep quality may lead to excessive food and calorie intake by stimulating hunger signals or suppressing signals of fullness,"" said study lead author Faris Zuraikat.

""Fullness is largely affected by the weight or volume of food consumed, and it could be that women with insomnia consume a greater amount of food in an effort to feel full,"" Zuraikat added.

""However, it's also possible that poor diet has a negative impact on women's sleep quality, eating more could also cause gastrointestinal discomfort, for instance, making it harder to fall asleep or remain asleep,"" Zuraikat concluded.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/poor-sleep-can-increase-heart-disease-risk-in-women-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/poor-sleep-can-increase-heart-disease-risk-in-women.html
254,18-2-20,Mediterranean diet may boost gut bacteria linked to 'healthy ageing': Study,"Eating a Mediterranean diet, which includes meals built around fruits and vegetables, boosts gut bacteria linked to 'healthy' ageing, while suppressing microbes associated with harmful inflammation, according to a study which may lead to better clinical food recommendations for old people.

The study, published in the journal Gut, noted that ageing is associated with deteriorating bodily functions and increasing inflammation, and the Mediterranean diet may act on gut bacteria in a way that helps curb the advance of physical frailty and cognitive decline in old age.

According to the researchers, including those from the University College Cork in Ireland, a poor diet, which is common among older people, particularly those in long term residential care, reduces the range and types of bacteria (microbiome) found in the gut, and speeds up the onset of frailty.

In the current study, they analysed the gut microbiome of 612 people aged 65 to 79, before and after 12 months of either eating their usual diet, or a Mediterranean diet rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, olive oil and fish, and low in red meat and saturated fats.

According to the findings of the study, sticking to the Mediterranean diet for 12 months was associated with beneficial changes to the gut microbiome.

The diet was linked to an increase in the types of bacteria previously associated with several indicators of reduced frailty, such as walking speed, hand grip strength, and improved brain function, such as memory.

The study also noted that the diet was related to reduced production of potentially harmful inflammatory chemicals.

A detailed analysis revealed that the microbiome changes were linked to an increase in bacteria known to produce beneficial short chain fatty acids, and a decrease in bacteria involved in producing bile acids.

The researchers added that the overproduction of these bodily chemicals are linked to a heightened risk of bowel cancer, insulin resistance, fatty liver, and cell damage.

According to the scientists, the bacteria which proliferate in response to the Mediterranean diet may act as 'keystone' species, meaning they are critical for a stable 'gut ecosystem,' pushing out microbes associated with indicators of frailty.

They said the changes were largely driven by an increase in dietary fibre and associated vitamins and minerals -- especially, C, B6, B9, copper, potassium, iron, manganese, and magnesium.

The findings, the researchers said, were independent of the person's age or weight, both of which have been shown in earlier studies to influence the make-up of the microbiome.

However, they said, the study did not establish a causative role for the microbiome in health.

""The interplay of diet, microbiome and host health is a complex phenomenon influenced by several factors,"" the researchers reported.

""While the results of this study shed light on some of the rules of this three-way interplay, several factors such as age, body mass index, disease status, and initial dietary patterns may play a key role in determining the extent of success of these interactions,"" they added.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mediterranean-diet-may-boost-gut-bacteria-linked-to--healthy-ageing---study-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/mediterranean-diet-may-boost-gut-bacteria-linked-to--healthy-ageing---study.html
255,18-2-20,Bengali actor and former MP Tapas Paul dead,"Veteran Bengali actor and former Trinamool Congress MP Tapas Paul died of cardiac arrest early Tuesday, a family source said.

He was 61.

Paul, who had gone to Mumbai to visit his daughter, complained of chest pain at the Mumbai airport during his return to Kolkata and was rushed to a hospital in Juhu but died around 4 am, the source said.

He had been suffering from heart ailments and been to hospitals several times for treatment during the past two years.

Paul, a two-term MP from Krishnanagar and an MLA from Alipore, is survived by his daughter and wife.

He was born in Chandannagar in Hooghly district and graduated from Hooghly Mohsin College in bioscience.

Paul moved away from films and active politics after the CBI arrested him in the Rose Valley chit-fund scam in December 2016 and was given bail after 13 months.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, in her condolence message, said Paul's death has left a deep void in films and politics.

""Saddened and shocked to hear about the demise of Tapas Paul. He was a superstar of Bengali cinema who was a member of the Trinamool family. Tapas served the people as a two-term MP and MLA. We will miss him dearly. My condolences to his wife Nandini, daughter Sohini and his many fans,"" Banerjee tweeted.

A romantic hero, having endeared himself to the Bengali audience since his debut film ""Dadar Kirti"" in 1980, Paul became a household name courtesy his lead roles in ""Saheb"" (1981), ""Parabat Priya"" (1984), ""Bhalobasa Bhalobasa"" (1985), ""Anurager Choyan"" (1986) and ""Amar Bandhan"" (1986).

He made his Bollywood debut in Hiren Nag's ""Abodh"" (1984) opposite Madhuri Dixit Nene.

He was awarded the Filmfare Award for ""Saheb"" (1981).

In a career spanning over three decades, Paul had worked with veteran actors Prosenjit Chatterjee, Soumitra Chatterjee, Ranjit Mallick and Raakhee Gulzar.

Some of his last appearances were in films such as ""Khiladi"" and ""Aat ta Aater Bongaon Local"".

Actor Ranjit Mallick described Paul's death as ""untimely"".

""I am yet to come to terms with the news. He was like my younger brother. He was not keeping well for some time,"" Mallick said.

After the TMC was formed in 1998, Paul, inspired by Banerjee and her fight against the Left Front regime, had joined the political party in 2000.

He was elected as the MLA from Alipore Assembly seat in 2001.

During the 2008-09 period, when West Bengal was witnessing winds of change, Paul had played an instrumental role in helping the party penetrate the Bengali film industry, which till then was under the firm control of the Left Front-aligned actors and directors.

After Paul's arrest in the Rose Valley chit-fund scam, his family members had time and again alleged that the party did not bother to enquire about him.

Post his release from prison in 2018, Paul withdrew from active politics and communicated to the TMC his unwillingness to contest elections.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bengali-actor-and-former-mp-tapas-paul-dead-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/bengali-actor-and-former-mp-tapas-paul-dead.html
256,18-2-20,UK warns won't accept EU-ruled 'level playing field',"Britain's trade negotiator warned Monday that his government would not accept EU supervision of its economy in exchange for close trade ties.

Senior diplomat Mark Frost told academics in Brussels that London intended to set its own laws following Brexit and not follow EU-imposed ""level playing field"" rules.

""It isn't a simple negotiating position which might move under pressure -- it is the point of the whole project,"" he said.

Frost's speech at the Free University of Brussels took place as EU member states were drawing up a mandate for their own negotiator, Michel Barnier.

Some capitals, in particular France, are pushing for a deal in which Britain would have to sign up to EU-supervised regulation in exchange for privileged access to the huge European single market.

But Frost, adding detail to the position championed by British prime minister Boris Johnson, said London wanted a typical trade deal of the kind Brussels signed with Canada.

""It is central to our vision that we must have the ability to set laws that suit us -- to claim the right that every other non-EU country in the world has,"" Frost said.

""So to think that we might accept EU supervision on so-called level playing field issues simply fails to see the point of what we are doing.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/uk-warns-won-t-accept-eu-ruled--level-playing-field--2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/uk-warns-won-t-accept-eu-ruled--level-playing-field-.html
257,18-2-20,Apple to miss revenue forecast as iPhone supply hit by coronavirus,"Apple is to miss its revenue forecast for the March quarter due to the coronavirus epidemic, the US tech giant said Monday, warning that iPhone supplies worldwide would also be impacted, underlining the economic cost of the health crisis.

The COVID-19 virus death toll now exceeds 1,800 in China, where it has infected more than 72,000 after emerging in the central province of Hubei in December.

The virus has sparked global economic jitters, travel bans and the cancellation of high-profile sporting and cultural events.

""We are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated,"" Apple said in a statement.

""As a result, we do not expect to meet the revenue guidance we provided for the March quarter."" Apple had forecast revenue of $63 billion to $67 billion for the second quarter to March.

It said that worldwide iPhone supply would be ""temporarily constrained"" as its manufacturing partners in China were only slowly ramping up work after being closed due to the virus.

Consumer demand in the crucial Chinese market has also been dampened after all Apple stores were shut.

""Stores that are (now) open have been operating at reduced hours and with very low customer traffic,"" the company said.

""We are gradually reopening our retail stores and will continue to do so as steadily and safely as we can.""

International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva has said there could be a cut of around 0.1-0.2 percentage points to global growth, but stressed there was much uncertainty about the virus's economic impact.

Outside of hardest-hit Hubei, which has been effectively locked down to try to contain the virus, the number of new cases has been slowing and China's national health authority has said the outbreak was under control.

However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the trend ""must be interpreted very cautiously."" The travel industry has been most directly affected by China's decision to quarantine dozens of cities and cancel all overseas tour groups.

Some countries have told nationals to avoid travel to China and banned arrivals from there.

Supply chains of global firms such as Apple supplier Foxconn and auto giant Toyota have been disrupted as key production facilities in China were temporarily closed, and some major airlines have halted services.

Sportswear giants Nike and Adidas shuttered hundreds of stores in the country earlier this month and warned of a negative impact on their earnings.

258,18-2-20,SpaceX re-useable rocket misses landing ship,"SpaceX successfully launched its latest cluster of high-speed internet satellites into orbit Monday but was unable to land its rocket booster on an autonomous ship, missing a key milestone.

The private company founded by billionaire Elon Musk has revolutionized spaceflight in recent years by developing rockets capable of delivering their payload in space then flying back to Earth and landing upright on a target zone, ready to be-reused.

It has successfully landed its booster 49 times previously and Monday's mission would have been the 50th.

""We had an on-time liftoff this morning, a good stage separation, first stage made its way back to Earth,"" manufacturing engineer Jessica Anderson said during a live feed of the mission, which launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida at 10:05am (local time).

""Unfortunately, we did not land the first stage on our drone ship, but it did make a soft landing on the water right next to the drone ship, so it does look like it might be in one piece,"" she added.

The mission delivered the fifth load of 60 satellites of SpaceX's broadband Starlink constellation, part of its plans to control a huge share of the future internet space market.

There are now around 300 Starlink satellites in orbit and that number could one day grow to thousands.

Several rivals have the same ambition, including London-based startup OneWeb and giant US retailer Amazon, whose Project Kuiper is far less advanced.

These have sparked concern among astronomers that they could obscure our view of the night sky, both visually and through radio interference.

Re-using rockets drastically lowers the cost of missions, and the Falcon 9 used in Monday's launch was being flown for the fourth time.

It was not immediately clear why it missed its target. The rocket did not appear in the frame in live footage broadcast from the drone ship, but a plume of smoke or vapor was seen a short distance away.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/spacex-re-useable-rocket-misses-landing-ship-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/spacex-re-useable-rocket-misses-landing-ship.html

Of the new deaths, 93 were reported from Hubei Province, the epicentre of the virus, three from Henan, and one each from Hebei and Hunan, said the National Health Commission.

Hubei reported 1,807 new confirmed cases, taking the total number of such cases to 59,989 in the province. Another 1,432 new suspected cases were reported from the rest of China.

On Monday, 1,097 patients became seriously ill and 11,741 patients remained in severe condition, the commission said.

Of the 41,957 patients hospitalised in Hubei, 9,117 were still in severe condition and another 1,853 in critical condition, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

The province also saw 1,223 patients discharged from hospital after recovery on Monday, bringing the total number of discharged patients in the province to 7,862. A total of 12,552 people had been discharged from hospital after recovery across China so far, it said.

In view of human-to-human transmission of the disease, over 1.41 lakh people who have come in contact with the people who contracted the virus are still under medical observation, it said.

By Monday, 60 confirmed cases including one death had been reported in Hong Kong 10 confirmed cases in Macao and 22 in Taiwan including one death.

Top World Health Organisation experts, including from the US, have joined the fight against the the virus, called COVID-19, in China.

China confirmed that the 12-member WHO team includes Americans, as sought by the US.

""The foreign experts on board the China-WHO Joint Mission have arrived in Beijing. They have started relevant activities. We have experts from the US in the mission,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told media.

NHC said China has stepped up efforts to shore up weak spots as the epidemic prevention and control have entered the most crucial stage.

""Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province, remains the main battlefield,"" Wang Hesheng, deputy head of NHC, said. ""Improving admission and survival rates and reducing infection and fatality rates are still the most urgent tasks.""

Nine temporary hospitals with more than 6,960 beds have opened in Hubei.

Age-adjusted rates of oral cancer in India is high, that is, 20 per 100,000 population and accounts for over 30 per cent of all cancers in the country. The variation in incidence and pattern of the disease can be attributed to the combined effect of ageing of the population, as well as regional differences in the prevalence of disease-specific risk factors.

Oral cancer is of significant public health importance to India. First, it is diagnosed at later stages which result in low treatment outcomes and considerable costs to the patients who typically cannot afford this type of treatment. Second, rural areas in middle and low-income countries also have inadequate access to trained providers and limited health services. As a result, delay has also been largely associated with advanced stages of oral cancer. Earlier detection of oral cancer offers the best chance for long term survival and has the potential to improve treatment outcomes and make healthcare affordable. Third, oral cancer affects those from the lower socioeconomic groups, that is, people from the lower socio-economic strata of society due to a higher exposure to risk factors such as the use of tobacco. Last, even though clinical diagnosis occurs via examination of the oral cavity and tongue which is accessible by current diagnostic tools, many cases present to a healthcare facility at later stages of cancer subtypes, thereby reducing chances of survival due to delays in diagnosis.

Causes: Mouth cancers form when cells on the lips or in the mouth develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. A cell’s DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutations changes tell the cells to continue growing and dividing when healthy cells would die. The accumulating abnormal mouth cancer cells can form a tumour. With time they may spread inside the mouth and on to other areas of the head and neck or other parts of the body. Mouth cancers most commonly begin in the flat, thin cells (squamous cells) that line your lips and the inside of your mouth. Most oral cancers are squamous cell carcinomas.

Prevention: There’s no proven way to prevent mouth cancer. However, you can reduce your risk of mouth cancer if you:

Stop using tobacco or don’t start.

Drink alcohol only in moderation, if at all.

Avoid excessive sun exposure to your lips.

See your dentist regularly. As part of a routine dental exam, ask your dentist to inspect your entire mouth for abnormal areas that may indicate mouth cancer or precancerous changes.

Treatment:

Surgery: Tumour present in lips, mouth, tongue can be removed with surgery. Surgical excision leads to disfigurement of face, drooling of saliva from angle of mouth, partial or complete loss of tongue and voice, reduced mouth opening in case of lip cancer. Disfigurement can be corrected cosmetically by plastic surgery. Functional losses may persist.

Radiation therapy: Treatment of cancer by rays (gamma, electron, photos and protons) is called radiation therapy. IMRT, IGRT are advanced form of radiation therapy that have the ability to spare surrounding organs as well as precisely deliver accurate dose to tumour. Post-surgery radiation therapy is called adjuvant therapy and reduces possibility of locoregional recurrence.

Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy is a medicine which is given in form of injections or tablets under supervision of oncologist. Mostly, it is given on a weekly basis during radiation therapy to enhances effects. Common side effects are hair loss, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation and reduced blood count.

Is there irritation in the throat? Is their pain when you swallow? In all probability you have a sore throat — a common ailment during change of season. While the itchiness and the irritation in the throat can be painful, there are several ingredients that we have in our kitchen that can bring relief.

The most important thing to remember is that one must drink warm liquids. Soup, herbal tea and even just warm water with honey can help soothe a sore throat. For flavour one can add mint and even ginger.

There is a reason why everyone suggests a saltwater gargle. Make a saltwater solution by putting half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water.

Just like salt, lemons, which are packed with Vitamin C help to boost the immune system and give it more power to fight infection. Mix one teaspoon of lemon juice into a glass of warm water and drink for quick relief.

They say prevention is better than cure. If you sense a sore throat coming, dilute one-two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in one cup of water and gargle with it. Do this on an hourly basis. Do drink plenty of water in between the gargling sessions.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dadikakehna-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/dadikakehna-dadikakehna-2020-02-18.html

The app reviewed findings from user responses to hopefully find the answer to what men and women really want!

While the Indian millennial today are evolved, well-traveled and like to live life king-size, they still love those old-school coffee dates. A large majority of both men and women report a preference to chat over a steaming cup while out on a first date, even now. And despite what every other generation is saying about millennial, most of them truly believe in the beautiful serendipity of falling in love and want to live ‘happily ever after’ rather than exploring multiple relationships. Funnily, the most interesting finding is that unlike popular perception, men are actually hopeless romantics at heart and like to go all guns blazing on planning Valentine’s Day celebrations. No judgement, but love deserves to be celebrated and most people did agree that love is not overrated or over celebrated.

According to the survey, while most millennials have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge (46 per cent), love is not far behind with over 30 per cent men and women saying that they are still driven by the idea of true love. The survey also revealed that 61 per cent of women and 53 per cent of men consider love as a true stroke of serendipity and want it to just happen to them by chance.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/studycentre-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/studycentre-studycentre-2020-02-18.html
266,18-2-20,Belly oh belly,"Food poisoning and stomach flu are common ailments. However, most people get confused between the two. Dr SK Mundhra tells you how to tackle both

Food poisoning and stomach flu are often confused due to their similar symptoms. Food poisoning is caused by eating food that contains bacteria, viruses, or parasites, which can get into food at various points during production. While stomach flu is caused by a viral infection that attacks the digestive system and is highly contagious and spreads rapidly.

A stomach flu has a few common symptoms that can last for up to 10 days. They include:

Diarrhea that may be watery or bloody

Loss of appetite

Nausea or vomiting

Stomach cramps, muscle aches, or weakness

Low-grade fever

Headaches

Light-headedness or dizziness

There are a few things that people can do at home while recovering from a stomach virus:

People with a stomach virus should avoid food for a while to let their stomach settle.

Let the stomach settle: Try not to eat any solid foods for several hours.

Take small sips of water: People should drink plenty of liquids to not get dehydrated.

Avoid juice or other beverages which can make diarrhea worse.

Ease back into eating: Start with bland easy-to-digest food such as soda crackers, toast,and rice. Stop eating if nausea returns.

Avoid certain substances: These include dairy, caffeine, alcohol, sugar, and fatty or highly seasoned foods.

People should be cautious of over-the-counter medications as some can make the infection worse. Even anti-diarrhea medications can make the situation worse if the cause of the infection is certain bacteria. The stomach flu typically goes away within 24 to 28 hours, but home care is vital for a speedy recovery. See a doctor if you have any of the following symptoms:

Bloody stool or vomit

Unable to keep liquid down for at least 24 hours

Dehydration

Fever above 104°F.



Better safe than sorry

Some foods are more likely to cause of food poisoning because of the way they’re produced and prepared. Meat, poultry, eggs, and shellfish may harbor infectious agents that are killed during cooking. If these foods are eaten in their raw form, not cooked properly, or if hands and surfaces are not cleaned after contact, food poisoning can occur.

Always wash your hands before cooking or eating food. Make sure that your food is properly sealed and stored. Thoroughly cook meat and eggs. Anything that comes in contact with raw products should be sanitised before using it to prepare other foods. Make sure to always wash fruits and vegetables before serving.

The following may be the reasons to cause food poisoning and infections.

Dirty utensils, hands and kitchen area: If the utensils and the kitchen area is dirty, the food you prepare is prone to infections and cause food poisoning. Wash your hands properly to avoid the spread of bacteria and contaminating the food.

Keeping raw material and ready-to-eat food together: Ready to eat food are not cooked and if kept along with raw meat, it is vulnerable to pick up germs even after cooking process.

Keeping cut fruits and vegetables outside: Warm place is a breeding ground for bacterias. Cut fruits or vegetables need to be kept in refrigerator immediately.

If the leftovers are not cooled: Nobody wants to waste the delicious food prepared. Cooling leftovers within 90 minutes of being prepared, then making sure they go straight in the fridge is the best way to ensure that your delicious leftovers will still be good for the next few days.

Reheating meat more than once: If you’ve got something meaty in your leftovers, ensure that you don’t heat it up more than once. Continuously heating and then cooling meat allows bacteria to grow and multiply, potentially causing food poisoning. If you’ve got a lot of leftovers, the best thing to do is to only heat up the portion you’re planning to eat, rather than the entire dish.

The symptoms of food poisoning occur more quickly than those of a stomach virus.

Cross-contamination is often the cause of food poisoning. This is when harmful organisms transfer from one surface to another. Raw foods and ready-to-eat foods like salads are particularly at risk of contamination.

Bacteria can also grow rapidly when foods such as meats, dairy products, and sauces are not kept at the right temperature. The bacteria and other harmful organisms can produce poisonous substances that cause inflammation of the intestines when eaten.

Symptoms can vary depending on the source of the infection. Common cases of food poisoning will typically include at least three of the following symptoms — abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, vomiting, loss of appetite, mild fever, weakness,nausea and headaches.

The best way to prevent food poisoning is to handle your food safely and to avoid any food that may be unsafe.

267,18-2-20,China to waive tariffs on US medical imports amid virus outbreak,"China will waive trade-war tariffs on imports of selected US medical equipment from March 2, the government said Tuesday, as the country battles to contain the new coronavirus epidemic.

More than 72,000 people have been infected by the outbreak of the new COVID-19 strain in China, which has claimed the lives of over 1,800 people.

Products that will qualify for the exemptions include patient monitors, blood transfusion equipment and instruments to measure blood pressure, according to a list released by the Tariff Commission of the State Council.

The commission said the move was ""to better meet the growing needs of Chinese consumers"" and that it would accept applications from firms in China.

The tariff exemptions will apply for a designated period, supporting firms that want to import from the US based on ""business considerations"", said authorities.

The list of eligible products also includes a wide range of food items such as frozen pork, beef and seafood.

There has been a spike in pork prices in China over the past year due to African Swine Fever, which ravaged pig herds across the country.

The latest move follows other exemptions or cuts that China has announced -- either related to its virus fight or a trade deal it signed with the US in January.

At the start of the month, China said US imports that can be used in its fight against the deadly virus will be exempted from retaliatory tariffs imposed in the trade war.

More than a week ago, Beijing also announced it would halve tariffs on USD 75 billion worth of US imports as part of its trade truce with the US.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-offers-tariff-exemptions-on-us-medical-equipment-amid-virus-outbreak-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-to-waive-tariffs-on-us-medical-imports-amid-virus-outbreak.html

Boult was out of action for the past six weeks due to a fracture on his right hand sustained during the Boxing Day Test against Australia and missed out on the limited-overs leg of the India series.

Back for the traditional format, the left-arm fast bowler made his priorities clear ahead of the first Test.

""That's personally why I play the game, to get guys like that (Kohli) out and test myself against them, so I can't wait to get stuck in. But he's an exceptional player. Everyone knows how great he is,"" Boult said, sending out a warning after landing in the capital city for the opening Test.

The Basin Reserve track will have a lot for the seamers and in conditions conducive to seam bowling, a wily customer like Boult might prove to be a handful.

""I'm preparing for a solid wicket. It generally is very good here and goes the full distance (five days). I do enjoy playing here, the history that's involved, and it's going to be an exciting week building up. I can't wait to get out there,"" said the 30-year-old who has taken 256 wickets from 65 Tests.

It was frustrating for him to watch his side get walloped 0-5 in the T20 series but exhilarating to when it got its mojo back in the subsequent one-dayers. The Black Caps won 3-0 in the 50-over format.

""I think it is what it is. I have just got to put the last six or so weeks behind me and just back myself to get out there and do my thing,"" said Boult, who warmed up by playing a club game at the picturesque Taupo ground.

""I was pushing in off the long run. I think a couple of the clubbies from Taupo really enjoyed that. It was a good afternoon,"" added the pacer, who sent down eight overs in a friendly game for his club Cadets.

""Having some time away from the game and having my second son a couple of weeks ago came at quite a good time,"" said Boult.

Wearing an orange scarf, Guterres visited different parts of the Gurdwara. He was served with traditional food in lunch along with Sikhs and Pakistani officials.

Strict security measures were taken during the visit.

Indian Sikhs in good number were also present at Kartarpur Sahib.

Khan inaugurated the Kartarpur Corridor on November 9, 2019 in connection with the 550 birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the corridor from the Indian side on the same day by flagging off the first batch of over 500 Indian pilgrims, including former premier Manmohan Singh and Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal.

Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan is located across the river Ravi. It was established by the Sikh Guru in 1522. The first Gurdwara, Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib, was built here, where Guru Nanak Dev is said to have died.

Earlier in the day, Guterres addressed students at the Lahore University of Management Sciences and urged them to focus on new technologies. He termed climate change as the major issue the world is facing today. He also inaugurated a polio campaign.

277,18-2-20,Fresh smoke for you! ‘Best before’ date on cigarette packs,"Cigarette manufacturers may soon have another mandate to “benefit” smokers. Besides the statutory warning and other relevant details, the packets will have to specify “best before” or “expiry” details, on the lines of other edible and consumable items, including medicines.

Sources in the Bureau of India Standards (BIS) said that research is ongoing on the subject as this is the long pending demand of tobacco and gutkha associations and even by the consumers.

“The best before/expiry dates of cigarette packets may be introduced soon and we believe this will in a way also counter fake manufacturing of the cigarettes. Our research team have also found that certain products had traces of fungus which when inhaled is more harmful,” said BIS sources.

Sources clarified that good quality cigarettes are manufactured after taking full precautions in processing of the tobacco to avoid any fungal growth but research has found that it goes stale after a certain period. Illicit cigarettes are on the rise and smoking them impacts the health more.

“Cigarettes don’t really expire, they go stale. When a cigarette goes stale it has lost its moisture in the tobacco and tastes differently. Commercial cigarettes usually don’t go stale unless the pack has been opened and it usually takes about two days. Usually, people look for an expiration date to make sure something won’t taste bad, smell bad, or be bad for your health. Hence, work is on to incorporate expiration schedule or the best before date on the cigarette packs which will be in the interest of consumers as well as manufacturers,” the sources said.

As per the existing BIS norms, a cigarette packet has to specify manufacturer details, month and year of production, length and price besides a toll free call centre and email address.

“A pictorial danger sign was incorporated on tobacco products on the directions of the Supreme Court a few years ago and expiration date will be the new addition,” the sources said.

India ranks fifth, jointly with Hong Kong and Thailand, in terms of the largest pictorial warning on cigarette packs with 85 per cent of both sides of the packets covered, according to an international cancer society report.

The report found that 118 countries and territories now require pictorial health warnings on cigarette packages, up from 100 in 2016.

A data from World Health Organization (WHO) shows that tobacco use kills nearly six million people in a year. The situation is equally bad in India with estimated number of tobacco users being 274.9 million as per Global Adult Tobacco Survey India (GATS). This includes 163.7 million users of smokeless tobacco, 68.9 million smokers and 42.3 million users of both smoking and smokeless tobacco.

“Cigarettes often come with best before information. While idea of an expiry date would be fine, its compliance is something that regulatory and enforcement agencies will have to deal with. We sincerely hope, as and when this comes into effect, it does take care of the growing menace of the illicit cigarettes in the Indian market. Over the years, India has emerged as world’s 4th largest market for illegal cigarettes and besides causing huge

revenue losses to the Government, it also poses severe risks to national security as illicit trade is known to fund organised crime, across the world,” said RS Tiwari of Centre for Public Awareness that works on awareness on illicit cigarettes.

He also added that as per a World Bank Report, illicit cigarettes have severe implications on the health of the nation as the “availability of inexpensive illicit cigarettes increases the likelihood of young people developing addiction — particularly where illicit imports “glamorise” smoking through aspirational brands.”",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fresh-smoke-for-you-----best-before----date-on-cigarette-packs-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/fresh-smoke-for-you-----best-before----date-on-cigarette-packs.html

280,18-2-20,I owe my career to debutant directors: Vicky Kaushal,"Successive hits and a National Award later, actor Vicky Kaushal vividly remembers his time as a newcomer four years ago and says he owes his career to first-time directors.

The actor, who was first noticed in the then debutant director Neeraj Ghaywan's 2015 social drama ""Masaan"", said every film is a new project for both the actor and the filmmaker.

He later collaborated with a string of new directing talent like Mozez Singh for ""Zubaan"", Anand Tiwari for ""Love Per Square Foot"", and Aditya Dhar for ""Uri: The Surgical Strike"", for which the actor earned the best actor National Award.

""I owe my career to debutant directors, so I'm quite used to working with first timers. I just read the script and if I am sold on that, I meet the director to understand his vision. If I sense clarity and vision there, that's what I am sold to.

""I was also a newcomer at one point of time, I'm only four years old here. I am no veteran. Every film is a new film. I am as new as the director for that film and story. We have to work with that spirit. I tried to bring out the same fire in every film that I had in my first film,"" Vicky told PTI in an interview here.

But the 31-year-old actor is more excited about working with a new director as they bring a ""scared energy"" to the film sets.

With his upcoming horror film ""Bhoot: The Haunted Ship"" too, Vicky is joining hands with debutant director Bhanu Pratap Singh, who served as assistant director on ""Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania"" (2014).

""There is a different sort of enthusiasm which comes on board. That energy is not an energy which takes things for granted. It's a scared energy and that brings out something special,"" he said.

The actor has always maintained he is no horror buff but it was the story, based on a true incident of a stranded cargo ship at Juhu Beach, that found him.

He said unlike ""Sanju"" where he needed to learn a dialect for the character or ""Uri"" which demanded physical transformation, essaying the role of Prithvi was a pretty much a straight line.

""It was more about adapting to the new grammar. It was something I was not so prepared for. I had underestimated the horror genre before doing this film quite a lot. In horror, timing has to be correct, everything has to fall in the right place at the right time, all departments work in sync to make that one shot,"" he added.

Vicky said the team has attempted to present the horror genre in its truest form -- with jump scares and atmospherics.

""'Bhoot' is not just about jump scares but it is also about the mood that keeps you on your toes when you watch it. We have tried to stay true to the genre. There are no unnecessary subplots.

""We have not tried to lure the audience with making a nice musical album where people are like 'let's go to watch the songs' or turning into a romantic horror or horror comedy. They have been made over the years.""

Asked his first memory of a horror film, Vicky remembered how scared he was after watching Ram Gopal Varma's ""Raat"".

""I don't remember what I saw but I remember being very scared for days altogether. I used to be scared thinking that Revathy ma'am, with those glassy eyes, will come out of anywhere. It is only after I grew up, I realised that she wore lenses,"" he recalled.

The actor has played diverse roles in his Bollywood career, but he said there is a ""certain awareness"" that one has to be careful while playing real-life characters, a number of which are lined up in his future filmography.

He is set to play Udham Singh in Shoojit Sircar's biopic on the revolutionary, Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in Karan Johar's period drama ""Takht"" and 1971 war hero Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw in Meghna Gulzar's ""Sam"".

""You follow the vision of the writer and director but while playing a real character, you can't take a lot of liberties. Some of the characters that I will be playing next, they were real people who existed at one point of time and you can't change history. Aurangzeb has been documented in texts and Udham Singh has been more like a legend.

""But people are much more aware about Sam Manekshaw. There are videos of the man, a more recent figure. I feel more responsible towards playing him. Every person has a 'sur' (tone) so besides how he looked, walked and talked, I have to get that right. Out of all the true life characters that I am playing, Manekshaw scares me the most,"" he said.

Last two years have been a game changer for Vicky and the actor is in no mood to slow down.

""I have spent my initial days so freely... Only knocking on so many doors, trying to make it to the offices to convince people that I want to be an actor. Now that God is giving me this.

""I'm not getting time to sleep and sit with my family but my hunger has not gone, I've become more hungry. I have spent enough time wanting this and now that it has come, I really want more of this,"" he said.

The actor will start prepping for ""Takht"" after ""Bhoot"" hits the screens.

Also starring Bhumi Pednekar and Ashutosh Rana, the film is slated to be released on Friday.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/i-owe-my-career-to-debutant-directors--vicky-kaushal-2020-02-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/i-owe-my-career-to-debutant-directors--vicky-kaushal.html
