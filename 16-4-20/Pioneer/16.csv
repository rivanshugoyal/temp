0,16-4-20,Climbing again,"After a production cut agreed upon by oil producers, crude prices are rising again. But demand will continue to be weak

As the world’s largest oil-producing countries agreed to somewhat reduce production after an intense price war last month between Russia and Saudi Arabia saw rates drop to their lowest level in almost two decades, crude oil prices have started to climb once again. But the spike, and this, using the one of North Sea Brent Crude which is a global benchmark, has found it difficult to pierce the $30 a barrel mark. Analysts believe that after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) report, which said that the world economy will shrink by almost three per cent this year, oil prices cannot rise to offset that much of a fall in demand. Even with countries such as India using the opportunity to fill their strategic reserves of oil to the brim, the additional demand this will produce will not offset the overall fall. This is a good thing for India, although not necessarily for the consumer. The Central Government recently used the fall in the crude price to increase existing excise duties on prices paid at the pump and passed a law to be able to increase the excise rates later on. Therefore, the fall in prices at the pump may be negligible. That said, the Government will be desperate to raise additional revenues after the six-week lockdown would have devastated the economy. The additional revenues that these potential excise duty enhancements will produce though will be tempered by a reduction in demand as the informal sector remains effectively shut and the formal sector is expected to operate at a mere fraction of its pre-COVID-19 ability.

The reduction in crude prices might also have a medium-term impact on demand and the technology progress of alternative environmentally-friendly mobility solutions. Electric vehicles, already expensive, might see a fall in demand as consumers will switch to more affordable petrol-engined cars. Handing out subsidies for buying such vehicles will be seen as an avoidable extravagance by Governments during a public health crisis. This may be one of the unintended consequences of the pandemic but we feel that the work in this space must continue. One of the positives of the past four weeks has been the cleaner and more breathable air across the world. We should not see that as an aberration but as the new normal. Crude prices may never recover from that shift.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/climbing-again-2020-04-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/climbing-again.html
1,16-4-20,Disaster waiting to strike,"The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nepal may be low but it is not due to precautions taken by the Govt but because of the low rate of testing

With the number of COVID-19 cases rising globally, India’s neighbour Nepal is also going through a critical phase in its fight against the pandemic. A country located next to China, the nation where the COVID-19 outbreak began, its immediate vulnerabilities lie in addressing the epidemic with an existing poor healthcare infrastructure and ensuring the safety of its people. The very first case of COVID-19 was reported on January 23 in Nepal. A student who had returned from Wuhan on January 9 was admitted to a hospital in Kathmandu. With no expertise and lab infrastructure to examine such cases then, the swab tests of the student were sent to Hong Kong and had confirmed the Nepal Government’s worst fears.

Loose end: Nepal’s first COVID-19 case had recovered in the second week of February. With no new cases reported until the third week of March, overzealous Government officials went on to declare Nepal a “COVID-19 free” country. While it was the time for the Government to deploy extra measures to prepare for the outbreak, declaring the country as “COVID-19 free” without any consultation with medical experts was indeed a short-sighted and irresponsible step. The Government was very clear that it did not wish to stop the arrival of tourists in Nepal because 2020 had been declared as a tourism year and the Government had spent a lot of time and money in making its ‘Visit Nepal 2020’ campaign a household initiative. However, in the end, with the appearance of the Coronavirus, Nepal had to suspend the campaign officially, even though till today it has a total of 16 confirmed cases and no reported deaths. In 2018, tourism had contributed more than seven per cent revenue to the Nepalese Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which was expected to double this year. With the suspension of tourism for this year, the economy will have to bear the brunt.

Logistic shortage: Compared to its neighbours India and China, which have reported a huge number of cases, Nepal has seen just 16 positive cases till now. The country has conducted a total of 6,299 tests, with a little over 80 people in isolation. Amid the ongoing lockdown, Nepal is facing an acute shortage of trained human resources, required healthcare infrastructure, including speciality hospitals, safety gear and testing kits. In several cases, healthcare staff have refused to attend to their duties due to lack of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). In the present circumstances, testing is key to contain and control the spread of the epidemic. However, with just one specialised testing lab for COVID-19 cases in the capital city for a population of more than 29 million people, Nepal is wide open to any major surge in the pandemic. While nine more temporary testing labs have been established in the last 15 days, logistical support and their testing capacity are yet to be seen. Meanwhile, Nepal has requested several countries, including India, China, Singapore, South Korea and Israel to supply medical equipment and medicines needed to combat the disease.

Missing preparedness: Over the last two decades, the Government has not paid any heed to improving the quality and quantity of healthcare facilities in the country. Against this backdrop, Nepal has faced several emergencies such as the present outbreak. A decade-long civil war from 1996-2006 was followed by a major earthquake in 2015 which claimed over 20,000 lives and destroyed 1,500 health facilities, creating an immediate need for investing in the public healthcare system. Meanwhile, no lessons were learnt from these two important events and nothing was done to better the basic healthcare infrastructure. While conflict and natural calamities have both direct and indirect effects on people’s health and the overall health system in the immediate and post-shock phase, the missing healthcare infrastructure in Nepal is a matter of major concern, particularly in the present crisis.

India extends help: As Nepal awaits replies from other countries, India has begun to send new consignments of medical supplies, including the much-needed hydroxychloroquine sulphate. During an official conversation between Prime Minister Modi and his Nepalese counterpart on April 10, the two Prime Ministers agreed “to look after the welfare and medical care of the people of the two countries currently living in each other’s territory.”

The multi-dimensional friendly relations between India and Nepal are testimony to shared socio-cultural and people-to-people contacts that have stood the test of time and various disasters. The creation of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) COVID-19 Emergency Fund is a collective effort initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring SAARC countries onboard to fight COVID-19. Nepal has actively participated in the initiative and the initiative shall work as an additional effective mechanism in Nepal’s fight against COVID-19.

China banks on the crisis: China, on the other hand, is banking on the ongoing crisis in Nepal. China’s online supply chain Alibaba along with the local administration of its Sichuan province have donated PPE and portable shelters to Nepal. However, a significant deal to a private Chinese company to procure equipment worth more than $10 million was cancelled amid criticism. The Government of Nepal faced criticism for defying the rules in granting the contract to a private company, which has been involved in supplying low-quality products in the past. Giving in to public pressure, the Ministry of Health and Population decided to annul the tender. At this critical juncture, it is the responsibility of the Government of Nepal to ensure that logistics are procured with caution, rather than appease China with multi-million-dollar deals. On April 10, the Tibet Autonomous Region also donated medical equipment to Nepal and China and Chinese officials conducted a “handing over ceremony.” With Nepal facing a critical shortage of supplies, Chinese assistance is not free from an attempt to win over public sentiments. Something that India needs to watch out for.

Poor governance: An acute shortage of medical equipment exhibits poor governance and the inability of the Government of Nepal to safeguard the interests of its citizens who have been a cardinal factor in sustaining the economy. Notably, one-fourth of Nepal’s GDP comes from the remittances sent home by the Nepalese workforce abroad. Following the initial fears of lockdowns in host countries, thousands of Nepalese migrant workers attempted to travel back to their home country. While the closure of international flights stopped millions of workers from returning to Nepal from the Middle-East, Malaysia and Australia, thousands of them are stuck at the Indo-Nepal border.

This is after they undertook long and arduous journeys through land routes to cross the border checkposts. With no quarantine wards and healthcare personnel deployed at the check-posts, these workers have been desperately waiting to get back to their homes.

By stopping the returnees at the border, Nepal might have chosen to contain the spread of the COVID-19 but it is a cruel, irresponsible and inadequate attitude towards its citizens. They have been left in the open without food, shelter and exposed to Coronavirus contamination due to lack of social distancing at several places. It was as late as April 10 that Nepalese Prime Minister KP Oli requested his Indian counterpart to look after the welfare and medical needs of those stuck at the Indo-Nepal border. As India does its bit to provide food and shelter to the suffering Nepalese workforce, the Government of Nepal should have had mechanisms in place in advance for its returning expatriates. It must have in all honesty anticipated the return of its people from the neighbouring nation given the long open border. That it chose not to do anything about it and let its people suffer knowingly is something that will always be remembered by the people of the little Himalayan nation.

The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nepal may be low but it is not due to precautions taken by the Government. It is less because of the low rate of tests being carried out per day. On April 11, Nepal recorded the highest number of COVID-19 tests and the same day, three new cases were reported. For all we know, it might be the next hotspot of the world. But that will only be revealed once more testing is done.

It is time for the Government of Nepal to provide proper healthcare to its people to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the country. The present Government won a large public mandate in the 2017 elections due to Oli’s promises of a stable Government and improved economic conditions. However, poor governance, flawed economic policies and imbalanced foreign relations have endangered the lives of citizens.

2,16-4-20,Resilience in a VUCA world,"The Novel Coronavirus has presented us with novel challenges and an uncertain business environment, the response to which has to be focussed

The unprecedented Coronavirus pandemic has driven home the fact that the world is a very volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) place. Hence, survival and growth strategies have to be revisited and revised accordingly. Although the term VUCA was coined by the US Army, it is now widely used by business leaders to portray the unpredictable nature of the environment in which they operate. Over the decades, business models have changed dramatically, so have the things that businesses value, leading to a sea change in how they operate. And since situations are so uncertain and can change quickly, businesses also need to be agile and adapt quickly. Here are some of the strategies that business leaders can look at to keep their corporations afloat now.

Optimise costs: Since this pandemic has hit the entire world, all businesses will find it extremely difficult to match historic levels of profitability. With factories shutting down due to lockdowns ordered by the Government and lower sales turnover, the resources available with the companies will be very limited. Therefore, proper utilisation of the same is a must. Review various costs, both fixed and variable, to carefully determine what is in fact required to run your business. After this, review, strategise any cost-reduction initiatives, whether it is making your business lean by introducing a downsizing process, holding off any upcoming capital investment or introducing companywide innovative techniques to drive down costs. Employees can be motivated to join this campaign and suitably rewarded for any innovative ideas that help the firm. Although reduction in expenditure is a must, cost-cutting should be avoided in areas that have the potential for revenue generation in the future. However, caution has to be exercised to make sure that the cost-cutting does not cause any reputation loss.

Liquidity rules: The pandemic and the lockdown strategies adopted by nations will most definitely lead the global economies into recession. During such slow times, it is crucial to understand that cash is the lifeline of any business and follow strategies to maintain cash flows. Run sensitivity and scenario analysis to understand the impact of changes in one or all variables relevant to your business, whether the impact would be more short-term or long-term in nature and what management approach needs to be taken. Build cash reserves like there is no tomorrow. That will become the lifeline of your business till things settle down and there is an upward trend in growth. Managing of working capital is another significant aspect of managing cash. Strategise to increase all inflows and reduce all outflows and stretch the time frame of payables. Try and reduce the days for any receivables and delay all non-essential capital expenditure. Another fastest way of adding liquidity to a business is the existing banker. Communicate with your banker to explore the extension of any credit facility. If you have a long association with your bank and it understands the value of your business, discuss the current situation and your plans to tackle the same. Clarity and openness in your conversation will be the key here. Try and re-negotiate the terms of your debt repayments or consider the options of refinancing or recapitalisation. Therefore, engaging with your key stakeholders and lenders early on will help you stay on top of your challenges.

Renegotiate terms with stakeholders: Customers and suppliers are the important external stakeholders for any business. In these economically difficult times it is vital to carefully nurture important and credit-worthy customers and weed out economic drags on your business. During normal times, businesses are under pressure to increase the number of customers or suppliers and to attain them firms sometimes give out more favourable terms. Now is a good time to carefully monitor accounts, re-evaluate the supplier base and re-negotiate favourable terms with some of your suppliers.

Be more responsive: You should aim at developing and transforming your organisation’s culture to be more responsive. The values of integrity, trust and empowerment will be the main features of this new business environment. Leaders have to set the right tone of the culture of the business, hire the correct staff and empower them to perform. All the organisational systems and processes have to be aligned with the company culture and become more responsive as a strategy for this new normal situation.

Invest in your people: Organisational response and agility will only develop if values are communicated correctly to your staff as they are the ones to steer your business through these difficult times. Businesses should invest in training people in skills and attributes that will help set up the corporate culture they are trying to build. In addition, leadership development programmes, coaching and mentoring are also a necessity. Innovate and find cost-effective and impactful ways of training staff. The Novel Coronavirus has presented us with novel challenges and an uncertain business environment, the response to which has to be focussed and swift. All these strategies, if adopted in time, will make it easier for businesses to emerge bruised but certainly alive.

3,16-4-20,War against COVID must be fuelled by peace,"Attacks on the Afghan security forces, who remain in active defence posture, targetted suicide and IED attacks and wartime criminality —including kidnapping and armed robberies — have hampered the rapid implementation of the Government’s Coronavirus strategy

COVID-19 has emerged as the single-most dangerous enemy of humanity in this century. Most of the fatalities have occurred in developed and developing countries, including the US, Italy, Spain, France, China and Iran. Looking at the scope and scale of emergency preparedness, the containment and mitigation measures undertaken by these countries to defeat COVID-19, one immediately begins worrying about a lack of resources, a severe shortage of essential commodities and services, as well as widespread human vulnerabilities in the countries of the “bottom billion.” There, State institutions remain weak, healthcare systems are non-existent or dysfunctional, demographics unchecked, coping mechanisms severely eroded and economies stagnating or in a state of gradual collapse.

This grim situation is further exacerbated by protracted and often imposed conflicts, which continue to be fuelled by geopolitical tensions and rivalries in regions such as the Middle East and South Asia where State actors exploit impoverished youth by brainwashing them ideologically and militarily arming them to advance State-specific geostrategic goals.

These intertwined and ever-growing vulnerabilities of the least-developed and war-ravaged societies remain a cause for grave global concern, as expressed by the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who urged warring parties across the world to lay down their weapons in support of the bigger battle against COVID-19. Indeed, no country needs an immediate cessation of conflict as much as Afghanistan. Even before the advent of the many and sometimes overlapping conflicts of the past four decades, Afghanistan had been a least developed country with meagre resources to address its dismal socio-economic indicators and abject poverty. The following decades, including the past 19 years, have hardly been kind to the suffering people of Afghanistan. Last year alone saw the killing and maiming of over 10,000 civilians while “conflict-related civilian casualties with more than 100 killed and many more injured” were recorded in March, says the UN Assistance Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA). On March 27, the UN Security Council condemned the “heinous and cowardly terrorist attack that took place at the Dharamshala Sikh Temple in Kabul” when 25 citizens, including children, were killed and wounded.

In addition to these attacks, the improvised explosive devices (IEDs), planted in urban and rural Afghanistan, indiscriminately kill and cripple citizens. This tragedy is further compounded by the adverse effects of climate change, including droughts, floods, landslides and avalanches. The UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) says that, “More than 14,000 people have been affected by floods, landslides and avalanches in more than 12 provinces across Afghanistan.” Plus humanitarian efforts have been hindered by attacks on aid workers.

Moreover, the destruction of critical service-delivery infrastructure remains a tactic often used to further victimise people. Millions have been deprived of electricity as transmission lines, importing electricity from Uzbekistan, have been cut in northern Afghanistan where such attacks recur often. Extended power cuts disable the few hospitals and clinics that respond to the basic medical needs of the population. Indeed, this is killing and maiming Afghans by other means than direct acts of violence, which are often overlooked for holding to account those UN member-State/s that directly cause or indirectly contribute to such complex humanitarian crises.

It is clear and well-documented that the Taliban are responsible for the frequent and largescale civilian deaths due to direct and indirect acts of violence and destruction of critical infrastructure. But they are not alone in committing these war crimes. Since their creation as an instrument of external strategic influence in 1994, the Taliban have enjoyed safe havens, an operational infrastructure, diplomatic support, as well as medical treatment for their wounded fighters in our neighborhood — from where they continue to run a terror campaign across Afghanistan.

At the same time, their killing machine has enabled other regional and transnational terrorist networks—such as the Al Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS) — to destabilise Afghanistan. In turn, this has enabled the Taliban to run a multi-billion-dollar illicit drug business that has not only addicted jobless young Afghans but has also fed drug demand in the wider region where millions are dying of addiction.

In the face of the rapid spread of the Coronavirus, the Taliban must reconsider their efforts to maintain status quo: To keep killing Afghans and destroying critical service-delivery infrastructure, whose extended dysfunction will cause further death, pain and destruction. Indeed, as they know all too well, this stands against the core teachings of Islam. This also violates the basic principles of international human rights and humanitarian laws, which uphold the right of all Afghans —including those in the Taliban-controlled areas — to unfettered access to COVID-19 tests and treatment.

As of now, 784 Afghans in over 20 provinces across the country have contracted the deadly virus and 25 people have died. These figures hardly reflect the ground reality, considering that thousands of Afghans have recently returned from Iran and Pakistan which are also battling COVID-19. Indeed, attacks on the Afghan security forces, who remain in active defence posture; targetted suicide and IED attacks and wartime criminality —including kidnapping and armed robberies — have hampered the rapid implementation of the Afghan Government’s COVID strategy, including containment, mitigation and socio-economic relief and recovery measures. To avert a COVID-19 catastrophe in Afghanistan, the Taliban must respond positively to calls by the international Ulema, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the Afghan people and the international community, to cease violence immediately across Afghanistan.

Cessation of violence during this national hour of acute need for a humanitarian response to the global pandemic will automatically build confidence on all sides, allowing the recently-announced inclusive negotiation team and the Taliban to begin making progress towards peace, which all Afghans desire, demand and deserve. In the eyes of the Afghan people, choosing the path to peace over continued bloodshed will undoubtedly demonstrate the Taliban’s independence of any foreign influence while establishing their Islamic credentials based on the key tenets of a peaceful, tolerant, compassionate and merciful faith as enshrined in the Constitution of Afghanistan.

4,16-4-20,‘Keep an eye on habitual domestic offenders’,"In view of a possibility of rise in domestic violence during the lockdown period in the State, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Tuesday directed the Director General of Police (DGP) to keep a strict vigil on the habitual offenders.

At a COVID-19 review meeting held here, Patnaik said that as domestic violence is also a major cause of concern during the lockdown, police should begin a process of identifying the habitual offenders and extend help to the complainants through phone calls.

According to DGP Abhay, in order to lodge complaint during the lockdown period, victims of domestic violence need not come to police stations. On receipt of telephone calls, police would reach the spot or home to collect complaints or FIRs and take necessary action.

The victims can also approach police through the Odisha Police Citizen Portal and Sahayata Mobile APP. All cases of the domestic violence during lockdown period would be investigated by the officer not below the rank of SI of police and all the cases would be supervised by an officer of rank of DSP or above.

The Chief Minister on Tuesday also directed the police to ensure that field works of farmers and movement of their agricultural produce are not disrupted due to the enforcement of lockdown.

Besides, Patnaik ordered for setting up of a COVID-19 hospital in each district in next one week. The Government has planned to keep a total of 6,000 beds ready at 36 places across the State to treat the patients by the end of this month, he pointed out.

“I am pleased to see that the coronavirus statistics are levelling in the State and going down. That’s a very good sign. And those who are responsible for this including doctors, health workers, police and administrative officials, very well done!,” Patnaik said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---keep-an-eye-on-habitual-domestic-offenders---.html
5,16-4-20,Akhilesh slams govt for apathy towards migrant workers,"



|

Continuing his tirade against the Yogi Adityanath government over lapses in providing relief for workers of unorganised sectors and migrant labours affected by the lockdown, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav charged that power had gone to the head of Bharatiya Janata Party brass and their leaders were behaving in an arrogant manner.

“The BJP leaders have the supreme confidence that whatever good or bad they offer to people, it will be accepted with gratitude, never complained about and people will continue to venerate BJP leaders,” said Akhilesh in a statement issued on Wednesday.

The SP chief said that acts of omission and commission of nodal officers of UP posted in other states was evident from the exodus and hardships faced by migrant labourers of the state in states like Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat (Ahmedabad, Surat), Maharashtra (Mumbai) and Uttarakhand.

“There is a huge gap between announcements of facilities by UP government for migrant labours and the situation on ground zero in other states,” he said.

Akhilesh said that letters written to chief ministers of different states by CM Yogi Adityanath would not serve the purpose as the state government needed to provide relief to lakhs of workers and poor people who fled from other states to their native villages in UP.

Accusing the state government of adopting ‘Ostrich- policy’, Akhilesh said, “The poor labourers coming to UP face a bleak future and BJP intellectuals may find some solution to the huge problem.”

The SP chief further said that the role of opposition could not be negated in a democracy. “No matter how many offensive comments are made on the opposition by the ruling party, the SP will continue to discharge its responsibility and democratic right of giving suggestions for public welfare. The government should make provisions for providing unemployment allowance till the time the unemployed get jobs,” he said.

Akhilesh alleged that public confidence in the ruling party has been shaken due to apathy of the government. “People have been following the advisory but the government should also recognise that immediate relief facilities should be made for the people,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/akhilesh-slams-govt-for-apathy-towards-migrant-workers.html
6,16-4-20,UPRERA extends completion deadlines,"Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UP RERA), in view of the 40-day-long nation-wide lockdown, has extended completion deadlines for under-construction projects registered in the state by three months.

The bodies representing the real estate developers — the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai) and National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO) — had approached RERA for extension of the deadline.

“The authority appreciates that there has been, firstly slow dislocation in the construction work because of the need for social distancing and movement restrictions and secondly absolute stoppage of the work with national lockdown towards the end of the month of March and therefore the authority decided to extend by three months the date of completion of the projects,” UP RERA said in a press release.

The extension, however, is for projects with completion deadlines falling between March 15 and December 31.

Most developers have welcomed the decision.

UP RERA has also decided to defer hearings of all complaints listed with the authority till May 3. It will reschedule hearing dates and communicate it to parties later on.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/uprera-extends-completion-deadlines.html
7,16-4-20,Legal wrangle amid Corona,"With COVID-19 causing disruption in businesses, it would be imprudent to conclude that force majeure can provide a blanket relief for all contracts and under all situations

As India fights COVID-19, businesses are under pressure. News reports have covered how energy companies have received force majeure notices from customers. With lockdown in full force, demand for fuel and electricity has suffered. Gas distributors are invoking the force majeure clause in their respective agreements with marketers like ONGC and GAIL, among others, in turn serving force majeure notices to their domestic and overseas suppliers. An industry expert has termed it a “chain reaction.” It remains to be seen where the buck will stop. There are similar stories of panic and desperation in almost all sectors, inconsequential of the strata.

Post the lockdown, there is a likelihood of force majeure litigations flooding the Indian courts. Some of these parties may be genuinely affected by the current situation while for others, it could be tactical litigation as a way out of bad contracts/deals. Quite naturally then, force majeure has become one of the most searched legal terms in times when COVID-19 deepens its impact over the business world and uncertainty looms large over the performance of contractual obligation of parties under various arrangements.

The logical question to be asked is whether “force majeure,” a panacea for contracts, has gone haywire due to COVID-19 or otherwise? Let’s look at some of the judgments to analyse how our courts have viewed this clause qua the liabilities of the contracting parties in the past. In legal parlance, unplanned, unimagined and unanticipated challenges are populated under the force majeure clause in contracts. In some instances it may be implied if not expressed. This standard clause is rarely invoked but always present. This is a well-recognised legal principle and exempts a party from performing her/his/their contractual obligations or terminate the performance of its obligations when certain circumstances, which are beyond their control, arise, thus making performance inadvisable, commercially impracticable, illegal or impossible. These circumstances are typically an event or effect, which the parties could not have foreseen or controlled. Therefore, the standard definition of force majeure clause is inclusive of the likes of natural calamities, war or sudden change of Government policies. Over the last few decades, it has come to include terms like terrorism and nuclear radio activity, wherever relevant.

Force majeure is a French phrase, which means a “superior force.” This principle is well-recognised and accepted by the Indian courts as well. Sections 32 and 56 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, are relevant to understand the scope of force majeure besides case laws developed around it. In some of the statutes there is direct reference to force majeure circumstances. Take the example of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, (RERA), which provides for extension of registration of the projects in force majeure situation even without payment of fee. In the present COVID-19 situation, RERA has already given extension to real estate projects that were expiring and that, too, without filing of any application, keeping with the spirit of social-distancing.

Similarly, the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act has force majeure as a shield to the lessee against the non-performance of its obligations under the mining licence. However, in certain circumstances, the force majeure is expressly rejected. A case in point could be Documentary Credit, which does not get extended beyond the expiry date by any force majeure circumstances.

As regards availing relief under the force majeure clause, it must be noted that it’s a question of fact and needs to be proved in each case in order to successfully plead it in the court of law. It is, therefore, important to examine some of the crucial issues at the outset when an entity/individual is contemplating legal options based on force majeure, both as a strategy as well as the ultimate goal.

First, does the COVID-19 disruption constitute a force majeure event under the contract in question? This is less likely as the history of the virus itself is not more than three months old. Second, will COVID-19 fall under some other events referred in force majeure clauses in the contract such as an “act of god,” a “natural disaster,” “epidemic”, “Government regulations” or just something beyond the contractor’s control? This would again be a question of fact that needs to be examined on the basis of the context of the contract and the scope of its performance. Third, it needs to be evaluated as to what the given contract provides for under the force majeure clause. Does it allow for extension of time for the performance of the contracts? Or is the provision for extension with or without compensation? Once again, it needs to be seen if the entity would rather give notice and seek extension or compensation. Does the force majeure clause allow one or both parties to terminate the contract? Are there any other terms in the contract that could be read or referred in connection with the liability arising out of non-performance? Are there mechanisms within the contract that provide relief to the party? Or does it provide for modification if the contract? If the contract is of international nature, it is also advisable to look at the law that would be applicable and then consider the factual conspectus in that scenario and how that law deals with the force majeure situation.

It is only after a careful examination of the contract and expected outcome that a call should be taken about invoking the force majeure clause and engage with the counter party. It is useful to remember that courts place the burden on the party asserting force majeure defence to demonstrate its existence and that such clauses are construed strictly by the courts.

The Supreme Court of India in the case of Energy Watchdog vs CERC, (2017) 14 SCC 80 (Adani power case) dealt at length the claim of the Adanis that the change in the price of coal in Indonesia amounted to force majeure and rejected the same after examining the contract document in question. The landmark cases on the subject being Alopi Prasad & Satyabrata Ghose, the court held that “force majeure” is governed by the Contract Act, 1872. “Insofar as it is relatable to an express or implied clause in a contract, such as the PPAs before us, it is governed by Chapter III dealing with the contingent contracts and more particularly, Section 32 thereof. Insofar as a force majeure event occurs dehors the contract, it is dealt with by a rule of positive law under Section 56 of the Contract Act.”

On another place in the judgment the findings of Satyabrata Ghose vs Mugneeram Bangur & Co is reiterated: “…The performance of an act may not be literally impossible but it may be impracticable and useless from the point of view of the object and purpose of the parties. If an untoward event or change of circumstance totally upsets the very foundation upon which the parties entered their agreement, it can be said that the promisor finds it impossible to do the act which he had promised to do.”

It was further held that where the court finds that the contract itself, either implied or expressly contains a term, according to which performance would stand discharged under certain circumstances, the dissolution of the contract would take place under the terms of the contract itself and such cases would be dealt with under Section 32 of the Act. If, however, frustration is to take place dehors the contract, it will be governed by Section 56.

Further, the court relied upon the finding in Alopi Parshad & Sons Ltd vs Union of India: “Parties to an executable contract are often faced, in the course of carrying it out, with a turn of events which they did not at all anticipate. For example, a wholly abnormal rise or fall in prices which is an unexpected obstacle to execution. This does not in itself get rid of the bargain they have made. It is only when a consideration of the terms of the contract, in the light of the circumstances existing when it was made, showed that they never agreed to be bound in a fundamentally different situation which had unexpectedly emerged, that the contract ceases to bind. It was further held that the performance of a contract is never discharged merely because it may become onerous to one of the parties.”

Therefore, the facts of a case as they play out before the court of law is an interplay of many dimensions and caution is required to be exercised while dealing with situations arising out of COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared it as the public health crisis on January 30 and on March 11, it revised its stand and said it is a “pandemic.” Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, rightly said, “This is not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector, so every sector and every individual must be involved in the fights.” This disease was unknown till the end of the December 2019 when it was reported by China to WHO and the world is grappling with the challenge it poses. In that sense, COVID-19 is a force majeure in a manner of speaking and unprecedented; still it would be imprudent to conclude that this would provide a blanket relief for all contracts and under all situations. The need, therefore, is for careful planning, strategic thinking along with an open mind to find amicable solutions and a human heart to respond to the current challenge.

8,16-4-20,Migrants revolt,"If we want them back, there has to be a solid reason and incentive for them to do so. Confinement without food won’t do

Nothing much has changed for the about 20 lakh migrant labourers, who have been displaced by the lockdown to contain COVID-19, driven out of their site shacks following stoppage of economic activity and left to fend for themselves with little or no savings. Turfed out of an existence as they knew it, they began the long walk home, fleeing a disease that they had not asked for but were exposed to, and returning to their subsistence livelihoods in the village. At least, there they would eat whatever the land would yield and they would be safe. And then they were held in camps by different State authorities, sometimes subjected to disinfectant jet sprays and at other times treated like pests and looked at with suspicion even if they offered themselves up for any job at hand. Although the lockdown is now being opened in a staggered manner to enable farm activity and construction, the flight has meant that a chunk of these labourers would rather avail these income openings in their own villages and States than staying on in cramped camps. There is a reason why 1,500 labourers virtually revolted and gathered at a bus stand in Mumbai’s Bandra on Tuesday afternoon, demanding transport arrangements to go back to their native places. Their reasons are common to all inmates huddled at makeshift camps that came up in various States in fits and starts, rather than as part of a unified policy. For all tall claims by authorities, they have no food. The Food Corporation of India godowns may be full and we may have many times more reserves than are required but with the supply and distribution chain broken down and disproportionately functional in places, no rations have reached these camps. Most labourers do not get more than one meal a day at a time when body resistance and immunity are primary concerns. Media reports indicate some of them are surviving on just rice, starch and salt. Except for private charitable organisations and trusts, there is no directive that makes Government community kitchens mandatory and keeps them running. Makeshift common toilet facilities are another problem, causing hygiene related deficiencies and compounding the risk factor for contracting the disease. Besides, there are no work opportunities or any kind of stipend. Apart from spraying disinfectants, there is no medical camp that assesses their health condition, leave alone testing for the virus. So the impatience and frustration are just getting over the tipping point. And that anger is manifesting in furious ways, sometimes as an assault on policemen enforcing the lockdown, at other times looting and damaging trucks full of supplies or simply staging sit-ins, demanding that they be allowed to travel. A recent survey has shown that four out of 10 labourers did not have ration left even for one day and 90 per cent had lost their only source of income in three weeks.

There is also a latent emotional reason. Rejected overnight by cities that they have serviced over the years and their residents who went into self-protection mode, they now are angry and want life on their terms. And they want to be home, a basic human instinct when battling a threat to survival itself. Yes, the Government did tout the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana, that would ensure that each one would get an additional five kg rice or wheat per month. The problem with migrants is they do not have ration cards here but in their villages. Those who do cannot use them either, simply because they do not guarantee portability like an Aadhaar and can be used only at the address registered on them. Besides, clustered in unknown sites, they do not know how to access fair price shops. Perhaps food coupons would have been better. As it is, the mass exodus has affected the economy badly with agriculture and small industrial units lacking enough staff. Perhaps the States housing camps should prepare a roster of units going empty, farms in need of manpower and send labourers there for work after a health check-up and an assurance of a clean accommodation, howsoever temporary. If we want to keep them back, then there has to be a reason and incentive solid enough for them to do so. Factory and farm owners need to restore confidence like clearing their dues, something that most MSMEs cannot as the Government is yet to repay them. Different State Governments may have to issue several work permits to get them back and keep them safe in a post-Covid work environment. It would be prudent to let those, who have been allowed to drift away too far out, to return and let them avail of MGNREGA schemes in their native villages. It is time to revive the village economy and set up import substitution units to decentralise the growth engine and get small wheels moving and pick up speed. If a solution is not worked out soon, protests and clashes will become the new normal as the in-betweeners could fuel a social uprising. We have no right to decide for them from a position of privilege but must guarantee their productive worth instead.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/migrants-revolt-2020-04-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/migrants-revolt.html

13,16-4-20,K'pada DHH bank short of blood,"The coronavirus outbreak has hit blood banks as the shortage of blood has emerged in the District Headquarters Hospital (DHH) Blood Bank.

If blood donation camps are organized, it will trigger a blood shortage crisis in the district and can cause severe problems for those reeling under thalassemia, anaemia, cancer patients and also pregnant woman ,said officials of the blood bank.

If official sources are to be believed, only three units of B +ve , 2 units of A+ve group, 1 unit of AB +ve group and 12 units of O +ve group blood are now available in the blood bank of DHH. Not a single unit of -ve group blood is available in the blood bank. It is only due to lockdown following the donors and people preferred to stay indoors in the ongoing lockdown and the donation of blood came down.

Though 20 units of blood are needed per day to meet the demand of Thalassemia ,pregnant woman ,anaemia ,cancer patients of the district , but there is a shortage of it.

As the donors did not turn up for donation of blood due to lockdown, the blood bank failed to meet per day blood requirement, informed, in-chargeofficer of blood bank Dr Manas Kumar Jena.

The district has about 160 Thalassemia patients ,who depend on the blood bank of DHH for frequent transfusion. Even the local clinics, cancer patients, anaemia pregnant patients along with accident patients too require blood during emergency. But due to shortage of blood, it has become a difficult task to arrange blood for them ,informed Dr Jena.

“Follow the Central guidelines. Conditional approval will be given to large construction works from April 20. Similarly, emergency medical services should start immediately,” Yogi told members of Team 11 in Lucknow on Wednesday.

The chief minister said that work should start on construction of expressways, state highways, housing societies, medical colleges and roads.

“Daily wagers will benefit from this conditional approval, but they will have to follow social distancing and other conditions suggested by the government,” he said.

Yogi instructed officials to start emergency medical services in the state and if needed, deploy MBBS final year students for this so that they could assist doctors.

The chief minister was informed that government agencies had set up 5,000 procurement centres across the state to buy crops from farmers and wheat purchase had already started at all the centres.

“Instructions have been given to follow social distancing in mandis. Farmers should not face any problem in bringing the produce to the mandis,” the chief minister said.

Yogi expressed concern about the future of students and directed officials to start online classes so that academic schedule did not suffer. “Heads of departments of Higher Education, Secondary Education, Vocational Education and Medical Education should promote online education in UP,” he said.

On this occasion, officials told the chief minister that the Higher Education department had prepared and uploaded over 31,000 e-contents that were being used by 2.29 lakh students.

19,16-4-20,Corona incidence pronounced in productive age,"Almost three in every four cases of coronavirus infection in Uttar Pradesh are from active working population in the age group of 21-60 years but the mortality is high among people above 60 years of age as per data released by the Uttar Pradesh government.

The Health department released the age-group survey of coronavirus positive cases found across the state on Wednesday.

Principal Secretary (Health) Amrit Mohan Prasad said that 17 per cent of the total 727 coronavirus cases in the state were in the 0-20 years age bracket, 46.5 per cent cases in 21-40 years bracket, 26 per cent in 41-60 years age group and 10.5 per cent in 60 years and more age group.

“In other words, 72.5 per cent of the cases are in the 21-60 year age group, which incidentally is the productive age group. This comes out to be around three in every four cases of coronavirus infection reported in UP,” Prasad said.

This trend, though uniform in India, is different from findings in other countries where people above 60 years of age are more affected. Therefore, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked people to take care of the elderly.

Prasad said that mortality was however very high among people of 60 years and above.

“The elderly have other diseases like diabetes, hypertension, cancer etc. and when they get affected by coronavirus, it becomes fatal. Therefore, it is requested that extra care should be taken of the elderly people,” he said.

Experts have come with an explanation behind high coronavirus incidence among people of productive age.

Head of Department of Respiratory Medicine, King George’s Medical University, Dr Suryakant, said that people in 21-40 year age group were always on the road. “They are ready to go out and they also act as attendants of ailing people. Thus, there is high chance of them getting infected,” he said.

Dr Suryakant said that figures about members who attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi in mid-March was not available. “I believe the number of people in the 21-40 age group could be high in the Jamaat too,” he said.

Dr SK. Pandey of Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences said that the primary reason could be that maximum persons in productive age group travelled internationally.

“A person who is carrying virus and screened at the airport may escape undetected as symptoms appear mostly a week after infection. Secondly, we have not intensified testing and therefore there is every chance that these people go undetected,” he said.

From Wednesday, the government has started pool testing wherein five samples each in hotspots in Agra would be mixed and tested in KGMU. Testing has also been intensified as now over 2,000 samples are being tested daily.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/corona-incidence-pronounced-in-productive-age.html

22,16-4-20,All 5 were gas tragedy survivors,"All five persons who died due to coronavirus in Bhopal were victims of the 1984 gas tragedy in Bhopal.

On March 21, some organisations working for the survivors of the Bhopal gas tragedy had written to the authorities concerned, saying such people were five times more vulnerable to the coronavirus infection.

""All the five persons who died after contracting COVID-19 here were victims of the Bhopal gas tragedy,"" the official said.

A hospital in the city dedicated for the treatment of gas mishap survivors has been turned into a facility for coronavirus patients, causing hardship to these people, Rachna Dhingra, member of the NGO Bhopal Group for Information and Action, told.The first coronavirus victim in Bhopal, a 55-year-old man, died at a hospital on April 5 due to negligence of authorities, she alleged.

Another 80-year-old gas tragedy victim, who was a retired employee of the Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), was also not given due medical care. He died on April 8 and his sample came out positive for coronavirus on April 11, Dhingra said.

On March 21, some organisations working for the welfare of gas tragedy survivors wrote to the state and central authorities concerned,

saying an overwhelming number of gas victims suffer from respiratory, cardiovascular, kidney problems and cancer as a result of exposure to the toxic gas that leaked at the Union Carbide factory here in 1984. They claimed that these survivors were at least five times more vulnerable to COVID-19 than other people.

Instead of paying special attention to the needs of Bhopal gas victims, the state government took over the only super-speciality Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Center (BMHRC)for gas victims,and turned it into a medical facility for COVID-19 patients, Dhingra said. For the last 22 days, no gas victim is even allowed to avail emergency services there, she said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/all-5-were-gas-tragedy-survivors.html

27,16-4-20,Do ‘men of steel’ not get Covid-19?,"At 8 pm on March 23, PM Narendra Modi in an address to the nation announced that from 0000 hours March 24, 2020 India shall go on a Covid-19 lockdown. Considering the severity of Covid-19 pandemic, I feel this was a bold as well as an important decision taken by Modi.

On consulting a few experts, I am convinced with the logic that if the chain of contamination could be broken, probability of mitigating the devastating effect of Covid-19 pandemic stands better.

On March 24, over the phone, a few of my constituents from Dhenkanal district of Odisha connected with my office, with a situation of theirs. I was told that even though everybody in India had been asked by PM Modi to stay at home, Tata Steel BSL Dhenkanal plant workers were being forced by their management to come to work. To the same, my office connected with Tata Group officials; and to my surprise, I learnt that the company had already been given permission by Ministry of Steel, Government of India to work as usual and that Covid-19 India lockdown did not imply to them.

This particular steel plant, am told, has thousands of people working in it. Which means chances of Covid-19 contamination is exposed to those thousands of workers, their families, their friends as well as their neighbours. Considering this to be a potential Covid-19 time bomb, I asked my office to connect me with decision makers as well as with enforcers of Odisha. That is when it's truly learnt that Covid-19 India lockdown exemption to the steel industry of India (not just to the Tata Group) had been given as per Essential Services Maintenance Act which had been passed by the Parliament in year 1981. As per Section 2(1)(a)(xii) of this Act (production, supply and distribution of steel as well as its input materials) shall be considered as ‘essential goods’.

How I wish for the Parliamentarians in 1981 to have had a fore vision that sometime during the end of year 2019, the world might face a pandemic such as the Covid-19. Am totally confused, it shall be nice if anyone of you could explain. Will any living organism cease to exist if steel isn’t produced during these testing times of Covid-19 lockdown? Are the lives of our steelworkers any less valuable than any of us who have been staying at home during this lockdown to save our life as well as the life of others?

This is a matter of concern for all the workers of the steel industry in India and not just of Tata Steel BSL workers. The otherwise very benevolent Ratan Tata is probably the eldest and arguably the most respected steel industry captain. History shall not be kind to him if he ‘does not stand up’ for Covid-19 safety of his own workers if not for all the workers of the steel industry in India.

‘Men of steel’ do not get Covid-19 or what?

At the same time, PPCC chief demanded that at least wages equal to 50 days of job should be urgently transferred to MGNREGA workers bank accounts in advance and work from them should be got done later since they had no money at present due to the ongoing lockdown to arrange food for their families.

Jakhar said that small and micro enterprises make significant contribution to the economy and millions of people are employed with it, “but with the limited financial resources, this sector is in serious crisis these days. It is not enough for the Central Government to defer loan recovery for just three months because after three months’ closure, the sector will not have the capital to pay the installments”.

He also said that the Centre has also asked the sector to provide regular salaries to its employees.

“It is imperative that the Central Government give exemption to small and micro enterprises in the interest of loans and other taxes for up to one year to prevent them from a fatal closure,” he added.

Terming the central government's contribution of Rs 500 to JanDhan accounts as a cruel joke to the poor, Jakhar said that in this way, the Centre was putting people in more crisis as thousands of people were braving heat in queue to draw only Rs 500 from the banks most of which were not following COVID related advisories also.

Therefore, it is necessary to transfer one-time and sufficient money in their bank accounts to prevent crowding that defeats the basic purpose of lockdown, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-cong-seeks-tax-relief-for-small--micro-industries.html

Alarmed, the District Administration has put around 500 people under home isolation, besides taking the samples for testing of his close contacts. Besides the herculean task of contact tracing, the Administration is also scrambling to trace the source of his infection.

“We have ordered the screening of the entire population living within the jurisdiction of the Patiala municipal corporation (MC) to avoid further spread of the infection. Special attention will be given to those exhibiting symptoms of coronavirus,” said Patiala Deputy Commissioner Kumar Amit.

The DC has also imposed ban on the distribution of langar in the city except the Red Cross Society.

“As per preliminary steps, we have sealed the area around his residence. We are conducting contact tracing,” said a government official.

Meanwhile, Amritsar Administration has started three-day house-to-house screening, and as many as 53,865 persons were examined from 12,401 households.

“Despite closure of industrial units and commercial establishments, surprisingly the domestic consumption of electricity has gone up compared to previous years. Data says the total consumption has gone up by 2.5 million unit than last year. It is believed since the people are forced to stay in they must be using all electrical appliances,” said Parida.

49,16-4-20,Lockdown right medicine but side effects painful: Badal,"Punjab’s five-time Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal on Wednesday said that the nationwide lockdown was “the right medicine at the right time but with painful side effects which need to be attended to immediately before they become more dangerous than the disease itself”.

“The poor, especially the daily wage earners, are the worst affected by these side effects and need immediate care. However, the other low income groups are not far behind,” said Badal adding that the middle classes were now beginning to find these side effects hard to cope with.

Badal said that the war on coronvirus needs to be fought with the same spirit as was seen during India’s struggle for freedom “as the challenge has the same gravity for every citizen”.

Describing hunger and poverty, plus unemployment and economic slowdown as three immediate, mid-term and long-term side effects of the pandemic, Badal called for a “graded strategy to fight all three”.

Welcoming ‘the gradual exit strategies’ announced, Badal appealed to the people, especially the farmers, farm labour and workers in other fields, to be extra-careful and “fully respect and obey the guidelines issued by the government”.

Badal, saying that lockdown was the only option available to the Government, said that “six weeks is a long time for the poor to survive without income, and more particularly, without regular supply of food at their door”.

“Governments must provide safe modes of travel to the migrants and others to go back to their homes, especially if the lockdown is to be extended further,” said Badal describing “containing and fighting unemployment” as the urgent long-term necessity.

Badal also emphasized the need for ensuring hassle free harvesting and procurement of the wheat crop saying that the governments must ensure that no one connected with these operations is harassed.

He urged the Centre to give a “significant bonus on wheat, in addition, the government must think of subsiding agricultural inputs in a major way”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lockdown-right-medicine-but-side-effects-painful--badal.html

52,16-4-20,Punjab starts pool testing of suspected corona patients,"Punjab Government has launched a pooled procedure for the investigation of suspected Covid-19 patients in the State’s Viral Research Diagnostic Lab (VRDL) at Government Medical College in Patiala and Amritsar.

“The results are very promising and no evidence of false results has been found during tests at Viral Research Diagnostic Labs (VRDL) of the states,” said the State Medical Education and Research Minister Om Prakash Soni on Wednesday adding that the technique is expected to increase Covid-19 testing capacity four folds.

Feasibility study of this technique has already been conducted and it is an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recommended technique, said Soni.

Soni said that the pooled testing algorithm involves the PCR screening of a specimen pool comprising multiple individual patient specimens, followed by individual testing (pool de-convolution) only if a pool screens positive. While all individual samples in a negative pool, are regarded as negative. This technique increases the capacity of the laboratories to screen increased numbers of samples and also results in substantial cost savings when a large proportion of pools tests negative, he said. He said that pooled testing detects viral RNA in samples very accurately and helps maximize existing resources. It can really save costs while enhancing the capacity enormously, he added.

Researchers from Germany and Israel have already validated this method and ICMR had issued the advisory in this regard on April 13. The labs in Punjab had immediately taken up this challenge and have delivered the results, thereby saving not only on costs but also on the test kits which are in limited supply the world over.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-starts-pool-testing-of-suspected-corona-patients.html

The initiative has been adopted by the Punjab Mandi Board to launch an e-pass system with the help of Department of Governance Reforms and Public Grievances, in an effort to further streamline the procurement operations in the backdrop of the Covid-19 crisis.

The OLA app, installed on the mobile phones of the farmers, shall also alert them on the rush spots at the mandi gates to check overcrowding. App’s centralized dashboard, a unique initiative aligned to the social distancing guidelines of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, shall also give alerts on pass issuance, expiry and validation.

This unique system enables Market Committees Secretaries across the State to generate mobility passes for farmers by the purchase centers as well as by the ahrtiyas. The software generates the required number of passes automatically, based on historic data available with the Mandi Board.

All arhtiyas shall be provided with one pass for one trolley of wheat. The passes for a particular day are provided three days before to the arhtiyas, to prevent any kind of rush. This automated technology solution removes all unnecessary bias and opportunities of favouritism, thus bringing in transparency to the process.

The arhtiyas shall distribute these mobility passes to their farmers to enable the latter to come on the designated date at the concerned purchase center. The farmer shall also receive an SMS with pass number and link to download the app.

“Apart from the e-pass system, an mPass system has also been developed in the ePMB mobile application. A Unicode SMS is sent to every arhtiya at the time of pass issuance. The arhtiya can allocate the passes to trolley drivers through in-built mPass system. The drivers can then download the mPass using the SMS received on his number, and use this mPass at various Police Nakas for permitted mobility,” said the state Additional Chief Secretary, Development, Vishwajit Khanna.

Khanna said that the online vehicular management shall help the Board maintain law and order protocols as well as DHS guidelines in the mandis.

59,16-4-20,Rawals of Badrinath and Kedarnath shrines to remain present,"The suspense over the presence of chief priests (Rawals) of Badrinath and Kedarnath shrines during the opening of the portals ended on Wednesday with Uttarakhand Government assuring that arrangements for their return to the State are being made. The Rawal of Badrinath, Ishwari Prasad Namboodri, is at his native village in Kerala while the Rawal of Kedarnath, Bhima Shankar Lingam, is at Nanded in Maharashtra. The portals of Kedarnath shrine are scheduled to open on April 29 while that of Badrinath are opening a day later on April 30.

As per the tradition, the presence of chief priests is necessary during the ceremonial opening of Badrinath and Kedarnath shrines after their idols are carried from their respective winter abodes.

Apprehensions were being expressed in various quarters on presence of these priests during the portal opening ceremonies due to prevailing lockdown in the country to check the spread of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection.

Due to the lockdown, the air, rail and road network in the country are totally jammed.

These apprehensions further gained ground after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced extension of lockdown till May 3. Incidentally both Maharashtra and Kerala are the states where large numbers of COVID-19 affected patients are being reported.

On behalf of Uttarakhand government, the tourism and culture minister Satpal Maharaj talked with both these chief priests on Wednesday and assured them that necessary arrangements are being made for their travel to the State.

When contacted, the Rawal of Badrinath, Ishwari Prasad Namboodri said that he has quarantined himself at his home in Kerala. “The State Government has assured me that I would reach my destination in Uttarakhand before April 20,’’ he said.

The Rawal of the Kedarnath, Bhima Shankar Lingam also said that the Uttarakhand Government has informed him that necessary arrangement for his timely return to the State are being made.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rawals-of-badrinath-and-kedarnath-shrines-to-remain-present.html
60,16-4-20,HC hears two PILs via video conferencing,"In a first, the Uttarkahand High Court heard two public interest litigations via video conferencing. These two PILs were regarding the protection equipment provided to doctors and paramedical staff, and issues related to farmers considering the lockdown imposed for containment of the spread of COVID-19.

Hearing on the petition regarding protection equipment for doctors, other medical staff and other aspects of COVID-19 treatment, the division bench of justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Ravindra Maithani has directed the government to submit a reply by April 18. Advocate Dushyant Mainali had filed the PIL seeking proper protective equipment for doctors and security arrangements for them. Raising questions at the safety of doctors and medical staff working on the frontline against COVID-19, the petitioner had contended that instead of PPE kits, the doctors and related staff were provided HIV kits which are not effective in protection from COVID-19.

The court has asked the Government to inform about the number of protective kits provided to doctors and medical staff, and measures taken for their security. The court has also asked if there is possibility of and whether the Government can set up laboratories for COVID-19 test in Udham Singh Nagar, Haridwar and Ramnagar. The government has also been directed to prepare guidelines for provision of telemedicine facilities in hospitals.

Hearing the second PIL regarding problems being faced by farmers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the division bench asked the Central and State Governments what guidelines have been issued for harvesting of the Rabi crop.

The court has also asked if the State Government can facilitate the purchase of the Rabi harvest without crowding.

The court has sought a reply by April 18. Murli Manohar Srivastav had filed this PIL stating that the Rabi crop was ready to harvest but the harvest and sale was being affected by the lockdown.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hc-hears-two-pils-via-video-conferencing.html
61,16-4-20,"UT identified as hotspot, Admn to urge Centre to reconsider decision","The Union Territory of Chandigarh, which has reported 21 positive Covid-19 (Coronavirus) cases till Wednesday evening, has been included in the list of coronavirus hotspots released by the Central Government.

As per Centre’s guidelines, restrictions will continue to apply on hotspots or red zones till May 3. A district could move from the red to the green zone if it does not report any case for 28 days, and vice-versa.

The development has come as a major disappointment for the UT Administration, which has decided to approach the Central Government to reconsider its case and allow relaxations accordingly, after April 20.

The Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a day before announced that for the next one week till April 20, every town, district, state will be examined carefully and areas, which have shown improvement in tackling coronavirus will be given certain relaxations.

Following this, the Administration had already begun preparing a roadmap for allowing relaxations after April 20 in the city. Curfew was imposed in Chandigarh on March 24 to ensure social distancing and combat the spread of Coronavirus. The city has so far recorded 21 positive Coronavirus cases, out of which nine have already recovered and no death has been reported till Wednesday evening. While 1721 were put in home quarantine as a precautionary measure, 1226 have completed the quarantine period.

Manoj Parida, Adviser to UT Administrator while talking to The Pioneer said, “Chandigarh has been included in the list of 170 districts identified as Covid-19 hotspots or red zones released by Central Government.

“The Administration will approach the Central Government urging it reconsider Chandigarh’s case as more than nine persons have already recovered in the city. No coronavirus hotspots within the city have been identified,” he said.

“We were hoping to allow certain relaxations regarding public movement and opening of various establishments after April 20. But, no relaxations can be allowed in coronavirus hotspots as per Centre’s guidelines till May 3,” he added.

The UT Administrator VP Singh Badnore was also apprized about Centre’s decision to declare Chandigarh as a hotspot district, which requires strict restrictions in the city. The Administrator has directed the UT officers to ensure that the instructions received from Central Government be strictly implemented and supervised.

Notably, Chandigarh is a joint capital of Punjab and Haryana. While Punjab has so far reported 186 positive coronavirus cases, Haryana has recorded 190 cases.

The satellite township of Chandigarh namely Mohali in Punjab is also Covid-19 hotspot and has reported 56 cases, maximum in the State. Neighboring district of Panchkula in Haryana has reported six cases.

According to the Centre’s guidelines, in hotspots, containment zones will be demarcated by States/ UTs/ District administrations as per the guidelines of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. In these containment zones, the activities allowed for non-hotspots will not be permitted. There shall be strict perimeter control in the area of the containment zones to ensure that there is no unchecked inward or outward movement of population from these zones except for maintaining essential services (including medical emergencies and law and order related duties) and Government business continuity.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ut-identified-as-hotspot--admn-to-urge-centre-to-reconsider-decision.html

65,16-4-20,Govt to issue appointment letters to doctors in waiting list: Anil Vij,"To tackle the Covid-19 pandemic amid reports of shortage of doctors in some hospitals of the State, Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij on Wednesday said that the State Government has decided to issue fresh appointment letters to doctors on 116 posts, who were named in the waiting list.

“With the direction to join duty within 15 days of issuance of appointment letters, state Government had issued appointment letters to 312 selected doctors in March but only 196 of them have joined. A total of 116 have not joined duty and their joining date has expired. Now new appointment letters will be issued to those candidates who are in the waiting list,” Vij said.

The Health Minister said that this move is a part of mobilising all available resources in view of the Covid-19 crisis and to ensure the availability of doctors in rural parts of the State.

Sources in the health department said that the selection process of 447 doctors was initiated by the Health Department through Rohtak PGI. 312 doctors were selected and were offered to join their favorite district. A total of 1400 candidates had participated in the selection process done by PGI, Rohtak.

Despite Government’s consistent efforts, there has been shortage of doctors in the Government hospitals since long. Currently, there are 789 vacancies in the Government hospitals despite availability of about 2,500 doctors hospitals. If all 312 selected doctors join duty, there will still be a vacancy of 477 doctors in the State, officials said.

Meanwhile, Vij said that to provide medical services in rural areas, 211 medical teams have been formed to operate mobile clinics. These medical teams will visit different areas of the districts in Haryana Roadways buses, which will be converted into mobile clinics, to provide general OPD services and trace people exhibiting Covid-19 symptoms.

Talking to ‘The Pioneer’ over the phone, Vij said, “To address the regular medical issues of citizens left unaddressed due to the unfolding of the Covid-19 crisis, all district chief medical officers have been directed to form teams, consisting of doctors, paramedics and pharmacist, to operate mobile dispensaries.”

To execute this scheme effectively, all the DCs have been given necessary instruction and also directed to prepare the route plan of the mobile dispensary with the officials concerned. This dispensary will go to each village for the treatment of patients for at least two hours. Many villages will be covered in a day, the Minister added.

Vij said that to know the actual status on the execution of this scheme, he will review this scheme with DCs on Thursday.

The Health Minister said that instruction has been issued that social distancing will be taken care of once the mobile dispensary reaches the village. No crowd will be allowed to gather, he said, adding that the medical officers have been directed to send maintenance records of patients daily at State Headquarters. All Chief Medical Officers have been instructed to create routes by coordinating with the concerned DCs.

Sources in the Health department said that every mobile dispensary will have Allopathic, Urologist and homeopathic medicines. For mobile dispensaries to function, teams have been formed, which include doctors, paramedics and pharmacists. They will visit their assigned areas, examine the health condition of people who approach them for check-ups and provide them with medicine.

The time-table has been made for every village and mobile dispensary will visit the villages accordingly. To avail the service of mobile clinic, the villagers will be informed about when the mobile dispensary will reach their village. Once or twice in a week, a mobile dispensary will visit the village as per necessity.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-to-issue-appointment-letters-to-doctors-in-waiting-list--anil-vij.html
66,16-4-20,Naveen Patnaik is hero in corona battle,"The unruly coronavirus has evoked the fear, precautionary spirit and frightful discussion among the human race as never before. The horrifically infective virus is the biggest enemy of mankind at the present. The entire human world is slowly coming together to destroy the invisible foe. The multifarious sovereign political entities that were at war for long have ignored hostilities and turned friends for survival.

Mighty and wealthy nations led by the USA are reeling under the pressure of helplessness as the virus is lurking everywhere irrespective of borders.

China believably discovered the virus first after taking a big beating. And since developed Western countries, having turned lazy due to riches, had dumped all their manufacturing activities in China to save money at enormous loss of employment, most of their nationals carried back the virus to their home locales. When Trump got to know about the pandemic, he was advised by his medical experts to let the country folks get infected to develop good enough ‘herd-immunity' and defeat the virus routinely. The previous SARS virus breakout in China was deadlier than corona but much less infective. The genetic material DNA of the previous one was less adaptive and so less lethal. Corona has the RNA genetic material which is way smarter in duping the host cell and getting itself ferociously multiplied. Incidentally, DNA is the master genetic material that stores and transmits the genetic code. The RNA is only the servant messenger to carry the message to newly-forming organism. The servant is always usually slier and bigger master of machinations. Corona is an RNA-virus that adapts hosts easily and jumps species immediately when in trouble.

By the time corona caused panic by assuming proportions of a global pandemic, huge damage was already done to those national communities that had intimate relationships of trade and other transactions with China. Around the close of February 2020 when India was groping in wilderness, Naveen Patnaik came heavily on the precaution mode having been guided perfectly by his chosen group of aides. Odisha, thus, is the first State to clamp the most critical lockdown technique as there was not much time in hand to persuade people to practise social distancing, constant hand-washing and more behavioural adaptations. PM Modi took cue and declared a nationwide lockdown. Naveen still scores by having established maximum number of COVID hospitals and installing the fastest testing equipment in Odisha.

The infection incidence and prevalence today across India are a bit misleading for the simple reason that ‘proportionate-to-population' tests are not being conducted due to lack of facilities. Odisha is one of fewest States to test huge numbers of COVID suspects. It is also the first State to extend the lockdown period to April-end. Naveen is smarter in disaster management. If Modi and Naveen join hands in nation-building efforts, wonders would happen.

Rightly, people have realised the greatest warriors in the ‘corona-destroy’ battle are low-wrung police functionaries that endure the scorching sun to keep public order intact; the nurses at hospitals who work in closest proximity with patients; the sanitary workers who keep clearing garbage from all around; and, lastly, the doctors some of whom are extremely dedicated in treating the afflicted people. Some doctors do shirk work out of fear of infection particularly those running private clinics. These cash-crazy crooks should be identified and brought to book. Besides, the bureaucratic administrators who are alert days and nights to ensure every official is delivering the desired service and everything is in place need to be hailed as heroes. People do not seem to know how top-level bureaucrats perform duties in nightmarish conditions because ultimately they would be blamed if things failed. But it is also true some tricky officials glorify themselves by confusing the media guys-in-a-hurry. They dramatise very ordinary acts during daily Press briefings.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/naveen-patnaik-is-hero-in-corona-battle.html

The awardees include four Superintendents of Police (SPs), one Assistant Superintendents of Police (ASP), one Deputy Superintendents of Police (DSP), six Inspectors, four Sub-Inspectors, three Assistant Sub-Inspectors (ASIs), two Head Constables and four Constables.

The award would honour those who have done outstanding work by going beyond the call of duty in various kinds of humanitarian activities during the current corona pandemic.

“They are selected from various nominations sent by the Commissioners of Police and Senior Superintendents of Police (SSPs) for the award introduced on the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s initiative in the light of scale and sacrifice of over 45,000 policemen who are working relentlessly across the State along with social and religious organizations to realize the resolve that ‘no man will sleep hungry in Punjab’,” said the DGP Gupta.

Gupta said: “Nakodar ASP Vatsala Gupta did pioneering work in reaching out to the poor and underprivileged slum dwellers of Nakodar town, while Ropar DSP Varinder Jit Singh ensured supply of essential goods to the poor and needy by mobilizing volunteers. Ropar’s SI Jatin Kapoor motivated the Panchayats to impose a voluntary lockdown of their villages.”

Kharar Station House Officer (SHO) Bhagwant Singh proactively carried out the tracking and tracing of suspect coronavirus cases.

Thousands of residents of the Uttarakhand working in other states are stranded and their hopes of return to homes got shattered when the Government extended the lockdown to control the spread of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).

The Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) Pritam Singh said that the State Government should make arrangements for return of these people of the State. “I appeal to the Chief Minister of State to show same empathy in ensuring return of people of state stranded in other areas and sending back the people of other states stuck here as shown in sending the stranded Gujarati’s back,’’ he said.

The Vice President of Uttarakhand Congress, Jot Singh Bisht said that the system which the State Government has set in place for return of Uttarakhandis stranded elsewhere has proved to be failure. “The officials concerned are either not picking up phones or are giving false assurances to the callers. The State

Government should prepare a plan for return of these stranded people of the State in a phased manner,’’ he said.

Bisht added that many of the stranded don’t have money to pay the rents of the houses they are living and are facing crisis of food also.

In a letter written to chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, Congress leader Manish Khanduri said that most of the youth of the State work in industrial areas or hotels and due to prevailing lockdown they have become unemployed.

He said that these people were somehow managing till April 14 but the extension of lockdown has brought them in a crisis.

He said that if any person is found outside wearing masks and violating social distancing, then strict legal action will be taken against them. “If the mask is not available, self-made masks or towel and handkerchiefs etc. can also be used,” added Kumar. “All the office bearers and police officers of the district and the heads of all other public sector undertakings and private companies are requested to ensure strict compliance in their establishments as well as in their areas even at their own level,” said the DC.

Appealing to masses to stay indoors and follow the lockdown strictly to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Kumar said people should venture out only in cases of emergency and to purchase essential commodities. “They should return home as soon as the purchase is done and not linger on roads,” he added.

“Police can now arrest anyone found outside without a good reason,” he said.

Anybody flouting the order will be warned by the police. However, the decision regarding levying penalty on violators is yet to be taken, said the official.

Those found violating the instructions will be punishable under disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant of the IPC and the police authorities are empowered to take action against the violators, said an official.

Chief secretary Sukhdev Singh was equally apprised of the plights of the patients. Clinics and nursing homes have begun to open now. These were found closed since March 24 barring a few nursing homes and doctors who continued to serve.

Sources said on April 14 DC Palamu Shantanu Kumar Arahari issued a letter to doctors/ nursing homes management to start delivering medical assistance to patients maintaining their own safety protocol.

DC’s letter read that district administration was getting complaints with regard to the closure of clinics and nursing homes.

The tone and text of the DC’s letter is just a kind reminder to doctors and nursing homes management to come up and help the needy patients and with all safety gears for themselves.

It has a note of advice to doctors and nursing homes management that in the event of any patient coming to them with complaints of cold, cough fever & respiratory trouble be immediately referred to civil surgeon or to the nearest government health set up.

The shutdown of clinics and nursing homes in all these days made quacks to strike gold as for one intramuscular injection the charge went up from 20 rupees to 50 per injection while for intravenous injection one shot was worth 250 rupees.

At least 50 per cent of Jharkhand's Coronavirus cases are from Capital City Ranchi – all from Hindpiri, where the first case surfaced on March 31, they added.

""One suspect's samples tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. He is around 35-year-old and a resident of Hindpiri,"" said Health Secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni. The health department was looking for more details about the patient and how he may have got infected, Kulkarni added.

However, the Government's timely intervention has prevented the virus from spreading in other parts of the city, he added.

Despite a delayed entry in Jharkhand, the virus has infected 28 people in around a fortnight – a cause for concern for the health department here. While the Government is planning to abide by the latest guidelines of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) for partial relief from the lockdown, it is likely to keep the affected areas of Jharkhand locked, sources said.

The prototype coveralls have already cleared the prescribed tests with the highest grades at the authorised ‘Defence Research and Development Organisation’ (DRDO) laboratory at Gwalior, the ministry said in a statement.

“Doctors, medical professionals, other health workers and care-givers of the Indian Railways are working tirelessly to fight the Covid-19 disease. All these personnel are directly exposed to the Covid-19 disease when working amongst infected patients. As a first line of defence against contracting the novel coronavirus, they need to be provided with a special kind of impervious coverall that acts as a barrier to the virus as well as other disease carrying fluids,” it said.

In order to fill the gap in availability and requirements of PPEs, Jagadhari workshop of Northern Railway had taken the initiative to design and manufacture a prototype PPE coverall, it said, adding that the prototype coverall was tested by ‘Defence Research Development Establishment Laboratory’ of DRDO at Gwalior, authorised for conducting such tests.

“Since each such coverall can only be used once they are required in very large numbers. As the incidence of Covid-19 disease increases, even though in a relatively controlled manner, the requirement of PPE coveralls is also multiplying,” it said.

Taking this initiative forward, Indian Railways has been able to procure and distribute to its workshops and other units sufficient raw material for manufacturing more than 30,000 PPE coveralls in the current month (April 2020).

The Ministry said that it has set the target of manufacturing another 1,00,000 PPE coveralls in the month of May, 2020, and sourcing of appropriate raw material has been started.

“All this has been done despite there being a major global shortage of appropriate raw material as well as machinery for manufacturing PPE coveralls. Behind this endeavour is the time-tested capability of Indian Railway’s workshops and production units of manufacturing and maintaining some of the safest railway rolling stock in the world,” it said.

The same capabilities, expertise, protocols and procedures usually followed for design, manufacturing and use of rolling stock, have been utilised for enabling field units and workshops to start manufacturing high quality PPE coveralls so rapidly, it said.

132,16-4-20,No relief for tipplers as sale of liquor banned,"This is not a good news for tipplers. The Centre on Wednesday banned the sale of alcohol and tobacco during the next phase of the lockdown to contain the coronavirus outbreak. The Centre’s guidelines came even as states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab were mulling opening liquor stores, which have a major contribution to the

State economy.

Ahead of the extension, states like Assam had allowed the sale of alcohol while those like Meghalaya had set up a provision to ensure home delivery of the spirit so that social distancing norms are not violated.

After the fresh guidelines on Wednesday, Assam and Meghalaya have withdrew their order to open liquor shops.

Kerala had earlier allowed addicts to buy alcohol if they produce a doctor’s prescription but the Kerala High Court stayed the government order and the Indian Medical Association too had objected to it.

According to a fresh set of guidelines issued by the union home ministry, there should be a strict ban on sale of liquor, gutka and tobacco. The restrictions for public spaces also include a ban on spitting in public and the organisation of gatherings. The directives shall be enforced by the District Magistrate through fines and penal action under the Disaster Management Act 2005.

In the first phase of the lockdown, states had refrained from operating liquor stores to ensure social distancing norms are followed.

Many are turning to illegal liquor, say customs and police officials, who have seen a marked increase in seizures of hooch, which has in the past claimed thousands of lives among the poor unable to afford branded booze.

According to Google Trends, online searches for “how to make alcohol at home” peaked in India during the week of March 22-28, the same week Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed the nationwide lockdown.

The liquor industry contributes about Rs 2 lakh crore a year to state governments by way of excise duty and in some states as value added tax, said an industry insider. Bulk of their tax outgo goes to state governments as liquor is a state subject. The liquor industry sustains livelihood of nearly 40 lakh farmers, and employs nearly 20 lakh people directly and indirectly.The central government’s indirect taxation of the industry is mostly limited to customs duty on import of concentrate.

“Excise duty on liquor is among the major revenue streams to state governments similar to GST on goods and services and excise duty on petrol and diesel. Kerala generates highest revenue from liquor sale every year,” said an official of the central excise department. The states that depend heavily on liquor for tax revenue are Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Delhi.

The International Spirits & Wine Association of India (ISWAI), which represents India’s largest liquor makers, told the consumer affairs ministry that the suspension of alcohol sales is only helping the illegal trade.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/no-relief-for-tipplers-as-sale-of-liquor-banned.html
133,16-4-20,Centre amends green rule for drug production,"After its move to grant “out of turn” clearances to bulk drug projects against the backdrop of surging Covid-19 cases, the Centre has gone a step further to ramp up the availability of drugs by making an amendment to Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification 2006.

“All projects or activities in respect of bulk drugs and intermediates, manufactured for addressing various ailments, have been re-categorised from the existing Category ‘A’ to ‘B2’ category. Projects falling under Category B2 are exempted from requirement of collection of Base line data, EIA Studies and public consultation,” the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change said in a statement.

The move is aimed at addressing the unprecedented situation arising from global outbreak of COVID-19. Within two weeks, more than 100 proposals have been received under this category, which are at different levels of decision making by the concerned regulatory authorities in the states.

“The re-categorization of such proposals has been done to facilitate decentralization of appraisal to State Level so as to fast track the process. This step is with a view to help in increasing the availability of the important medicines/ drugs in the country within short span of time. This amendment is applicable to all proposals received up to 30th September 2020. The states have also been issued advisories to expeditiously process such proposals.

“Further, to ensure expeditious disposal of the proposals within given time-line, Ministry has also advised states to use information technology e.g. video conference, considering the fact that in view of the prevailing situation on ground, appraisal of proposals may not be possible through physical meetings, the MoEF stated.

Earlier, the Centre had decided to expedite clearances to bulk drug projects by considering them ‘out of turn’ ensure overall preparedness and availability of drugs to reduce the impact of the outbreak.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/centre-amends-green-rule-for-drug-production.html

137,16-4-20,"Punjab Govt, Ola develop app for e-passes to farmers","The Punjab Government has developed a mobile application with cab aggregator Ola to issue e-passes to over 17 lakh farmers, in a bid to prevent overcrowding at state grain markets during the procurement of wheat.

The procurement of wheat in the state mandis started on Wednesday amid the lockdown imposed to check the coronavirus spread.

According to an official release, the application will help in the online management and regulation of all tractor-trailers and vehicular movement in the mandis.

It removes all unnecessary bias and favouritism, thus bringing transparency to the process, the release said.

Under the initiative, all arhtiyas (commission agents) will be given one pass per wheat trolley, which they will further give to farmers.

Farmers will come to the mandis on a given date at the designated procurement centre.

The app, installed on mobile phones of farmers, will alert them about rush spots' to check overcrowding.

The centralised dashboard of the app, an initiative aligned to the social distancing guidelines of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, will also give alerts on pass issuance, expiry and validation.

This mobile app has been adopted by the Punjab Mandi Board to launch an e-pass system with the help of the Department of Governance Reforms and Public Grievances in an effort to streamline the procurement operations in the backdrop of the COVID-19 crisis, said the official release.

The software generates the required number of passes automatically based on the past data available with the mandi board.

Within two weeks, from March 31 to the morning of April 15, the number of COVID-19 cases in the state increased 13 times.

However, officials point out that about 80 per cent of the patients have been found in Indore and Bhopal districts alone. As per the 2011 census, the population of the state was around 7.26 crore.

The 24 districts where coronavirus patients have been detected are home to 4.29 crore people. Also, no coronavirus case was found among the local population in Satna, but it figures in the list of virus- affected districts as two persns arrested under the National Security Act in Indore and shifted to a jail in Satna tested positive.

If Satna is excluded, remaining 23 affected districts house 55 per cent of population. ""The number of affected districts looks high, but around 80 per cent of the cases are reported in two districts Indore and Bhopal. So the virus has affected these two districts the most, especially Indore,"" said Mohammed Suleman, Additional Chief Secretary, Public Health and Family Welfare.

Of 874 COVID-19 cases in the state, 544 or over 62 per cent are from Indore. One hundred and fifty-eight cases — 18 per cent — have been reported from the state capital.

139,16-4-20,SC considers Centre's stand on helping poor,"The Supreme Court took note of the Centre's submission on Wednesday that it was taking steps to implement relief measures to help the poor during the nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic and disposed of a PIL seeking relief such as financial help and food for them.

A bench headed by Justice NV Ramana recorded the statement of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta who explained the steps taken by the centre to address the concerns raised in the petition.

The apex court, through video conferencing, was hearing the PIL field by activist Swami Agnivesh seeking immediate relief for poor, homeless and all Economically Weaker Sections during the lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19 or novel coronavirus.

It was alleged by senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the activist, that the March 28 guidelines of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare 28 on helping people were not being fully implemented by authorities concerned.

""On the contrary, Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the Union of India states that there is full monitoring and implementation of the guidelines...And it will be ensured that the concerned police authorities would also naturally follow these guidelines.

""Recording the statement made by the Solicitor General, we dispose of the instant writ petition,"" said the bench which also comprised justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and B R Gavai.

The bench took note of Mehta's statement that the central government was taking all steps to ensure that the benefits of relief measures reach to the poor and needy people.

The law officer said the Centre would ensure that state governments also do the needful to help the poor and its (Centre's) day-to-day directives are being complied by them. Gonsalves submitted however that the government should have paid wages to the migrant workers in this hour of need.

He contended that though the Centre in its affidavit has claimed that everything has been done to help people, at the ground level very few things have been done. During the hearing, the bench said the grievance of the petitioner was that at the ground level, the administrative authorities were not implementing relief measures.

The law officer said there is no reason to ""not to trust"" the Centre.

He said ""these are self employment generating petitions. This court should not entertain such petitions"".

He was later remanded to judicial custody.

The court directed that he be kept at the newly created jail ward in the hospital till his treatment is over and later lodged in prison, a senior police official said.

The PIL filed by People for Better Treatment (PBT) through its President Dr. Kunal Saha, said the use of HCQ and AZM were recommended for the most serious COVID-19 patients by the Health Ministry based primarily on anecdotal evidence and not as a specific therapy.

The petition has also sought directions to take necessary steps for immediate implementation of all the specific preventive measures recommended in hospitals across India to protect the lives of COVID-19 patients who are being treated with HCQ and AZM.

It said the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare published comprehensive 'Revised Guidelines on Clinical Management of COVID-19' on their website on March 31, 2020 that included detailed description of how to test, diagnose and treat COVID-19 patients.

""Ministry of Health has specifically advised that although no specific anti-viral medicines are available against COVID-19, a combination of HCQ and AZM may be administered as an 'off-label' use to the most seriously ill COVID-19 patients who are in ICU,"" it said.

Many doctors have started using HCQ and AZM to treat their most critically ill COVID-19 ICU patients in hospitals across India following the published treatment guidelines put forward by the Health Ministry, it said.

""Off-label use of HCQ and AZM in acutely ill COVID-19 patients has been highly controversial from the very beginning. However, both HCQ and AZM were studied extensively prior to FDA approval for their use in indicated medical conditions and both drugs are known for occasional and serious adverse reactions, particularly on the cardiovascular system in humans,"" the plea said.

142,16-4-20,HC grants bail to man accused of assaulting two women doctors,"The Delhi High Court on Wednesday granted bail to a man, accused of assaulting two women doctors of Safdarjung Hospital for allegedly not following social distancing norms amid coronavirus pandemic, and observed that he should have been respectful towards them rather than abusing and threatening them.

Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar, who conducted the hearing through video conferencing, granted relief to the man, who was in jail since April 10, saying no useful purpose would be served by keeping him in custody and overcrowding Tihar Jail.

“The country is passing through a very difficult phase and the doctors are rendering yeomen service to the nation. The petitioner being an educated man, as stated by the counsel for the petitioner that he is an interior designer by profession, should have been respectful to the doctors rather than abusing and threatening them,” the court observed.

The court noted that accused Sanjeev Sharma was suffering from diabetes and he was earlier allowed by the trial court to carry two medicines in jail for his medical condition. It granted bail to him on furnishing of a personal bond of Rs 20,000 and a surety of the like amount.

According to the police, the incident took place on April 9, when the two women were allegedly abused and assaulted in Gautam Nagar area near AIIMS by the 42-year-old man, who alleged they were spreading coronavirus and were not maintaining social distancing.

An FIR was lodged at Hauz Khas police station for the alleged offences of causing hurt, molestation, criminal intimidation, wrongful restraint and insulting the modesty of a woman by uttering objectionable words under the IPC.

The prosecution opposed the bail plea saying the allegations against the man were grave and serious in nature and instead of being thankful to the doctors, he attacked and molested them.

143,16-4-20,"Cong seeks probe, says attempt to disrupt communal harmony","The Congress on Wednesday demanded a thorough probe into the gathering of migrants at Mumbai’s Bandra railway station saying it was an attempt to disrupt communal harmony and negate the State’s efforts to fight the coronavirus outbreak. Questioning why railway bookings continued during the lockdown, the Congress also sought a probe into the role of the Railways Ministry.

While former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan alleged that the Congress smelt a political conspiracy behind the campaigns being run on social media to impose President’s Rule in Maharashtra, alliance partner NCP’s chief Sharad Pawar urged political parties to desist from scoring points over each other during the ongoing crisis and asked them to defeat Covid-19 collectively.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi questioned the role of Railway Ministry in spreading the rumour of run of the train and urged the Government to probe the “role” of the Railways Ministry.

Addressing a Press conference through a video link, Chavan cited a letter of the South Central Railways for starting special trains to transport migrant labourers that might have triggered the gathering at Bandra.

A large number of migrant workers gathered at the Bandra railway station on Tuesday, forcing the police to take stern action to disperse them.

Chavan said a police probe into the matter has already been launched and the guilty will be brought to book. Taking on the BJP, Chavan said, “Who is patronising the social media campaigns to impose President’s Rule in Maharashtra? It smells of a political conspiracy. This is not the time to play politics, but who is running such social media campaigns needs to be found out.”

Pawar termed as unfortunate the gathering of migrant workers outside the Bandra railway station and stressed such incidents should not recur in the face of the Covid-19 crisis.

He said people gathered outside the station after somebody circulated the rumour that trains services will resume, adding precautions need to be taken to ensure that such confusing messages are checked.

“Somebody spread the rumour that train services will resume and local people gathered there. Unfortunately, social distancing was not observed,” Pawar said in a Facebook post.

“I would also request political parties that we may fight politically but this is not the time to score over each other. It is not the time to think who is in power at the Centre and in the state. We should take steps to defeat the coronavirus,” he said.

For her part, Priyanka also urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to help the stranded workers reach their villages. “After all, why does every disaster break on the poor and the workers? Why are decisions not taken while taking them into consideration. Why are they left on God. Why was booking of railway tickets allowed to continue during the lockdown?”

She said the workers were the backbone of the country and the government should help them reach their villages. “For God’s sake, Narendra Modi ji please help them,” Priyanka said.

“Why were special trains not arranged? Their money has finished and so have their stock of ration. They are feeling insecure and want to go home in their villages. Arrangements should have been made for them. They can still be helped with proper planning,” the Congress general secretary said in a tweet in Hindi.

Congress leader Ahmed Patel said the “role” of the railways ministry must be probed for the crisis among the migrants. “Why were train services abruptly stopped leaving migrants stranded? Why was railways accepting bookings despite no clarity on lockdown extension,” he asked.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cong-seeks-probe--says-attempt-to-disrupt-communal-harmony.html
144,16-4-20,"India faces double whammy of Covid, Pak infiltration","In the backdrop of a spike in ceasefire violations by Pakistan on the Line of Control (LOC) and infiltration bids into Kashmir, Army Chief General MM Naravane will review the situation on the border during his one-day visit to the Valley on Thursday. His visit also comes days after five elite commandos were killed in a hand-to-hand fight with as many terrorists in Keran sector. All the terrorists were also killed.

The Army Chief’s visit comes at a time when on the one hand the entire world including India are fighting the coronavirus pandemic and on the other, the Pakistan Army is determined to up the ante on the LOC as evident from the hike in the number of ceasefire violations in the last two months.

With summer setting in and making it easier for the militants to negotiate the ingress routes so far blocked by snow coupled with the fact that the Pakistan Army and ISI are desperate to foment trouble in Kashmir, the Army chief will take stock of the operational preparedness of the anti-infiltration and anti-terrorist grid.

Besides fine-tuning the strategy to meet the upcoming challenge in his meetings in Srinagar with the commanders of the 15 Corps responsible for fighting terrorism in the Kashmir Valley, Naravane is also likely to visit some positions on the LOC, sources said here on Wednesday.

The coming months are crucial for the security forces as it will be the first summer after the abrogation of Article 370 giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir last year. Militants will try to go all out to stoke violence. The Pakistan Army has already stepped up the tempo by relentlessly violating ceasefire on the 750-km long LOC and giving covering fire to the ultras to sneak into the valley.

Nearly 1,144 ceasefire violations between January and March this year have taken place with the highest number of violations (411) being recorded last month. The ongoing month of April has seen more than 60 such violations so far, sources said.

These figures are higher as compared to last two years with 680 violations between January-March in 2019 and 630 in 2018 for the same period, they added. The overall figure for the entire 2018 and 2019 are 1,629 in 2018 and 3,170 last year. This year more than 1,200 ceasefire violations have already taken place.

As regards the anti-terrorist operations, the security forces have killed 41 terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir this year so far compared to 152 terrorists in 2019 and 215 in 2018.

On renewed efforts by Pakistan backed militants to come into the valley from across the LOC, the Army recently carried out precision strikes against terrorist launchpads in the Dudhniyal area in Pakistan occupied Kashmir(POK). The operation was undertaken by the force after a series of ceasefire violations and infiltration attempts by the Pakistan army in the Keran sector.

The action came a few days after the five commandos were killed while battling militants who had infiltrated into the Keran sector in north Kashmir on April one.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/india-faces-double-whammy-of-covid--pak-infiltration.html

Equity benchmarks reversed early gains to finish in the negative territory on Wednesday as risk-off mood prevailed amid grim prognoses of the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Weak global markets and the rupee plunging to its all-time low against the dollar further weighed on sentiment, traders said.

After gyrating over 1,346 points during the day, the 30-share BSE Sensex ended 310.21 points or 1.01 per cent lower at 30,379.81.

Similarly, the NSE Nifty settled 68.55 points, or 0.76 per cent, down at 8,925.30.

Kotak Bank was the top loser in the Sensex pack, cracking 6.23 per cent, followed by Hero MotoCorp (4.83 per cen), Bajaj Finance (4.63 per cent), HDFC (3.61 per cent), HDFC Bank (3.57 per cent) and Maruti Suzuki (3.55 per cent).

On the other hand, HUL, HCL Tech, ITC and Nestle India were among the gainers, rising up to 6.07 per cent.

Despite opening on a positive note, domestic stocks gave up all gains in a highly volatile session following negative sentiment in global equities amid projections of major slump in economic growth, traders said.

The IMF on Tuesday slashed India’s projected GDP growth to 1.9 per cent in 2020 from 5.8 per cent in January, as the global economy is seen hitting the worst recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s due to the raging coronavirus pandemic.

Meanwhile, the Government on Wednesday said industrial units in rural areas will be allowed to function from April 20, provided they follow social distancing norms, while all kinds of public transport will be barred and public places closed till May 3.

“There may be greater clarity for the market participants as the details of the limited relaxation of the lockdown rules are announced by the State Governments. But the volatility in the markets may stay with us till the trajectory of growth and price level becomes less uncertain,” said Joseph Thomas, Head of Research — Emkay Wealth Management.

Analysts also said the focus will now also shift to the earnings season and the management commentary on the impact of Covid-19.

“Almost all sectors have been affected by the lockdown and the market will try to measure the future financial impact of this, rather than focusing on the previous quarter numbers. This is expected to drive stock specific moves in the market in the coming days.

“IT companies will officially kick off the earnings season and investors will be keen on how the virus spread has impacted their services and the locations in which those services are offered,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

BSE bankex, finance, energy, auto and consumer durables indices ended up to 2.49 per cent lower, while FMCG, basic materials, realty, capital goods and metals gained up to 4.33 per cent.

149,16-4-20,India is world's most digitally dexterous country: Survey,"Sixty-seven per cent of digital workers in India said emerging technologies such as machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) are increasing their effectiveness at work, according to a survey by Gartner, Inc.

The Gartner 2019 Digital Workplace Survey found that India is the most digitally dexterous country in the world - followed by the UK and the US, due to having the largest Gen Z workforce along with the desire to learn new skills using digital technologies in the workplace.

Twenty-seven per cent of the digital workers in India are skilled experts in digital technology for work purposes, the research and advisory firm said in a statement.

""Seven out of ten employees in India said that adoption of new digital technologies will create career opportunities and higher paying jobs,"" said Rashmi Choudhary, principal research analyst at Gartner.

""Technical professionals are firm believers of adopting new digital technologies in comparison to manual, skilled and semi-skilled manual workers.""

In terms of tools that employees use for real-time collaboration, digital workers in Singapore and India use real-time messaging and social media network tools more frequently than their counterparts in China, France, Germany, the US and the UK.

""Digital tools improve employee collaboration through crowdsourcing and cross-pollination, thereby improving the digital dexterity of workers,"" Choudhary said.

Forty-five percent of digital workers in India do not mind having their work habits tracked and monitored by digital technologies. This figure is the highest amongst the surveyed respondents.

""Digital workers in India believe that an intelligent workplace contributes to increased focus on more meaningful, business-critical work. At the same time, they expect that their organisation is mitigating the risk it entails by being monitored,"" she said.

The survey also showed that digital workers not only want formal training which consists of classroom modules and workshops but are also willing to undertake on-the-job (OTJ) and just-in-time (JIT) training to enhance their digital skills at work.

In India, 39 per cent of digital workers want to be trained OTJ to keep their knowledge on AI, ML, IoT up to date, which is the highest amongst the survey respondents, Gartner said.

TCS Board has proposed a final dividend of Rs 6 per equity share.

152,16-4-20,1 lakh RSS members lend helping hand to people in distress,"The RSS has deployed the highest number of over one lakh ‘swayamsewaks’ in Kerala for “serving” those facing distress on account of coronavirus. Over all, the organisation has sent out a total of over 2 lakh of its workers — of which around 2,000 are doctors and medical students — across the country .

According to the Nagpur-based organisation, a total of 25,61,391 people who are affected in one way or the other since the outbreak of the pandemic were assisted by 2,04,190 RSS workers across the country in 25,924 places.

The RSS “inspired” doctors and medical students under the banner of ‘National Medicos Organisation’ have been working “in around 110 places in the country” including hotspots, said NMO’s National General Secretary, Dr Yogender Malik. He said they are “inspired” by the RSS and willing to be the ‘frontline warrior’ in the crisis.

Malik said 500 Doctors have been moved to 18 States in the country “ who are running helpline, arranging Personal Protection Equipments , facial mask, blood camps , creating medical awareness, cleanliness and other related jobs”. Talking to Pioneer, he said in total Doctors and medical students in service in the places affected by the pandemic are 2000 and “ they are working in coordination with state governments and local administration” .

Another doctor Rajiv Mittal, looking after the Delhi Rs PrantRs , said in the national Capital the NMO has put 80 doctors to supplement governments efforts to contain the spread of Coronavirus.

Beside Doctors and medical students, the RSS ‘Swayemsevaks’ are spread over 25 states according to the RSS zone-wise division of the country. The states include Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka in south to Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh to Jammu and Kashmir in the North and Maharashtra and Gujarat in the west to Bengal, Assam and Tripura in East and the North-East.

“ The number of 204, 190 RSS workers is of April 09 and it would swell further by the end of the month,” said Rajiv Tuli, in-charge, Delhi RSS.

Asked whether RSS workers were also managing the lockdown , Tuli said “Yes, it is with the consent of the state governments and local administrations as we have our volunteers in the field.”

Some eyebrows were raised recently over RSS workers’ engagements in “assisting’ the three-week lockdown in the country.

The RSS workers are involved , among other tasks, in providing face-masks, sanitisers and cleaning of hospitals and isolation centres, said RSS leaders. “The workers have also been asked to create awareness about social distancing and other preventive measures,” they said. Besides, providing food to migrant and daily wagers and supporting low income families without government supplies with essential groceries are among the services rendered by the RSS.

The RSS maintained that its workers have also been providing “food and safety gear” to police and medical personnel, forming the frontline of the anti-corona battle.

With the onset of the pandemic, the RSS has cancelled more than 60,000 of its ‘shakhas’ and “moved many of them online”.

Interestingly, the RSS deployment is massive in Kerala where 1,04,500 of its workers have been placed in 6000 places. They have attended to around 30,00,00 people in the state till date. In comparison, the other states including the highest populated Uttar Pradesh and the most coronavirus-affected state of Maharashtra stand nowhere near Kerala in the number of presence of ‘Swayemsevaks’.

In Uttar Pradesh, the Braj area has 8977 workers, Kanpur 7827, Avadh region 3273 and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home constituency Varanasi has 4639 ‘Swayamsevaks’ to provide civic help.

In Maharashtra, the RSS has sent 136 workers in Konkan, 290 in Vidharbh, 250 in west Maharashtra and and 588 swayemsevaks in Devgiri.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/1-lakh-rss-members-lend-helping-hand-to-people-in-distress.html
153,16-4-20,"Growth will see strong rebound from Q2 FY21, says Niti VC","India’s GDP growth will see strong recovery from the second quarter of this fiscal as economic activities resume, Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar said on Wednesday. He also expressed hope that the Government will unveil fiscal measures to jumpstart growth, which has plummeted due to the Covid-19 crisis.

In an interview with news channel CNBC-TV18, Kumar said April would be a washout in terms of economic activity, though all has not been lost for agriculture.

“Once economic activity starts in the second quarter, I think you will see a fairly strong recovery in the country for the next three quarters of financial year 2020-21. To support that I am sure the Government will come up with a fiscal stimulus.

“There is a clear understanding within the Government and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that we have to do whatever it takes to get the economy back on track. We know that the implications of a very weak growth are going to be negative,” he said.

Kumar said he is convinced that with the fiscal policy package now in the making, India will see economic activity recovering quite strongly from the second quarter of 2020-21.

Replying to a question about delay in announcing another fiscal package, the Niti Aayog vice chairman said the country’s diversity is significant to come up with a pan-India solution and it takes time to develop guidelines.

“Plus, we do not have the luxury of unlimited resources at our disposal. So we have to figure out what is the cloth that we have (with) which to cut our coat, as it were. So, that is being considered quite actively.

“I know that some of us are being impatient, but the request from us would be to have a bit more patience because at this point of time it is important to get it right and it is important to therefore take as many variables on board as we can before something like that is announced,” he said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/growth-will-see-strong-rebound-from-q2-fy21--says-niti-vc.html
154,16-4-20,WPI inflation cools to 4-month low of 1% in March as food prices ease,"Wholesale price inflation eased to a four-month low of one per cent inMarch on sharp fall in prices of food and fuel items asdemand slowed.

The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) based inflation was 2.26 per cent in February and 3.10 per cent in March, 2019.

As per Commerce and Industry Ministry data, food inflation fell to 4.91 per cent in March from 7.79 per cent in the previous month. Fuel and power basket witnessed deflation of 1.76 per cent, while manufactured products witnessed inflation of 0.34 per cent in March.

The Government said, due to outbreak of coronavirus and national lockdown, the provisional figures of WPI for March are computed with low response rate. “The figures are likely to be revised in a significant manner during release of final month,” it said.

The WPI inflation in March is the lowest since November 2019 when it was 0.58 per cent.

Inflation in vegetables fell sharply to 11.90 per cent in March from a high of 29.97 per cent in the previous month. Onion prices continued to rule high with inflation at 112.31 per cent during March.

Pulses was the only item in the food articles category which saw rise in rate of inflation at 12.12 per cent in March, from 11.42 per cent in the previous month. Data released earlier this week showed retail inflation, based on consumer price index, fell to four-month low of 5.91 per cent in March from 6.58 per cent in February. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) takes into account retail inflation while formulating its monetary policy.

The RBI had last week said that its inflation outlook looks benign, with risks around inflation project being balanced. With softening of food prices, sharp fall in crude prices and normal monsoon, RBI expects inflation for current fiscal to be in the range of 3.6-3.8 per cent. It said the impact of Covid-19 on inflation is ambiguous, with a possible decline in food prices likely to be offset by potential cost-push increases in prices of non-food items due to supply disruptions.

The nation-wide lockdown which started on March 25 would have had an impact on the data collection for the month and the inflation number for April is likely to be even lower.

ICRA Principal Economist Aditi Nayar said March WPI should have seen a deflation if the index levels fully reflected the plunge in prices of commodities like minerals, crude oil and natural gas, in the aftermath of the Covid-19 outbreak. “For April 2020, while food inflation may undergo an uptick, the lagged correction in prices of various commodities would push the WPI into disinflation. At present, we expect the WPI to record a disinflation of 1.5 per cent in FY 2021, in contrast to the mild inflation of 1.7 per cent in FY 2020,” Nayar said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/wpi-inflation-cools-to-4-month-low-of-1--in-march-as-food-prices-ease.html
155,16-4-20,"MFIs may face liquidity, debt servicing challenges in absence of loan moratorium from banks","Microfinance institutions (MFIs) are likely to face severe liquidity and debt servicing challenges if banks do not offer loan repayment moratorium to them, according to rating agencies. Though most of the micro lenders have extended the three-month moratorium, announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), on repayment of term loans to their borrowers, there is an ambiguity on whether the same is applicable for MFIs.

A clarification on repayment moratorium is still awaited from the banking regulator.

“MFIs are yet to formally receive moratorium from their lenders and the absence of the same could severely impact their ability to serve their debt-servicing obligations,” rating agency Icra said in a report.

The industry is going to face a cash shortage for some time after the lockdown is eased as collections from borrowers will remain almost nil, it said. “Moratorium is critical for NBFC-MFIs to sustain their business and tide over liquidity stress as they have announced moratorium to their borrowers,” another rating agency Care Ratings Associate Director Ravi Kumar Dasari told reporters in a webinar Wednesday. Rating firm Crisil in its report said most of its rated MFIs in the investment-grade or with strong parentage have sufficient liquidity to manage repayments and operational expenditure for the next two-three months but for other micro lenders, availing of the moratorium will be critical.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/mfis-may-face-liquidity--debt-servicing-challenges-in-absence-of-loan-moratorium-from-banks.html

Narendra Jadhav, a Rajya Sabha MP and former RBI chief economist, said the principle objective of the government should be to save lives now and save livelihoods in the immediate future.

“Due to Covid-19, India’s GDP growth rate will take a hit and may come down to 2.1 per cent from 4.5 per cent...India should release an economic package which should not be less than 5 per cent of its GDP soon,” he said during an online address to the Masters’ Union School of Business.

Jadhav also highlighted a host of policy measures that the Government should take in these times including relaxing the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM ACT), letting the fiscal deficit rise for 1 year, relaxing the limits on the debt that can be raised by the States and taking away MPLAD funds for 2 years. “But with the crisis at hand, the GDP of the world will come down by 2.2 per cent which looks small but is incredible in terms of the size and travesty it can cause,” Jadhav noted.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/india-growth-may-fall-to-2-1-pc-in-fy21-due-to-coronavirus-impact--expert.html
158,16-4-20,"Global stocks, oil price sink on grim forecasts","Global stocks and oil prices tumbled on Wednesday after the International Monetary Fund said the world’s economy will suffer its worst year since the Great Depression of the 1930s due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Indexes in London and Frankfurt were down about 2 per cent and benchmarks in Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney closed lower. Wall Street futures were down by over 1.5 per cent. The price of oil hit a new 18-year low the International Energy Agency said demand will drop by 9.3 million barrels per day in 2020 overall. Demand in April will hit its lowest since 1995, it said. The drop came despite an agreement over the weekend among OPEC and other oil producers to cut output to reflect collapsing demand.

Benchmark US crude lost 40 cents to USD 19.71 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, declined USD 1.02 to USD 28.58 per barrel in London. The IMF said this year’s global economic output will shrink by 3 per cent, a bigger loss than 2009’s 0.1 per cent decline during the financial crisis. That was a sharp reverse from the Fund’s January forecast of 3.3 per cent growth before the virus prompted governments to shut down factories, travel and other industries. “The IMF forecast a deep economic winter,” said Hayaki Narita of Mizuho Bank in a report. The IMF’s chief economist, Gita Gopinath, said the loss to global gross domestic product, the broadest gauge of economic output, could amount to USD 9 trillion, or more than the economies of Germany and Japan combined. In Europe, London’s FTSE 100 lost 2.3 per cent to 5,661 and the DAX in Frankfurt declined 2.1 per cent to 10,473. The CAC 40 in France retreated 1.9 per cent to 4,437.

159,16-4-20,No time to waste: WHO after Trump freezes funds,"The World Health Organization (WHO) is purely focused on saving lives and halting the coronavirus pandemic, its chief said Wednesday after USPresident Donald Trump announced he was freezing funding for the WHO.

“There is no time to waste. WHO’s singular focus is on working to serve all people to save lives and stop the COVID-19 pandemic,” director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Twitter following Trump’s decision.

Trump said Tuesday he was freezing the funding pending a review into the UN health agency’s “role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus”, adding: “everybody knows what’s going on there”.

The US is the biggest individual contributor to the WHO’s funds.

Tedros was due to host one of his thrice-weekly virtual press conferences later Wednesday from the organisation’s headquarters in Geneva. Tedros tweeted the WHO’s updated strategic preparedness and response plan for dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, which was released on Tuesday.

“The updated WHO global Covid-19 strategy guides the public health response at national and subnational levels, including practical guidance for strategic action, tailored to the local context,” he said.

“One of the main things we’ve learned in the past months about Covid-19 is that the faster all cases are found, tested, isolated and cared for, the harder we make it for the virus to spread.

“This principle will save lives and mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic.” Trump’s move has drawn criticism from the United Nations, Russia, China, the European Union, the African Union and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, another major WHO contributor through his foundation.

Trump’s freeze on funding for the WHO is a selfish response to the global pandemic, a senior Russian official said. “We see yesterday’s announcement by Washington on freezing funding of the WHO as most concerning. It is a sign of the very selfish approach of the US authorities to what is happening in the world due to the pandemic,” deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said.

Iran said the world is learning that the United States “kills people”, after President Donald Trump suspended US funding for the World Health Organization amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif likened the funding freeze to the United States’ “maximum pressure” campaign against his country. “The shameful defunding of WHO amid a pandemic will live in infamy,” Zarif wrote on Twitter. “The world is learning what Iran has known & experienced all along,” he said. “US regime’s bullying, threatening & vainglorious blathering isn’t just an addiction: it kills people,” added Zarif.

The European Union said Trump has “no reason” to freeze WHO funding at this critical stage and called for measures to promote unity instead of division.

On Twitter, Bill Gates — whose foundation was the second-largest donor to the WHO for its latest two-year budget, contributing over $530 million in 2018 and 2019 — wrote that stopping funding for WHO during a world health crisis “is as dangerous as it sounds.”

Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, pushed back at Trump’s announcement. “Placing blame doesn’t help,” he wrote on Twitter.

“The virus knows no borders. We must work closely against Covid-19.”

The Netherlands also threw its support behind the WHO. “Now is not the time to hold back funding. Once the pandemic is under control, lessons can be learned. For now, focus on overcoming this crisis,” Sigrid Kaag, minister for foreign trade and development cooperation, said on Twitter.

In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian says the country is “seriously concerned” about the US Government’s decision to suspend funding.

161,16-4-20,Work out the lockdown,"Staying at home does not have to bring your fitness journey to a halt. Regular equipment-free exercise and eating healthy are the way to go, says Ayushi Sharma

The lockdown has been nothing less than a challenge for everyone. In between switching channels, odd eating hours and poor sleep schedule, you may find it difficult to follow a proper workout regime. However, fitness experts suggest that home workouts can be a great substitute for gym sessions. It’s a good idea to start with basic bodyweight exercises. Yoga is another activity that can be done anytime and anywhere. It is just important to ensure that there is a routine and you stick to it as you need to channel your pent-up energy. Here are some tips and tricks one can follow:

Various Home workout techniques

The founder of a fitness social network and consultation platform, FITTR, Jitendra Chouksey, tells us that exercising not just strengthens your immune system but it is a great way to ward off some of the psychological issues associated with being cooped up for an extended time. He shares that one can always begin with basic exercises which require no equipment at all.

For instance, push-ups are a great way to exercise at home. “If you’re completely new to this exercise, you can start with wall push-ups. As you gain strength, graduate to bent knee push-ups. Then, one bent-knee push-ups (with the other leg stretched out). Once you’re able to do these properly with full range of motion and correct form, then start doing regular ones (with both legs stretched out),” says he and goes on to add that you can add progressions or increase the intensity in two ways — either by doing different variations of the exercise, such as one-armed push-ups, decline push-ups where you place your feet on a higher surface or you could add external weight, such as doing regular push-ups while wearing a backpack with some weights inside it.

Jitendra suggests another great way is to perform circuit training. It’s a form of body conditioning or resistance training using high-intensity aerobics. It targets strength building and muscular endurance. This involves performing a series of exercises in rapid succession with a very short break or even no break in between.

He recommends, “Try doing AMRAP (as many reps as possible) or TABATA, a high-intensity interval training, where you workout for 20 seconds, then take a 10 second break and repeat the cycle for eight rounds.”

Any physical activity that can keep you active and fit is great during the lockdown, feels Sarvesh Shashi, founder of SARVA and Diva Yoga. For instance, he says, “Even five minutes of yoga is better than doing nothing all day. While mornings are apt, yoga routines are flexible enough to be practiced all day.” He shares some basic yoga routines that can help build immunity and keep you active:

Kapalabhati pranayama: Sit comfortably with your spine straight and place your palms on your knees. Take a deep breath in. As you inhale, pull your stomach in and try pulling your navel back towards the spine as much as possible. As you relax the navel and abdomen, the breath flows into your lungs automatically. Take 20 such breaths to complete one round of kapalabhati pranayama.

Inversions: These enable the lymph fluids to flow through the body, filtering the bacteria and viruses in the system and thus help in ramping up your immune system.

Twist and detox: Seated spinal twists compress and stretch the core/torso, increasing the circulation of blood to the gut, which stimulates the digestion process. A healthy gut is essential to building a stronger immune system.

The rise of fitness apps

Since everybody has switched to home workouts, there has been a rise in online fitness apps. These applications claim that it’s like having your own personal trainer on the smartphone. “During the lockdown period, FITTR has seen a spurt of almost 15 per cent in the total number of downloads. A really well-designed fitness app is an intuitive tool that becomes the one-stop-shop for all your fitness needs, right from nutrition and diet to exercise and overall well-being,” shares Jitendra. “We understand the key roles that motivation and peer support can play in helping a person on their fitness journey. FITTR has over 5,00,000 members and it provides them with a platform to share their stories and engage with others on their fitness journeys,” adds he.

While it’s definitely much easier to lounge on a couch, binge watch on series and forget your commitment to the gym but the lockdown is no excuse to ditch exercise, says Diksha Chhabra, a fitness trainer, sports nutritionist and founder of Diksha Chhabra Fitness Consultations. “The user must decide on an apt platform on the basis of effectiveness, flexibility and personal attention. If all these aspects are taken care by the platform one chooses, it’s a great way to stay active in a disciplined manner,” she feels.

Not everybody is a fitness enthusiast but it’s really important for people to indulge in some kind of physical activity. However, the question is how to make it interesting so that people are motivated? Experts believe that online fitness platforms are actually inspiring their followers to get up and keep moving.

With a commitment to remaining fit, active and healthy while staying at home, close to a thousand members of the Decathlon community, whether they be teammates or volunteer sports ambassadors, have come together with a series of #playitsafe challenges and activities online. It offers virtual workouts ranging from indoor running, strength and conditioning to targeted workouts and yoga sessions.

Decathlon has also put together a creative format of virtual events dubbed as ‘Hallympics’ for those missing the Olympics. These were a series of games and challenges for people at home to follow and participate in, hosted across social media platforms. The activities were designed to be easily practiced in one’s hall, living room or just about anywhere. Points were awarded collectively to each city. Challenges included handle hurdles, one glass-one leg, frozen squat designed for just about anybody from kids to groups of family members.

Another fitness gamification app, StepSetGo, has revolutionised walking by rewarding its users. They took cognizance of this global self-isolation and launched a 21-day fitness challenge on their app. As a part of this, users will undergo a series of seven challenges, all from the comfort of their homes. Users will be challenged to be active, burn calories, test their endurance levels and find innovative ways to walk two km within their homes. In the end, they will be rewarded with StepSetGo coins, which can be redeemed for exciting offers on the app’s bazaar as well as Amazon vouchers.

Well, technology, for sure, is increasingly finding a place within people’s fitness routines now more than ever.

Do not confuse boredom with hunger

Since the level of physical activity is reduced, our energy requirements are lower than usual. “People should stick with regular healthy balanced meals. Portion control is necessary as we are sitting at home, we tend to confuse boredom with hunger,” says Diksha. “One can ensure eating at fixed timings and set portions, avoid binge eating fried junk. Stick to regular Indian meals, which is well-balanced with protein, carb, vitamin, mineral and fibre. Addition of fruits and vegetables are a must to boost your immunity and metabolism,” adds she.

A healthy gut can ward off many health conditions. It is important that your diet is composed of antioxidant-rich foods. “Include immunity-boosting foods every day including those rich in Vitamin C and other minerals,” Sarvesh shares.

Jitendra suggests a few ways to ensure that you continue to stay healthy and eat well:

Avoid junk food: It’s tempting to demolish all the cookies and chocolates as you lounge on the sofa watching movies. But these are empty calories that will only make you put on weight. Eat healthier snacks such as vegetable sticks, fruit and salads (without the sauces). The best way to avoid temptation is to not stock junk food in the house at all.

Don’t starve yourself: Another problem is that people could go to the other extreme and cut their food intake drastically because they’re afraid of gaining weight. Don’t cut calories all of a sudden. Eat whole foods and let hunger be your guide. If you aren’t sure how much to eat, use fitness apps to calculate your daily caloric requirement.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/work-out-the-lockdown-2020-04-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/work-out-the-lockdown.html

Bollywood actor Deepika Padukone has been a diva since childhood and she has shared a picture to prove it.

The actor took to Instagram to post a vintage childhood image to prove that her career “started young,” leaving her fans in complete awe.

In the image, Deepika is looking cute in a glamorous black dress with matching shoes and a hat, and is posing like a pro with a big smile. “Started young…,” she captioned the picture.

Amid the lockdown, the actor has turned into a masterchef and is treating her husband and actor Ranveer Singh to scrumptious meals.

‘I am committed to taking risk in career and life. What scares me is what if I lose out on the confidence to take new challenges. Hopefully, that never happens. I do not want to live a predictable life. Perhaps that is why change does not worry me, stagnancy does. Every change that is happening now is teaching us something.’

—Sobhita Dhulipala

It seems actor Ayushmann Khurrana is a big fan of the hit Spanish show Money Heist, originally titled La Casa de Papel.

Taking to Instagram, the actor posted a video that shows him playing Bella Ciao, the title track of the show, on his piano. He also shared that he wants to essay the role of the professor (played by Alvaro Morte) in the series .

He captioned the video, “I want to be the professor. That’s why I’m wearing similar glasses and playing Bella Ciao. I want to put this out in the universe. Hello reverent filmmakers, are you listening?”

163,16-4-20,Making a difference,"House of Anita Dongre makes masks to support the fight against COVID-19

House of Anita Dongre, announces the production of cloth masks for distribution to contribute in the fight against COVID-19. After receiving adequate permissions from government authorities, production of these masks has begun in two of the five rural village centres that were initiated in collaboration with the Maharashtra state government four years back, starting with Charoti. Through these centres, the Anita Dongre foundation trains women to make garments and has set up a production facility close to their homes to bring gainful employment to them.

Starting this week, these centres have had voluntary participation of about 24 women who will be able to create up to 7,000 masks each week for distribution to NGOs, village residents, individuals, and hospitals.

Fears around COVID-19 are escalating each day and with masks becoming compulsory to wear in Maharashtra, the supply has struggled to catch up with demand. The women in these village centres will be working under strict social distancing and hygiene protocols to produce these masks and distribute them. “Every one of us must do everything within our power to stop the spread of this virus and keep as many people as we can safe. The production of reusable masks is one step in that direction.” says fashion designer and chief creative officer of ‘House of Anita Dongre’.

Made of cotton, these reusable masks will use fabric that was originally purchased for the production of clothes for The House of Anita Dongre’s labels AND, Global Desi, and Anita Dongre. These protective masks while being reusable are also washable and sustainable. At the request of the local hospital in Palgarh, the team will also make special disposable masks for doctors, nurses and hospital staff.

The company clarified that there is no end goal right now. “As long as people need masks they will be produced and distributed” said Anita Dongre. This is the company’s second initiative to fight COVID-19 after setting up a 1.5 Crore fund to cover smaller vendors and self-employed artisans arising from previously unforeseen medical emergencies at this time.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/making-a-difference-2020-04-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/making-a-difference-making-a-difference.html
164,16-4-20,Face masks to be a fashion accessory: Sircar,"Face masks are going to be a fashion accessory and social status soon, feels filmmaker Shoojit Sircar, at a time when India along with the rest of the world is battling the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Piku director took to Twitter to express the idea. He wrote, “Face masks are going to be a fashion accessory and social status soon like jewellery, handbags, hats, belts, scarves, watches, sunglasses and much more. Designer label face masks for weddings/birthdays/anniversary etc.”

Masks have become mandatory to step out anywhere, what with the escalating count of COVID-19 cases everywhere around.

Reacting to his tweet, a user shared a news piece that says global fashion giants such as Louis Vuitton, Burberry and Chanel have already started making protective clothing for people on the front lines of the pandemic.

One of the brightest and most innovative storytellers in Bollywood, Shoojit Sircar never seems to run out of fresh ideas to share on social media while spending time in lockdown. And his sense of humour is worth applauds, too!

In an earlier tweet this morning, the filmmaker expressed that since the world has been hit by an economic crisis, we should head back to barter system as a means for exchanging goods and services. He suggested that people can give him their unused items, clothes, ration, vegetables and other things in exchange for watching his movies!

“As the World 2020 is hit with huge ‘economic crisis’, I suggest let’s head back to Barter System as a means for exchanging goods and services. It is most simple and trade is ‘fair’. No problem of over-production and under-production, No concentration of economic power. In a barter system, you only produce the required amount of goods and services, thus minimizing waste in the monetary economy. For instance, people watch my films and they can give me their unused items/ration/veggies/clothes whatever,” he wrote on Twitter.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/face-masks-to-be-a-fashion-accessory--sircar-2020-04-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/face-masks-to-be-a-fashion-accessory--sircar.html
165,16-4-20,NAFED to the rescue,"The federation has begun its supplies of pulses and oilseeds in various States and Union Territories during a nationwide lockdown amid the pandemic

The National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED), Government of India, has begun dispatching the supply of one kg pulses under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojna (PMGKY) to states and union territories like Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Chandigarh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Goa, Karnataka, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Andaman & Nicobar Islands, during the lockdown amid Coronavirus pandemic.

Under the Yojna, NAFED aims to supply 1,95,510 MT of processed or upgraded pulses to the states to cover around 19,55,51,000 households in the 36 states and union territories. There are pulses like Arhar, Masoor, Malka, Chana dal, Chana whole and Urad for the beneficiaries. It is expected that by the end of the April, it will supply the required quantity for the month.

Except Chana whole, all the dals being supplied require processing. NAFED procures the whole raw pulses with FAQ specification from the farmers at Minimum Support Price (MSP) announced by the government in the producing states. Therefore, the millers are being hired by the federation through a transparent selection process to mill and deliver the processed pulses at different delivery centres of the states, confirming to FSSAI grade.

Despite the lockdown, the federation is making strenuous efforts to supply the pulses in the minimum period for this month and ensure supplies for May and June on time.

In addition, the federation is already continuing to procure pulses and oilseeds at MSP from the farmers in the states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh. It is likely to also undertake procurement in Rajasthan, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh soon.

The Federation is gearing to make intervention for purchase of vegetables and fruits from cooperatives and FPOs to minimise the losses to the farmers to some extent. It is seen that the presence of NAFED in the Mandis provides essential support to the markets. The update on the progress of supplies under the Yojna is being regularly tracked.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nafed-to-the-rescue-2020-04-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/nafed-to-the-rescue.html

While all the major equipment for the testing facility have been provided by Governemnt of Odisha, the infrastructure has been provided by SAIL-RSP. Doctor and paramedics of the hospital, trained at RMRC, Bhubaneswar and AIIMS, Bhubaneswar, will carry out the testing. The testing lab facility at IGH will be of great help in quick identification of Coronavirus patients and containment of the disease.

Amid Coronavirus pandemic and hence, a nationwide lockdown, the Sunaayy Foundation has come forward to help their children and poor daily wage labourers. Realising the loss of work and wages due to Coronavirus’ attack on livelihood of 2,300 migrant workers and their families, whose 450 children are a part of the foundation in Vasant Kunj, its team courageously fought all odds to distribute them about 4,000 kg of grains, 2,000 kg of potatoes and onions, and 800 soaps. The relief work has been supported by members of Young Indians (Yi), a subsidiary of Confederation of Indian Industries (CII). The relief team of Sunaayy has managed a smooth distribution following all norms of social distancing and lockdown caveats.

With a view to keep medical staff fully prepared to tackle emergencies due to the outbreak of COVID-19, a training session was organised at Tapan Sinha Memorial Hospital, Metro Railway, Kolkata, on Monday. This training programme was conducted to train the medical staff of Metro Railway on Donning and Doffing of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), in which para-medical staff were trained on how to use PPE and dispose them properly. It should be noted that the Tapan Sinha Memorial Hospital is also ready to handle COVID-19 patients, if required. Hence, a 75-bed isolation ward has been set up for such patients. Five doctors, 17 nurses and other paramedic staff have been posted in the ward to treat Corona suspected/ confirmed patients. So far, no COVID-19 patient has been admitted.

KRIBHCO (Krishak Bharati Cooperative Ltd) has contributed Rs 2 crore in PM CARES fund for combating COVID-19.

167,16-4-20,Death toll above 1.3L,"There have been at least 2,035,737 cases reported in 193 countries and territories since the virus emerged in China. Of those, 1,30,802 people have died worldwide.

US: The coronavirus death toll in the United States crossed 27,000 with the country witnessing the highest single-day tally of 2,129. More than 619,331 Americans had tested positive for the novel coronavirus — more than the other top three countries taken together — according to Johns Hopkins University. A record number of 2,129 of Americans died in one single day, the previous highest being 2,074 on April 10. New York has become the epicentre of the country’s outbreak with 2,03,020 confirmed cases and 10,842 deaths so far.

UK: The British Government was under pressure on Wednesday to set out its plans to end the coronavirus lockdown, as the country’s death toll approached 13,000. Keir Starmer, the new leader of the Opposition Labour Party, said it would support the government’s expected decision on Thursday to renew a stay-at-home order imposed three weeks ago to stem the spread of Covid-19.

He said this was necessary while the UK death toll kept rising. Figures announced by the health ministry on Wednesday showed that 12,868 people have died from the coronavirus, a rise of 761 over the previous day. The number of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 has now reached 98,476, making Britain one of the worst affected countries in the global pandemic.

Canada: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada’s lockdown will last “many more weeks” and warned Canadians if the economy is reopened too soon all the sacrifices they are making now might be for nothing as the country could see another peak in coronavirus cases. Trudeau said Canada is still “a number of weeks away” from being able to start to reopen and urged Canadians to be patient.

He added once there is some reopening there is going to be a need for rapid testing on a wide scale and extensive contact tracing for those who test positive. He said once Canada is past the first wave Government needs to have the capacity to stamp out any future outbreaks.

His remarks are his strongest yet against loosening economic restrictions too soon. Canada has more than 27,557 confirmed cases including 954 deaths.

Germany: Germany plans to let small shops reopen as early as next week after a four-week coronavirus shutdown, but Europe’s biggest economy is keeping strict social distancing rules in place.

After much-anticipated talks with Germany’s 16 state governors, Chancellor Angela Merkel set out a plan for the first steps of a slow restart of public life.

A ban on gatherings of more than two people in public has been in place since March 23 and was due to run until Sunday. Merkel says the restrictions will remain in place, and officials will review at the end of the month what happens after May 3. Nonessential shops also have been closed for nearly four weeks. Other shops of up to 800 square meters (8,600 square feet) will be allowed to start reopening, with hygiene precautions. Merkel said the decision applies to the period from Monday though May 3.

Italy: Italy’s daily increase in Covid-19 cases has continued to slow. The day-to-day increase of 2,667 confirmed cases that was announced by authorities was the lowest in some five weeks and represented a less than 1.7 per cent increase compared to the total cases of the previous day. The number of intensive care beds occupied by patients with coronavirus infections also kept dropping.

Other encouraging numbers were registered in Lombardy, the northern region which by far has had the heaviest case load. Lombardy saw 827 more cases since a day earlier, but past days had brought day-to-day increases of 1,000 or much more. Italy now has more than 1,65,000 known cases of Covid-19.

Spain: Spain’s daily death toll from the coronavirus fell on Wednesday to 523, after posting a one-day rise, bringing the total number of fatalities to 18,579, the Health Ministry said. The number of new confirmed infections in the country, one of the worst hit by the pandemic, rose by over 5,000, after falling for six consecutive days, which lifts the total number of infections to over 1,77,000.

Russia: Russian President Vladimir Putin has presented new measures to support business, including direct financial aid and state-supported loans. Putin said the state will provide small- and medium business with direct financial support to help pay salaries to employees. The amount of aid will be calculated on official minimal wage, now equivalent to about $160 a month.

Also, businesses will be offered state-guaranteed loans for salary payments and government low-rate loans for companies to finance their operational costs.

The measures follow broad criticism of the Kremlin for the failure to shore up the businesses hurt by the partial economic shutdown through April 30. Russia has reported 24,490 coronavirus cases, including 198 deaths.

France: France reported 762 more Covid-19 deaths in hospitals and nursing homes, bringing its total toll from the epidemic to 15,729. The number of confirmed cases in France now exceeds 100,000, health official Jerome Salomon told reporters, adding however that the total number of patients in intensive care fell for the sixth day in a row, by 91 to 6,730 Despite the heavy new death toll, Salomon said that the latest data confirmed that France’s month-long lockdown was beginning to have an effect.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/death-toll-above-1-3l.html
168,16-4-20,Virus that hits all faiths tests religion’s tie to science,"Tanzania’s President claimed the coronavirus “cannot sit in the body of Christ.” Israel’s Health Minister dismissed a potential curfew by saying that “the Messiah will come and save us.” A global Muslim missionary movement held mass gatherings - and took blame for spreading the disease.

While most leaders of major religions have supported Governments’ efforts to fight the pandemic by limiting gatherings, a minority of the faithful — in both religious and secular institutions — have not.

Some have insisted that in-person worship should continue because of the relief it can provide. Others have suggested that faith is an authority higher than science, and belief can turn back contagion.

The struggle to adapt religious behaviors to a pandemic that doesn’t distinguish between denominations or national boundaries was especially urgent in its earliest weeks, before many countries fully locked down. But as more officials trace virus hot spots back to faith gatherings, calls have grown louder for the devout to protect each other’s physical well-being first.

“One of the things that most religious faiths stress in the first instance is to care for the most vulnerable in a community, to save others’ lives as a primary focus,” said L Gregory Jones, dean of Duke University’s divinity school.

But for some people of faith — particularly those whose churches, synagogues and mosques are important community centers — that focus appears to conflict with the very fabric of their lives.

The Pakistani Government — accused of moving too slowly to curb gatherings — refused to order mosques closed. Instead, it limited congregants to five or less. Still, some hardliners remained defiant despite advice to stay at home from the country’s Islamic Ideology Council. Maulana Abdul Aziz, a cleric at the Red Mosque in Islamabad, urged the faithful to challenge restrictions, arguing it was a sin to keep mosques empty.

Most US religious services have paused or shifted online as the federal Government discourages group gatherings to help contain the virus. But a few faith leaders and congregants in America, where religious freedom was already a political minefield, have rebelled against those limits and claimed an incursion on their rights.

Others have taken less aggressive steps to assert the power of communal worship, pointing to what they see as the ability of belief to heal the pandemic’s spiritual pain. Retired Catholic moral theologian Janet Smith is among those in her faith urging bishops to support the restoration of the holy sacraments, delivered in person using tactics that wouldn’t flout governmental orders.

Seeking solace in spirituality or relying on religious rituals for relief and protection, some believers across faiths have continued to shrug off coronavirus risks as they worship.

Last month in Iraq, some defied a curfew to observe the anniversary of the death of revered Shiite Imam Moussa al-Kadhim. One of the visitors who have trekked to the imam’s gold-domed shrine complex, Ayoub al-Moussawi, said he has over the years braved threats to perform religious visits.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/virus-that-hits-all-faiths-tests-religion---s-tie-to-science.html
169,16-4-20,Around the Globe,"China on Wednesday asked all the countries to import medical equipment through reputed Chinese firms cleared by the Government and vowed to punish those involved in counterfeit behaviour amid growing complaints about the low quality of the exported items. As factories in China resumed operations after over two months of grim battle against the coronavirus, the country is now busy tapping into the vast business opportunities of exporting key medical goods, especially ventilators and personal protection equipment (PPE), across the world, including India, where both private and Government bodies are placing orders for these products

Sweden’s softer approach to containing the new coronavirus was already an outlier in Europe and is coming under even more scrutiny as death rates leap ahead of its Nordic neighbours. As of Wednesday, a total of 1,203 people had died from nearly 12,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 — a far higher rate than Finland, Denmark and Norway, which have all instituted more restrictive containment measures. “The authorities and the Government stupidly did not believe that the epidemic would reach Sweden at all,” Bo Lundback, professor of epidemiology at the University of Gothenburg, told AFP

A Missouri man who investigators say was planning to bomb a Kansas City-area hospital was distressed by the government’s response to the coronavirus crisis and motivated by racial, religious and anti-government animus, according to newly unsealed court documents. Timothy Wilson, 36, of Raymore, died March 24 in a firefight with FBI agents serving a probable cause arrest warrant on a Belton street. The plot was reminiscent of the 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City. Wilson first talked of plans for an attack in April or June, but FBI agents say he moved up that timeline as the coronavirus made its way to Missouri

The European Union moved on Wednesday to head off a chaotic and potentially disastrous easing of restrictions that are limiting the spread of the coronavirus, warning its 27 nations to move very cautiously as they return to normal life and base their actions on scientific advice. And US President Donald Trump said he’s enlisting advisers from nearly all sectors of American commerce, the medical field and elected office to help shape his plans to reopen the economy.

Videos and online reports claiming that millions of Americans will have to repay the relief checks they receive from the federal government under the $2.2 trillion coronavirus economic recovery bill are not true. The government began issuing the one-time payments this week. In recent days, social media posts have falsely claimed there’s one catch to this money — that you’ll eventually have to pay it back

China’s CanSino Biologics has begun the second phase of testing its vaccine candidate, China’s Ministry of Science and Technology said on Tuesday.

In the US, a shot made by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc. Isn’t far behind. The first person to receive that experimental vaccine last month returned to a Seattle clinic on Tuesday for a second dose. NIH infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci told The Associated Press there are “no red flags” so far and he hoped the next, larger phase of testing could begin around June. A third candidate, from Inovio Pharmaceuticals, began giving experimental shots for first-step safety testing last week in the US And hopes to expand its studies to China.

Initial tests focus on safety, and researchers in both countries are trying out different doses of different types of shots. But moving into the second phase is a critical step that allows vaccines to be tested in many more people to look for signs that they protect against infection.

Last week, CanSino filed a report showing it aimed to enroll 500 people in this next study, comparing two doses of the vaccine to dummy shots. As of Monday, 273 of the volunteers had been injected, state media said.

Looking ahead, Fauci said if the new coronavirus continues to circulate widely enough over the summer and fall, it might be possible to finish larger studies slightly sooner than the 12 to 18 months he’d originally predicted — maybe toward “mid to late winter of next season.” “Please let me say this caveat: That is assuming that it’s effective. See, that’s the big ‘if,’” Fauci stressed.

“It’s got to be effective and it’s got to be safe.” During a news conference in China, authorities also cautioned that the studies must be done properly. “Although we are in an emergency, we cannot lower the standards of safety and effectiveness in the reviews of vaccines,” said Wang Junzhi, a Chinese biopharmaceutical expert.

“The public is paying huge attention.” The World Health Organization this week counted more than five dozen other vaccine candidates in earlier stages of development being pursued around the world. Many research groups are teaming up to speed the work; in an announcement Tuesday, vaccine giants Sanofi and GSK became the latest to partner on a candidate.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/search-for-a-vaccine-heats-up-in-china--us.html
171,16-4-20,Italians question merits of virus testing,"Testing is being held up as the world’s best bet for ending the economically crippling —and emotionally draining —coronavirus lockdown.

But some doctors at the Italian epicentre of the health crisis doubt that countries can test their way out of confinement.

“It is a nonsense,” Milan’s Polytechnic Institute professor Davide Manca said. “Conceptually, I am sceptical.”

The reason for Manca’s scepticism is plain to see in the math. Milan’s Lombardy region has 10 million people and 11,142 officially registered Covid-19 deaths.

The economically vibrant area the size of Belgium has been under one of the world’s strictest lockdowns since early March. Few regions need testing more.

Yet Lombardy has been conducting just 6,500 tests daily over the past 10 days. Manca estimates it would take more than five years for everyone in Lombardy to get tested just once.

“And you need people tested every 15 days for it to have any meaning,” Manca said in a phone interview.

“Even if you raise that number 10 times, that would still take 200 days for one test. That’s six or seven months.”

Manca was talking about the swab tests that doctors insert up people’s noses to see who is Covid-19 positive.

Their shortage has made Lombardy’s death ratios look stark. The region had conducted 234,870 tests and confirmed 61,326 cases by Wednesday.

A jarring 18.2 per cent of those officially infected with the virus have died of Covid-19. The death rate stood at 4.2 per cent on Wednesday across the United States.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/italians-question-merits-of-virus-testing.html
172,16-4-20,virus claims as ‘nonsense’,"The British Government on Wednesday dismissed a TV presenter’s claim that there could be a link between 5G technology and coronavirus as “complete nonsense”.

The 5G conspiracy theory, spread widely on social media, has already led to a new telecoms mast being set alight in Ireland at the weekend.

Experts have poured scorn on the claim, saying 5G is based on radio frequency and is not related to the viral outbreak.

But Eamonn Holmes, who presents ITV’s This Morning show, said they were dismissing the theory “when they don’t know it’s not true”.

“What I don’t accept is mainstream media immediately slapping that down as not true when they don’t know it’s not true,” he said, leading to hundreds of complaints.

“It’s very easy to say it is not true because it suits the state narrative.”

A Government told journalists that Holmes’s claims were “complete nonsense” and “entirely bogus”, while experts also rubbished the comments.

“It’s fair to say Eamonn Holmes is to the advancement of science what I am to banal and unsatisfying morning television,” said Michael Head from the University of Southampton.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/uk-dismisses-5g-virus-claims-as----nonsense---.html

Pakistan has registered over 6,245 coronavirus cases and more than 112 deaths due to the deadly viral infection.

At a time when Covid-19 cases are rising in the country, there remain limited numbers of tests and the capacity of laboratories is under strain. According to a report in the Urdu newspaper, Daily Jang, some 2,50,000 people reported at Government hospitals across the country for coronavirus testing.

“However, only 74,000 suspected cases were tested, out of which around 6,000 people were tested positive for the novel coronavirus,” the report said. Citing sources, it said,”The health ministry had to refuse examination for some 1,75,000 people as they did not meet the criteria set for the tests.”

However, the details of all those persons who had come for the tests have been saved in the data base of the health authorities. One of the criteria for the coronavirus test is that a person must have returned from abroad, the report said, adding that the doctors on duty take the final decision on whether a test is necessary for a person or not.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/nearly-1-75-000-pakistanis-denied-coronavirus-testing-for-failing-to-meet-criteria--report.html

The COVID-19 pandemic is a cause of great concern. While the whole nation is under lockdown, POWERGRID, a central PSU under Ministry of Power, has not just been ensuring uninterrupted 24x7 transmission of power but also acting proactively by taking up humanitarian relief activities to aid those impacted by the pandemic in India.

It has contributed Rs 200 crore to PM-CARES Fund. Additionally, all its employees also contributed one day salary to the fund.

Along with financial contribution to PM-CARES Fund, the PSU is also distributing food packets/groceries to its contractual workers, labourers and needy people near its sub-station sites and transmission line offices. Besides, these essential items, distribution of masks, sanitisers and soaps is also being carried out. So far, around 81,000 beneficiaries have been provided Ration/food items worth Rs 4.27 crore at more than 200 locations across the country.

The PSU has also provided assistance to hospitals for purchase of ventilators, strengthening medical facilities as well as creation of infrastructure for managing this pandemic. PPE kits, ventilators and other hospital equipment have also been distributed to various hospitals all over the country in its support for the fight against COVID-19.

175,16-4-20,Friendship with Indian player doesn’t ensure IPL entry: Laxman,"Former India batsman VVS Laxman took a jibe at Michael Clarke for his recent claims that Australian cricketers “sucked up” to India captain Virat Kohli for protecting their IPL contracts, saying just being nice to someone doesn’t guarantee a spot in the cash-rich tournament.

“Just by being nice to someone doesn’t get you a place in IPL,” Laxman, who also mentors IPL team Sunrisers Hyderabad told Star Sports on its show Cricket Connected.

“Any franchise will look at the player’s caliber and value add to the team, which gives them desired results by winning matches/tournaments. These are the kind of players who get IPL contracts. So just being nice to someone will not earn you a spot in the IPL.”

Laxman said as a mentor when he is on the auction table, those players are looked at who do exceptionally well for their country.

“If you’re friendly with any Indian player it doesn’t mean that you are getting IPL contract. As a mentor, I’m on the auction table and we select players, those international players that have played exceptionally well for their country and can add value to the franchise.

“Friendship with any Indian player doesn’t ensure entry into the IPL,” Laxman, who amassed 8,781 Test runs, said without mincing any words.

Former India opener Krishnamachari Srikkanth also shot back at Clarke, terming his comments as ‘ridiculous’.

Srikkanth, who was part of the 1983 World Cup winning Indian team, said matches are not won by sledging.

“You do not win matches just by sledging. Aussie’s loss is a loss, his statement was ridiculous I would say,” said 60-year-old Srikkanth.

Srikkanth, himself an aggressive player, said that sledging cannot help in any way.

“If you ask Nasser Hussain or Sir Vivian Richards who are experienced players, you can never score runs or get wickets through sledging. You need to play good cricket and showcase determination; you need to bowl well to get wickets and bat well to achieve targets. Sledging cannot help in any way according to my opinion,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/friendship-with-indian-player-doesn---t-ensure-ipl-entry--laxman.html
176,16-4-20,Indian women qualify for 2021 World Cup,"India on Wednesday sealed their qualification for the 2021 Women’s World Cup following the cancellation of their ODI Championship round against Pakistan with the BCCI not getting government clearance to play the arch-rivals.

The India-Pakistan round was scheduled to take place between July and November last year but was always subject to government clearance. Both teams will share points for the cancelled three-match series.

“With respect to the India v Pakistan series, the TC concluded that the series could not be played because of a Force Majeure event after the BCCI demonstrated that it was unable to obtain the necessary government clearances to allow India to participate in the bilateral series against Pakistan, which forms a part of the ICC Women’s Championship,” said the ICC in a statement.

“The India-Pakistan series was originally scheduled in the sixth round of the competition, between July and November 2019, but despite the best efforts of both the boards, it was unable to take place,” it said.

The development also means that India, who finished runners-up in the 2017 edition, have secured their berth for the 2021 World Cup in New Zealand.

All eight teams in the 2017-2020 edition of the ICC Women’s Championship play each other in a three-match series. Hosts New Zealand and the next four highest-placed teams on the points table qualify directly for one-day international cricket’s showpiece.

“Australia (37 points), England (29), South Africa (25) and now India (23) have qualified by virtue of being the top four,” the statement added.

The 10 teams vying for the three remaining places in the showpiece event will be the hosts, Sri Lanka, along with Pakistan, West Indies, Bangladesh, Ireland, and the winners of the five regional qualifiers.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/indian-women-qualify-for-2021-world-cup.html

178,16-4-20,Trump eager to ‘get sports back’,"US President Donald Trump is hankering for a return of live sports action, but US league supremos are taking a cautious approach to competition amid the coronavirus pandemic.

“We have to get our sports back,” Trump said Tuesday. “I’m tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old.” Sports in America, like the rest of the world, have been brought to a virtual standstill by COVID-19.

The NBA shut down on March 11 after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the virus, and the NHL, Major League Soccer and the US PGA Tour quickly followed suit.

Major League Baseball’s 2020 season, due to start March 26, is on hold, as is the LPGA tour and motor racing, while the NFL is just hoping it will be able to start its season on time in September.

The dearth of sports has led to a wealth of speculation as to when and how competition could resume.

The NBA and NHL are wrestling with how they might fashion credible ends to campaigns that were heading into their final stages.

Baseball, meanwhile, was reported to be considering sequestering 30 teams in Arizona — or perhaps Arizona and Florida — to open the season playing games in empty ballparks.

The NHL was reportedly mulling a single-venue re-start in North Dakota, while Dana White, head of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, indicated he was considering holding mixed martial arts cards on a private island.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/trump-eager-to----get-sports-back---.html

“He believes the conditions are right there for him to achieve his ultimate goal: winning the Champions League.”

The 24-year-old Sane is viewed as one of Germany’s brightest talents and has scored five goals in 21 appearances for his country. He won the Premier League title with City in 2017/18 and 2018/19.

Bayern want Sane after wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery both retired at the end of last season.

180,16-4-20,Holding picks Steyn in his ‘fab 4’ pacers,"The great Michael Holding has picked South African Dale Steyn among his top-four fast bowlers across generations and his list includes fellow West Indians Malcolm Marshall and Andy Roberts besides Australian Denis Lillee.

In a Sky Sports podcast, the 66-year-old said he would pay to watch Steyn, who retired from Tests last year.

“I have experience with those three guys (Marshall, Roberts and Lillee, but just watching, you can’t go Dale Steyn outside of photography. He has been one of the great fast bowlers in an era. You’d pay to see it,” said Holding, who picked 249 wickets in 60 Tests at 23.68.

Steyn picked 439 Test wickets at a stellar average of 22.95 and has one of the smoothest actions in the game.

Talking about Lillee, Holding said he was a complete package.

“Lillee had it all: rhythm, aggression control. He was extremely fast when he started, but he had to completely reshape his action after a back injury and find different ways to get hitters out after losing a lot of rhythm.

“When you see that someone can adapt in that way, you have to rate him highly, as many players are not as effective when they miss a beat,” said Holding, who was nicknamed Whispering Death for his smooth and silent run-up.

On fellow West Indians Marshall and Roberts, Holding said: “Malcolm started with a good rhythm, but as time went on he learned a lot about fast bowling. He could evaluate opposition hitters so quickly and so easily.

“In those days you didn’t have many tapes or computers, it was all in his head. He understood how to deal with hitters.”

On Roberts, he added: “Andy was someone I learned a lot from. He hardly ever spoke, he used to walk around the field with a sullen face and people thought he looked aggressive and must be a miserable guy. But that wasn’t Andy.

“He was my roommate for most of my career and we used to talk about cricket almost every night. A lot of times, we would order food, we would stay in our room and talk about cricket. You would never believe how much this guy knows.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/holding-picks-steyn-in-his----fab-4----pacers.html
181,16-4-20,Tour de France postponed to Aug 29-Sept 20,"The Tour de France will be raced from August 29 to September 20, organisers announced on Wednesday, postponing cycling’s flagship event originally slated to start on June 27 due to the coronavirus lockdown.

The news comes as a relief to professional cycling teams and fans with four-times Tour winner Chris Froome welcoming ‘light at the end of the tunnel’ for those suffering under COVID-19 lockdown.

The decision moves the three-week race out of its traditional slot in the summer holidays where roadside crowds of around 12 million would be expected to gather in festive spirit.

It will now finish on the same day the postponed French Open championships starts, September 20, giving a worrying indication of a potential autumn fixture pile-up as more sports seek to reschedule suspended events.

Tour director Christian Prudhomme said the new start was based on a double rationale.

“We wanted to be as far away from the pandemic as possible,” he said.

“The president put a July 14 date on public gatherings, but it seemed more reasonable to us to allow the riders time to get into peak condition.”

While the dates have changed the original route remains intact, starting in Nice and finishing in Paris.

“The Tour is still the Tour. All the challenges we set remain intact,” he said of the hotly anticipated climb-laden route that rarely strays far from the mountains.

The new date solves a series of problems after organisers faced up to the reality that the race could never take place on the original dates.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/tour-de-france-postponed-to-aug-29-sept-20.html

Almost all the states and UTs in India are affected by it, in varying degrees. The trade and industry, at all levels and all segments of society are also affected. The situation has dealt a serious blow to the livelihood of the poor and marginalised communities too.

TRIFED under Ministry of Tribal Affairs, with the assistance of state nodal departments and state implementation agencies initiated Pradhan Mantri VanDhan Yojana (PMVDY) where a total of 1205 Van Dhan Vikas Kendras (VDVKs) have been sanctioned in 27 states and one union territory involving around 18,075 Van Dhan self-help groups (SHGs). This constitutes over 3.6 lakh tribal gatherers in the scheme.

TRIFED has issued dos and don’ts advisories relating to NTFP to be kept in mind during COVID-19, providing suggestive practices for maintaining personal hygiene, adopting cashless practices, among others. It is also working on setting up of 15,000 ‘Van Dhan Social Distancing Awareness and Livelihood Centres’ from the recently sanctioned Van Dhan SHGs among the 1205 Van Dhan Kendras under Van Dhan Samajik Doori Jagrookta Abhiyaan. One leader from each Van Dhan SHG will be identified for generating awareness among the community about social distancing and steps to be followed. He would be made aware of the symptoms of the disease, information about the nearest medical facility/ practitioner in case of need for contacting or reporting and will disseminate information to the community. The SHG would be provided with protective masks and sanitising products (soaps, disinfectants).

It has collaborated with UNICEF for developing a digital communication strategy for promoting the scheme and utilising the VDVK platform for risk communication and well-being during the pandemic. UNICEF is providing the necessary support to be circulated to the SHG centers in the form of digital multimedia content, webinars for virtual trainings (basic orientation on COVID response, key preventive behaviours), social media campaigns (on social distancing, home quarantine, etc) and Vanya radio.

A webinar with UNICEF training team was held on Thursday. It witnessed national level participation from representatives of state implementing and nodal agencies, members from SHGs, among several others from all over the country. The informational training helped the participants in knowing the key preventive measures to take against COVID-19, and clarified doubts and dispelled the myths related to the pandemic. It also involved interaction from viewers in the form of poll questions, with viewers answering questions based on the information provided in the discussion. The webinar saw over 2,380 users, and amassed over 26,000 views while being live-streamed on Facebook.

186,16-4-20,PCB won’t agree to cancel Asia Cup to accommodate IPL,"Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ehsan Mani has asserted that the PCB will not agree to cancelling the Asia Cup, scheduled in the UAE in September, to make room for the Indian Premier League, which has been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The IPL was to be held from March 29 to May 24 but has been postponed indefinitely because of a extended lockdown.

“I have read and heard about these speculations but right now just remember that having or not having the Asia Cup is not a decision between Pakistan and India it involves other countries as well,” asserted Mani on Tuesday.

Pakistan were to host the event but it was shifted to Dubai and Abu Dhabi after India expressed reluctance to visit Pakistan owing to security concerns and the strained diplomatic ties between the two countries.

“...It is important to have the Asia Cup if cricket activities resume by then because development of Asian cricket depends on funding from the tournament. It is important for many countries who are members of the Asian Cricket Council,” he added in a podcast released by the PCB.

However, he also conceded that holding the Asia Cup this year is a big challenge because right now “we don’t know if it can be held or not.”

“But if the conditions change and we can have the Asia Cup, it must be held as earnings from it are distributed as development funds to member countries for next two years,” he said.

He said reports about the Asia Cup being hosted by Bangladesh or UAE were mere speculation at this stage.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/pcb-won---t-agree-to-cancel-asia-cup-to-accommodate-ipl.html

“CSK is a very very special team. The kind of players, who came aboard right from the first auction, you name it, they are legends of world cricket,” Vijay, who spent five seasons with the team from 2009-13 in his first stint before re-joining it in 2018, was quoted as saying by the CSK website.

“It was a great honour for us youngsters to step into the dressing room and rub shoulders with some of the legends. You get to learn a lot of things by watching them and being around them,” the right- hander said about his early days in the franchise.

188,16-4-20,Buttler in awe of Rohit’s effortless batting,"England batsman Jos Buttler was effusive in his praise for Rohit Sharma, describing the India opener as an awesome player, who can ‘effortlessly’ take down any opposition by scoring big hundreds.

“Rohit Sharma I think is an awesome player,” Buttler said during an Instagram Live session on Rajasthan Royals page. “Effortless. Quite a lot of Indian players have that awesome style.

“He has been fantastic for a long time and I just like the way he bats and the effortless nature in which he takes people down.”

Rohit is currently regarded as one of the greatest ODI players, ranked only behind India skipper Virat Kohli at the top of the ICC rankings. The Mumbaikar is the only batsman to have scored three double hundreds in the format.

The 32-year-old had equalled Sachin Tendulkar’s record for most centuries in World Cup matches when he scored five hundreds at the 2019 edition to end up as highest-scorer with 648 runs.

“One of the things I have seen with Rohit is that if he gets in, he scores big runs and really affects the game. He must have scored 4-5 hundreds in the World Cup last year,” said Buttler, who had shared the dressing room with Rohit at Mumbai Indians in the 2016 and 2017 seasons.

189,16-4-20,Moyes fears injury pile-up if PL resumes,"West Ham manager David Moyes fears a rash of injuries to players should there be a desperate rush to complete the Premier League season if the coronavirus relents sufficiently to allow the resumption of football.

The Premier League has now ditched plans to get back underway at the start of May and a further complication is that a number of players will be out of contract in June.

It has been suggested that clubs may need to play up to three games a week in order to finish this season before the 2020/21 campaign gets going. Moyes would prefer a four-week build-up on the training ground before the current Premier League season resumes, should lockdown restrictions be relaxed and the Hammers boss fears the consequences if, as seems likely, clubs have less preparation time.

“I think that four weeks would be ideal. But I think three weeks will be the maximum we get,” Moyes told beIN Sports.

“Everybody’s now talking about the injuries we’re liable to pick up either during the three-week preparation time or during the period where it looks like we’ll have to play an awful lot of games in a short period of time.”

West Ham are only above the relegation zone on goal difference in Moyes second spell in charge of the east London club.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/moyes-fears-injury-pile-up-if-pl-resumes.html
190,16-4-20,"Pak army shells forward areas along LoC in J-K's Rajouri, Poonch","Pakistan army on Thursday intensified firing and shelling targetting villages and forwards posts along the Line of Control (LoC) in Poonch and Rajouri districts of Jammu and Kashmir, officials said.

The Pakistani troops have been hitting the civilian areas along the LoC with mortars and small arms for the last 12 days.

""At about 0945 hours today, Pakistan army initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation along the LoC in Qasba and Kirni sectors of Poonch by firing with small arms,"" defence spokesman Lt Col Devender Anand said.

He said Pakistani troops also violated the ceasefire along the LoC in Nowshera sector in Rajouri district at around 11.45 am by firing small arms and mortars.

The Indian Army was retaliating befittingly to the Pakistani aggression in all these sectors, Lt Col Anand added.

Pakistan army's targetting of hamlets in Nowshera, Qasba and Kirni sectors has triggered fear among the people.

The residents living in villages near the Indo-Pak border in Rajouri, Poonch, and Kupwara are reeling under palpable terror ever since the three civilians were killed in Pakistan shelling last week.

191,16-4-20,Rahul Gandhi pitches for aggressive testing to defeat COVID-19,"Congress leader Rahul Gandhi called for a united fight against COVID-19 on Thursday and said a lockdown is no solution, but aggressive testing is the main weapon to defeat the coronavirus and it should be used strategically.

Addressing a press conference via video-conferencing, he said India will emerge as a better place if everyone fights the virus with confidence and not out of fear.

Noting that the ongoing nationwide lockdown is like a ""pause button"" and not a solution to defeat the virus, the former Congress chief said testing is the real weapon against it, which India should use strategically.

Calling upon the government to quickly resolve the issue of the migrants stranded at various places without food and money, he feared that it might lead to social unrest otherwise.

Gandhi also called for a provision of food to be distributed among the poor and marginalised, while providing a safety net for the MSMEs and other strategic industries, which foreign entities may be eying for takeovers.

""In no way does a lockdown defeat the virus. It stops the virus for some time. The biggest weapon to fight the virus is testing. Testing is scaled to know where the virus is moving and you can isolate it and target it,"" he said.

Gandhi said the scale of testing in India has been low so far at 199 per 10 lakh people -- around 350 tests per district -- which he said is not enough to tell which way the virus is moving.

""If you have to fight the virus, you have to increase testing dramatically and your testing has to go from chasing the virus to moving ahead of it. That means you have to move into random testing,"" he noted.

The Congress leader said experts across the world and in India say that a lockdown is like a ""pause button"" and it ""is in no way a solution to the virus"".

""When we come out of the lockdown, the virus is going to start its work. It is important that we have a strategy in place to come out of the lockdown,"" he said, adding that it is time to ramp up testing and put adequate infrastructure in place when the virus picks up again.

Urging people not to be worried, Gandhi said they should fight the virus unitedly as the country is bigger than any disease, while asserting that India will overcome the current crisis too.

""No one will be harmed by testing. It should be done on a large scale. But India will have to unite to fight the virus. Caste, religion and creed will have to be forgotten in fighting this virus,"" he said.

Calling for a ""strategic opening"" of the lockdown, Gandhi suggested opening certain key areas and to use testing to identify hotspots.

""This is where ramping up testing is important, to dynamically identify the hotspots,"" he said.

Gandhi suggested creation of two basic zones -- a hotspot zone and a non-hotspot zone.

""It is important to focus on the strategy after lockdown. What will be the strategy for testing? How will you prepare the PHCs and hospitals? Because, the cases will increase after the lockdown. Action should not be delayed,"" he noted.

The Congress leader said the pandemic will have a negative effect on the country's economy, while adding that people are becoming unemployed and ""it is going to get worse"".

He also called for preparing packages for SMEs as well as for big companies.

Calling for providing money and foodgrains to the poor, he said in line with the proposed NYAY scheme of the Congress, the government should give money directly to 20 per cent of the poor people in the country because they are facing difficulties.

Gandhi also called for setting up structures and managing funds, saying if all the money is spent now, there can be a financial crisis later.

""Hence, you need to think and move strategically,"" he said, adding that there is going to be a massive financial backlash due to COVID-19 and waves of unemployment that will put a huge pressure on our financial system.

The Congress leader also called for granting adequate resources to the states to help them deal with COVID-19 in a ""nuanced"" manner.

He insisted that there is a need for devolution of powers to the states to help them effectively deal with the situation, while adding that a ""blunt instrument"" should not be used and what is needed is a strategic approach.

Gandhi also pointed out that there is a need to use the available resources carefully.

192,16-4-20,PM reviews impact of COVID-19 on economy; 2nd stimulus in consideration,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday reviewed the impact of COVID-19 on the Indian economy, and discussed a possible second stimulus with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to boost sectors hit hard by the pandemic.

Modi held discussions with the Finance Minister as the pandemic hit sectors from small industries to the aviation sector hard with millions of jobs at stake.

The meeting comes amid drastic reduction in GDP growth forecast by various multi-lateral funding agencies for the current fiscal due to the impact of COVID-19 and consequent lockdown.

State of the economy was discussed in details during the meeting, sources said, adding resource mobilisation for taking on the future challenges was also highlighted.

As per the World Bank's latest assessment, India is expected to grow 1.5 per cent to 2.8 per cent. Similarly, the IMF on Tuesday projected a GDP growth of 1.9 per cent for India in 2020, as the global economy hits the worst recession since the Great Depression in 1930s.

The pandemic and consequent lockdown have hit various sectors, including MSME, hospitality, civil aviation, agriculture and allied sector.

The government constituted an empowered group - headed by Economic Affairs Secretary Atanu Chakraborty - which is entrusted with the task of suggesting measures that can bring back economy back on track quickly post the lockdown.

Besides, it was also asked to work on relief and welfare measures for various sectors of the economy as well as for the poor and needy.

In his address to the nation, the Prime Minister had expressed concern over problems being faced by poor and daily wagers and farmers.

""The government has made every possible effort to help them through Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Yojana. Their interests have also been taken care of while making the new guidelines,"" he had said.

To ease the pain and misery, the Finance Minister last month announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore stimulus that included free foodgrains and cooking gas to poor for three months, and cash doles to women and poor senior citizens as it looked to ease the economic impact of the nationwide lockdown.

As per the announcement, 80 crore poor ration card holders will each get 5 kg of wheat or rice and one kg of preferred pulses free of cost every month for the next three months, while, 20.4 crore women having Jan Dhan bank accounts would get cash help of Rs 1,500 spread over three months.

Over 8.3 crore poor women, who were handed out free cooking gas connections since 2016, will get free LPG refills for the next three months, while poor senior citizens, widows and disabled will get an ex-gratia cash of Rs 1,000.

Sitharaman had hinted at more announcements if need arises.

In a bid to save resources, the government has already put restrictions on expenditure and funds are being diverted towards the fight against COVID-19.

Besides, the Union Cabinet approved a 30 per cent reduction in salary and allowances of Members of Parliament for one year.

President, Vice President and Governors voluntarily decided to take a pay cut as a gesture towards concerted effort to contain the spread of the deadly virus.

At the same time, the government has decided to suspend MPLADS and funds would be directed towards improving medical infrastructure.

An MP gets Rs 5 crore every year as part of the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS).

195,16-4-20,Focus on rural livelihood,"Faced with an economy battered by the coronavirus outbreak and resultant lockdown, the Modi Government has decided to focus on starting the wheels of the rural economy to provide livelihood support to millions of daily wagers, farm labours, and migrant workers.

The Union Home Ministry’s latest guidelines allowed farming operations and farm workers in the field from April 20. To provide an impetus to the rural economy, the Government has allowed construction of roads, irrigation projects, buildings and industrial projects in rural areas; works under MNREGA, with priority to irrigation and water conservation works; and operation of rural Common Service Centres.

The guidelines allowed agencies engaged in procurement of agri-products, including MSP operations, permission to function during the extended lockdown period. The guidelines give operation permission to mandis operated by the Agriculture Produce Market Committee or as notified by the State Government as well as direct marketing operations by the States or industry directly from farmers or Farmer Producers Organisations.

The Government asked State Governments to promote decentralised marketing and procurement of farm commodities at village level. As harvesting of rabi crops like wheat is underway, the Government has allowed inter and intra-State movement of harvesting and sowing related machines like combined harvester and other agriculture and horticulture implements.

That apart, the Government has allowed shops of agriculture machinery, its spare parts including its supply chain and repairs to remain open.

196,16-4-20,377 dists listed for intensified containment,"As the country entered into the second phase of the 21-day lockdown on Wednesday with around 12,000 positive Covid-19 cases and 392 deaths, the Government has identified around 377 districts where it plans to intensify its virus containment strategy even as around 400 districts across the States remained green zones where coronavirus has not stepped in so far.

The identification of zones based on Covid-19 footprint comes amid Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan’s observation that the “next 2-3 weeks are going to be the most crucial in handling the Covid-19 pandemic particularly in India.”

Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary Health Ministry, said at a Press briefing here that with a view to manage Covid-19, every district has been divided into “Hotspot”, “Non-Hotspot districts with reported cases”, and “Green zone districts”.

The criteria for segregation are based on reporting of more numbers of cases and speed of growth of cases.

There has been steadily increase in cases with 1,118 new cases reported in the last 24 hours, taking the coronavirus tally to 11,933. 1,343 people have recovered and 392 persons have succumbed to the dreaded virus. One person has migrated to another country.

The large outbreak containment strategies and cluster containment strategies have been planned in the designated hotspots and non hotspots. These containment strategies describe how to delineate the containment zone and buffer zone.

In these containment zones, except for essential services, the rest of the movement and activities will be restricted, said Agarwal.

Cases will be actively monitored and surveyed by special teams in the containment zone as per sampling criteria. In these zones, the samples will be collected and tested. In addition to this, testing for any cases of ILI (influenza like illness) and SARI (severe acute respiratory illness) with proper orientation of all health facilities will be undertaken for the buffer zones.

Special teams are to be set up to trace all contacts as well as conduct house to house surveys. These teams will include the health staff, local revenue staff, corporation staff, Red Cross, NSS, NYK and other volunteers.

Segregating areas into three zones, the Union Health Ministry said, “Containment operation would be deemed over when there is no case reported in 28 days from an area after the last case tests negative. Hotspots (designated red zones) will be assumed to be undertaking effective containment activities, if no case is reported in the next 14 days (designated orange zones) and will be deemed successful in containment, if no case is reported for 28 days (designated green zones).

Districts have also been told to classify hospitals as Covid Care Centres for mild cases or very mild cases, Covid Health Centres for clinical moderate cases requiring oxygen support, and Covid Dedicated Hospitals for severe and critical cases with ventilator support.

“The districts which have not reported any cases yet, have also been directed to work on cluster containment plans. In order to break the chain of transmission, focus needs to be on contact tracing, monitoring and clinical management. States have been asked to uniformly implement the containment plan in every district across the country,” said Agarwal.

Of the total cases, 2,687 have been reported from Maharashtra, followed by Delhi (1,561), Tamil Nadu (1,204), Rajasthan (1,005), Madhya Pradesh (987), Uttar Pradesh (735), Gujarat (695), Telangana (647), Andhra Pradesh (503) and Kerala (387).

The Union Territory of J&K has reported 278 cases, West Bengal (213), Karnataka (277), Haryana (199), Punjab (186), Bihar (70), Odisha (60), Uttarakhand (37), Chhattisgarh (33), Himachal Pradesh (33), Jharkhand (27), Chandigarh (21), Ladakh (17), Andaman and Nicobar Islands (11), Goa (7) and Puducherry (7).

In the northeast, Assam has reported the most number of cases at 33, while Meghalaya has reported 7 cases. There are two cases each in Manipur and Tripura, while Mizoram, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh have one case each.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/377-dists-listed-for-intensified---containment-2020-04-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/377-dists-listed-for-intensified---containment.html
197,16-4-20,Curran ‘can't wait’ to play under Dhoni,"England all-rounder Sam Curran said he still hoped to play under India great MS Dhoni in the Indian Premier League — and get one over older brother Tom — despite the coronavirus pandemic.

The 21-year old was the most expensive England player in November’s initial IPL auction, being sold to Chennai Super Kings, captained by Dhoni after a succesful 2019 stint with the Kings XI Punjab.

Meanwhile the 25-year-old Tom, also of Surrey and England, was signed by the Rajasthan Royals.

This year’s IPL was meant to start on March 29 before being delayed due to Indian government lockdown and now with it extended to May 3, there is no certainty about when, or indeed if, the 2020 edition will take place.

“No-one knows,” Sam Curran told reporters in a conference call with Tom.

“It (the IPL) might happen this year, it might be cancelled, but we have to follow the government guidelines.”

Chennai are one of the IPL’s most successful teams, having won the tournament three times.

“I was very excited to move franchises,” said Sam. “Chennai is a great franchise with all the big names and I can’t wait to play under MS Dhoni.

“Hopefully I will play against Tom, hit him everywhere and then hit his stumps.

“Dhoni exudes calm,” added Sam, who said only Virat Kohli, Dhoni’s successor as India captain, could rival him in terms of superstar status in cricket crazy India.

“Chennai is quite an older squad so there are quite a few legends who have made it in the game,” said Sam.

“Hopefully they will be looking to give tips to the younger players, so that’s something I’m really looking forward to.”

Sam had been preparing for a ‘massive’ three-month stint in Asia after being selected for England’s tour of Sri Lanka, which was abandoned before the start of the Test series.

Tom insisted, however, the lack of cricket was “nothing in the grand scheme of things” even though it was a “shock to the system”.

‘Huge test ambitions’

The England all-rounder Tom hasn’t played red-ball cricket in over a year but says he has huge Test ambitions and is developing his skills to make a comeback.

“I’ve definitely got huge Test ambitions still.

“It’s a tough one because I’ve been playing so much white-ball over the last few years. Without playing Championship cricket it is hard,” said the 25-year-old.

Tom, who has played two Tests for England — both in the 2017-18 Ashes in Australia, hopes to feature in a five-day game alongside Sam.

“Over the last couple of years there was a huge focus on white-ball cricket with the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2019 and rightly so,” he said.

“Now it’s trying to get that balance between white and red-ball cricket and developing my skills and awaiting my chance. I’ll keep training hard and try to take my chances when I can. It would be amazing to play Tests with Sam. That’s definitely a huge ambition of ours.”

Sam added: “As Tom said, it’s a dream. Any game you play for England is obviously a great privilege but I think playing with your brother or a member of your family gives it that extra special feeling.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/curran----can-t-wait----to-play-under-dhoni-2020-04-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/curran----can-t-wait----to-play-under-dhoni.html

199,16-4-20,"McGrath musings: Cummins best pacer, bowlers better blokes than batsmen","Australia's Pat Cummins is the most complete pacer among the current crop, says the legendary Glenn McGrath, who feels fast bowlers, in general, are ""better blokes"" and more hardworking than batsmen.

McGrath was answering 25 rapid-fire questions from 'ESPNCricinfo' on a range of subjects, including who he would like to see as himself in a biopic.

Asked to name the most complete bowler in world cricket now, McGrath replied: ""Pat Cummins. I like the way he goes by.""

Cummins is currently no.1 in ICC Test rankings and occupies the fourth spot in the ODI list.

One of the best fast bowlers through the '90s till late 2000s, McGrath also addressed the big debate of his era -- who was harder to bowl at, Sachin Tendulkar or Brian Lara?

""Tough,"" he said when asked to pick between the two icons.

""I would go with Lara just (a bit) from my experience. The hat-trick wish-list would be Brian Lara, Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid.""

Asked if there was any delivery which was missing from his armoury, he cheekily replied: ""the 100miles per hour delivery.""

According to him, the bowlers work a lot harder than batsmen.

""Fast bowlers are better blokes, work harder and batsmen expect everything,"" he opined.

Asked if he would indulge in 'Mankading' a batsman in a World Cup final where he has to get the last wicket but with only two runs to defend, the legendary pacer said he would never do it.

He also feels that after watching Jim Carrey's performance in 'Dumb and Dumber', he would like the iconic funny-man to play his role if a biopic is ever made on him.

""Brad Pitt or Hugh Jackman,"" are his other choices.

Not known to be an extravagant dresser, McGrath said he nonetheless likes wearing outfits by Indian designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee.

Away from cricket, the sporting legends that he has felt privileged to meet include Jamaican sprint king Usain Bolt, tennis icon Roger Federer and five-time Olympic champion rower Steve Redgrave.

200,16-4-20,It's official: IPL 2020 suspended till further notice,"The BCCI on Thursday suspended the 2020 Indian Premier League ""till further notice"" in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has claimed more than 400 lives and affected over 12,000 in the country.

The PTI reported on April 14 that the Indian cricket board (BCCI) had intimated the eight franchisees along with other stakeholders about the indefinite postponement of the tournament's 13th edition but there was no official word from the parent cricketing body.

""Due to the evolving global health concerns regarding COVID-19 and lockdown measures implemented by the Government of India to contain the spread of the pandemic, the IPL Governing Council of the BCCI has decided that the IPL 2020 Season will be suspended till further notice,"" said BCCI secretary Jay Shah in a statement.

The IPL was set to start on March 29 and end on May 24 but it was first postponed till April 15 after a surge of COVID-19 positive cases in India. However with situation not being conducive for any sporting activity and the country in the midst of a 40-day lockdown, the BCCI didn't issue any fresh date.

""The health and safety of the nation and everyone involved in our great sport remains our top priority and as such, the BCCI along with the Franchise Owners, Broadcaster, Sponsors and all the Stakeholders acknowledge that the IPL 2020 season will only commence when it is safe and appropriate to do so,"" Shah further stated.

While BCCI is not committal on when cricket could resume in the country, Shah maintained that India's richest sporting body is monitoring the situation and will seek guidance from the central government as well as states.

""BCCI will continue to monitor and review the situation regarding a potential start date in close partnership with all of its stakeholders and will continue to take guidance from the Government of India, State Governments and other State Regulatory bodies,"" Shah added.

The only window left for the BCCI to host the tournament is September-November. For that to happen, India will have to skip the Asia Cup hosted by the PCB in Dubai or Cricket Australia and the International Cricket Council decide to forego the T20 World Cup to create a vacant window.

201,16-4-20,"Coronaviruses found in bats, but it spreading to humans very rare: ICMR epidemiology chief","Research done in China has found that the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19 either could have been the mutated version of a bat virus, which developed the capacity to cause the disease in humans, or got transmitted to pangolins from bats and then to humans, the ICMR said on Wednesday.

Head of Epidemiology and Communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Raman R Gangakhedkar said that coronavirus is found in bats, but an incident of it spreading from bats to humans happens once in, may be, a thousand years when any virus changes species.""That is a rare event,"" he said.

""We have come to know from the research in China so far that the virus which has affected humans either may have been because the bat virus has mutated in such a form that it has developed the capacity to cause disease in humans or it got transmitted to pangolins from bats first and then to human beings,"" Gangakhedkar said.

Referring to a recent ICMR study which has found the presence of bat coronavirus in two species -- Rousettus and Pteropus -- in some states, he said these are incapable of affecting humans adversely.

""We started a survey on emerging infectious diseases and to see if those viruses can be found in bats. We found the presence of bat coronavirus (BtCoV) in two bat species but they are not capable of affecting human beings adversely.

""These bat coronaviruses have no relation with SARS-CoV2, which is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic,"" he said.

Researchers have found the presence of BtCoV in two species from Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu, according to the ICMR study, published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research.

There is no evidence or research to claim that these bat coronaviruses can cause disease in humans, Dr Pragya D Yadav, Scientist at National Institute of Virology-Pune and also the first author of study had said.

Throat and rectal swab samples of the two bat species from seven states were screened for the bat coronvirus during which the representative samples collected from Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu tested positive while those from Karnataka, Chandigarh, Punjab, Telengana, Gujarat and Odisha came out negative, the study said.

The reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and sequencing were used for the confirmation of the findings.

207,16-4-20,Amazon to shut French centres for five days over virus ruling,"Online retailer Amazon said on Wednesday it would close its French distribution centres for five days after a court ordered it to evaluate measures taken to protect workers from coronavirus.

The sites would be closed from Thursday but employees would be paid full salaries, Amazon said.

The firm promised to appeal against Tuesday's court ruling, which limited the tech giant to delivering only essential goods while it evaluates the risk of workers being exposed to coronavirus.

The facilities are key in preparing orders submitted online for delivery to clients.

The court said Amazon France had ""failed to recognise its obligations regarding the security and health of its workers"" and gave it a month to carry out the evaluation.

The firm said the ruling left it ""perplexed"" saying it had given the court evidence about temperature checks, physical distancing orders and use of personal protective equipment.

The CGT union told AFP a committee including representatives of the union, workers and the employer voted to close the sites so that they could be cleaned.

Amazon France's biggest labour union, the SUD, took the company to court saying workers were being forced to work in close proximity.

The SUD welcomed the site closures and its representative Laurent Degousee told AFP that the union would watch carefully to make sure employees were properly paid.

""Currently, we are continuing to operate in the country and doing everything possible to maintain the level of service,"" the company said in a statement in French.

""However, without the possibility to use our distribution centres in France, we will be forced to restrict a service which has become essential for millions of people across the country which want access to products that they need during the crisis."" The company said it had delivered more than 127,000 packets of disinfectant wipes, 27,000 litres of sanitising hand gel and 1.5 million masks.

France, like many other countries, has closed all non-essential businesses -- only supermarkets and pharmacies are open in many areas.

Online retailers like Amazon have continued to sell products now unavailable elsewhere, and in many countries Amazon has added thousands of staff to meet a surge in orders.

Amazon, which in February employed 6,500 permanent staff and 3,600 temporary employees at six French sites, insisted it was properly respecting safety standards.

Since the coronavirus outbreak, it has received five warnings from French labour inspectors and has taken action to get three of them lifted.

""This is a difficult situation,"" Planning Minister Asad Umar said while addressing a news conference along with PM's aide on health Dr Zafar Mirza and adviser on national security Moeed Yusuf following a meeting of National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) here.

He said besides coronavirus, the government is fighting war at different fronts including poverty, hunger and weak economy.

""It is important to find a balance between slowing the spread of the virus and ensuring lower-income people don't have to go hungry,"" he said, adding that the country was ""passing through a difficult situation.""

Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday extended the lockdown till April 30, but allowed several industries to open up.

His Advisor on Health Dr Zafar Mirza said that a lower number of deaths, in comparison with the rest of the world, didn't mean the people should stop taking precautionary measures.

Yusuf said all Pakistanis currently in India will be brought back to the country through Wagah border on Thursday.

All Pakistanis who are arriving from other countries will be quarantined. Those wishing to stay in hotels will have to bear their own expenses, he added.

Yusuf said that due to limited testing kits, the country's ability to test local residents will be restricted if all Pakistanis arriving from other countries are tested. This is one constraint the government is facing in bringing back people from abroad, he said.

Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus patients in the country rose to 6,383, with 395 new confirmed cases and 11 deaths during the last 24 hours.

Worst-hit Punjab province reported 3,143 cases, Sindh 1,668, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 912, Balochistan 240, Gilgit-Baltistan 234, Islamabad 140 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 46.

Minister of Industries Hammad Azhar has said several sectors and industries including construction, agriculture, chemical manufacturing, e-commerce, software, paper and paper packaging, fertilisers, mines, glass industry and plant nurseries were being allowed to open.

He said exporters can also become operational.

Khan, while allowing relaxation in the lockdown to allow these industries to work, warned of action if set procedures were flouted.

He also announced to bring ordinance to curb smuggling and hoarding ive strict punishment to culprits.

212,16-4-20,"Virus afflicts 1 million in 70 days, 2mn in 12 days","The speed with which the Covid-19 is sweeping across the world is seen from the fact that the deadly pathogen took 70 days to grip 1 million people and just 12 days to reach the 2-million count on Wednesday.

This, despite the fact that most affected nations, including India, are in a state of complete lockdown as WHO cautions patience before lifting social distancing restrictions.

Experts believe the true figure of positive cases is much higher, with many people never tested because their symptoms are mild or because of a shortage of medical supplies.

As of Wednesday morning there have been at least 2,004,670 cases of the disease worldwide, while at least 130,680 people have died after catching the virus.

Worldwide coronavirus cases reached one million and the global death toll surpassed 50,000 on April 2.

The United States has the largest outbreak in the world with more than 600,000 confirmed cases and nearly 30,000 deaths. Local and state officials in the US have acknowledged that the true number of Covid-19 cases in the country is likely far higher than those that have been confirmed due to testing shortages and restrictions.

According to WHO figures, there were around 153,000 cases a month ago on March 15, but the figure had risen to 751,000 by March 31.

The global tally passed one million on April 2, and has now doubled again in the space of two weeks.

214,16-4-20,IMD predicts 100% normal monsoon,"Amid the gloom of a massive economic slowdown triggered by the coronavirus outbreak, India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Wednesday predicted that southwest monsoon would be normal at 100 per cent of the long period average this year.

The IMD also came out with new reference dates for ‘onset’ and ‘withdrawal’ of monsoon across the country. The date for the onset of monsoon in Kerala remains the same — June 1. The date for Chennai will be June 4, Panjim June 7, Hyderabad June 8, Pune 10, Satara 10, Vizag 11, Mumbai 11, Cuttack 12, Puri 13, Surat 19, Nagpur 15, Kolkata 11, Jamshedpur 14, Bhopal 15, Gaya 16, Sonepat 30 and Jammu 30. The monsoon will reach the national Capital on June 27.

“We will have a normal monsoon this year. Quantitatively the monsoon rainfall during the monsoon season 2020 is expected to be 100 of its long period average with an error of +5 or -5 per cent due to model error,” said Madhavan Rajeevan Nair, Secretary with the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES). He said the weather department has revised the onset and withdrawal dates of the monsoon from this year.

Rajeevan, who along with IMD Director, General Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, released the first stage long-range monsoon forecast, said both El Nino and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), the ocean warming phenomena that influence the quantum of rainfall that India gets during the southwest monsoon, are neutral this year.

The El Nino is linked to deficient rain, while a positive IOD brings in more rain to the Indian landmass. However, he said, some models suggest La Nina conditions leads to better rains during the latest part of the monsoon.

The IMD defines average, or normal, rainfall as between 96 per cent and 104 per cent of a 50-year average of 88 centimetres for the entire four-month season beginning June.

Though the IMD’s first stage monsoon forecast would be able to give only a broad picture, it is considered important for farmers to plan in advance the kind of crop they should select for cultivation and arrange seeds and relevant farm inputs such as fertilisers and pesticides.

Farmers will get the more accurate picture from the IMD’s second stage forecast for monsoon either in last week of May or in first week of June when the national weather forecaster would be able to predict spatial distribution of rainfall over the vast geographical areas of India.

The country has had a rollicking pre-monsoon season till date (March 1 to April 14) with a surplus rainfall of 16 per cent, though there are a few pockets of deficits. These include Lakshadweep (-45 per cent); Tamil Nadu and Puducherry (-44 per cent); Saurashtra & Kutch (-70 per cent); and a few North-Eastern States.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/imd-predicts-100--normal-monsoon.html

216,16-4-20,"Trump halts fund to WHO, alleges Covid cover-up","US President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced halting America’s funding of the World Health Organization while a review is being conducted to assess its role in “severely mismanaging and covering up” the spread of the deadly coronavirus.

The Trump administration has accused WHO of taking side with China in the coronavirus outbreak that has brought America’s economy to a standstill.

While China and EU countries have slammed the US President’s decision, UN chief Antonio Guterres said it “not the time” to reduce resources for the WHO as it is fighting the Covid-19 pandemic.

Covid, which originated from Wuhan in China’s Hubei province in November, has so far killed over 1,19,000 people globally, including more than 25,000 in the US.

“Today I am instructing my administration to halt funding of the World Health Organization while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization’s role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus. Everybody knows what has gone on there,” Trump said at his daily White House news conference on Covid.

American taxpayers provide between USD400 million and USD500 million per year to the WHO, in contrast, China contributes roughly USD40 million a year and even less, he said.

“As the organization’s leading sponsor, the United States has a duty to insist on full accountability, one of the most dangerous and costly decisions from the WHO was its disastrous decision to oppose travel restrictions from China and other nations,” Trump alleged.

“They were very much opposed to what we did, fortunately, I was not convinced and suspended travel from China saving untold numbers of lives...Thousands and thousands of people would have died,” he said.

The world, he asserted, depends on the WHO to work with countries to ensure that accurate information about international health threats is shared in a timely manner. “The WHO failed in this basic duty and must be held accountable,” he said.

The president alleged that WHO failed to investigate credible reports from sources in Wuhan that conflicted directly with the Chinese government’s official accounts. There was credible information to suspect human-to-human transmission in December 2019, which should have spurred the WHO to investigate and investigate immediately, he observed.

“Through middle of January it parroted and publicly endorsed the idea that there was not human-to-human transmission happening despite reports and clear evidence to the contrary,” he said.

According to Trump, the delays the WHO experienced in declaring a public health emergency cost valuable time. “More time was lost in the delay it took to get a team of international experts and to examine the outbreak...,” he added.

The inability of the WHO to obtain virus samples to this date has deprived the scientific community of essential data. New data that emerges across the world on a daily basis points to the unreliability of the initial reports and the world received all sorts of false information about transmission and mortality, he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-halts-fund---to-who--alleges-covid-cover-up-2020-04-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/trump-halts-fund---to-who--alleges-covid-cover-up.html
217,16-4-20,IMF backs India's 'proactive' COVID-19 response,"The International Monetary Fund Wednesday said that it supports India's proactive decision of a imposing a nationwide lockdown in its fight against coronavirus.

A day earlier, the IMF in its World Economic Outlook had forecast India's growth rate to be 1.9 per cent in 2020.

""India entered the pandemic turmoil in the midst of a credit crunch-induced slowdown and its recovery prospect becomes more uncertain,"" Chang Yong Rhee, the Director of the IMF's Asia and Pacific Department, told reporters during a news conference here.

""Despite the economic slowdown, the government implemented a nationwide lockdown and we support India's proactive decision,"" Rhee said.

On March 25, India entered a three-week lockdown, which was slated to end on April 14. The lockdown was extended till May 3.

The impact of the coronavirus on the Asia-Pacific region will be severe, across the board, and unprecedented, he said, adding that Asia's growth in 2020 will come to a standstill.

This is worse than the annual average growth rates throughout the Global Financial Crisis (4.7 percent) or the Asian Financial Crisis (1.3 percent). Actually, Asia has not experienced zero growth in the last 60 years, he said. ""That said, Asia's growth still fares better than other regions.""

For 2021, he said, there is hope. If containment policies succeed there could be a rebound in growth, he said.

However, it is highly uncertain how this year will progress, he added.

Noting that this is not a time for business as usual, Rhee said that Asian countries need to use all policy instruments in their toolkits. In doing so, policy tradeoffs will be inevitable and will depend on policy space, he added.

China is expected to grow by 1.2 percent in 2020. The revisions to growth reflect both losses of domestic activity due to the social distancing measures, as well as loss of external demand.

""We expect a rebound in economic activity later this year. This is because China is emerging from the outbreak first. Nonetheless, there are clear risks: the virus could come back and normalization could take longer,"" Rhee said.

Japan's economic outlook for 2020 has deteriorated significantly, he said.

Real GDP in Japan is expected to decline by 5.2 percent, caused by the coronavirus impact, and a sharp deterioration of external demand, he said, adding South Korea's growth in 2020 is anticipate to be at -1.2 percent, he said.

Spelling out a set of recommendations for the countries in the Asia-Pacific region, Rhee said the first priority is to support and protect the health sector to contain the virus and introduce measures that slow contagion.

""If there is not enough fiscal space, countries will need to re-prioritize from other expenditures,"" he said.

Noting that containment measures are severely affecting economies, he said targeted support to hardest-hit households and firms is needed.

This is a real economic shock unlike the Global Financial Crisis. Protect people, jobs and industries directly, not just through financial institutions, he said.

Observing that the pandemic is also affecting the financial market functioning, he urged countries to use monetary and macroprudential regulations flexibly to provide ample liquidity, ease financial stress of industries and SMEs.

""For emerging markets with limited fiscal space, they might need to consider how to use central bank balance sheets flexibly to help SMEs through risk sharing with the government, he said.

Asserting that external pressures need to be contained, he said that countries should seek and utilize bilateral and multilateral swap lines and financial support from the multilateral institutions.

There can be a role for capital flow measures to secure external sector stability as a prerequisite to use more aggressive domestic policies to prevent lasting social and economic distress, he said. ""Targeted support combined with domestic demand stimulus in a recovery will help to reduce scarring, but it needs to reach people and smaller firms.""",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/imf-backs-india-s--proactive--covid-19-response-2020-04-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/imf-backs-india-s--proactive--covid-19-response.html
218,16-4-20,COVID-19 may impact treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes: Study,"Researchers have revealed intersections of the biological pathways behind coronavirus infection and type 2 diabetes, findings that may lead to new approaches in treatment for hospitalised COVID-19 patients.

According to the research, published in the journal Endocrine Reviews, individuals with obesity and diabetes are known to be at increased risk for complications arising from influenza, with the two conditions emerging as important comorbidities for disease severity in the context of COVID-19.

""We reviewed how the pathophysiology of diabetes and obesity might intersect with COVID-19 biology and found key shared pathways and mechanisms linked to the development and treatment of type 2 diabetes,"" said the study's author Daniel J. Drucker from Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto.

Some cells in the lungs and the gut, the scientists said, are important sites for the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, to enter and infect hosts, causing inflammation in these regions.

They found that some of these cells produce specific proteins that are also expressed by cells during type 2 diabetes development.

""Cells within the lung and gut are major sites for coronavirus entry and inflammation. These cells express key proteins like Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP4) that are also present in the development of type 2 diabetes,"" Drucker said.

However, he added that more studies need to be conducted to understand the risks and benefits of commonly used diabetes medications in patients with severe coronavirus infections.

According to Drucker, the pandemic highlights the importance of expanding innovative delivery of diabetes care and regular communication between people with diabetes and their health care providers.

219,16-4-20,"China dispatches 650,000 medical kits to India to fight COVID-19: Indian envoy","China on Thursday dispatched 650,000 coronavirus medical kits to India to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Indian Ambassador to Beijing Vikram Misri said.

Over two million test kits being procured from China will be sent to India in the next 15 days, he told PTI here.

#IndiaFightsCoronavirus A total of 650,000 kits, including Rapid Antibody Tests and RNA Extraction Kits have been despatched early today from Guangzhou Airport to #India, Misri tweeted on Thursday.

As its factories resumed operations after over a two-month grim battle against the coronavirus, China is busy tapping into the vast business opportunities of export of key medical goods, especially ventilators and personal protection equipment (PPE), across the world, including India, where both private and government bodies are placing orders for the import of these products.

Two major consignments of medical kits were reported to have been sent to India from China earlier as part of efforts to step up testing specially in hotspots during the current lockdown in the country.

India has extended its ongoing lockdown to fight the coronavirus till May 3. It has reported 414 deaths due to the disease and 12,380 people have been infected by the disease in the country.

Considering the importance, Misri said the Indian Embassy is facilitating commercial procurements besides coordinating flight linkages for their timely arrival in India.

On Tuesday, Misri told media here that India has placed orders to procure 15 million personal protection gear from China for medical personnel treating COVID-19 patients besides three million testing kits.

The orders are being placed with bonafide firms with the help of the Chinese government.

""I think facilitation of our needs and our requirements in a timely manner, in a smooth manner, on a predictable timeline at prices that are stable and orderly, would be the best signal possible to send for the India-China relationship,"" Misri said.

As demand for Chinese medical supplies scaled up due to the spread of the virus in several parts of world, China on Wednesday asked all the countries to import these items through reputed Chinese firms cleared by the government and vowed to punish those involved in counterfeit behaviour.

Responding to questions about quality concerns raised by several countries related to medical equipment imports from China, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here on Wednesday that the Chinese government is facilitating the orderly exports.

""We hope foreign buyers can choose products from companies that have been accredited by Chinese regulators with good production credentials,"" he said.

220,16-4-20,"Social worker arrested, TV reporter booked for fake info causing Bandra chaos","A day after thousands of restive migrant workers gathered in front of the Bandra Railway Station demanding that they be allowed to return to their native places, the Mumbai Police on Wednesday arrested a social worker for his social media posts and booked a television journalist for his “incorrect” news leading to huge crowds in front the railway station on Tuesday evening.

On a day when the investigations by the police and cyber wing of the city police threw up new facts that suggested the incident might have been sparked by the alleged irresponsible acts by a social worker and journalist, the Bandra police arrested Vinay Dubey, a social activist from Airoli in Navi Mumbai and brought him to Mumbai.

“He (Dubey) has been remanded to police custody till 21 April,” Deputy Commissioner of Police Abhishek Trimukhe said.

Having taken serious cognisance of the crowds gathered suddenly in front of the Bandra Railway Station on Tuesday evening, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had ordered a thorough probe into the incident.

In all, the Bandra police have filed three FIRs in connection with the incident.

Dubey has been booked under sections 143 (Whoever is a member of an unlawful assembly), 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Besides, Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act has also been invoked against them.

Simultaneously, the Bandra police registered an FIR against Rahul Kulkarni, a correspondent with a Marathi news channel in Osmanabad, for allegedly reporting “incorrect” news that trains would restart. The news report on ABP Majha is said to have been based on a letter written by a South Central Railway official on April 13 on a proposal for Jansadharan special trains.

In a video message which went viral on social media prior to April 14, Dubey slams the Prime Minister for the unplanned manner in which the latter enforced lockdown in the country which landed migrant workers based in Maharashtra in deep trouble. He says he had organised 40 buses to take back these people to their native place, written to the Chief Ministers of various north-Indian and other States that he be permitted to take back the migrants their native places free of cost and that had not got any permission for the same.

Continuing, Dubey appealed to the Railway Ministry and the Prime Minister requesting them to organise special trains with unreserved compartments in two to three days from Mumbai, Nashik and Pune to take back migrants to their native States of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Western Bengal. “On their arrival in their States, it is okay if they are quarantined for 14 days before allowing to go their home,” he said.

Dubey said that if the buses are permitted to move out of Maharashtra and trains were not run by the Railways after the lockdown lasting till April 14, he would lead all the migrants to their respective States by foot by April 20, come what may and he would feed them en route. During the course of his message, he gives his mobile number and asks people to call him and give him the number of people that would accompany him and he also says he would provide all the information to the State Government.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/social-worker-arrested--tv-reporter-booked-for-fake--info-causing-bandra-chaos-2020-04-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/social-worker-arrested--tv-reporter-booked-for-fake--info-causing-bandra-chaos.html

222,16-4-20,Sharon Stone blasts 'misogynistic era' of 1990s Hollywood,"Hollywood star Sharon Stone says Hollywood was rife with misogyny when she entered the showbiz over two decades ago.

The 62-year-old actor said she was criticised for her appearance at a time when the #MeToo movement wasn't even in sight.

""When I started as a model and actress, the term 'f***able' was equated with workable and camera. At the beginning, you found that I was too masculine, athletic and muscular, so pretty unsexy. To be perceived differently, I had myself photographed half-naked for 'Playboy',"" Stone told the German edition of Vogue magazine.

""It was a pretty misogynistic era 20 years ago. Mel Gibson, who is three years older than me, thought I was too old to star opposite him,"" she added.

Stone shot to fame after her turn as serial killer Catherine Tramell in 1992's ""Basic Instinct"", so much so that she landed on the ""Sexiest Woman Alive"" lists, something she doesn't take much pride in.

""It's crazy what you find so sexy. But men are probably into sexual offenders and predators who take what they feel like. At least that was the case in the 1990s.""

The actor, whose leg-crossing scene in the erotic thriller has been called iconic by many, also shared her distaste for the sequence still being a topic of discussion.

Referencing her re-enactment of the scene at an event last year, Stone said, ""When will the same questions ever stop? The short film scene was shot in another century and has dominated my life ever since. I'm just fed up with it and wanted to address the dilemma with humour.""",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sharon-stone-blasts--misogynistic-era--of-1990s-hollywood-2020-04-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/sharon-stone-blasts--misogynistic-era--of-1990s-hollywood.html

224,16-4-20,"Vir Das on comedy in times of coronavirus: If you're funny, time to do your best job now","Actor-comic Vir Das says people will need to smile a lot more amid the coronavirus pandemic and comedians should step up to do the best job they've ever done.

From his end, the comic is raising funds through 'Vir Das At Home' where he performs for an audience online.

""We are going to need to smile now more than ever and for a while. If you're a funny person, this is the time to do your job. The best you've ever done it... I'm trying to focus on fundraising. I'm doing a show every night on Zoom call where the proceeds are going to different charities.

""This lockdown won't affect the privileged as much. We have got to do our part. So my main focus during the lockdown is to try and raise money,"" Das told PTI.

Before the pandemic brought everything to a standstill, Das had planned a world tour of 29 countries, which naturally got pushed.

There has been a lot of conversation about how the way people consume entertainment stands to change post coronavirus.

As a comic, who is used to performing in front of a large gathering, Das feels the impact will be there for sometime, but eventually, the urge to laugh will gather people together.

""Those are the things that come and go. From court jesters, impressionists, Jaspal Bhatti, Johnny Lever to us and the people who come after us, the urge to sit in a room and laugh with each other together, will always find a way back. That I'm not so worried about.""

The actor is currently gearing up for the release of the Netflix series, ""Hasmukh"", co-created by Das and filmmaker Nikkhil Advani.

The series features Das in the titular role of a young man from Saharanpur, who has to kill people off stage to perform better on stage.

The actor had written a pilot, nearly three years ago, and taken it to the ""Kal Ho Naa Ho"" director who felt it was funny but needed ""more darkness and gravity.""

Together, they worked on it for six-seven months, got it green-lit and then ran a writers room.

""Comedy isn't so much about telling jokes, it's about being yourself and telling jokes. 'Hasmukh' is this awkward, shy, man who has a lot of anger inside him. Which is who I was when I got into comedy, except I don't murder people.

""But the first time I got a laugh was when I went on stage and yelled at a bunch of people. I was 22, life wasn't going well, I couldn't make rent, girls weren't talking to me and I yelled out all of that stuff.""

The series, directed by Nikhil Gonsalves, also features Ranvir Shorey, Manoj Pahwa, Ravi Kishan, Amrita Bagchi, Suhail Nayyar, Inaamulhaq and Raza Murad.

With ""Hasmukh"", the 40-year-old ""Go Goa Gone"" actor got a chance to create a lot of the characters and deep dive in the ""outrageous"" universe of the show.

""I got to write them as really loud characters. Nikkhil really led me on 'Hasmukh.' We decided that I would be the in-charge of who Hasmukh is on stage and Nikkhil gets to shape who he is off stage.

""He's a passive, underconfident character surrounded by these loud maniacs. That's what makes him frustrated and pop when he murders. He's only ever free when he murders or is on stage.""

Writing the show was a challenge on multiple levels for Das as Hasmukh is ""diametrically opposite"" to the comic.

""He's a small town boy, a Hindi comedian. Also, to write for an artiste who doesn't know his voice yet. He's a terrible comedian, he's clueless. It's a very outrageous universe for a show.

""When I first came to Mumbai, I was a writer on various GEC (General Entertainment Channels) comedy and award shows. So a lot of it is also based on what I saw- the big, glamorous GEC world of those. But to try and add darkness to that was a challenge,"" he added.

""Hasmukh"" produced for Applause Entertainment by Emmay Entertainment, will debut on Netflix on April 17.

231,16-4-20,"Iran says virus deaths rise 92 to 4,869","Iran on Thursday announced 92 new deaths from the novel coronavirus, the third straight day that official fatalities remained in double digits in the Middle East's worst-hit country.

Health ministry spokesman Kinaoush Jahanpour told a news conference the latest deaths brought the official total to 4,869.

He added that 1,606 new infections had been confirmed in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 77,995 from 310,340 tests.

Of those confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus and admitted to hospital, 52,229 had been discharged after recovering, which he described as a ""rising trend"". Another 3,594 patients are in critical condition.

There has been speculation abroad that the number of deaths and infections is higher than officially announced.

A report published Tuesday by parliament said the real death toll from Iran's outbreak was estimated to be as much as 80 percent more than that announced by the government.

The number of COVID-19 infections were estimated to be ""eight to 10 times"" higher.

It said the officially announced figures were based only on ""patients that are hospitalised with severe symptoms"".

It also criticised the government for being slow to act against the outbreak and said a ""second wave"" of the virus may come next winter -- possibly without a break due to containment measures taking too long.

In a statement on Thursday, the office that carried out the report denied it contradicted official figures and accused ""foreign media"" of lying and distorting its contents to ""undermine official statistics"".

A deputy health minister confirmed the numbers may be higher due to limited testing but rejected estimates based on ""incorrect modelling"", without directly addressing the report.

""The cases we have confirmed are certainly not the real figures. But there are no exact assessments in the world, save for South Korea which has had many tests done,"" Alireza Raisi was quoted as saying on Wednesday by state news agency IRNA. The ministry had also stopped provincial medical universities from reporting figures on their own, IRNA reported.

It argued such announcements have at times prompted Iranians to travel from worse-hit provinces to less-infected ones and further spread the virus.

The government of President Hassan Rouhani has struggled to contain the outbreak that emerged two months ago.

It shut schools and universities, postponed major events and imposed a range of other restrictions, but it has stopped short of ordering lockdowns.

Iran allowed small businesses outside Tehran to reopen on Saturday and is set to extend the measure to the capital next week.

The move has faced criticism from health experts and even some authorities, while top officials argue that sanctions-hit Iran cannot afford to shut down the economy. State television showed busy banks, government offices and taxi queues in various provinces on Thursday.

234,16-4-20,New iPhone SE to further boost Apple's position in post-lockdown India,"Ending months of speculations, Apple has brought a new, affordable second generation iPhone SE during tough COVID-19 times and when the lockdown opens, the Rs 42,500 device will certainly find appeal with college-going crowd or teenagers in India who cannot spend too much to own the iPhone 11 series.

The price segment where the new iPhone SE has entered is piping hot with competitive devices from OnePlus, Samsung and Vivo and Apple -- which saw a great uptick with iPhone XR when it got cheaper in India - is certain that iPhone SE 2020 will find a solid response from those which like to experience an iPhone but could not, to date, owing to the high prices.

The truth is: Apple logged a massive over 55 per cent growth in iPhone shipments for the India market in January and February this year compared to the same period in 2019, riding on strong demand for iPhone 11 and other models, according to Prabhu Ram, Head-Industry Intelligence Group (IIG), CMR.

Packed with top-of-the-line hardware, the new iPhone SE has the potential to create much room for Apple in the aggressive Rs 40,000-Rs 50,000 segment, feel industry experts.

""This will certainly appeal to a lot of Android mid-segment users who cannot afford a flagship iPhone. Also, this can really find traction is corporate and enterprise segment with Apple's positioning of privacy and security,"" Navkendar Singh, Research Director, IDC India, told IANS.

The new iPhone SE still carries that same look and design as from the iPhone models few years back and many upgraders have moved to XR or 11 in past two years with their new design and full screen experience.

""I should certainly find volumes immediately when it is launched since this will be the most affordable new iPhone and cheapest way to enter Apple ecosystem,"" Singh added.

The Cupertino-based iPhone maker has seen a dramatic shift in its fortunes in India since mid-2019, with increased 'Make in India' manufacturing giving the impetus required for iPhones.

According to Hanish Bhatia, Senior Analyst, Devices & Ecosystem at Counterpoint Research, Apple's latest A13 bionic chipset, IP67 rating and wireless charging feature are some of the key highlights of the new device.

""The aspirational value of the Apple brand remains high in India, but traditionally consumers tend to lean towards buying a device with higher specifications. The new iPhone SE shall further consolidate Apple's position in the premium segment,"" said Bhatia.

Although lockdown, along with other factors, will impact some sections of the Indian economy, the social distancing period is also likely to create some demand vacuum which may lead to stronger demand for a short period in the coming days.

""Consumers will be excited to get hands-on experience of the new device,"" Bhatia added.

The move is seen as a very strategic one to gain foothold in important emerging markets like India, which is a very value-conscious market.

""This price point is very aggressive from Apple, considering that Apple found success in India in 2019 in this segment. Also, with the expected aggressive marketing and demand generation initiatives expected by the brands and platforms, once the lockdown is lifted, should really help Apple to gain foothold in the mid premium segment of the market, where the competition is intensifying,"" elaborated Singh from IDC.

Apple is also continuously ramping up its manufacturing capabilities through its partners in India.

Apple supplier Wistron assembled low-end iPhone SE (now discontinued) and is now assembling iPhone 6S and iPhone 7 at its Bengaluru facility. The highest-selling iPhone XR is being manufactured at Apple supplier Foxconn's facility in Sriperumbudur, Chennai.

""Some of the best-selling Apple iPhone models are already manufactured in India. Also, we can now expect global OEMs to be more aggressive on their contingency planning while diversifying their supply chain and reducing the overall dependency on China. So it seems highly likely that a fraction of iPhone SE 2020 will be manufactured locally in India,"" Bhatia told IANS.

A 'Make in India' iPhone SE will have a different sort of appeal, isn't it?

The Head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at ICMR, Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, however, said these testing kits will be used for surveillance and to monitor whether coronavirus hotspots in the country are increasing or decreasing.

Regarding concern over the efficacy of the rapid antibody testing kits, he said if an antibody test of a person turns out to be positive, one cannot necessarily be sure the person would not get infected ever again. ""This means, even if antibody is present, that doesn't mean it will necessarily be effectively able to fight the virus.""

""Rapid antibody tests are for monitoring surveillance, not for diagnosis. Hence there is no concern with respect to the testing kits being faulty, that concern was with respect to immune response alone,"" Dr Gangakhedkare explained.

At least 9,000 people participated in the religious congregation in Nizamuddin. Later, many of the attendees travelled to various parts of the country.

At the LNJP Hospital, a COVID-19 patient allegedly misbehaved with a woman doctor on Tuesday evening, hospital authorities said.
