0,17-2-20,Time for introspection,"An institution can play a leadership role only if it comprehends the dynamic nature of its mission and goals in professional terms and understands the importance of looking within

One of the most prestigious national institutions of India, the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), is in ferment. Not for the first time. There is a general refrain among academics that it is the most pampered universities in the country. With over 70 per cent entrants getting scholarships, its professors are free to enroll any number of scholars who continue their research work, avail hostel facilities without any time limit or restriction — all for their political pursuits.

While the amount of scholarships must be enhanced regularly, hostel rent must not be touched. Currently, even when over 80 per cent of the students have already deposited the revised fee and registered for the new semester, courts are being approached to deliver justice with one demand: No rise in fee. In fact, in JNU’s terminology, it is business as usual.

However, the level of investment that the nation has made in this one university makes it obligatory on its part to prove its worth on account of the confidence put in it by the people. They know where JNU stands. But the latter is not interested in incisively securitising its role and contribution.

Central Universities and other national-level institutions of higher learning and research must regularly pose a very serious query to themselves — both individually and collectively: Are we really equipped enough to take a fresh look? An institution can play a leadership role only if it collectively comprehends the dynamic nature of its mission, objectives and goals in professional terms and consistently strives to understand the importance of “looking within.” National-level institutions must remain ever-alert on “growing up” professionally. Reputations are made only through persistence of single-minded commitment to the cause over a long period of time. When academics within an institution get divided on ideological constraints, there is a drastic reduction in the time available for high quality collaborative research and genuine innovations. In the post-Independence period, India has witnessed a sharp decline in some of its prestigious learning centres of earlier years. It would have been in the fitness of things if JNU had studied such cases and came forward with a model of re-engineering and quality enhancement strategies.

The growth of unbiased and pure professional tradition of knowledge quest suffers in conditions of severe apathy towards the indigenous tradition of knowledge-creation and dissemination, the essence of which may still be relevant.

It is now globally acknowledged that education in every country must be rooted in its culture and must be committed to the progress of the country. The pre-Independence model of Gandhi and Zakir Husain was based upon this premise. It is now being realised that had India given the importance education deserved, things would have been far more encouraging on the employment front. There would also have been no exodus from rural areas.

Education has suffered because of a lack of courage to link it to the national tradition of growth of knowledge and scholarship. Instead, we have been overdependent on inherited legacy. It should never be tough for a professional, unbiased educationist to conclude that education in every country must be a product of indigenous thought process and appropriate new scientific knowledge.

Consequently, the first requirement at the policy-planning level is full familiarity with the indigenous traditions of knowledge quest, its creation, generation, transfer and utilisation. This is necessary but should not be a closed exercise. It would be equally necessary to acquire a deep comprehension of new knowledge that could be available from all possible sources and places.

Mahatma Gandhi had something to say about it and it appeared in the Young India of June 1, 1921: “I do not want my house to be walled in all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the cultures of all the lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any. I refuse to live in other people’s houses as an interloper, a beggar or a slave.”

One of the outstanding features of the freedom struggle was its persistent focus on indigenous universal education in a free India. Our founding fathers knew that the transplanted system forced by the alien rulers on the country would not work in free India. It was meant for a few to attain a specific objective and would crash even otherwise if extended on a universal scale. Sadly enough, India continued with it. Can one say that we preferred continuity and status quo instead of creating “our schools, our campuses, our programmes, our curricula, our libraries and laboratories?”

Though Mahatma Gandhi had warned about all this in Hind Swaraj, he wrote in 1909: India remained too enamoured of all that is Western; we are too overwhelmed; just too eager to borrow everything from “there and them?”

With its overwhelming emphasis on liberal education, JNU could have researched what was the best model for school education that India must implement. It is certainly not too much to expect that it could have presented to the nation how social cohesion and religious amity could be cemented in the country and why it is a core element of economic growth, progress and development.

It is really depressing that there are two distinct ideological groups of students and teachers who have just fully ignored the dialogical tradition that was the hallmark of knowledge growth in the past and has become more relevant and necessary in present times.

Swami Vivekananda could put it in futuristic perspective as early as in 1896 in one of his lectures delivered in London: “What we want is progress, development and realisation. No theories ever made men higher. No amount of books can help us to become purer. The only power is in realisation, and that lies in ourselves and comes from thinking. Let men think. A clod of earth never thinks but it remains only a lump of earth. The glory of man is that he is a thinking being. It is the nature of man to think and therein he differs from animals.”

Let JNU lead other universities to a major rethink that would let them focus purely on knowledge quest for fulfilling the aspirations of the youth and the nation.

For those who are interested in finding solutions, one would like to submit the following from a letter Albert Einstein wrote to Mahatma Gandhi and which was quoted by APJ Abdul Kalam in one his books: “You have shown through your works, that it is possible to succeed without violence even with those who have not discarded the method of violence.”

Are our universities and students of today not expected to strengthen this philosophy?

It is indeed depressing that today we have a culture where even premium universities, with all of their much-publicised achievements, never seriously try to listen to those who do not think alike. It is sad that a culture of intolerance pervades many famed institutions of higher learning. However, they must not forget that they have an obligation to the nation to encourage, nourish and nurture the great dialogical tradition of India. They must become a place of intellectual interactions and welcome every idea with open arms. India needs leadership institutions that would promote social cohesion and religious amity.

1,17-2-20,Priyanka hits out at UP govt over unemployment,"Congress general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh East, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, on Sunday slammed the Yogi Adityanath government over unemployment issue.

The Congress leader took to Twitter to give the unemployment statistics of 2018 and 2019.

In 2018, a little over 21,39 lakh people were unemployed in UP but in 2019, there were 33,93 lakh registered unemployed in the state, she said.

Slamming the government, Priyanka tweeted in Hindi: “The government’s job is to provide job opportunities but the UP government is working every year to increase the rate of unemployment. In the Assembly, the minister had said that in the last two years, 12.5 lakh registered unemployed people have increased. Now look at BJP’s fake claims and see their reality. The youth is very worried.”

Earlier, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had launched a frontal attack on the Narendra Modi government over unemployment in the country and predicted that in six months from now, the prime minister would be unable to step out of his house as the youth would “beat him with sticks”. Addressing an election rally in Delhi, Rahul Gandhi had alleged that the youth were roaming on the streets and getting angry and restless due to lack of jobs.

He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would not be able to step out of his own home and face the youth of the country.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/priyanka-hits-out-at-up-govt-over-unemployment.html
2,17-2-20,Maya slams Centre over apex court ruling on quota,"Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Sunday criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central government over Supreme Court’s recent verdict on reservation.

Mayawati said that constitutional effort to bring oppressed victims of Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) and Other Backward Class (OBC) sections into the mainstream was “failing” as the BJP-led Centre had followed in the footsteps of the Congress by neglecting their cause.

She said the Supreme Court in a recent verdict had held that states were not bound to provide reservation in appointments and there was no fundamental right to claim quota in promotions.

Addressing the verdict, Mayawati, in a series of tweets, said, “Because of such a wrong attitude of the Centre, the Supreme Court made the system of reservation in government jobs and promotions inactive/ineffective.”

“The whole society is agitated by the manner in which the court did this. There are constant attacks on the rights of the poor, youth, women, and other oppressed people in the country,” she said.

She urged the Centre to provide a ‘security cover’ for the system of reservation by bringing it in the 9th Schedule of the Constitution.

Her tweet translates to, “In such a situation, I demand the Central government to bring the positive system of reservation in the 9th Schedule of the Constitution and provide it with security cover till crores of people who are suffering from neglect join the mainstream of the country. Reservation has the correct constitutional intent.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/maya-slams-centre-over-apex-court-ruling-on-quota.html
3,17-2-20,"UP’s solar energy sector growing, says Shrikant","Giving a boost to the renewable energy sector in the state, the Uttar Pradesh government is all set to get over 1050 megawatt of solar energy by the end of this year and for this the solar power plants have entered into agreement with the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL).

Power Minister Shrikant Sharma said that under the solar power energy policy, Uttar Pradesh was set to get 1122 MW of solar energy of which 1050 MW would be made available by November this year.

“The UPPCL has entered into an agreement with the solar units under open access or third party agreement. We are moving ahead in this direction confidently and would be able to generate enough solar power that will ease pressure on the conventional methods of generating electricity,” Sharma told this reporter.

He said that the first captive 50 MW unit had been commissioned on November 23, 2019. “Our solar energy policy is very attractive and many private players have started working on the ground with the government in this field,” he said.

The confidence of the minister sounds music to the ear at a time when the latest State of India’s Environment Annual report has claimed that the country’s renewable energy sector was losing steam, and even as the total capacity had reached almost 86 GW by December 2019, it may not meet the target of 175 gigaWatt (GW) RE capacity by 2022.

The renewable energy would mainly be in the form of 100 GW solar (60 GW utility-scale and 40 GW rooftop) and 60 GW wind.

Between 2014 and 2018, the renewable energy sector grew from 2.6 GW to 28 GW — a cumulative aggregated growth rate of around 18 per cent.

The report further says that annual additions to solar capacity had dipped drastically to 6.5 GW in 2018-19 from 9.4 GW in 2017-18.

The minister said that in 2019, rooftop solar power units of capacity 15 MW were installed and over 9,120 solar pumps and 7,120 solar streetlights had been installed.

“Our stress is on introducing renewable energy system in the rural sector where we are determined to provide quality electricity at a cheaper rate to the consumers,” the minister said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up---s-solar-energy-sector-growing--says-shrikant.html
4,17-2-20,Political parties recasting their 'quota' of electoral strategies,"The recent Supreme Court order quashing quota in promotion for Schedule Castes in state services has let the genie of reservation out of the bottle again, forcing political parties to recast their electoral strategies.

The apex court said reservations and quota in promotion were not a fundamental right and the state governments were not bound to provide reservation in promotions in public services.

Caste based political parties like Bahujan Samaj Party and Bhim Army were quick to target the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Central government, accusing them of being anti-Dalit. Bhim Army and other Dalit organisations have already given a call for Bharat Bandh on February 23. A similar bandh call by Dalit organisation in April 2018 in protest against the Supreme Court judgement diluting the stringent provisions of the Prevention of Atrocities against Schedule Castes Act had led to large-scale violence in UP, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and many other places in north India.

The Samajwadi Party has charged the ruling BJP government at the Centre with conspiring against Dalits, BSP chief Mayawati has asked the Union government to take positive corrective steps as her party does not agree with the Supreme Court ruling.

Asking the Centre to come clear over the issue soon, Mayawati said, “We demand from the Centre not to keep the matter hanging like the Congress did,” she said.

Calling the ruling unfortunate, BJP ally Apna Dal (Sonelal) national president Anupriya Patel said that the main reason for the recent move against reservation was the absence of SC/ST representation in judiciary.

Though the BJP governments, both at the Centre and in Uttar Pradesh, have been trying to allay the fears, the Congress has attacked the Narendra Modi government, accusing the BJP and its ideological mentor Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh of conspiring to end reservation.

For the Yogi Adityanath government, the apex court judgement has added to its woes as it is facing flak for delay in granting quota within the 27 per cent OBC reservation for the most backward classes (MBCs).

The MBCs are demanding separate quota for them within 27 per cent reservation for the Other Backward Classes as the dominant OBC castes Yadav and Kurmi have pocketed the lion’s share of the reservation benefits. The Yogi Adityanath government had set up a committee in 2017 which submitted its report in May 2018.

Suheldeo Bhartiya Samaj Party, a former ally of the BJP, is accusing the ruling party of ignoring the interests of the MBCs. The UP government has, however, promised that another committee to examine the report of the previous committee would soon be constituted and a final decision on quota within quota would be taken within the next few months.,

The quota for SCs, OBCs is a sensitive issue in the Hindi heartland where caste-based political parties have enjoyed considerable clout in electoral politics for the last several decades. The SCs and STs, who account for around 22 per cent of the population in UP, have been playing a significant role in electoral politics.

Both the SP and the BSP have reason to worry as their vote share since the 2014 Lok Sabha elections has eroded considerably. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, despite having joined hands to secure their respective clout, the vote share of SP-BSP combine came down to a little over 37 per cent from 42 per cent in 2014. It was due to the shifting of non Jatav SCs and non-Yadav OBCs towards the BJP. The vote share of the BJP went up to over 49 per cent in 2019 from a little over 42 per cent in 2014.

Political pundits have attributed this rise in BJP vote share to the mobilisation of non-Yadav backwards and non-Jatav Dalits. In fact, the power struggles in UP and the resulting shifts can be traced to the manner in which the SP and the BSP have treated the backwards and Dalits in the name of social engineering.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/political-parties-recasting-their--quota--of-electoral-strategies.html
5,17-2-20,Extreme weather conditions behind large-scale migration India records highest deaths in Asia,"India has witnessed the highest number of deaths in Asia because of extreme weather in the last two years leading to large-scale migration of people from one place to another, taking climate scientists and meteorologists by surprise.

The State of India’s Environment Annual report says that in terms of deaths, 48 per cent of the deaths in Asia due to extreme weather events happened in India.

In 2019, 2,038 people died due to extreme weather conditions compared to 1,396 in 2018.

Extreme weather events include conditions like drought, wildfire, flood, landslides, extreme temperatures, fog and storm.

The State of India’s Environment report says: “The continuity of extreme events from one month to the next means that the world needs to always be on its toes. Scientists and environmentalists have called this a climate emergency.”

Dr Shiraz A Wajih from Gorakhpur Environment Action Group says that months after months, India has witnessed vagary of weather. If in one particular month it had rained in one parts of the country, there was drought in other part that led to migration.

The report further says that in 2019, if north-east witnessed the end of the north-east monsoon season with a 44 per cent deficit rain, north India had one of the coldest and driest winters ever. In March, an unseasonal heat wave roasted Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. In April, thunderstorms with cloud-to-ground lightning strikes began affecting states in east, central and north-east India. The month ended with the formation of a rare pre-monsoon cyclone (Fani).

May and June were marked by a spate of heat waves.

“By the first week of June, the country had undergone 73 spells of heat wave conditions, 11 of them extreme; with the maximum deaths in Bihar The conditions were so harsh that district magistrates of five districts invoked Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code to restrict public activities during daytime,” the report said.

There was delay in the onset of south-west monsoon, and July started with a weak rainfall. But once it started raining, it poured. Twelve states received over 60 per cent surplus rains in the second week of July. The resultant floods in Bihar and Assam affected over 10 million people and claimed 168 lives.

“The rains came in short bursts of heavy downpours followed by drier periods, a pattern that continued till September. In all, there were 1,250 events of extreme rainfall during the year, or more than three per day,” the report said.

In October and November, cyclones Hikaa, Kyarr and Maha in the Arabian Sea and cyclone Bulbul in the Bay of Bengal formed and intensified in quick succession. With cyclone Pawan in December, the total number of cyclones in the northern Indian Ocean region reached eight. This is the highest number of cyclones in a single year since 1976.

The biggest impact of the climate change was on human migration. With increasing intensity and frequency, natural disasters now affect more than half of India’s population, both in rural and urban areas.

According to the National Disaster Management Authority, 27 of the 37 states and Union territories are disaster-prone. Some 68 per cent of the cultivated land is vulnerable to drought, 58.6 per cent landmass is prone to earthquakes, 12 per cent to floods, 5,700 km of the coastline is prone to cyclones and 15 per cent of the area is susceptible to landslides.

The 2011 Census shows that 405 million (or 33 per cent) of the country’s population are on the move, with some 9.9 million people migrating from one state to another every year.

Sunitha Krishnan from Prajwala, who is working with trafficked women in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, said that displacement or rise in migration due to disasters has raised concerns on increasing human trafficking.

“There is a clear evidence of linkages between disaster, migration and vulnerability to human trafficking. Even the UN Environment Programme estimates that trafficking goes up by 20-30 per cent during disasters,” she said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/extreme-weather-conditions-behind-large-scale-migration-india-records-highest-deaths-in-asia.html

8,17-2-20,Revisiting the fundamentals,"The world has progressed exponentially but the way forward is to select carefully from the creative method that applies to one’s context

The world progresses because it has pioneers. To be deemed a pioneer, a person must be able to do something which was never quite done before. It may be a discovery, creation or developing an insight. Illustratively, the Wright Brothers were pioneers when they built the world’s first practical fixed-wing aircraft. They were pioneers in making the first powered, controlled and sustained flight over 100 years ago. Every pioneering activity tries to negotiate the unknown. Path-breakers create opportunities to discover, explore, improve and basically deal with harnessing possibilities. There are some institutions born with a pioneering and innovative belief and the Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED) is one of them. It is rooted in the understanding that much of the forest produce has yet to be completely discovered and fully harvested. Often, even when people have gathered or “discovered” forest produces, they do not know how to convert them into progressively more worthwhile products. By adding value to the produce, by eliminating some of its attributes or adding new elements, it becomes more useful and meets some of the market’s needs quicker and better. It could also orient the buyer on how to do the same thing differently. This indeed is the heart of an innovative act and process.

Put simply, an innovative mind is marked by passion, curiosity, openness, courage, proactive orientation and divergent thinking. When monetised and put to covert advantages, forest produce gives to tribal folk better returns for their labour and better return on value. Some organisations have a structure for doing and developing this. They deal with facilitating market exchange and supporting tribes to understand and better the market economy and take it further. In the process, some of these institutions operate a network of collaboration with other entities and organisations. These include some world-class research and development institutions. They all help the core marketing enterprise to achieve its mission. It is worth exploring the principles of creativity and innovation to explain how pioneerism, making produce and marketing improvement can lead to better life for all concerned.

This is not a fable of hope. It is a description of what is rolling out on the ground. It is incredible how a produce graduating through primary innovation, secondary innovation and tertiary innovation can register a successful positioning in the market. In other cases a produce can achieve market attention even before the above three steps are completed. The important thing is to see the innovative process as a journey with feasible and marketable landmarks where at each stage a possible monetisation can take place. This will add to the practitioner’s perspective. Before that, however, an effort at context-setting may be in order. Talk and use of creativity is as old as the rivers. When the ancient seer of India recited the cantos of the Vedas he was riding the crest of his creative self. When the musicologist deciphered nadas (sound vibrations) of the brahmand (universe) the foundation of vocal arts using the auditory sensibilities of humans was laid.

Similar remarks can be made of other artistic and literary creative efforts. Parallely, there is the category of scientific creativity. The writer of these lines has developed the third concept of creativity beyond literary and scientific, called “informed creativity” which is best manifested in the problem-solving domain. There the instincts of problem-solving lead one to sourcing solutions, not because there is a muse as in writing poetry or a creative extrapolation because of a scientific logic, but a completely different platform of applied experience.

In the case of informed creativity, the instincts of the karta (the doer) tell him which way to go because his experience becomes the insight and solutions emerge instinctively. In management consulting, there can be situations where the two types of creative universes — scientific and literary — converge. One is where a type of a logic prevails in dealing with an inanimate universe, like in the category of materials. In dealing with them, there is a predictive validity, which can be both precise and quantitatively-oriented. In dealing with live entities like human beings, the predictive validity is doubtful because quantitative parameters are feeble at work. It is when the situation needs both predictive validity and is partially incapable of one, that “informed creativity” gets to work.

To elaborate further, when experiments related to atoms and the efforts at their synthesis and disaggregation were being made, it called for a visualisation of a possibility, which only a creative mind was capable of. This is the bedrock of “informed” creativity.

Roughly 200 years ago, Galton captured the key elements of such situations by captioning it “applied creativity”, which was made a synonym for innovation. The world has progressed in many directions, in many domains with varying intensities over the last 200 years. The way forward would be to select carefully from the creative method, for what applies to one’s context best.

9,17-2-20,Are we proud of ourselves now?,"Dr Khan was voicing the feelings of many Indian Muslims who have the impression that the Government is anti-minority. No doubt his speech was strongly emotional but surely in a democracy people should be allowed to vent some steam

Dr Kafeel Khan is a medical practitioner who did his MBBS and MD from the renowned Manipal Medical College, Karnataka, and thereafter served as a lecturer in BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur.

When several children died in 2017 in the Gorakhpur hospital attached to the medical college for lack of piped oxygen, he was arrested and charged with medical negligence. However, the enquiry revealed that there was a shortage of oxygen cylinders in the hospital and, in fact, Dr Khan spent money from his own pocket to obtain oxygen cylinders for the patients and worked overtime during the crisis. It was also found that he had written letters to several authorities informing them of the shortage but to no avail. The Indian Medical Association, several doctors of AIIMS, Delhi and over 200 health professionals and allied activists wrote to the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh (UP), Yogi Adityanath, in Dr Khan’s support. He was released on bail in April 2019 after spending nine months in jail.

Ultimately, in September 2019 Dr Khan was acquitted by the court which found no evidence against him. Thereafter on December 12, 2019 he gave a speech at an anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) rally in Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). A First Information Report (FIR) was lodged on December 13 regarding this, for allegedly creating religious disharmony under Sections 153A and 295A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Dr Khan was arrested on January 29 at Mumbai airport by the UP Police, which then took him to the State. He was granted bail by the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM), Aligarh on February 10 but was not released from Mathura jail. Ultimately, a preventive detention order was passed against him three days later under the National Security Act (NSA). Anyone who has carefully heard Dr Khan’s speech will bear witness to the fact that nowhere did he speak against any religious community. All that he said was, “We (i.e. Indian Muslims) are 25 crore people and we cannot be removed or scared and you cannot take anything away from us. (Tumhaari auqaat nahi ki tum humse kuch chheen sakte, hamein daraa sakte, hamein hataa sakte. Hum 25 crore hain).”

Dr Khan was voicing the feelings of many Indian Muslims who have the impression that this Government is anti-Muslim. No doubt his speech was strongly emotional but surely in a democracy people should be allowed to vent some steam. I do not see how this speech could attract Section 153A IPC, which makes promoting disharmony on the ground of religion and so on, or Section 295A, IPC which makes outraging religious feelings a criminal offence.

Even assuming those provisions were attracted, does it justify passing a preventive detention order under the NSA? It may be mentioned that in preventive detention no trial is held nor a lawyer permitted. Hence it is undemocratic. In Rekha vs State of Tamil Nadu (2011) a three judge Bench of the Supreme Court observed, “Preventive detention is by its nature repugnant to democratic ideals and an anathema to the rule of law. No such law exists in the US or England, except in war time. Since, however, Article 22(3)(b) of the Indian Constitution permits preventive detention, we cannot hold it illegal. But we must confine the power within very narrow limits, otherwise we will be taking away the right to liberty guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution, which was won after long, arduous, historical struggles. It follows, therefore, that if the ordinary law of the land (the IPC and other penal statutes) can deal with the situation, recourse to a preventive detention law will be illegal. Whenever an order under a preventive detention law is challenged, one of the questions which the court must ask is, was the ordinary law of the land sufficient to deal with the situation? If the answer is in the affirmative, the detention order will be illegal.”

It was also held in Rekha’s case, “No doubt it has been held in the Constitution Bench decision in Haradhan Saha’s case that even if a person is liable to be tried in a criminal court for commission of a criminal offence, or is actually being so tried, that does not debar the authorities from passing a detention order under a preventive detention law.

This observation, to be understood correctly, must, however, be construed in the background of the Constitutional scheme in Articles 21 and 22. Article 22(3)(b) is only an exception to Article 21 and is not itself a fundamental right. It is Article 21 which is central to the whole chapter on fundamental rights in our Constitution.

The right to liberty means that before convicting a person, a trial must be held in which he must be given an opportunity of placing his defence. It follows that if a person is liable to be tried, or is actually being tried, for a criminal offence, but the criminal law (IPC) will not be able to deal with the situation, then and only then, can the preventive detention law be taken recourse to.”

As regards Dr Khan’s speech, it does not attract 153A or 295A, IPC and even if it does, surely those provisions are sufficient to deal with the situation. The preventive detention order under the NSA is, therefore, clearly illegal and should be struck down by the court.

Dr Khan and his family have been victimised by the Government. His brother was shot at in 2018 but survived. He and his family have been bankrupted. Dr Khan has said people have stopped doing business with his family for fear of antagonising the Chief Minister.

10,17-2-20,People’s nationalism,"If AAP uses its power and manages to make neo-socialist logic visceral and granular to concerns of everyday life, it could transfer the ownership of nationalism to the citizens instead of politicians

Has the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), with its comprehensive home run at the Delhi Assembly elections, managed to carve an alternative space that may just be a dot at the moment but can be the cure to the fractured disease that the Opposition has become in our country? An antidote rather than being an antithesis? An equaliser in a society that’s predicated on inequity as social, economic and political capital? Owning responsibility than harvesting blame games? Perhaps that’s the reason why the party, while assuming charge for the third time, gave a clarion call for “positive nationalism” and has decided to participate in local self-governance polls across the country in a bit by bit lab experiment of welfarism. It may not be a pyramid yet but AAP is giving a new ring to the bijli, sadak, paani plank of the past and making delivery-oriented governance its new credo, much in line with countries like Denmark and South Korea, where the redress of people’s liveability indices, a happiness project if one could call it that, has changed traditional politics. And in resource-depleted times, where sustainability will be the only measure of a nation’s progress, this approach is set to redefine and reshape protectionism and nationalism as we know it.

Unmistakably, AAP has mastered realpolitik in its third avatar, neutralising the BJP’s campaign missiles with smart electoral strategy. But if it uses its power and manages to make this neo-socialist logic visceral and granular to the concerns of everyday life, then it could transfer the ownership of nationalism to people instead of politicians. This is not going to be an easy battle in deeply divided times where nationalism has been predicated on identity politics, the imaginary fear of the others and the hurt of denial we didn’t know existed. Polarisation and majoritarianism, of the kind that the BJP has encoded through its most repugnant avatars, need counter-strategies to begin with. And when the manifestation of vitriol is through the emotive force of religion, then secularism seems like an angularity than an asset. And in the India of our times, secularism is the new tormentor, the free radical that has emaciated religiosity, a non-belief that has denied us the right to wear it comfortably on our sleeves. Therefore, each Opposition party, which is now tactically avoiding a confrontation with the BJP and refusing to bite the bait that makes the latter look like the victim, is coopting religion, too. AAP has successfully turned religion into a jan dharma of serving the people and communities with its actions, be it on public health, water, education or empowering fee exemptions. However, in the public war of chants and rants, it countered Jai Shri Ram with Jai Bajrangbali, using the image of Ram’s servitor Hanuman. AAP is also using Hanuman as a metaphor for being a devotee of the people, serving with commitment and democratising religion as inclusive and common, pitting the BJP’s negative projection against a positive one. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee is doing the same with her Jai Maa Kali slogans in Bengal, invoking a deity which is revered by everybody in that State irrespective of their faith. The Congress, too, is now employing soft Hindutva of its kind. India had so far reconciled itself to a secular public life where ritualism was lived as a daily habit rather than an exhibitionist practice. The BJP has managed to overturn this paradigm, making public symbolism of religion a matter of pride and disowning it as a matter of national shame. Insidiously, it has throttled majoritarian liberalism and compelled political parties to play by the rules of this game. Religion, tragically, is now the domain of tactical warfare and a test of loyalty to the nation, thanks to the BJP. By establishing religion as a tool of political play, it has skillfully exiled secularism and Constitutional values to the domain and responsibility of civil society. This dissociation is significant. Simply because, despite protests, sit-ins and disruptors, there’s no political space for civil movements. As the BJP herds parties into Centre-Right positions, civil movements have become the cultivable space for transformational strategies. The AAP, which was born of such a movement, is then perhaps best placed to re-induct it in a manner that matters most, daily governance. And marry it to the larger reclamation of dharma, that of changing people’s lives. For people give parties the electoral strength to change politics. This could yet reset our fulcrum.

Undoubtedly, the Delhi verdict stands out because it has attempted creating a classless society — elevating standards and quality of Government schools so that their students are mainstreamed better, appointing proficient teachers with the right pay, setting up neighbourhood clinics that have become the first responders in a health crisis, allowing women free mobility without worrying about burdening the family budget, ensuring community-specific projects and doorstep delivery of services, reducing power bills that shows the Government’s intent to plough back its surpluses and enhancing digital access. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal himself astutely asked people to vote for his performance, no matter what religion or political ideology they harboured. This empowerment explains why BJP and Congress supporters, too, voted for AAP, why nationalism as an abstract idea will have to be translated into pride in the city you live in, the street where your home is.

According to a report by McKinsey, such a technique has been used successfully as a governance tool. “In the UK, for instance, the Local Government Association undertook a project to measure how satisfied residents were with their local council’s performance. Their analysis showed that perceived value for the money — essentially, whether residents feel they’re getting a good return on their tax dollars — was by far the most powerful influencer of public satisfaction; it was far more important than the tax levels themselves. Further, perceived value for the money was determined largely by how well residents were informed about local services. Several councils used these insights to make specific improvements; one group launched a ‘cleaner, greener, safer’ public-relations campaign that helped move the council from the bottom 40 per cent of performance satisfaction ratings to the top 10 per cent in less than five years,” the report says.

Aware of its limited territoriality and resources, the Kejriwal Government has worked on smart metrics, gathering public feedback to identify what matters most to citizens and circling out those that have the highest levels of dissatisfaction. Then it graded categories that began with basic infrastructure. Having taken care of those somewhat, it has already prioritised pollution as its next assignment, something for which it has already been criticised but hasn’t forgotten to take up.

Denmark, which is among the top liveability and sustainability indices of the world, is demonstrable proof of the success of a delivery-oriented governance model. The Social Democrats and the Farmers’ Party stood out for their social reform programmes when Adolf Hitler was on the ascendant in Germany. They embodied the power of a representative Parliament against his personality cult that was changing the political template of the times. With time they made the citizen feel valued for all the taxes s/he paid by evolving a governance model responsive to their needs and justifiable to their concerns. This automatically built accountability in systemic processes. And they included women in their growth story from the very beginning. The result? The nation has the highest employment ratio, the highest number of citizens on public allowances, the highest taxes (acceptable because it finances public expenditure), and the highest percentage of the economy ploughed into the public accounts. And it figures among the top 10 in income and education.

Many critics argue that such an approach builds a sense of entitlement, kills enterprise and works only on broad majorities, one that may actually coerce political parties into the game of populism. They may even atrophy on subsequent changes. But in a dynamic such as India’s, welfarism is empowering and encouraging and is needed to level out the basic indices. The application of ingenuity and its incentivisation can happen only when we have crossed this enabling threshold. Change doesn’t happen overnight. And you need role models. But at least a start has been made.

11,17-2-20,Vodagone?,"The telecom industry needs a level-playing field to take a giant leap towards exploring newer technologies

The telecom industry has undergone a fundamental change in recent times. Easy and ubiquitous access to voice and data services has transformed several industries, including the media. Yet, the controversy surrounding the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) and the dues that the telecom industry owes to the Government is making matters financially difficult for it. In fact, the huge amount of losses incurred by the industry, thanks to India’s low cost voice and data services and the competitive telecom environment, have questioned its long-term viability. The Government’s demand of over Rs 1 lakh crore from telcos and the Supreme Court’s Valentine’s Day gift to it demanding instant payment of dues along with the defaulting oil and gas companies may help it improve its fiscal deficit. But this may have the unintended result of killing the golden goose and realising that the insides of the goose are hollow. So what next for the Indian telecom industry? As it is, there are only three private telecom players that dominate the scene. And with British telecom operator Vodafone already making it clear that it is seriously considering leaving India, we will be left with just two. The immensely negative message that such a move will send to foreign companies looking to invest in India should not be underestimated. The emergence of a duopoly market portends a bleak future for customers. In the absence of Vodafone, would the two be able to absorb its customers? Already, complaints about call quality and lack of network connectivity have become common. The need for investment in newer technologies has been starker today than before. However, the Government’s view that telcos avoided paying their fair share should not be ignored and the court has rightly ruled in its favour. But it would be prudent to consider an instalment scheme for telecom operators. Some experts have even suggested a policy fix like retrospective tax change. Some reassurance and practicality are needed because the Government will be auctioning a new spectrum for the fifth-generation (5G) mobile services. Without an auction with relatively healthy telecom companies in the fray, the process will hardly help realise a fair value. It is not without reason cynics of the judgments have suspected that this order and payment demand benefit one particular company and individual.

It is important that India progresses quickly into next-generation services. We have seen how easy and cheap access to mobile data has transformed the country. These new services will make the “Internet of Things” (IOT) a reality and offer a whole set of services to India’s large and young population. While India has among the most affordable data prices, it is important that the industry also profits with a degree of competition. India’s reputation as a low-cost market where jugaad rules the roost is not one it should be proud of. Its evolution as an economy will happen with increased consumption and affordability. Telcos have taken a positive move with increased prices recently and the Government has been supportive of this. It is in India’s interest that the telecom industry becomes competitive. This will lead to better services. To promote a single company at the risk of creating a monopoly is not the route we should take. The Supreme Court must take cognisance of this fact. The Narendra Modi Government has stopped “business as usual” and this was bound to lead to situations like this. But this should not be seen as a substitute for policy improvements. At the same time, it is vital that the industry remains viable. We have seen how the real estate sector has collapsed. We cannot afford the telecom sector to go the same way.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/vodagone--2020-02-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/vodagone-.html
12,17-2-20,Re-engineering solutions,"AICTE report on 50 per cent vacancies in engineering colleges shows why we need job-ready courses

Who would have imagined that engineering, the most sought after discipline in India, would lose traction? Or so it seems going by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) report, which says that almost 50 per cent of the available seats in engineering colleges across States are going abegging. This at a time when there has been a spike in overall enrolment in higher education. The crisis is so acute that AICTE has decided not to accept applications for new colleges for two years for the time being. It is not that students aren’t making past the entrance tests, usually considered to be on the tougher side of the scale. The vacancies point to a deeper malaise, that of an inequity in standards of excellence. There is a yawning gap prevailing between the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and general engineering colleges in terms of the quality of instruction imparted and the employability the differing courses guarantee. Even among IITs, there is a difference between the cream centres of excellence and the branch units. As a majority of the other degree courses are not job-linked or designed according to marketability in today’s changed circumstances, and are mostly in the nature of elevating the student on the academic stakes, they have simply lost economic value. And most students, who look at jobs as a return on the investment in education — considering course fees of engineering degrees are expensive — signing up is not worth it. Besides, the massive job cuts of IT professionals and recent trends of even IITians diversifying into financial markets and consulting have been a dampener for aspirants. There can be no denying, therefore, that the BTech/BE degrees have lost sheen over the years. Just a decade ago, when the IT industry was booming and when Indian engineers figured among the most powerful CEOs in the world, the number of aspirants wanting to take the engineering course outpaced the number of seats available in colleges. The education sector was forced to add tens and thousands of seats to professional colleges, which also led to the mushrooming of anonymous colleges in practically every street corner, offering devalued degrees. We may be producing more engineers than the US and China put together but without industry applicability of courses, our engineers lack competencies and do not count among best-in-class software workers from across the world. Except for the IITs and a few NITs, most private engineering colleges have failed to make their students job-ready for lack of an updated curriculum or ignoring the poor student-faculty ratio. Some of these institutions even struggle to place their students. This is the reason why freshly-minted engineers from premier engineering colleges like IITs are still in demand even as others have to wait for years together to get a job.

According to the AICTE data, in 2019, merely six lakh graduates found jobs during campus placements. Between 2015 and 2019, a total of 518 engineering colleges shut down. While the AICTE revises its model curriculum every five years, most colleges prepare their own syllabus while others continue with decades-old programmes. The existing capacity of traditional subjects such as mechanical, chemical, electrical and civil must be expanded and made competitive. With the challenge of automation such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain technology, data science, Internet of Things and cybersecurity among others looming large, we need to redraw the template. And now.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/re-engineering-solutions-2020-02-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/re-engineering-solutions.html
13,17-2-20,Akhilesh alleges threat to his life from BJP leader,"Samajwadi Party chief and former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav, claimed that he was receiving death threats of late, after a youth trespassed security at an event in Kannauj on Saturday.

Yadav was addressing a public meeting when a youth raised the slogan of Jai Shri Ram.

“A youth barged in while I was addressing the public meeting. He was caught by the security personnel and handed over to the police. But the threats that I am getting these days are now confirmed,” Yadav said, questioning the police for the security lapse.

The SP chief lashed out at a police officer on Saturday after a man went near his dais and chanted ‘Jai Shri Ram’.

The former chief minister also tweeted a screen shot of a WhatsApp message he received, allegedly from a BJP leader.

The message says, “Bharatiya Janata Party zindabad, Amit Shah zindabad, Modiji zindabad, and toti chor.”

“A BJP leader has threatened me and I am not going to sit quietly anymore. I have saved the message. The BJP should stop sending their workers to my public gatherings, else we will reply in a similar way,” Yadav said.

“I will hold a press conference soon on this issue in Lucknow. A BJP worker had barged into my event today, he could have possibly taken my life.

14,17-2-20,Minister: Govt making efforts to provide jobs to educated youth,"Uttar Pradesh’s Labour Minister Swami Prasad Maurya said that there were over 33 lakh registered unemployed youth in the state and the Yogi Adityanath government was making efforts to provide employment to the educated youth of the state.

“The Labour department has a dedicated portal. sewayojan.up.nic.in, where the unemployed youth register for employment. As per the figure available, the total number of unemployed youth till February first week stands at 33.93 lakh,” Maurya told a select group of reporters.

“This figure does not present a true picture. There are many people who are employed but are looking for better avenue and they also register their names. There are many others who are working in neighbouring states but are looking for avenues in UP and they also get themselves registered,” he said.

Maurya said that the Bharatiya Janata Party government was committed to providing employment to the educated youth of the state and therefore it had started ‘Rozgar Melas’ across the state where big companies scout for talent.

“Besides, career counselling sessions are also organised where youth are told about possibility of employment across the state,” the labour minister said.

“This government has created an environment of employment following which big companies have started investments in the state. The success of Investors’ Summit in February 2018 and the recent defence expo, DefExpo 2020, have thrown open the gates of employment for the youth,” the labour minister said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/minister--govt-making-efforts-to-provide-jobs-to-educated-youth.html
15,17-2-20,Guv greets famed poet Padmashri Bashir Badr,"Governor Lalji Tandon greeted and congratulated renowned poet Padmashri Bashir Badr at his residence on the latter’s 85th birthday. The Governor presented him with shawl and bouquet.

When Bashir’s wife, Rahat Badr, told him that Lalji Tandon from Lucknow has come to Bhopal as Governor and has come to greet you on your birthday, Bashir ji said with a naive smile “hamare paas ayen hai to hamare hain” (if he has come to us, he is ours). Suffering from dementia, not much remains in the memories of Bashir Badr but when his wife recalled two or three of his famous “sher”, he smiled. Bashir ji, who has lost all his memory, however, does not forget to kiss the hand of anyone who comes to meet him. This is the love in his subconscious mind.

Rahat Badar told the Governor that late Atal ji was a great fan of Bashir Saheb and used to call him Bhadra Saheb. She recalled Bashir ji’s shayari, ease, simplicity and Atal ji at a Mushaira in Lucknow.

This soulful meeting with Badr Saheb took place on the initiative of Lalji Tandon. Governor Tandon said that when I came to Bhopal, I was very eager to meet Bashir Saheb.

Workers engaged by the Ramky Enviro Engineers Limited have alleged that they are being paid between Rs 190 and Rs 220 per day against the minimum wage of Rs 298 as fixed by the State Government.

The workers, who are agitating under the banner of the Bhubaneswar Asthai Safei Karmachari Sangha, accused both the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the agency of depriving them of minimum wage.

“We have urged the BMC authorities and the contractual agency several times to increase our wage to Rs 298, However, our grievance has fallen on deaf ears. We have been forced to stop lifting garbage,” said a sanitation worker.

It may be noted that the civic body has engaged three sanitation agencies, Jagruti Welfare Organisation, Ramky and PMR Consortium, for better management of sanitation in the city. More than 1,200 sanitation workers are working under Jagruti, while 700 under Ramky and 650 are engaged by PMR on contractual basis.

Contractual agencies have, however, alleged that they are not being paid escalation fee by the BMC even as they have already hiked wages of workers two-three times.

“We are paying Rs 224 to each worker against the BMC’s allotment of Rs 150 per worker. Though there is a provision for escalation of rate with respect to labour, fuel, repair, maintenance and replacement components, BMC officials are taking no measures,” said an official of a sanitation agency.

If the sanitation workers continue cease-work agitation, tonnes of garbage would be piled up on roadsides, posing threats of breeding mosquitoes, said a resident of the zone.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bbsr-sanitation-workers-begin-cease-work-stir.html

24,17-2-20,‘Pakeezah’ screened at Bharat Bhavan,"Under the film screening during 38th Foundation Day Anniversary, Bollywood classical saga “Pakeezah” was screened here on Sunday.

Organised at Bharat Bhavan the movie was screened at Abhirang Auditorium. The filmy buffs of the city enjoyed the movie whole heartedly. The film screening evoked a tremendously wonderful response and a lot of art lovers of the city were noticed at the hall watching the movie.

Pakeezah is a 1972 Indian film, written and directed by Kamal Amrohi who was known for his perfectionism.

The film tells the story of a Lucknow tawaif played by actress Meena Kumari who died shortly after the film was completed.

This movie is about Sahibjaan, (Meena Kumari), who is born to a courtesan, Nargis. After being spurned by her lover Shahabuddin's (Ashok Kumar) family, Nargis is driven to a graveyard where she gives birth to Sahibjaan secretly. Nargis dies during childbirth and her sister Nawabjaan (Veena) a brothel madam brings her up as her own. Unable to break away from the vicious circle, Sahibjaan grows up to be a beautiful and popular dancer/singer.

Forest ranger Salim Ahmed Khan (Raaj Kumar), enthralled by her beauty and innocence, eventually convinces her to elope with him, which she does. But trials and tribulations await Sahibjaan as she is recognized by men wherever she goes in the company of Salim. When Salim renames her Pakeezah (pure of heart) and takes her to a priest to be legally married, she refuses and returns to the brothel. Salim eventually decides to marry someone else and invites Sahibjaan to dance at his wedding; she agrees. During this event, Nawabjaan recognises Shahabuddin and calls him to witness the irony of the situation: It is his own daughter dancing and entertaining his family.

The screening was a mere pleasure for the filmy buffs of the city as they rejoiced the magic of Meena Kumari once again on a big screen.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---pakeezah----screened-at-bharat-bhavan.html

40,17-2-20,Odisha needs to close nutrition gap for tribals,"At a time when Odisha is being hailed as a champion of nutrition, there is a constant pressure on the State to perform better and to be counted among the top States which have nutrition on top of their agendas.

The political leadership is beginning to understand that there are many vulnerable groups in Odisha which need special attention. These include the particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs) who live in remote locations. Being a member of the Legislative Assembly from Pallahara in Angul district, I understand the challenges that are faced by these communities. The biggest challenge is topography of the area, which makes access to an Anganwadi Centre difficult. In addition to this, there is also lack of awareness.

Statistics also prove the need for special focus on the tribal communities. As compared to the rest of the children in Odisha, 46 percent of children from tribal communities under five years of age are stunted and half of them are underweight. Thus they require more attention and there is a need for specific interventions to ensure we close the gap on the nutritional needs of all the children and women in Odisha.

There are many notable interventions which are happening at a small scale, with a special focus on the tribal communities that can be replicated across the State.

One such example exists in Angul district. A community-led movement by the name of Angul Pusti Adhikar Abhiyan (APAA) has created a model which can be scaled up not just by the State of Odisha but by many other States too.

The APAA, community members, Anganwadi workers, Child Development Project Officer (CDPOs), District Social Welfare Officer (DSWO), District Collector (DC) and elected representatives like MPs and MLAs have come together to create this replicable and sustainable model to ensure nutrition is the top priority in the district of Angul.

Communities, which have been made aware of their rights due to the APAA’s interventions, have managed to inspire frontline workers like Anganwadi Workers to perform their duties well. The movement has worked on the monitoring of schemes too. All the members have come together to activate existing Government monitoring committees like Jaanch and Matru committees which monitor Government schemes like Integrated Child Development Services.

Another APAA initiative to inspire local leaders like Sarpanch to take the lead to declare their villages ‘Malnutrition-free’ has resulted in applications being filed by Sarpanch to establish mini AWCs in far-flung areas, especially tribal-dominated ones like Pallahara.

Self-help groups have also contributed their bit in this Jan Andolan or people-led movement by cooking hot cooked meals for children who were not able to access an AWC at the village level. More than 1,300 children between the ages of 3-6 years have benefitted because of this in four blocks of Angul district.

Thus, an effort from the State Government’s side to leverage these local examples will not only benefit the tribal community but also establish Odisha as a leader in matters of nutrition in the country.

41,17-2-20,State battles connectivity woes in Maoist-hit areas,"Slow in sanction and delay in installation of mobile towers in Maoist-affected areas of the State has left the Odisha Government worried as connectivity in these areas has become a major problem for the security forces and district administrations.

While the Odisha Government has requested for mobile towers for 1,000 locations in the Red corridors, the Union Government has sanctioned for only 158 locations in phase II.

The Ministry of Telecommunications (MoT) has been repeatedly urged by the State Government to speed up sanction and installation of mobile towers in the Left Wing Extremist (LWE) affected districts. However, the MoT is moving at a snail’s pace, which has resulted in poor connectivity in the Maoist- hit areas.

With establishment of Gurupriya bridge, road connectivity has improved a lot and now the State administration has scaled up police presence and expedited developmental activities in the cut off areas.

But people in the cut off areas are demanding mobile connectivity as it is very poor and people are moving up to trees to talk in their mobile phones. Some of them are also scaling up hill tops to use their cell phones as there is hardly any mobile towers in the vicinity.

In Phase I Connectivity Programme, 253 mobile towers were installed and those towers are having low radiating antennas with poor bandwidth. There is virtually little or no data facility available in the covered areas of the mobile towers. Consequently, setting up of the mobile towers has defeated their very purpose, admitted officials in Malkangiri

district.

Latest official statistics revealed that tele density of all India level is 90.34 per cent, while Odisha is having 75.05 per cent coverage. Over 11,000 villages are out of mobile connectivity and it continues till date as sanction and setting up of mobile towers has taken a back seat in the State.

The State Government has requested the MoT for deployment of additional resources in the tele density deficit State so that there will be improvement in mobile connectivity. The Union Government can utilize Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) for Odisha as it requires more coverage in less time, sources said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-battles-connectivity-woes-in-maoist-hit-areas.html

44,17-2-20,Jajpur brassware artisans face livelihood crisis,"The popular brass cottage industry of Atalapur, Samantapur, Laxminagar, Kundapatana, Balipatana and other villages in Jajpur district is presently facing a major challenge to sustain itself following a sharp erosion in the demand for its products in the market.

The brassware cottage industry is an important part of the handicrafts and cottage industry of the State and is known for its unmatched range of brass antiques and brass decorative items.

Over 400 Kansari families, engaged in the well-known brass industry of these villages till recently are confronted with the biggest dilemma of their livelihoods. They have to choose between loyalty to traditional profession and survival. These families are struggling to survive due to popularity of stainless steel utensils and other modern synthetic kitchenware.

And, thus, for the last couple of decades, the local brass industry is facing a gradual decline, said Nakul Kumar Sahoo (42) of Kundapatana.

""No new orders are coming, and even our old goods are just dumped in the storehouses,"" said Pabana Sahoo, an artisan of Samantapur.

The brass dealers and traders said the cheap exports from China were flooding the markets and denting their sales.

""Lack of adequate Government support to the brass industry here has ruined brassware crafts persons lives. It has become very challenging to carry on making brass products in prevailing conditions,"" said Manoj Sahoo, a local craftsmen.

""These families are gradually giving up their traditional craft of moulding brass utensils and other items. Today, the brass craftsmen are limited to just 80 families. There were around 200 families engaged in the brass business two decades back. But, gradually, it has started declining ,"" said Narayan Sahoo (60) an artisan of Laxminagar. Many of the Kansaries , who were earlier a part of the cottage industry, have taken up other professions. But there was a time when the cottage industry of moulding brass utensils was viewed as an integral part of the life of Kansari community in these areas. A major reason attributed to the downfall of the cottage industry is the lack of funds and required machineries which have added to the worsening situation. Craftsmen believe their industry can survive only if it has Government support.

""We need some assistance in terms of finance and machineries for its revival and modernisation,"" said Prakash Sahoo.

Two brass and bell cooperative societies which once catered to the needs of the artisans have now become defunct. The authority is not taking any steps to revive the society, lamented Tikina Sahoo, an artisan. There are some workers who have survived the fluctuations in the demand. They make gift articles, like flower vases , from small ones to fairly large ones, photo frames and ornamental buntings for threshold, said sources.

Thanks to the popularization of Vastu Shastra in the urban areas, many persons now purchase brass made bells, idols of Laughing Buddha, turtles, frogs, dragons and other items prescribed under the Shastra.

""Not that the business has been extraordinarily good. But we are doing relatively better because we work on orders and sell them directly and do not depend upon the traders, ""said Mohan Sahoo, an artisan.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jajpur-brassware-artisans-face-livelihood-crisis.html

46,17-2-20,Modi Govt taking away rights of STs,"In the backdrop of an Apex Court ruling that States are not bound to provide reservation in appointments or promotions, the Haryana Congress on Sunday held a protest, accusing the Narendra Modi Government of attacking rights of the STs/SCs and OBCs.

The Supreme Court had given the judgment last week, upholding the contention of the Uttarakand BJP Government.

The protest was led by state Congress president Kumari Selja, who alleged that the Constitution of the country and its principles are constantly under attack by the BJP government.

“Once again, the BJP has attacked the fundamental right of reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and backward classes,” she said during the protest in Yamunanagar.

The Rajya Sabha MP accused the BJP and the RSS of conspiracy to end reservation. They have betrayed the people who belong to the SC, ST and backward classes, she said, slamming the BJP Government.

Selja said that the RSS and BJP had time and again demanded to review and end the reservation in jobs. Earlier, the demolition of 500 years old Guru Ravidas Temple and cancelling the law having provision of saving the reserved categories from oppression, are a part of this sinister conspiracy, she added.

She further said that the Congress party had enacted the Atrocities Act and when she was Social Justice and Empowerment Minister in the Union Government. But when BJP Government came into power, it did not take up the matter seriously in the Supreme Court due to which it was cancelled. After this, Congress party started protest and Government had to introduce an Amendment, Selja said.

She also said that her party will fight against the anti-people policies of the Government.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/modi-govt-taking-away-rights-of-sts-scs--obc--kumari-selja.html
47,17-2-20,Police unearths cross border links,"Investigation by the Punjab Police in narcotics cases following the arrest of a dreaded gangster Sukhpreet Singh Dhaliwal alias Budha has revealed links of the other gangsters to the nexus leading to Pakistan.

Days after the Punjab Police claimed to have arrested 23 criminals and seized 36 weapons on the basis of interrogation of Budha, who was arrested by the Interpol in Armenia some six months back, the Punjab Police on Sunday maintained that the probe into the drugs trail during Budha’s interrogation have exposed further links of Jagdeep Singh alias Jagga (Billa) and Gurvinder Singh alias Pehalwan, who were arrested three days ago, revealing a powerful nexus of the big fish leading to Pakistan links.

The police maintained that Pakistan SIM cards have been recovered from the duo, both residents of Kot Dharam Chand Kalan village of Tarn Taran district.

Billa and Pehlwan, who were arrested in a joint operation of the Organized Crime Control Unit (OCCU) and SAS Nagar Police, have been booked under Section 21 of Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substance (NDPS) Act at Kharar city police station for possessing one kg heroin.

“The investigations into the racket, in which around two dozen big fish have been apprehended so far, are led by DSP Bikram Brar under the supervision of the State Special Operation Cell (SSOC) AIG Gurmeet Chauhan and ADGP RN Dhoke,” said the police spokesperson.

The spokesperson said that the investigations, so far, have revealed that the duo, who had been absconding since 2014-15, had received large quantity of heroin and fake Indian currency from Pakistan.

They had been wanted by the Directorate Revenue Intelligence, Rajasthan Police and Punjab Police in cases related to receiving huge consignments of heroin from Pakistan. Both Jagga and Pehalwan had evaded arrest for the past five years by operating their own Dhillon Transport Company with a route spanning New Delhi to Madhya Pradesh.

They had reportedly set up their own empire with the drug money and had purchased a new house at Makhu in Ferozepur, along with five new trucks bought from New Delhi.

They had also purchased about four acres of agricultural land at Kot Dharam Chand village in Tarn Taran. Investigations have revealed huge money transactions in their bank accounts, said the spokesperson, adding that the initial interrogation of the men revealed that they received drug money transferred by Pakistan dealers through Hawala.

Jagga had been involved in cross-border smuggling of heroin since 2008, when he first started using Pakistan SIM cards too. The same year, he came in contact with Pehalwan, and later connected with Abad Ali alias Baadi of Pakistan.

Jagga received the drug consignments from Jecka Pehalwan and Abad Ali, both Pakistanis, in the area of villages Rajetal and Mahawa drain near Attari border by using Pakistan SIM cards, which were functional in this region. He also used to procure drug consignment from Pak-resident Bodi Lamma, near Fazilka-Ferozepur border.

Spokesperson said that Jagga came in contact with one Malik, resident of Narwad village of Pakistan, in 2015, and had been receiving huge consignments of drugs from Pakistan from him since then.

Jagga received most of his drug consignments from Pakistan through Ravi river and from the fencing in the plastic tubes. He used Alto, Lancer, Swift, Truck and Tata Sumo vehicles of his associate Mahinder Singh alias Minda for transportation the drugs.

In Tata sumo, he had made hidden boxes below the rear seat to conceal the drugs. The drug money was transferred to Pakistan dealers through Hawala.

After he was arrested twice in NDPS cases, Jagga started using WhatsApp on an international number. He was initially arrested in a Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) case of 13 kg heroin registered in 2009. He was convicted to 10 years imprisonment in 2011 in this case, but jumped the parole in 2014.

He was again arrested by DRI in a 42 kg heroin case in January 2015. He fled from the police custody during his court appearance at Tarn Taran in this case in October 2015 and was absconding since then.

Incidentally, his father Gurdev Singh was also sentenced to 11 years imprisonment in a drug case in 2005. He got parole and jumped the parole in 2014 and is still absconding.

Pehalwan, a cousin of Jagga, had been absconding since 2014 in a case of 10 kg heroin seizure. To evade arrest, he had changed his appearance and had started tying a turban.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/police-unearths-cross-border-links.html
48,17-2-20,Cong takes dig at Badal’s ‘belated awakening’ on CAA,"Punjab Congress on Sunday took a dig at Punjab’s former Chief Minister and Akali Dal patron Parkash Singh Badal over his “belated awakening” about the ill-effects of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

“It is strange that while the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) voted in favour of the CAA and supported its passage in both the Houses of Parliament, the senior Badal has now started crying hoarse over it

saying that the citizenship should be open to people of all religions,” said senior Congress leader and Punjab Jails and Cooperation Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa.

However, there is no “awakened conscience” in Badal as it had died in him long before, Randhawa said, adding, “It is actually a statement of convenience as he and his party has been ignored and sidelined by the BJP and now they are trying to use the CAA to seek attention from their masters (BJP leaders)”.

The Minister challenged Badal that if he was really serious and concerned about the divisive nature of the CAA, he can ask his daughter-in-law to resign from the Cabinet.

“Or at least write a letter of protest to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi questioning the unconstitutional nature of the CAA,” he asked Badal, while adding, “otherwise, it will be reaffirmed that you are making random statements to derive some political bargain from the BJP”.

Randhawa said the Badals have changed their stand on CAA so frequently depending on the situation at the particular moment. “First when it suited them, they supported the CAA in the Parliament, and now they think opposing it will suit them more,” said Randhawa.

At the same time, Randhawa advised the SAD leader to retain consistency in his stand and statements about such a crucial matter that concerns the secular ideal of the Indian democracy.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-takes-dig-at-badal---s----belated-awakening----on-caa.html
49,17-2-20,Mahashivratri beckoning devotees in Mandi,"The temple town of Mandi, with its pristine grandeur is beckoning tourists and Shiva devotees from across the world for the festival of ‘Mahashivratri’.

Mandi, situated on the banks of Beas is the land where Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists monks and saints had meditated for centuries.

The ‘Mahashivratri fair’ will be formally inaugurated by Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur on February 22 and celebrated in accordance with traditional religious fervor and fanfare.

The Chief Minister will first go to the temple of Bhootnath to pay obeisance and then proceed to temple of Madho Rai to whom the sovereignty has been vested since the rule of Surya Sen, who ruled Mandi from 1664 to 1679.

According to the history of Mandi, all the 18 sons of the king died during his life time. He, therefore, vested his kingdom to Madho Rai ( Lord Vishnu ) and the Raja was a mere his agent.

The practice is still continuing. After Independence, the place has been taken over by the Chief Minister, who gives the same reverence to Madho Rai.

After the pooja of Madho Rai, a massive Shobha Yatra, headed by Madho Rai, Gods and Goddesses, elite of the towns, officers wearing colored turbans , bureaucrats, women and children wearing multi coloured costumes take out a procession in the town from district Secretariat to the sprawling Paddal Stadium, the venue of the International Shivratri Fair.

Over half of the vast stadium is covered with Shivratri exhibition, where attractive and educational stalls from India and abroad are set up to acquaint visitors with the latest technological advances made by the scientists.

The history of the present Mandi town is also interesting. Long back, Mandi town was located on the right bank of Beas and the present Mandi town was a grassland where cattle used to graze.

A farmer was astonished to observe that his newly calved cow was not yielding the desired milk. He then observed that the cow was pouring her milk on a particular stone.

The news spread across the town like a forest fire and also reached the king who personally witnessed this.

In the meantime the Raja saw Lord Shiva in a dream who ordained him to dig beneath the stone. He was astonished to find a large-size stone image of Lord Shiva.

This happened during the fairs of Shivratri. The joy of Raja knew no bounds. He prolonged the fairs for a month and decided to build a marvelous temple of Lord Shiva on the spot where the stone image of Shiva had been found

buried.

Today, the same image of Lord Shiva is adorned in the Temple of BhootNath at the heart of Mandi where thousands of people pray to the Lord.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mahashivratri-beckoning-devotees-in-mandi.html

51,17-2-20,Sthitapragya — The Perfect Sage,"Sthita means steady and pragya means wisdom. Sthitapragya refers to a person of steady wisdom, the one who has experienced the truth from within.

Bhagavad Gita in some of the shlokas from 2.54 to 2.72 has described the characteristics of a person of steady wisdom. It has been explained as to what are the attributes of such an evolved soul, who is firmly situated in the divine consciousness. How does he conduct himself.

It has been stated that he who withdraws his senses from their objects in every respect, he who having brought all his senses under full control fixes his consciousness on the Supreme Lord, he who is without any kind of affection ; and who is neither delighted nor dejected by good or evil - intelligence of such a devoted person is firmly set in wisdom.

He whose mind remains unperturbed in the midst of sorrows, who does not get excited amid pleasures ; and who is free from attachment, fear and anger - such a person is called a sage of settled intelligence.

Even while abstaining from sense enjoyments, the taste for them may still remain. Even this taste vanishes, when the Supreme is seen. In other words, a realised soul obtains not merely an outer abstention but also inner renunciation. He remains in full control, not only of the body but also of the mind.

When one gives up all the desires of his mind and when his soul is content in itself, he is then called a man of steady wisdom, sthitapragya.

To summarise, in these shlokas Krishna has stressed upon control of the senses, equanimity of the mind, conquest of fear and anger, freedom from attachment, tempering of the passion ; and fixing the consciousness on the Supreme Lord. When such a person remains content in himself, then he is called a sage of steady wisdom.

Such a sthitapragya sage is not a slave of the senses. He is indifferent to the taste of the senses. He neither loves nor hates them. He controls them, through the power of his mind. He is, thus, his own master.

The above description does not mean that there is no charm in the life of such a person of steady wisdom. On the other hand, such a developed soul enjoys the life more because he finds joy from within. His happiness is long lasting because it does not depend upon outside objects or external circumstances.

He is cheerful internally because he is liberated from the strangulating grip of the ever expanding desires. He is never disappointed because he never covets anything. He is not jealous of anyone. He is freed from the troubles of earthly existence because he lives the life of disinterested service. He is never plagued by anxiety and depression because he has learnt the art of maintaining psychological equilibrium in all situations.

He does not hanker after pleasures. He gratefully accepts whatever comes his way, without excitement and without any complaint. But the grateful acceptance is not the same thing as passive acceptance. It does not mean that one should not make efforts to get what is one’s due. Krishna did not ask Arjuna to accept whatever was offered to him. Rather he exhorted him to fight for his right. But at the same time, Arjuna was advised to always remain aware of his true nature. He was asked to fight without attachment ; and with a calm and equanimous mind. He was taught as to how one can be free from grief.

A question is often asked as to whether the ideals described in the above shlokas can be of any real relevance in day to day life of a common man. Is it humanly possible to achieve such a state of mind, even while remaining physically and mentally active, in this world of fierce competition ? The answer to this question is to be found in Gita itself wherein it is stated that only very few people are able to achieve perfection. Still the standards set in the Gita are worth emulating. No effort on this path ever goes waste. Degree of success corresponds to the amount of effort made.

The teachings of Gita are applicable equally to everyone ; whatever be his profession, vocation or situation in life.

When one has an equanimous mind, is free from fear and anger, is endowed with patience, remains content in himself ; and whose mind is focussed, whose senses are under control and who is led not by impulses but by considered opinion - such a person of illumined intelligence is most likely to succeed in whatever he does. When such an attitude becomes spontaneous in one’s life, he moves from hopelessness to hope. He moves from distress to delight.

When one gains steady wisdom, he understands that the cycle of life and death goes on infinitely. What is important is as to what is one’s attitude towards life. What is his contribution towards its betterment.

To conclude, sthitapragya is a sage who has risen above the never ending desires and is firmly set in the divine consciousness. That state of being may be difficult to achieve. But the principles laid down in Bhagavad Gita, in this regard, are universally applicable. Anyone who follows them even partially can benefit immensely. He can lead a much more satisfying and meaningful life.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sthitapragya-----the-perfect-sage.html
52,17-2-20,Punjab DGP launches ‘Appreciate and Commend’ scheme for police officials,"To boost the morale of police officers who work exceptionally and diligently, Punjab Director General of Police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta has launched a monthly “Appreciate and Commend” scheme to recognize ‘Punjab Police Performers’ of the month.

“This initiative is launched during the high level meeting of the top brass of the Police at Punjab Police Academy (PPA), Phillaur, on Friday and 15 police personnel, including three women Sub-Inspectors, were honoured with the DGP’s Commendation Disc,” said Gupta adding that the awardees included two Inspectors, six Sub-Inspectors, three Assistant Sub-Inspectors, one Head Constable, and three Constables.

DGP said that their performance had been rated outstanding in various policing areas, such as action against terrorists and gangsters, arrest of Proclaimed Offenders, large number of NDPS recoveries, property forfeiture in NDPS cases, spreading drug awareness, investigation of sensitive cases, Community Policing initiatives, Police Station management, among others.

The aim behind the scheme was to recognize the outstanding and professional work being done by many Punjab police personnel during the course of their duties and to motivate the rank and file of the force of the border state, which faces immense security challenges, he said.

The State police chief hoped that the Scheme would go a long way in motivating the police personnel to further excel in their profession by giving outstanding performance.

Gupta said that he planned to make this initiative into a monthly feature and would personally interact with the awardees and also host a lunch for them at the Punjab Police Headquarters in Chandigarh.

Nominations will be sought from the Police chiefs of various districts by the 25th of every month, and these will be screened by a Committee comprising senior Police Officers from the headquarters and the field. The names would be announced by the fifth of every month.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-dgp-launches----appreciate-and-commend----scheme-for-police-officials.html
53,17-2-20,Cultural significance and health benefits of the Paan Patta,"The tradition of eating Paan originated in India before it became popular in other Asian countries. Travel anywhere in India and you might come across a paan shop selling this age old traditional item.

Paan is made from betel leaves (paan patta) filled mainly with chopped areca nuts (supari), slaked lime (chuna), catechu (red katha paste), fennel (saunf), sweetened and mashed rose petals (gulkand) and elaichi (cardomom) among other items.

Though its primary purpose is to be used as a mouth freshner, many people also use it for the numerous health benefits it provides. According to Ayurveda, the betel leaf is full of medicinal properties. The regular consumption of betel leaf helps balance Vata and Kaph doshas of the human body.

Chewing betel leaf stimulates the release of saliva that further helps in digestion of food. It has anti- microbial properties that can protect the consumer from minor bacterial and fungal infections. It is really good for people suffering from diabetes as it can regulate their glucose levels. It lowers your cholesterol and protects your heart. Depression is a serious condition that affects many people. One of the most important herbal remedy for this condition is to chew betel leaves.

Betel leaves play an important role in Indian tradition, customs and rituals. It is believed that Lord Shiva and Parvati themselves had sown the seeds of paan patta in the Himalayas. According to Skanda Purana, the betel leaf was obtained by the gods during the churning of the ocean for the nectar of immortality- Amrit.

That is why it is believed that the different deities and planets such as lord Indra, goddess Saraswati, Shiva, Shukra, Vishnu, goddess Parvati and lord Suryanarayan reside in the leaf. In the Ramayana, it is mentioned that the time when Hanuman reached Lanka to convey the message of Rama, Sita welcomed him with a garland of betel leaves to express her happiness and gratitude. That is why people offer betel leaves too while worshipping lord Hanuman.

According to the Indian tradition, a combination of betel leaf and areca nuts is inseparable as they symbolise loyalty in love and a strong bond.

Thus, it is a tradition to chew a paan when the tilak ceremony of groom is done in traditional Indian weddings. It means that the newly wedded couple is now compatible to each other just like the betel leaf and areca nut. However, chewing paan can also be slightly addictive. But the addiction here is to the tobacco in it and not the leaf itself.

There is a risk of developing oral cancer if you eat paan with tobacco too often. Even though betel leaves have health benefits, they should be used in a limited quantity.

54,17-2-20,Thousands of fruit tree saplings planted in Saklana,"Thousands of fruit trees were planted in the Saklana range of Tehri district on Sunday. Along with the locals and environmentalists, the ambassador of Sweden to India, Klas Molin also attended the plantation event organised with the involvement of Earth Day Network and One Tree Planted.

Speaking on the occasion, the Swedish ambassador said that Sweden and India are close partners when it comes to environmental issues. Recalling that about 10 per cent of Sweden’s GDP comes from ‘green gold’, he said that his nation is also particular about ensuring that trees are nurtured and more planted.

Expressing happiness at participating in the tree plantation in Saklana range, Molin said that he would mention this experience too when he goes to meet the king of Sweden in the near future.Meanwhile, tree saplings were planted in the villages of Manjgaon, Kalavan, Uniyalgaon, Haveli, Jaadgaon, Navagaon, Semvalgaon, Maroda, Lamkandai and Hatwalgaon. The saplings included those of apricot, walnut, plum, pear, papaya and lemon. The inaugural ceremony for tree planting was held at Rajkiya Ucchatar Madhyamik Vidyalaya, Manjgaon. From there, the villagers went on to plant these saplings in their farmland and homesteads. The saplings will be nurtured and monitored by social enterprise Sustainable Green Initiative.

“We planted 15,000 trees in this area last year on Vasant Panchami. Encouraged by the excellent survival rate and with the way the people here are taking care of the saplings, here we are, again, working on greening the world, one fruit tree at a time,” said Karuna Singh, the regional director for South Asia and Country Director, Earth Day Network.

Sustainable Green Initiative director Raj Mohan said, “It may sound cliched, but indeed, where there is a will, there is a way. In the land of the ‘tree man’ Vishweshwar Dutt Saklani, the people treat tree saplings like their own children.”

SGI will help the villagers plant and nurture these fruit trees to not only increase the green cover but also provide nutrition and secondary income by selling the fruits. According to SGI’s estimates, each fruit tree gives a quintal or more of fruits from the fourth year onwards.

Even at a marginal market price of Rs 10 per kilogramme, each tree will provide nutritional value or an additional income of Rs 1,000 to the farmer. While helping farmers nurture these saplings into young trees, SGI will stress on the importance of organic farming and help the villagers in taking care of them by not resorting to chemical fertilisers or pesticides.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/thousands-of-fruit-tree-saplings-planted-in-saklana.html
55,17-2-20,Waste-to-energy plant to be built for disposal of RDF,"Due to the insufficient disposal of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) from the solid waste management and recycling plant in Sheeshambada, the authorities are considering the construction of waste-to-energy plant nearby.

The waste management plant produces about 100 tonnes of RDF in a day but considerable quantity of of RDF still remains in the waste management plant of Sheeshambada in spite of its regular disposal.

The project manager of Sheeshambada waste management and recycling plant MA Saify said that in view of this, the Ramky Company is considering the option of constructing a waste-to-energy plant near the Sheeshambada plant or close to the city so that RDF can be disposed of easily. According to Saify, “RDF is being regularly disposed by us but due to the lack of cement factories and waste-to-energy plant in Dehradun or elsewhere in the state, the RDF produced in the plant is not disposed completely. This is the reason why the company is considering to set up a waste-to-energy plant nearby so that full disposal of RDF can be done within the city.”

Saify also talked about the production of RDF and compost in the plant. According to him, compost and RDF are being produced from the garbage which is collected by Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) from the city and dumped in the plant at Sheeshambada. After the garbage is unloaded in the plant, it is thoroughly segregated so that the materials for making RDF and compost can be set apart. Talking about the disposal of compost and RDF, Saify said that around 20 tonnes compost is generated in a day which is supplied to the enterprises like Krishak Bharati Cooperative Limited (KRIBHCO) and to the local farmers as per the requirement so that they can use the organic manure for agriculture whereas RDF is supplied to cement plants and waste-to-energy plant as per the demand.

Recently, the protesting locals of Sheeshambada alleged that Ramky Company had dumped heaps of manure and garbage into a trench inside the waste management plant which will have a detrimental effect on the groundwater in the area. However, the project manager has refuted these allegations.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/waste-to-energy-plant-to-be-built-for-disposal-of-rdf.html
56,17-2-20,Action taken against hospitals for violating PCPNDT Act,"One hospital was sealed and action was taken against another hospital for violation of PCPNDT and other relevant acts here on the weekend.

The actions were taken as part of raids conducted by the authorities on the directions of the Nainital district magistrate Savin Bansal who had been receiving complaints regarding private hospitals not providing facilities as per the PCPNDT Act.

The additional chief medical officer (ACMO) Dr Rashmi Pant and her team raided the Sparsh hospital and infertility clinic and the Vivekanand Hospital. According to Dr Pant, during inspection at the Sparsh hospital, the establishment could not provide any documentation of its registration with the pollution control board as required under the Clinical Establishment Act. There was no drug license available at the hospital’s medical store which also lacked a refridgerator for safely storing medicines. Further, the establishment did not have IVF registration under the PCPNDT Act.

The hospital management could not provide any document to show the training of the staff members. Documents regarding establishment of the hospital were not available even as there was no fire exit plan. Considering these irregularities, the team sealed the hospital on the spot.

The ACMO further informed that the registration of Vivekanand hospital under PCPNDT Act had been cancelled due to its ultrasound machine not being found at the designated place.

the said machine was also sealed by the officials. Members of the PCPNDT committee were also present during the raids.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/action-taken-against-hospitals-for-violating-pcpndt-act.html
57,17-2-20,Sanctuary Asia awardees honoured by BTDT,"Conservationists and Sanctuary Asia awardees Arun Gour and Taukeer Alam were felicitated by noted author Ganesh Saili at a programme organised by the citizens walking group Been There Doon That (BTDT) here on Sunday. The duo was felicitated for their outstanding work in the field of conservation of nature and wildlife in the state.

Alam, who belongs to the Van Gujjar community is a self taught bird expert who grew up near Rajaji National Park and always loved the forest and its wildlife.

While talking about his journey, Alam said that he dropped out from school when he was in class IX and afterwards he started as a cook for Nature Science Initiative’s Soumya Prasad who was conducting research near Rajaji. From there, his journey of becoming a birder started when his observational skills were recognised by his mentors. He also added that after leaving the studies for three years, he started his education again, and currently he is an undergraduate student. “While I was still in the learning phase, I realised that researchers from foreign countries research and write thesis about birds and go away.

What they found in research never actually reached out to the people of the forest or anybody else. So I thought about organising school programmes to inform and educate children about birding and I also become a guide for the people who came to see any particular bird in the area,” added Alam.

Talking about Alam, one of his mentors from Nature Science Initiative, Raman Kumar said, “Whatever Taukeer has achieved till now is all due to his hard work. He is an exceptionally self-motivated person and without any help he has learnt various skills on his own whether it be operating a computer, data entry, or promoting awareness about the environment and its conservation among the people.” Arun Gour is a beekeeper who founded the Devalsari Samiti to nurture a culture of conservation among the people of his community.

He has also supported the forest department by reporting poaching incidents and by helping in tackling forest fires. He also trained many people of the mountainous areas in beekeeping, butterfly walks and homestays which will make them self sufficient as well as avert their migration towards cities.

According to Gour, “It is very important to save the environment and culture of mountainous villages, though it is not easy. In the name of development, hundreds of trees are cut down in the forests of the villages and even if some of us raise voice against it, people don’t like it because according to them we are the obstacles in the way of urbanisation and development of the village. I have also received many threats on this account.” He further said that he is not against the government policies but it should be done without disturbing the balance in the nature. One of the mentors of Gour, Anchal Sodhi from Titli Trust said, “Arun never wanted to migrate but always desired to do something for his village.

He was not in favour of migrating to the city and do a menial job like his fellows in the village. He is an inspiration for all the youth who migrate to cities to get jobs and better life.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sanctuary-asia-awardees-honoured-by-btdt.html

61,17-2-20,Rishikesh Mayor’s remark on Shahi Snan elicits opposition,"The Rishikesh mayor talking about Shahi Snan at Rishikesh during the Kumbh Mela stirred up objections from some members of the religious fraternity. The issue was settled later after the intervention of the cabinet minister and members of the religious fraternity

On the weekend, the Rishikesh mayor Anita Sharma addressed the media and later shared her views on the social media. She said that she had requested the Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and Kumbh Mela administration that there should be a Shahi Snan at Rishikesh too.

In response to this, the administration had approved the Shahi Snans at the places sought, she had claimed. However, this elicited strong objections from some members of the religious fraternity and the Ganga Sabha. The cabinet minister Madan Kaushik had to intervene and pacify the ruffled tempers.

Ganga Sabha general secretary Tanmay Vashisht said that he had come to know from media reports about the Rishikesh mayor talking about a Shahi Snan at Rishikesh during the 2021 Kumbh Mela in Haridwar. Objecting to this, he said that according to the scriptures and religious beliefs, Kumbh Mela is organised only in four places.

And in Haridwar, this event takes place only at Har ki Paidi Brahmakund because the drop of nectar –Amrit is believed to have fallen at Har ki Paidi. For centuries, the Shahi Snans of all the Akhadas and followers of Sanathan Dharma have been taking the holy dip during the Kumbh Mela as per traditions. No one has the right to play with the Sanatan faith. If any person or the government itself plays with the faith, then it will be strongly opposed, he said.

Vasishth further said that the the date and place of Shahi Snan is decided by the Ganga Sabha and Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP). The State Government and Mela administration are responsible only for manging the crowds and events, he added.

The ABAP president Narendra Giri said that apart from Har ki Paidi Brahmakund, it is not possible to take a Shahi Snan anywhere else during the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rishikesh-mayor---s-remark-on-shahi-snan-elicits-opposition.html

“We will meet the Superintendent of Police (SP), Traffic on Monday and will discuss about the assurances given by the department to e-rickshaw drivers. If they allow them on the main roads on a trial basis even for one week, we will go on a strike,” said one of the members of VASSM, Vijay Vardhan Dandriyal.

According to him, police has no right to allow the protesting e-rickshaw drivers to operate on the main roads by ignoring the gazette notification issued by the state transport department. If the department will permit the e-rickshaw drivers due to political pressure then unions of auto, bus, vikram, and tata magic will protest against it, he said.

Meanwhile, talking about one week trial of e-rickshaws on the main roads, one of members of Devbhoomi E-rickshaw Welfare Society said, “We met SP, Traffic on Saturday and he assured us that one week trial will be done to check the feasibility of operating the e-rickshaws on the main roads.

We are allowed to run the rickshaws on all the main roads though the entry is still restricted on the main roads from 1 pm to 3 pm and from 5 pm to 7 pm.

They have not accepted all our demands and the talks are still in progress but for now at least we got some positive response from the department,” he added.

The e-rickshaw union member further said that e-rickshaws started operating on the main roads from Sunday and for now their protest has been suspended by the drivers.

What are the issues being raised by the people in your constituency? What did you instruct to the officials concerned?

Our Constituency which is a part of Hisar Lok Sabha constituency is a rural constituency having an estimated SC population of 26.83 per cent. Being a minister of the State, the expectation of people of my constituency has been very high and will try my best to live up to the expectations of the people. As a minister of State, I will also work hard on improving the delivery for the intended beneficiaries. The officials have been asked to complete ongoing projects and people to be consulted in the draft of the plans or schemes for the constituency.

Your party had promised to build Ravidas temple during election. Now the Chief Minister has declared it. Your comment

According to the ‘Jan Seva Patra’ (manifesto) issued by the JJP in the assembly elections, the BJP-JJP coalition Government of the State has taken a big decision on the promise of building big temple of Sant Ravidas ji in Kurukshetra district. I am happy that now the State Government is going to build the temple. This temple will be the largest saint Ravidas’s temple in the world and for this, the State Government has decided to give five acres of land.

Do you think unemployment is a big issue before the Government?

The State Government is working hard to provide maximum employment to the youth and we are serious about this. Efforts are being constantly made to provide employment to youth either in Government or private sector.

Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala have recently announced to implement 75 per cent jobs for local youth in the private sectors.

The employment fair was organised in January month in Hisar by the Employment Office. More than 35 companies participated in this fair. Youths from 18 to 40 years attended considerable number of them secured job.

You started your political career from Indian National Lok Dal (INLD). Now you are a Minister in BJP-JJP- led coalition Government in the State. How has your political journey been so far?

I was actively involved in politics since my college life. I joined INLD and won the election in 2014. In 2019, I fought on JJP ticket and became a minister. I was made district general secretary of INLD in 1994-95. In 1996, I was also made district yuva general secretary of INLD. In 2000, I was SC Cell State general secretary. I was district INLD general body secretary in 2003-04. Now I am serving the people as a Minister of State.

What are priorities for your constituency?

I have been in touch with people of my constituency and give maximum time to public life. Work for public welfare will continue as I have been doing it after becoming public representatives. Following consistent efforts, in 2016-17, Government College in Ukalana was made. Working for the people and delivery of services to the intended beneficiaries are my priority.

Oppositions say both BJP and JJP fought against each other. Now they have formed coalition Government. They say this coalition would fall under its own weight. Do you think this Government will complete its five years term?

Nothing to comment on opposition leaders but we firmly believe that this Government will complete its five year tenure. There is no threat to this coalition Government as it is being run smoothly in the State. We respect the mandate of the people. Both the parties have decided to form stable Government in the State.

Common minimum programme has been made to fulfill the promises made by both the parties in the form of declaring their manifestos. Promises made by both the parties during the election will be fulfilled. This coalition Government will complete its tenure. Unprecedented development has been done in the 100 days of the coalition Government in the State.

There are many promises which are similar in both the parties. There will not be any problem to execute the promises made by both the parties. During the meeting both the parties have agreed on 33 points mentioned in the manifesto, the announcement of which will be made after the same will be brought to the notice of Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister.

What are your priorities?

I want to ensure everyone’s progress under this Government. The State Government has decided that there should not be any delay in giving legal aid to the people belonging to scheduled caste in case of atrocities against them. An order has been issued to ensure that the hoardings or banners should be installed in scheduled caste settlements to make people aware of their rights.

The Government has directed the officers concerned that they need to ascertain the reasons for the withdrawal or cancellation of the case of atrocities against scheduled caste.

It was also decided that two investigating officers including an officer from scheduled caste and others from the General category, should be appointed while investigating the cases related to the atrocities on them.

How do you evaluate 100 days of your Government?

The prohibition on sale of liqour has been implemented in 872 villages of Haryana. These villages had passed the resolution in the Gram Sabha for the closure of liquor contracts.

In the last 100 days, the present State Government launched new projects for the welfare of people and development of the State. Besides it has also accelerated the pace of ongoing development works and prepared the future road map. A decision has been taken to ensure reservation of 75 per cent jobs to unskilled workers of Haryana in the industries of the State.

Apart from this, provision of reservation has been made for Scheduled Castes Students in Post Graduate Courses in Medical Colleges of the State.

To provide social security benefits to eligible families of the State, our Government launched “Mukhyamantri Parivar Samridhi Yojna”.

The Pradesh Congress Committee president Pritam Singh and leader of opposition Indira Hridayesh said this while addressing a Press conference at the Congress Bhawan here on Sunday. The State Government under chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat will complete three years in office next month. In this context, the PCC president Pritam Singh said that influenced by the pleasing promises made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the people of Uttarakhand had elected the BJP to office with a strong majority in the 2017 Vidhan Sabha elections. Out of the 70 seats in the assembly, the BJP had won from 57 seats. Singh opined, “However, contrary to the expectations of the public, the State government has spent its three years in office executing works which are detrimental to the interests of the public.

The government has failed in executing development works with the chief minister failing to present any vision of his for this. The developmental works initiated by the previous Congress government were also stalled by the current government. At the same time, unemployment is on the rise even as employed youth are being terminated from their jobs. The government has no control over price rise. Apart from this, by bringing in the Devsthanam Act, the state government is tampering with the traditions of religious places,” alleged the PCC chief.

The leader of opposition in the Vidhan Sabha said that the state’s economy is now in dire straits. She said, “The government does not have enough funds to pay the salaries of employees and pensions. The government is taking loan from the market for this purpose. The Laltain Yatra of the Congress will be held in every Vidhan Sabha constituency to throw light on the failures of the state government on various fronts,” she said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-to-start-state-wide-laltain-yatra-today.html
72,17-2-20,"Talk of leadership change party’s internal matter, says PCC chief","While senior Congress leader and former Chief Minister Harish Rawat fuelled further speculation on rumours about change in the leadership of the State Government, the PCC chief Pritam Singh opined that this is an internal matter of the party in office. Singh also gave a diplomatic reply on the issue of reservation in promotions.

It will be recalled that a couple of days ago, Rawat spoke on the social media about instability and uncertainty in the BJP in Uttarakhand. However, when asked about his view on this, Singh said that the Congress is not interested in any possibility of change of political leadership which is an internal issue of the BJP.

Replying to a query raised during the Press conference at the Congress Bhawan, Singh said that if the BJP is considering change in its leadership in the state, the issue is internal to the BJP. The Congress has nothing to do with this issue, he stressed. Referring to Rawat, he said that Harish Rawat is a senior leader with long political experience.

However, he stressed that the Congress will now focus on strengthening its organisation in the state. “The Vidhan Sabha election is slated for 2022 and not much time is left.

Hence, we will focus on strengthening the party from the booth level to the state level. We will decide our programmes and work on making them successful. We will inform everyone about the failures of the BJP state government,” he said.

On being asked about the stand of the Congress on the issue of reservation in promotions, the PCC chief said that the Supreme Court has clarified the situation in its order. The State government has to take a decision as per the orders of the Apex court, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/talk-of-leadership-change-party---s-internal-matter--says-pcc-chief.html

74,17-2-20,Congress campaign just a political gimmick: BJP,"The Bharatiya Janata Party has opined that the Congress’ campaign against the state government is merely a gimmick meant to divert the focus away from its internal strife. Reacting to the Congress declaring its plan to undertake a Laltain Yatra across the state, the BJP State media in-charge Devendra Bhasin said that this is nothing more than a political gimmick. He said, “At present the Congress party is in dire straits with its internal factionalism coming all out in the open. Some leaders of the Congress are talking about a campaign while some others are talking of taking out some Yatra. At the same time, a national level party leader from Uttarakhand states that he is suspended from the Uttarakhand unit of the Congress and is hence going to Assam.”

Referring to the Congress leaders talking about price rise, Bhasin said that all essential commodities are available at proper rates today. The price of cooking gas was raised slightly due to international factors but it is still less than the Rs 900 for which it was available when the Congress was in power. The price of onion which had increased due to natural causes is now almost back to normal. These days, there is no shortage of any commodity nor is any item being black marketed. However, black marketing was rampant during the time of the Congress government.

When it comes to employment, the state government is taking concrete measures. Along with facilitating self-employment, the procedure of appointments in various government departments is also underway, added the BJP State media in-charge.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/congress-campaign-just-a-political-gimmick--bjp.html

The State Government recently announced to hike the dearness allowance (DA) by 5 per cent, besides releasing 10 per cent of the arrear for three lakh Government employees and two lakh pension holders.

It said that of the 60 per cent arrear, the Government had announced to release only 10 per cent while it was silent on the rest 50 per cent. Besides, the DA has been delinked from the basic pay, which has created much uncertainty among the employees, the committee told.

“The Government has also deviated from its policy by going for contractual appointment in rehabilitation scheme in 4th class posts. It also criticized the outsourcing of para medical staff in hospitals and not regularizing hundreds of employees on contractual posting for years despite vacancies. Contractual employees are also deprived of DA and HRA, while those appointed after 2005 have no pension,” said leaders of the committee.

81,17-2-20,JVM-BJP merger against mandate: JMM,"Reacting sharply on merger of former Chief Minister Babulal Marandi’s Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) in Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) on Sunday said that it was against the mandate and Marandi should resign as MLA from Rajdhanwar before joining BJP.

Addressing a Press meet at the party headquarter, JMM General Secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said that as the State Government is investigating all the works started during the tenure of the former governments, it will also investigate the Manhunt scam which happened when Marandi was the CM. “So he fears also that the Government would interrogate him for the matter. It was premonition since a very long time that Marandi would join BJP. After contesting Lok Sabha election in coalition with JMM, Congress and RJD his party contested the State Assembly elections on its own,” he added.

It may be mentioned here that Marandi led JVM contested at all 81 seats in the State Assembly elections and won only three seats. Apart from Marandi, two JVM candidates won their seats - Pradip Yadav from Poraiyahat and Bandhu Tirkey from Mandar. In January, JVM officially announced Tirkey’s expulsion and Pradip Yadav was also expelled by the party on February 5. Expulsion

of both the leaders paved the way for the smooth merger of JVM in BJP.

Bhattacharya alleged that Marandi helped BJP in past also when BJP got only 37 seats in 2014 State Assembly elections and needed four more MLAs for majority in the house of 81 members. “He convinced his six MLAs to merge with BJP as political commodities. This time also when two other MLAs denied merging with BJP then Marandi decided to join BJP alone,” he added

Mocking Marandi for his repeated comments on 10th Schedule of the Constitution of India when Six MLAs of JVM had joined BJP in 2014, Bhattacharya said Marandi should remember his words from 2014.

When asked about the suspension of Additional Director General of Police Anurag Gupta, the party General Secretary said that the party is not taking any step with evil will, it was decision of Election Commission of India (ECI) but the former Government was not following the decision of ECI, this Government is following the decision as everyone has seen the video footage showing how Gupta supported the ruling party and its Chief during the Rajya Sabha elections.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jvm-bjp-merger-against-mandate--jmm.html

85,17-2-20,Govt uphold current reservation policy: SAD,"Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Sunday asked the Congress-led Punjab Government to immediately declare that it would not tamper with the current reservation policy in appointments and promotions in Government service to ensure the fundamental rights of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes communities were safeguarded at all costs.

“The reservation given to the SCs and STs should not be diluted in any way despite a recent judgment of the Apex Court which says States are not legally bound to provide reservation in government jobs and promotions,” said senior SAD leader and Punjab Vidhan Sabha’s former Speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal.

He said that the Punjab Government should make an immediate declaration that it will stick to the current policy vis-à-vis reservation in Government jobs and promotions to dispel the fear that has arisen in the minds of the SC population.

“Simultaneously, we expect the Centre should also intervene in the same way as it did when the Apex Court had diluted the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

Parliament was extended by a day and the status quo was maintained by law. Such affirmative action is needed now also,” said Atwal.

Stating that reservation was a ‘fundamental right’ which had been granted to the SC and ST population under the Constitution, SAD leader said that this had been reiterated by a full bench of the Supreme Court.

Atwal said that reservation, under the Constitution, was an aspect of substantive equality which imposed a duty on States to provide it to those groups who were disadvantaged in different terms.

“SAD is of the firm belief that reservations should be read and interpreted as a part of protections and in the spirit guaranteed in Articles 14, 15, and 16 (4) of the Constitution.

Not doing so would be a grave injustice to the SC community,” he said adding that SAD would do its utmost to ensure this right was not snatched from the SC community.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-uphold-current-reservation-policy--sad.html

The group consists of two legislators, Bandhu Tirkey MLA from Mandar and leader of the legislative party and Poreyahat MLA Pradeep Yadav.

With Yadav and Bandhu Tirkey announcing to merge the party, the ball is in the Speaker’s court as which fraction he will authorised as official group merging with BJP or Congress. JVM chief Babulal Marandi has already announced the merger of the party with BJP on Monday.

Congress MLA from Jamtara, Irfan Ansari was to tender his resignation from post of party working presidents, but he differed his decision at last hour. Ansari talking to media person said, “The day Pradeep Yadav joins Congress, I will tender my resignation from party.”

Ansari, the two-time Congress MLA from Jamtara in Santhal Pargana, had even knocked the door of Congress senior leader Rahul Gandhi expressing his discomfort over induction of Yadav in Congress. Ansari said, “Pradeep Yadav has an RSS background and his entire political career has revolved around criticizing Congress and he is anti-Muslim. He is one of the few leaders in Jharkhand who can never be trusted.”

Ansari also claimed that Yadav is rape accused and his induction in Congress will create a bad impression for Congress party. Months before the last year general election, a worker of Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) had filed a rape complaint against then JVM general secretary and five-term MLA Pradeep Yadav. Yadav at that time was Grand Alliance candidate from Godda the seat which Ansari family had claimed as their traditional seat.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bandhu--pradeep-announce-jvm-merger-with-cong.html
88,17-2-20,BJP hopes to win tribal trust with Marandi’s ‘ghar wapsi’,"The BJP, after the drubbing in the recently-concluded Assembly election, hopes to win the trust of tribals in Jharkhand as a grand welcome awaits former Chief Minister Babulal Marandi back into the party. It is due to the stature of Marandi and the support he still enjoys in tribal community that BJP has decided to give a red carpet welcome to Marandi who along with his supporters will join the party.

The importance of Marandi and his supporters joining the BJP can be gauged from the fact that in the season when there is no election, BJP national president JP Nadda and Union Home Minister Amit Shah are going to reach Ranchi for becoming witness to the grand function. With Marandi’s home coming to party after 14 years, the party aims at once again getting back its tribal vote bank as in last Assembly election the party’s biggest disappointment was in tribal reserved seats. Out of 28 tribal seats in Jharkhand, the BJP won only Khunti and Torpa.

BJP had to face the wrath of tribal resentment as its state president Laxman Gilua and Assembly speaker Dinesh Oraon too lost their election from Chakradharpur and Sisai respectively. In Santhal Pargana where the party had hoped to gain maximum seats the BJP failed to win any tribal seats.

A senior BJP leader requesting anonymity said, “The party has understood that without tribal face the party is not going to consolidate its position in tribal seats. Once Marandi joins BJP he will be given important post and the party will once again reach out to people reposing confidence among tribals.” The leader further said, “As Marandi is accessible and keeps on travelling in remote areas, it is hoped that the party’s connect with the masses may get restored after Marandi’s entry.”

Sources said with Marandi joining BJP there will be two senior tribal leaders in BJP, Arjun Munda in Centre and Marandi in State. As JVM merger with BJP will be grand affair, BJP national general secretary Om Prakash Mathur today visited Prabhat Tara Ground to assess the preparations. Mathur said, “The merger of JVM with BJP will be a grand affair and a historic event. It will change the politics of State.”

Moreover, the merger of JVM in BJP will be a win-win situation for Marandi too. Sources said that for Marandi too it will be rehabilitation for him as despite all efforts his party managed to win only three seats.

Affable, suave and soft in nature, Babulal has been a loyalist of RSS and it seems to have paid him a rich dividend. He was felicitated with the coveted post of first CM of Jharkhand when it became a separate state on November 15, 2000. However, his stint as the CM could not last for a long time and he had to step down on March 17, 2003.

In 2006, Marandi formed his own party and since then he has been trying to find a base in the State.

In 2009, his party won eleven Assembly seats, which were reduced to eight in 2014. In 2019, his party managed to win only three seats.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-hopes-to-win-tribal-trust-with-marandi---s----ghar-wapsi---.html

92,17-2-20,"2 Jamia videos, 2 narratives surface","Social media platforms erupted on Sunday after a CCTV footage of police brutality inside the library of Jamia Millia Islamia went viral. The video is related to the alleged police brutality on the campus on December 15. The 48-minute-long video emerged purportedly showing paramilitary and police personnel beating up students in the library 15. It instantly evoked sharp response from several political leaders, including Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.

Meanwhile, Jamia Millia Islamia administration denied to have issued any video footage related to December 15, 2019 violence. They said that the said video was released by people behind the Jamia Coordination Committee and is being looked into.

However, another video of over two-minute duration was accessed by a section of the media that clearly showed that the miscreants who were part of the large scale violence and vandalism inside and outside of the university campus, entering the library and some of them carrying stones. Those in the video could be seen ushering alleged rioters inside the library and putting up a large study table to block the doors being opened.

Special Commissioner of Police (Crime and Intelligence) Praveer Ranjan said that the video clips were being investigated by the cyber experts and they will take action after the identity of the people seen in the video is established.

The 48-second video, which appears to be a CCTV footage, purportedly shows some seven to eight paramilitary and police personnel entering the Old Reading Hall and beating up students with batons. The paramilitary and police personnel are also seen covering their faces with handkerchiefs.

Reacting to the videos, Jamia Millia Islamia administration clarified that it has not released the new video, which is circulating on social media showing some men in paramilitary and police uniform beating up students in the university's library on December 15.

""It has come to our notice that some video with regard to police brutality in Dr Zakir Husain Library of the Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) is in circulation. This is to clarify that the video has not been released by the university,"" the institute's public relations officer Ahmad Azeem said.

According to the public relations officer, the JCC is spearheading the stir against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens on the Maulana Mohammed Ali Jauhar Road outside the university''s gate number seven.

""This is to clarify that JCC is not an official body of the university. Any communication from JCC should not be taken as version of the university,"" Azeem said. The video was released by the Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC), a group comprising Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) students and alumni. The group was formed after the alleged police brutality on the campus on December 15.

The Jamia Coordination Committee said it received the video from an ""anonymous"" source. It also said the university has shared video footage of the police action in the library with the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), which is probing the episode.

Sharing the video on Twitter, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi said if no action is taken even after the video, then the Government' s intentions will stand exposed. She also accused Union Home Minister Amit Shah and the Delhi Police of ""lying"" that Jamia students were not beaten up inside the library.

""Look at how Delhi Police is blindly assaulting students in the library. A boy is flashing his book but the policeman is continuing to attack him with batons,"" she said in a tweet in Hindi. CPI-M general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the police''s act is ""unconscionable"" and ""unacceptable"".

BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya, however, claimed that the video of purported police brutality at the Jamia Millia Islamia in December also showed that students in the library were actually ""stone pelters"". In a tweet, Malviya tagged the video and claimed that the students in the library were wearing masks and reading shut books. They were ""looking anxiously towards the entrance rather than being relaxed and immersed in studies, which is what a library is meant for"", he said. ""Anatomy of Jamia rioters who tried hiding in the library after a stone pelting session?"" Malviya asked. ""Good of Jamia rioters to self identify themselves. Agencies must use the video as evidence.""

It may be recalled that Jamia Millia, had turned into a battlefield on December 15, 2019 as police entered the campus to look for ''outsiders'' who were reportedly involved in incidents of violence and arson a few metres away from the educational institute during a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

105,17-2-20,Kejriwal — an elected aam aadmi,"Arvind Kejriwal, an unassuming politician has been a trail blazer, ever since he gave up his job from the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) and joined the India Against Corruption movement led by social reformer Anna Hazare. Dressed in oversized shirts and trousers, open toe sandals and with a muffler wrapped around his head and neck, Kerjiwal, a former Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer, soon carved out an image as a leader of the common man. His trademark muffler has even earned him the moniker 'mufflerman'.

The bespectacled bureaucrat who joined the Indian political frame during the Anna Hazare-led Lokpal movement in 2011, took oath of office and secrecy for the third consecutive terms as Delhi Chief M on Sunday.

Kejriwal formed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in 2012 and it stumped Rs everyone after winning 28 seats in 2013 Delhi Assembly election. Kejriwal took on then CM Sheila Dikshit and defeated her by 25 thousand votes from New Delhi Assembly seat. AAP won a landslide in 2015 and decimated its rivals BJP and Congress. While BJP could win three seats, Congress was relegation to a humiliating zero seat.

Kejriwal led AAP stormed back to power in Delhi by winning 62 seats in the 70-member Delhi Assembly. The party's choice of name was in line with the alternative brand of politics it espoused.

However, Kejriwal's efforts to spread the AAP's footprint beyond the national capital have not been successful. His attempt to be seen as a direct challenger to Narendra Modi came a cropper in 2014 when he contested the Lok Sabha elections from Varanasi. He also tried to make an electoral dent in Punjab and Goa in 2017 but in vain. Kejriwal first became Delhi's chief minister in 2013.

Images of him sleeping in his utilitarian Wagon R while staging a sit-in for a Jan Lokpal (ombudsman) wrapped in a cotton quilt in cold winter nights dominated the front pages of newspapers and prime-time news bulletins.

He resigned 49 days after coming to power since the Jan Lokpal Bill could not be tabled in the Delhi Assembly, earning him the 'bhagoda' (deserter) tag. He silenced his critics when he returned to power in 2015 with the AAP winning 67 of Delhi's 70 seats. Kejriwal runs his party with the proverbial iron fist and has learnt to temper his aggression, say people close to him.

He has mellowed since his days as the angry leader on a sit-in, carefully calibrating his political message and refusing to be baited by the BJP which made the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests in Shaheen Bagh the centrepiece of its campaign for the Delhi polls.

During the election campaign, Kejriwal attacked the BJP on several occasions. He was careful, however, to not speak out too clearly on the Shaheen Bagh protests.

Notwithstanding the electoral triumph for the BJP in the May Lok Sabha polls, the IIT Kharagpur graduate managed to anchor a campaign that wooed all sections in the city.

At the start of the campaign, he had announced that his party will run a positive campaign on the basis of the development work done by his government in the last five years. Schemes such as free travel for women in DTC buses, free electricity, installation of CCTV cameras and free water were his party's poll planks.

Dubbed a ""terrorist"" by BJP leaders, Kejriwal said he would leave it to the voters to decide whether they consider him a son of Delhi or a terrorist.

Born on August 16, 1968 in Hisar in Haryana to Gobind Ram Kejriwal and Gita Devi, Kejriwal is a man of simple tastes. He lives with his parents, wife and two children, and is often seen going out for a quiet meal or an occasional film. Both his children -- Harshita and Pulkit -- are also IIT products.

A strict vegetarian who prefers home-made food, Kejriwal married a fellow IRS officer, Sunita. He is known to be an ardent practitioner of Vipassana, and seldom misses his yoga and meditation sessions.

After completing his graduation in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Kharagpur, he joined Tata Steel in 1989. He resigned in 1992 to take up the Union Public Service Commission examination which he cleared to become an IRS officer. He also worked with Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata.

Kejriwal worked with people in slums through an NGO, 'Parivartan', he set up with his confidant Manish Sisodia. His efforts towards the enactment of the RTI Act to empower the poorest citizens of India won him the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Emergent Leadership in 2006.

In February 2006, he became a full-time activist and started another NGO, Public Cause Research Foundation, with his award money as a corpus fund.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/kejriwal-----an-elected-aam-aadmi.html

110,17-2-20,J’khand women tackle menstrual waste with biodegradable pads,"In order to break the taboos associated with menstruation and to encourage adolescent girls and women to use eco friendly sanitary pads, a series of campaigns under ‘Garima Abhiyan’ have been launched across Jharkhand. The initiative which was started in Simdega in December 2018 is now being taken across all the districts of Jharkhand by the education department since December 2019. For ‘Garima Abhiyan’ the district administration collaborated with Nation’s Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (WSSCC) to create awareness about menstrual hygiene and the eco friendly ways of practicing it.

“In Simdega mostly the rural women are involved in the various economic activities and are the main work force. While tackling sanitation, the administration decided to take up personal hygiene especially for the women. As a part of this project awareness among more than 1.25 Lakh people was created. Since sanitary pads are expensive, women were trained on how to make cloth pads. They were also told on how these are reusable and the ways of maintaining proper hygienic conditions,” said former Simdega Deputy Commissioner and present Director Secondary Education, Jharkhand Jatashankar Choudharary.

As a part of this campaign, women in the district of Simdega were given training on how to make sanitary napkins using cloth. For this the district administration collaborated with an Udaipur based NGO- Jatan and trained 100 women on how to make the cloth napkins.

“Menstruation is one of those topics on which apart from men even women shy away from discussing it openly. The main purpose of this campaign is to break the silence and that can only be achieved when the men are also aware about this natural process and are open to discuss it. In the ‘Garima Fauj’, which included locals men also participated in equal numbers. During an awareness campaign, about 3200 people in the district which included both men and women in equal numbers were trained,” said Aspirational District Fellow Satwik Mishra.

Mishra further stated that under this project, workshops in 964 Anganwadi Centre and 500 SHG Centres across all the 450 villages in Simdega district were conducted. Women in the district have formed self help groups that make around 150 biodegradable pads on a regular basis which are sold in the village markets and are called ‘Missi Garima Pds’.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/j---khand-women-tackle-menstrual-waste-with-biodegradable-pads.html

116,17-2-20,Tigress found dead in PTR,"Forest officials have recovered the carcass of a 14-year-old tigress beside road number 2 of the National Park Betla under Palamu Tiger Reserve (PTR).

Sources said the death of the tigress is not due to any poaching but a fight with a bison. Betla Ranger Prem Prasad said the 14 year old tigress was found dead and a bison of the park killed her in a fight that broke out between the two last night.

No senior official could be reached for comments on Sunday. Sources said the location from where the tigress’s carcass was recovered had numerous footprints of bison and the tigress which suggested a fight was one between the two.

National Park Betla has seen many such fights among its occupants but it is the first time that a tigress succumbed to the injuries sustained in a fight with a herbivore animal.

D S Srivastava, who is secretary Nature Conservation Society and a member of the state wild life board, said in the year 1982 -83 then queen tigress of Betla had a fight like this with a bison which died and the Begum lived to enjoy its prey.

Srivastava on his return from Betla said “The dead tigress was 8.6 feet long. It had worn out claws and teeth. It had all the fragility of ageing.”

He said this tigress might have attempted to kill a baby bison which may have led to the fight.

The horn of the bison went 3 inches inside the belly of this tigress resulting in its death, he said, adding that the tigress was burnt with hide and other assets of her body intact.

A team of vet doctors also did a postmortem of the cat.

121,17-2-20,Opp asks Centre to take action against police,"Political leaders on Sunday asked the Centre to take action based on a viral video purportedly showing Jamia students being beaten up by police. While the Congress said if no action is taken, the Government’s intentions would stand expose, Left stated the police’s act is “unconscionable” and “unacceptable”.

BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya, however, said the investigating agencies must use the video as evidence, adding it was “good” of “rioters” to identify themselves.

Sharing the video on social media, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi accused the Home Minister and the Delhi Police of “lying” that Jamia students were not beaten up inside the library.

“Look at how Delhi Police is blindly assaulting students in the library. A boy is flashing his book but the policeman is continuing to attack him with batons,” she said in a tweet in Hindi. “Home Minister and the Delhi Police lied when they said students were not beaten up in the library,” Priyanka said in a tweet in and shared the video.

“If no action is taken even after watching this Jamia video, the Government’s intentions would stand exposed before the whole country,” she said. The 48-second video purportedly shows some seven to eight paramilitary and police personnel entering the Old Reading Hall and beating students with batons.

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said police’s act is “unconscionable” and “unacceptable”. “Every defence of police action on students in universities, offered by Amit Shah, is untrue, misleading and politically motivated. Delhi police comes directly under Modi-Shah and this is how it treats young students studying in a library. Shame,” Yechury tweeted.

BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya the investigating agencies must use the video as evidence.”Students in library with ‘masks’ — Reading from shut books — Looking anxiously towards the entrance rather than being relaxed and immersed in studies, which is what a library is meant for... Anatomy of Jamia rioters who tried hiding in the library after a stone pelting session?” he posted on Twitter.

The University on its part clarified that it has not released the video which is circulating on social media showing some men in paramilitary and police personnel uniform beating up students in the university’s library on December 15.

“It has come to our notice that some video with regard to police brutality in Dr Zakir Husain Library of the Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) is in circulation. This is to clarify that the video has not been released by the university,” the institute’s public relations officer Ahmad Azeem said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/opp-asks-centre-to-take-action-against-police.html
122,17-2-20,NIA finds evidence of terror funding through cross-LoC trade during DySP case probe,"The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has stumbled upon evidence of funding of terror groups through cross-border trade during its probe into the case of Deputy Superintendent of Police Davinder Singh who was caught escorting militants out of Kashmir Valley, officials said on Sunday.

The officials said NIA investigators grilled self-styled commander of the banned Hizbul Mujahideen terror group Syed Naveed Mushtaq Ahmed alias Naveed Babu, who was caught with Singh, about the funding of the organisation and the way they had been in touch with their masters in Pakistan.

The agency has stumbled upon evidence of terror financing through cross-LoC trade during Naveed Babu’s questioning, they said. The NIA had registered a case against unknown people in connection with the trade across the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu & Kashmir in 2016 and carried out raids at trade facilitation centres in Salamabad in Kashmir’s Baramulla district and Chakan-da-bagh in Poonch district of Jammu.

During its probe in the past four years, the NIA had been unable to find the final beneficiary of the money received from traders, the officials said, adding that after Naveed’s questioning the agency had got a vital link.

The officials said that some more people were likely to be picked up for questioning in the case as the probe in the DySP’s case has brought the four-year-old case to focus.

Recently LoC trade organisation president Tanveer Ahmed Wani was arrested by the NIA and was being questioned. The cross-LoC trade, started in 2008 as a confidence building measure between India and Pakistan, was stopped in April last year by the Centre citing “funnelling of illegal weapons, narcotics and fake currency”.

“The action has been taken after reports that the cross-LoC trade routes are being misused by Pakistan-based elements for funnelling illegal weapons, narcotics and fake currency, etc.,” the government had said then.

The officials said that they did not rule out the possibility of arrested police officer Singh having knowledge about the funding pattern through trade as he had been associated with Naveed Babu for long.

Singh was arrested last month along with Naveed, Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Rafi Ahmed Rather and Irfan Shafi Mir, who claims to be an advocate. He is at present in judicial custody.

The officials said that if need be Singh and others could be summoned in connection with the LoC trade case as well.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nia-finds-evidence-of-terror-funding-through-cross-loc-trade-during-dysp-case-probe.html
123,17-2-20,9 months of assured income if employee gets terminated not due to his fault,"A private member’s Bill has been introduced in the Rajya Sabha seeking to provide minimum nine months time with assured income in case of termination of employees due to economic slowdown,

employer becoming insolvent and change in technology among others.

The Terminated Employees (Welfare) Bill, 2020, was introduced by BJP MP Rakesh Sinha in recently concluded first phase of Parliament’s Budget session. It proposes that, if an employee gets terminated due to economic slowdown, change in technology, court order, employer becomes insolvent, owner unable to carry business and change of Government, then he is entitled for unemployment benefits.

The terminated employee shall be entitled to unemployment compensation health insurance benefits or any other benefits as may be

prescribed by the Central Government, if such benefits are not part of the employee-employer agreement, for nine months or till

the time he gets employed elsewhere, whichever is earlier, the bill reads.

In the Bill’s statement of objects and reasons, Sinha said, “At present, there is no law to ensure that the employers provide terminal benefits in time and which makes provision for education, medical facilities etc., to the families of employees who have been terminated. The bill seeks to achieve the above objective.”

“After employment, a person often takes a few loans to meet his needs, gets their children admitted at a certain level of school. All this cannot come to a halt without any of his fault. The family of the employee should not suffer because of such events,” he said.

Therefore, the bill provides for minimum nine months time with assured income to the terminated employees which will give them enough time to reassign themselves to new employment without disturbing the existing set up of their family, the BJP MP added.

Most of the time, a private member’s bill doesn’t get passed and usually gets stuck at the introduction stage.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/9-months-of-assured-income-if-employee-gets-terminated-not-due-to-his-fault.html
124,17-2-20,"EC, IIT-M join hands to develop new technology for voting","The Election Commission (EC) has collaborated with IIT Madras to work on a new technology which will allow electors to vote from far away cities without going to the designated polling station of their respective constituencies, a senior poll panel official has said. The project is at present in the research and development stage with an aim to develop a prototype, another official said.

Explaining the ‘block chain’ technology involved in the project, Senior Deputy Election Commissioner Sandeep Saxena said the concept is a “two-way electronic voting system, in a controlled environment, on white-listed IP devices on dedicated internet lines, enabled with biometric devices and a web camera”.

He, however, made it clear that voters will have to reach a designated venue during a pre-decided period of time to be able to use this facility. It does not mean voting from home, Saxena explained, which is “anytime-anywhere-any device” and would require some more time and technological advancement.

Explaining the technicalities, the Senior Deputy Election Commissioner told PTI that the “two-way block chain remote voting” process would involve voter identification and authorisation using a multi-layered IT enabled system working on the EC’s e-Governance award winning Electoral Registration Officer Network (ERO Net) using biometrics and web cameras.

After a voter’s identity is established by the system, a block chain enabled personalised e-ballot paper (Smart Contract) will be generated.

When the vote is cast (Smart Contract executed), the ballot would be securely encrypted and a block chain hashtag (#) will be generated. This hashtag notification would be sent to various stakeholders, in this case — the candidates and political parties, the official said. The encrypted remote votes so cast would once again be validated at the pre-counting stage to ensure that they have neither been decrypted, nor tampered with or replaced.

“Suppose there is a Lok Sabha election and a Chennai voter is in Delhi. Instead of returning to vote in his or her constituency or missing out on voting, the voter can reach a predesignated spot set up by the EC, say in Connaught Place, in a particular time window and can cast his vote,” Saxena said.

He said such voters may have to apply in advance to their returning officers to exercise the option. Another top EC functionary, who refused to get quoted, said at present it is only a research and development project. If the technology is found to be “okay”, then only after stakeholder consultations and changes in the election laws and rules, it will be tried in actual conditions, he said.

There have been demands from various parties that the Election Commission should ensure that migrant workers who miss out on voting as they cannot afford going home during elections to exercise their franchise should be allowed to vote for their constituency from the city they are working in.

A bill to allow proxy voting for overseas Indians had lapsed following the dissolution of the previous Lok Sabha.

The Law Ministry had also recently tweaked election rules to allow One Way Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot System (ETPBS), enabling service voters consisting of personnel belonging to the armed forces, central para military forces and central government officers deployed at Indian missions abroad, to get their postal ballots electronically. They have to fill up the ballot papers and post them back.

During the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the ETPBS system helped such service voters in participating overwhelmingly in the polls, with the turnout of almost 62 per cent which used to be dismally low in single digits earlier.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ec--iit-m-join-hands-to-develop-new-technology-for-voting.html

Citing section 13 of the PSA, the officials said that when a person is detained in pursuance of a detention order, the authority concerned needs to communicate the grounds for detention to the person to enable him/her to make a representation against it to the Government.

In its dossier, the police recommended Mufti’s detention for her “dangerous and insidious mechanization and usurping profile and nature by the masses as ‘

The incident happened on Friday evening when a group of tourists was on a trip inside jungle safari at Nava Raipur.

In the video, two tigers were seen fighting. The video was shot from inside the tourist bus. Then, one of the two tigers charged towards the bus in a bid to catch curtain hanging from the bus. Later the bus drove away leaving the big cats behind.

With the help of local residents, the injured children were shifted to the community health centre in Soharatgarh for treatment.

Soon after learning about the accident, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath got in touch with the local administration and directed the officials to ensure best treatment to all the injured. He also asked the district magistrate and the district police chief to rush to the spot and take necessary action in the matter.

Reports said that the private bus attached with Saraswati Shishu Mandir in Siddharthnagar was going to collect the students on Monday morning.

According to local residents, there were 25 students in the bus when its driver suddenly lost control over the wheel and the bus overturned.

The locals rushed to the spot after hearing the screams of the students. They somehow took out all the students and found 14 of them injured.

Later they called the local police and ambulance and shifted the injured to Soharatgarh CHC where the doctors who attended on the children said their condition was out of danger.

Reports confirmed that Sub-Divisional Magistrate Anil Kumar, Circle Officer Sunil Kumar Singh, were the first to reach the spot followed by District Magistrate Deepak Meena and Superintendent of Police Vijay Dhul. They also went to the CHC to ensure best treatment to the injured.

Parents of the students admitted in the CHC told reporters that the bus driver was drunk at the time of the incident, and that they had made verbal complaints against him in the past.

District Magistrate Deepak Meena said if it was found after medical test that the driver was under the influence of alcohol,, requisite action would be taken against him.

133,17-2-20,‘Avoid controversy’ is Nadda’s advice,"After the BJP’s loss in the Delhi election, the party’s top brass believes its leaders should restrain themselves from making controversial remarks as it is gearing up for the Bihar polls, with party chief JP Nadda cautioning Union Minister Giriraj Singh against making such statements, sources said on Sunday.

BJP’s ally at Centre, Union Minister and LJP leader Ram Vilas Paswan too said restraint over language by political leaders must be maintained and that the Bihar Assembly polls later this year should be fought on local development issues.

Nadda’s piece of advice for his party men comes couple of days after Home Minister Amit Shah, attributed controversial remarks made by some party leaders in the run up to the campaign as one of the reasons for the BJP’s defeat. Shah was the main force behind the BJP’s high-octane campaign in the Delhi Assembly polls.

Nadda summoned Singh and cautioned him against making such remarks after he stoked a controversy by describing Deoband, the seat of Islamic seminary, as the “Gangotri of terrorism”. Singh has been found making such remarks and with this the BJP chief’s message seems to be clear that they should avoid any controversial statements or remarks.

Speeches like ‘Indo-Pak match’ should not have been made by BJP leaders during the recent Delhi election campaign and that such remarks may have resulted in the party’s defeat, Shah had said while speaking about the party’s defeat in Delhi assembly polls. Union Minister Anurag Thakur and Delhi BJP MP Parvesh Verma faced action from Election Commission for making controversial remarks in Delhi election campaigns and they were banned from campaigning for two days.

Paswan said the LJP chief Chirag Paswan had made the party’s stand clear on this (language restraint) and the Home Minister too admitted that it might have been counterproductive. “Restraint over language should be a must and I would like to appeal to the people of Bihar to vote on the basis of performance, keeping in mind the work done by the Central and State Governments,” said the Union Minister.

Sources in the party said now the party has set its eye on the Bihar Assembly polls, where it is in alliance with the JD(U) and wants to ensure their victory in the state. Therefore, the BJP does not want its leaders to switch to provocative rhetoric which brings bad name for the party, the sources said, adding that at the same time such remarks may not go down well with the Janata Dal (United), which never hesitates in flaunting its secular credentials. The Assembly elections in Bihar are expected to be held around October this year and the JD(U)-BJP alliance Government under Nitish Kumar is seeking re-election.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---avoid-controversy----is-nadda---s-advice.html

135,17-2-20,11 Navy personnel arrested till now,"The number of honey-trapped Navy personnel arrested in the espionage case has reached 11 with four arrests made recently by the Andhra Pradesh Police that is probing the matter.

Apart from the 11 Navy personnel, two civilians have also been arrested in the case. The Navy personnel apprehended by the police are from the different naval bases, including Mumbai,

Karwar (Karnataka) and Visakhapatnam. After being honey-trapped by Pakistani intelligence agencies, the arrested men had allegedly passed on sensitive information related to the Indian Navy through their social media profiles.

Besides these arrests, a number of social media profiles of service personnel are under surveillance for links with suspicious accounts, according to sources.

In December, seven navy personnel were arrested for alleged espionage by the Andhra Pradesh police. The non-officer rank personnel were posted at three different naval bases including Mumbai, Karwar(Karnataka) and Visakhapatnam. A hawala operator was also arrested then in this connection.

All the sailors were arrested in a joint operation code-named “Dolphin’s Nose”” launched by the Naval intelligence wing, Andhra Pradesh police and central intelligence agencies. The Andhra Pradesh police said in a statement, “An FIR has been lodged and seven Navy personnel and a hawala operator have been arrested from different parts of the country. Some more suspects are being questioned.”

The seven arrested were giving out “unauthorised information” through Facebook and other social media tools.

It is one of the biggest cases in recent past as the seven sailors were arrested from three sensitive naval bases. While Mumbai has the Western Naval command headquarters and most VIPs land at the helicopter base there, submarine construction base of nuclear powered Arihant submarines besides the Eastern Naval command headquarters are in Visakhapatnam. Country’s lone aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya’s base is in Karwar.

Given the sensitive nature of these three locations, the Navy along with other agencies carried detailed probe and surveillance about the kind of information leaked by the arrested sailors to strengthen their security apparatus, sources said.

Preliminary probe indicated that all the seven sailors fell into a honey-trap in September 2018 after they were contacted by some women on the Facebook and lured them into an online relationship. The trap was, most probably, set up by a Pakistani handler, according to the probe so far.

The sailors were then reportedly blackmailed and forced to give information about the position and movement of warships and submarines.

Following the busting of the espionage racket, the Navy had banned use of smart phones and social media applications and the Army warned its personnel against 150 fake social media profiles, including of phoney spiritual gurus and babas, being used by Pakistan’s Intelligence officers to honey-trap officials for extracting sensitive military information. In an advisory issued in mid-October, the Army asked the personnel to avoid interacting with unknown social media profiles.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/11-navy-personnel-arrested-till-now.html

137,17-2-20,Centre facing Pawar’s ‘perception war’ on it: Fadnavis,"Former Maharashtra Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday said his party-led Government at the Centre was facing a ‘perception war’ from NCP chief Sharad Pawar on CAA and this will have to be countered by taking the political fight to the streets.

The Narendra Modi government is facing protests nationwide over its Citizenship Amendment Act which aims to give persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh citizenship but excludes Muslims.

Speaking on the second day of the 2-day state level convention held in Nerul in neighbouring Navi Mumbai, Fadnavis said, “NCP chief Sharad Pawar is playing a perception war against the BJP-led Union Government, deliberately creating confusion over CAA. A disinformation that citizenship (of certain communities) will be taken away by CAA is being spread.”

Pawar has called the CAA ‘divisive’ and ‘diversionary’ and has been vocal in his support to a plethora of national leaders who have said that they would continue to oppose the legislation till it is scrapped by the Centre.

Fadnavis said the strategy of parties opposed to the CAA was “if you cannot convince them, then confuse them”.

“The opposition should either prove that CAA is going to affect the poor and nomadic tribes in Maharashtra or they should apologise to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for their false claims,” Fadnavis said.

He said the BJP would contest polls on its own from hereon and claimed the party’s first success with this decision will be upcoming Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation polls.

Lashing out at former ally Shiv Sena, which parted ways after the October Assembly polls and joined hands with the Congress and Pawar’s NCP, Fadnavis said “Congress leaders will continue insulting V D Savarkar” and asked “how long is the Sena leadership going to tolerate it”

“If there is some courage left in the Shiv Sena, it should ban Shidori magazine published by the Congress,” he dared the Uddhav Thackeray government.Shidori had recently published two articles terming Hindutva icon Savarkar as an “apologist” and “rapist”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/centre-facing-pawar---s----perception-war----on-it--fadnavis.html

Participating in an event organised by the People’s Platform Against Fascism here, he also said those protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act and NPR and NRC had been painted as Muslims” and people must be worried about the amount of “hatred that has been inculcated in the society.”

He alleged CAA was the first official act of the government which was discriminatory and went against the spirit of the Constitution and the NRC and the NPR were the real danger.

“The rich will not be affected. The poor in our cities and the poor in the villages are the ones who are going to face the brunt of the promulgation of those two procedures which government is so keen to implement,” he said.

141,17-2-20,"Centre’s decisions leading to suspicion, says Ashok Gehlot","Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot here on Sunday accused the BJP-led Union Government of taking arbitrary decisions, leading to an environment of suspicion in the country.

He said the intention of those at the helm at the Centre was not clear due to which it was not known where the country was headed to.

Gehlot said this while addressing a dharna held in the backdrop of an apex court ruling that States are not bound to provide reservation in appointments or promotions.

The Supreme Court had given the judgment last week, upholding the contention of the Uttarakand BJP Government.

Congress leaders also submitted a memorandum to the President through the Rajasthan governor, urging to take action according to the basic spirit of the Constitution over the question of

reservation. “The intention of people ruling the country at present is not clear. The Centre is taking decisions arbitrarily. An environment of doubt is inevitable as it is unclear in which direction the country is headed to,” Gehlot said.

He said the BJP was making arbitrary decision despite getting only 39 per cent votes in the Lok Sabha elections.

Gehlot said the ruling party at the Centre can go to any extent to impose its agenda and in such a case, danger on quota for deprived communities was obvious.

He accused the BJP and the RSS of inciting people in the name of nationalism.

“Their nationalism is pseudo-nationalism. Their only aim is to win elections by instigating people. Where would 20 per cent muslim minority population go,” he said.

Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot said their protest is to alert the BJP government at the Centre that no ideology or power can abolish the fundamental rights of the citizens of the country.

He said Babasaheb Ambedkar had made a provision for reservation so that the standard of living could be improved by connecting the Dalits and backward with the mainstream.

He said the quota is not a programme like ‘Garibi Hatao’ but a continuous process to ensure rights to the Dalits and backward classes.

He said the aim of the BJP is to mislead people by diverting attention from issues like inflation and unemployment.

AICC general secretary and state in-charge Avinash Pandey said the BJP is trying to tamper with the right to reservation which is enshrined in the Constitution.

He said uncertainty prevailed in the whole country as people were confused about policies of the BJP Government.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/centre---s-decisions-leading-to-suspicion--says-ashok-gehlot.html

143,17-2-20,Hydroponic farming gets farmers’ attention,"Hydroponic farming —growing plants in micro nutrients enrich-water solution instead of soil — is fast catching the attention of farmers struggling with shrinking land and water resources.

Scientists from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research’s lab- Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (CSIR-IHBT), Palampur have come forward to arm the farmers with the technical know on plant propagation in hydroponic and aeroponic system, that is also being termed as a game changer technology.

IHBT Director Sanjay Kumar said that as majority of the rural regions in India is experiencing population shift in recent years due to animal menace and poor returns from traditional farming system, it is high time our youth adopt new techniques of agriculture like hydroponics and aeroponics.

In this regard, the scientists from the IHBT have been conducting training program on this farming technique from time to time, the recent being early this month wherein farmers, unemployed youth, students from Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Gujrat attended the four-day training workshop.

Hydroponics is the technique of growing plants without soil by using water solvent which consists of mineral nutrient whereas aeroponic is the technique of growing plants in air without soil and using external nutrients. These techniques provide higher yield and economic returns compared to traditional agricultural practices, because of increase in harvest cycles and balanced nutrient supply.

Kumar added that such farming systems are the need of hour given that arable land per person is projected to decrease by 2050 to one-third of the amount available in 1970. Also, the plant’s grown like this consume only 10 per cent of the water used in the field and thus saves water.

“The interested farmers can start startups for the production of nutrient enriched spice, herbal and high value crops which has huge demand in the urban market. But before venturing into such new arena, they need to have technical knowledge about it,” he said.

Dr. Rakesh Kumar, Programme coordinator at the IHBT added : These eco-friendly techniques can be practiced in smaller space and are successful in advanced countries. “There is no environmental risks due to less use of water, more productivity per unit area, labour saving, no use of pesticides,” he said.

In India as the urban population is expected to rise by 50 per cent 2030, the overall hydroponics system market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 12.1 per cent by 2025.

Training Co-cordinator at the IHBT, Dr Ashish Warghat said revenue generating cultivations such as herbs, spices and floriculture crops can be grown under hydroponic and aeroponic system. “although the initial investment cost for setting up the system is high but in long run it will provide better returns to farmers,” he added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/hydroponic-farming-gets-farmers----attention.html

The patient from Kasaragod, one of the three positive cases of coronavirus detected in the country on their return from China, would, however, remain under home quarantine for ten days, the state health department said.

“Two consecutive results of the patient came negative and was then discharged today morning. The patient will have to remain under home quarantine for ten more days,” a senior health official told PTI. More than 2,000 people are still under observation for the novel coronavirus in the state, which had accounted for all three positive cases in the country.

The partys national general secretary in-charge for Bihar and Rajya Sabha member Bhupendra Yadav also told reporters that denial of a scheduled meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah to a delegation of Shaheen Bagh protesters was “a decision taken by the administration and police in Delhi taking into account the situation on the ground”.

He, however, declined to comment on a video purportedly a two-month-old CCTV footage —viral on social media wherein police personnel can be seen storming a library inside the Jamia Millia Islamia and baton charging the students engrossed in books.

“I am not sure about the authenticity of the video and hence it would not be proper for me to comment on it,” Yadav said.

The BJP leader was here to take part in a meeting of the partys office-bearers in Bihar which was attended, among others, by state unit chief Sanjay Jaiswal and the latters predecessor and Union minister Nityanand Rai.

“I must say that the CAA was a decision taken out of humanitarian considerations (maanavata ke aadhar par).

150,17-2-20,Raut: Delhi poll results show Modi-Shah not invincible,"Senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday said the Delhi Assembly poll results indicate that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Minister Amit Shah are not invincible.

In his weekly column in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, its executive editor Raut criticised BJP’s “religion-centric” political strategy while lauding the developmental works of the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government.

He said the BJP, which appeared invincible during the Lok Sabha polls, fell like a ‘house of cards’ in Delhi.

“No country is without religion, but religion does not mean patriotism...A follower of Lord Hanuman, Kejriwal brought ‘Ram Rajya’ in Delhi though the BJP almost fielded Lord Ram in this election,” Raut said in sarcastic comments.

“The picture of Delhi was of Kejriwal as devotee of Hanuman and people of Delhi became Ram...Ram strongly stood behind Hanuman,” he said, adding that there are lessons to be learnt from this election”. BJP leaders earlier said those who don’t vote for the saffron party would be traitors, so is the entire Delhi going to get that stamp? Raut asked.

“The Delhi verdict indicates that Modi-Shah are not invincible any longer. It also points out that voters are not dishonest. Religious whirlwinds were stoked for political gains, but voters did not get carried away,” he said.

People should get over the “myth” that only Modi and Shah can win elections, the Rajya Sabha member said.

Sharing an experience from a recent international visit, Raut said while he was at the Tashkent airport, two Indians living there for years told him that the “BJP bubble has started to burst now”.

“Even Lord Ram is not helping the party to win polls. They (those two Indians) shared their views on the day of vote counting (for Delhi polls),” the Sena leader said.

The common factor between Prime Minister Modi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is that “both are self- centered”, but Modi also has “huge arrogance and pomposity”, Raut alleged.

He said Kejriwal also once wanted to “conquer the entire country”, but after facing defeat in the Lok Sabha polls, he soon realised his limitations and built his party and its network in Delhi.

“The BJP has ridiculed Kejriwal’s freebies, like free electricity and water. BJP’s definition of patriotism comprises waging war against Pakistan, abrogation of Article 370, strong steps against infiltrators and random sloganeering of ‘Vande Mataram’ and ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’,” he said.

But, “the better form of patriotism” (referring to Kejriwal) is offering better education, health services and providing electricity, water and shelter to the needy, the Sena leader pointed out.

“Will you (BJP) call it patriotism when two crore people lost jobs in last two years?” Raut wondered.

He said before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP promised that Rs 15 lakh will be deposited in every citizen’s bank account, but not even Rs 15 got deposited.

The BJP also pushed the Delhi poll narrative towards issues like Ram temple, (abrogation of) Article 370, Jammu and Kashmir, surgical strike and ‘Hindutva’, but people instead chose Kejriwal, who provided them essential services, he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/raut--delhi-poll-results-show-modi-shah-not-invincible.html

154,17-2-20,Naidu: India known for peaceful co-existence of all religions,"Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu On Sunday said India is known for unity in diversity, pluralistic ethos and peaceful co-existence of all religions.

This ethos should be nurtured and there should be no discrimination based on gender or differences between people, he said while addressing a global meet of Rotary International here.

Naidu called for making the youth of the country focus on creating social amity and work for strengthening community bonding.

The vice president said India wants good relations with all her neighbours and advocates for a climate of peace and progress.

He said the world community should take a pledge to fight against any force that promotes terrorism.

“We want to have good relations with all our neighbours. Let us take a stand... We must all seek to create an atmosphere where peace can flourish,” Naidu

said.

Without naming any country, the vice president observed there is a saying that “you can change your friends, but cannot change your neighbours”.

“Peace is the prerequisite for progress. India has always believed in the concept of 'Vasudaiva Kutumbakam' (the world is a family),” he said.

The vice president said over the years, India has believed in “living together” and “working together”.

“The world probably needs to adopt this approach as it moves to implement the ambitious 2030 Sustainable Development agenda,” Naidu said.

The vice president, who had a long stint in the Parliament, appealed to the lawmakers to discuss and debate in a constructive manner.

“Discuss and debate to decide, not to disturb. Agree to disagree. Let the government propose, let the opposition oppose and let the House dispose. (This is) My request to all parliamentarians,” he said.

Naidu also called upon the youth not to forget their mother tongues.

He spoke a few lines in Bengali and Hindi during his address to thunderous applause.

Singh was talking to reporters here on Saturday after attending the Madhya Pradesh Congress Coordination Committee meeting held in New Delhi earlier that day.

“The party manifesto is meant to be fulfilled in five years. Right now, the (Kamal Nath) government has completed only 15 months. Talks are on with the guest teachers over their demands and a formula is being worked out. A solution will be found,” Singh said.

“There is no lack of communication between Kamal Nathji and Scindia...There is no need for any mediation,” he added.

Amid reports that Scindia had left the coordination committee meeting midway, Singh said, “During the meeting (in Delhi) we discussed all the issues. Some reports showed that he (Scindia) left the meeting in a huff. But they (reports) are absolutely wrong. During the meeting that took place between 10 am and 2 pm, talks were held in a peaceful manner,” Singh said.

158,17-2-20,Protests continue for third day in TN,"Anti-CAA protests by members of Muslim community continued for the third day on Sunday in Old Washermanpet area in the city and some other parts of Tamil Nadu.

The fresh round of agitations against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), after a lull since December, followed the violence that broke out during a protest here on Friday in which four police personnel and some protesters suffered injuries.

Agitators at Old Washermanpet area raised slogans against CAA and sought its withdrawal during the protest, which was peaceful.

“Several Muslim outfits have joined hands and are taking part in the protest today. We seek withdrawal of the CAA..,” a protester said.

The state had witnessed a series of protests against CAA by political parties, including the main opposition DMK and Congress, while some Muslim outfits too had hit the streets to register their opposition to the controversial law.

In a related development, several senior IPS officials have been assigned specified areas to maintain law and order.

“In view of the developments on CAA, NRC and NPR issues, officers are directed to take charge immediately of the areas noted, take stock of law and order development and adequate precautionery measures”, the order issued by DGP JK Tripathy said.

161,17-2-20,BJP ridicules Mamata as ‘brother’ Kejriwal ignores her for oath event,"The BJP on Sunday ridiculed Mamata Banerjee after her ‘brother’ and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal ‘ignored her’ when it came to inviting her in his swearing-in function in the national Capital.

Taking a dig at the Bengal Chief Minister State BJP president Dilip Ghosh said “Mamata Banerjee should abandon her dreams of becoming a national leader around whom the parties will rally because no one takes her seriously.

“Look at her much touted brother Arvind Kejriwal for whose electoral success she prayed at Kalighat and even kept fasts. See what happened. She was not even invited by him in his swearing-in ceremony. Her brother pleasantly forgot her. I feel really bad for her and her ambitions to become a national leader who aims at galvanizing the parties behind her,” Ghosh said.

Drawing a reference to the Bengal Chief Minister’s public moaning about her not being invited by the Railway Ministry at the inauguralfunction of Kolkata East-Metro corridor Ghosh said “she shed tears for not being invited by the Railway Ministry to a recent programme but what about her not being invited by the Delhi Chief Minister … I think she has been more pained by Kejriwal ji’s behavior than that of the Railway Ministry.”

The Chief Minister had earlier in a speech inside the Bengal Assembly said that she was really pained at the treatment meted out to her by the BJP-led Government. “I brought the East-West Metro to Kolkata after much sacrifice but now when its inauguration date came I was kept out of it,” she had said.

Asking her to refrain from making issues by

dramatizing non-issues and advising her to give good governance instead of nourishing national ambitions, Ghosh said “she should stop making issues out of non-issues by such public acts … instead of dreaming national she should concentrate on the State and try to give good governance to the people of Bengal which is gripped by poverty, crime, police inaction, tolabaji (extortion) and political victimization of the Opposition.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-ridicules-mamata-as----brother----kejriwal-ignores-her-for-oath-event.html
162,17-2-20,Shaheen Bagh stir attempt to impose views on others: Kerala Guv,"Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan has defended the citizens’ right to dissent if such views are not sought to be imposed on authorities and others. Speaking at a panel discussion on the topic of “ free speech, censorship, and media”, at Difficult Dialogues conference at the international centre, Goa, the Governor said, “those dissenting against any decision of the Government should not start with a premise to force the authorities to overturn it.”

“ You have the right to dissent. You have the right to peacefully raise your concerns, but you can’t expect the authorities to accept your point of views,” he said.

When asked the growing tendency to brand dissenters as traitors by persons or group close to power, the Governor referred to excesses against the minority community in Pakistan and said such happenings are finding echo in India. “ I don’t justify such brandings, but we have to also understand the context in which such utterance are being used.”

Khan disagreed with the rigid stand adopted by the Shaheen bagh anti-CAA protesters and said that they have closed the door on possibility of holding dialogues by holding an open-ended talk.

“ They are not ready to settle for anything but scrapping of the Citizenships Act. This is not dissent. This is imposition of views. Such rigid views should not be confused as democratic dissent,” he said.

On alleged by the Government to muzzle the media, the Governor said, Media faces much bigger threats from within and authorities have not been able to curb the freedom of the press even though such attempts go back to the first constitutional amendment in 1951.

The Governor has a word of advice for the media. He cautioned against blaming the Government for muzzling the press whereas the real threats are coming from several other sources. “ in the age of social media, the Government cannot impose it’s will dissemination of news. The media must stand up and fight for its independence.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/shaheen-bagh-stir-attempt-to-impose-views-on-others--kerala-guv.html

165,17-2-20,"6-7% LIC stake dilution enough to mop up Rs 90,000 crore: CEA","The Government’s Rs 2.1 lakh crore sell-off target is achievable with half of this amount expected to be met through the spill-over deals of Air India, BPCL and Concor and the remaining Rs 90,000 crore through just 6-7 per cent stake dilution in state life insurer LIC, Chief Economic Advisor KV Subramanian has said amid questions being raised over meeting such a huge amount when the current fiscal disinvestment revenue target was lowered by 40 per cent.

As per Budget 2020, out of the Rs 2.1 lakh crore target, Rs 1.2 lakh crore is expected to come from IPOs, strategic stake sales, buybacks, and OFSs, while the Government expects to raise Rs 90,000 crore through the sale of stakes in state-owned life insurance company LIC and IDBI Bank.

Doubts of disinvestment targets not being possible to be met next fiscal have been raised at various quarters as apart from a higher amount of Rs 2.1 lakh crore, the government has also lined up listing of Life Insurance Corporation which needs a change in the LIC Act and several other changes prior, which could be time-consuming enough to be completed in 10-12 months.

The uncertainty over meeting the target also arises as most of these deals depend also on conducive market conditions (as in the case of IPOs) to be able to sail through and also on the foreign and domestic bidders in case of BPCL and Air India.

The Chief Economic Advisor, however, has said the target is not insurmountable and can be achieved well within time. He said even a below 10 per cent listing of LIC has the ability to fetch about Rs 90,000 crore of the total Rs 2.1 lakh crore target and LIC’s amendment procedures should not pose any extra time limit on the sell-off schedule.

“There are legislative amendments required here in LIC. But I think this (LIC listing) is doable. LIC is a just a case of listing. I would think that about 6-7 per cent would be enough to get the entire Rs 90,000 crore. I have done some back of the envelope calculations based on that... can say that just selling 6-7 per cent will be enough to mop up Rs 90,000 crore....

“There is a good chance that we will be able to achieve these targets. It is consistent with the government’s strategy for enabling efficiencies in the CPSEs. BPCL privatisation is the evidence of that. Listing brings in more disclosure requirements which enables efficiencies. We have full confidence in the DIPAM to achieve the target. Many of the deals on which actions have been going on this year --Air India, BPCL, where a lot of work has already happened and it’s just that those could not be closed by March this year... therefore would get closed in the coming year.

“More than half of this target will be met by the spill over target of this fiscal into the next year - like Air India and BPCL privatisation and Concor stake sale. That leaves about Rs 90,000 crore,” Subramanian told IANS.

The Finance Ministry doubled the disinvestment target from the current fiscal’s original target of Rs 1.05 lakh crore with LIC, BPCL and Air India form big-ticket line-up.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/6-7--lic-stake-dilution-enough-to-mop-up-rs-90-000-crore--cea.html
166,17-2-20,Rocket attack hits near US embassy in Iraq capital: Militaries,"President Donald Trump mixed reelection business with pleasure during a weekend stop at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, attending a fundraiser on Saturday evening expected to raise USD 10 million for his campaign and the Republican National Committee.

The event was believed to be his most expensive fundraiser ever, with invitations going to donors who gave $580,600 per couple, according to The Washington Post, which obtained an invitation to the event at the Palm Beach estate of billionaire investor Nelson Peltz. Pro-Trump groups have been shattering fundraising records on the path toward a goal of raising $1 billion this election cycle.

Advocacy groups that have sought campaign finance reform said the Supreme Court paved the way for such fundraising hauls by striking down in 2014 the limit on the total amount of money an individual could give to all political party committees in a two-year election cycle.

“The ability of Trump to raise these astronomical amounts of influence money from billionaires and multimillionaires is a direct result of the Supreme Court’s utter failure to understand the nation’s campaign finance laws or the implications of its decision,” said Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer in an op-ed published in Medium.

In that 5-4 decision the Supreme Court found that limits on the total amount of money donors can give to all candidates, committees and political parties were unconstitutional.

Sen Bernie Sanders has criticized some of his fellow Democratic presidential candidates for accepting campaign donations from the extremely wealthy, questioning whether those who accept the donations would stand up to those who provide them if the situation called for it. AP

Baghdad: Multiple rockets hit an Iraqi base hosting American troops near the US embassy early Sunday, the latest in a flurry of attacks against US assets in the country.

“The Coalition confirms small rockets impacted the Iraqi base hosting (coalition) troops in the International Zone... No casualties,” said coalition spokesman Myles Caggins.

That base, known as Union III, is the headquarters for the US-led coalition, deployed in Iraq since 2014 to help local troops fight the Islamic State jihadist group.

Iraq’s military said three Katyusha rockets hit inside the Green Zone, the high-security enclave where the US mission and Union III are located, as well as Iraqi government buildings, United Nations offices and other embassies.

A fourth rocket hit a logistics base in a different neighbourhood operated by the Hashed al-Shaabi, a military network officially incorporated into the Iraqi state, the Iraqi military said.

There was no immediate statement from the Hashed.

Strikes on assets of both the US and Hashed at the same time are unusual, as Washington has blamed hardline elements within the military network for repeated rocket attacks on American installations across Iraq.

Sunday’s was the 19th attack since October to target either the embassy or the roughly 5,200 US troops stationed alongside local forces across Iraq.

No group has claimed responsibility for any of the incidents. In late December, a rocket attack on the northern Iraqi base of K1 left one US contractor dead and unleashed a dramatic series of events.

Washington responded with retaliatory strikes against Kataeb Hezbollah, a hardline Hashed faction in western Iraq.

Days later, an American drone strike in Baghdad killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani and his right-hand man, Hashed deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.

Hashed factions have vowed revenge for the pair’s death but said they would prioritise a political objective first: the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq.

But the network includes a broad range of groups and some have appeared more willing to harass US troops militarily. Sunday’s attack came just hours after one of the Hashed’s Iran-backed factions, Harakat al-Nujaba, announced a “countdown” to ousting American forces from the country.

A top leader within Nujaba, Nasr al-Shammary, tweeted a photograph of what he claimed was an American military vehicle, adding: “We are closer than you think.”

Sunday’s assault sent warning sirens blaring across the diplomatic compound, a US military source and a Western diplomat based nearby told AFP.

167,17-2-20,Lanka asks US to review travel ban on its army chief,"Sri Lanka on Sunday asked the US to review its decision to impose a travel ban on its army chief Lt Gen Shavendra Silva, who has been accused of grave human rights abuses during the final phase of the country’s civil war against the LTTE, and warned that America’s move “unnecessarily complicates” bilateral ties.

The US last week imposed travel restrictions on Lt Gen Silva and his immediate family members over alleged gross violations of human rights during the final phase of the military conflict that ended in 2009 with the killing of LTTE supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran.

US ambassador Alaina Teplitz was summoned by Sri Lanka’s Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena on Sunday.

Gunawardena conveyed to Teplitz Sri Lanka’s strong objections on the imposition of travel restrictions by the US on Lt Gen Silva and his family.

He said that the move unnecessarily complicates the US-Sri Lanka relationship.

Noting that Lt Gen Silva was one of the senior military officials who contributed significantly to liberate Sri Lanka from terrorism over a decade ago, the minister said it is disappointing that a foreign government should question the prerogative of a democratically elected President to call upon persons of proven expertise to hold key positions on national security related matters.

Noting that the designation was not based on independently verified information, the minister requested the United States to verify the authenticity of the sources of information.

Gunawardena asked that the United States Government review its decision.

Ambassador Teplitz said that she would convey Sri Lanka’s concerns to the US.

Earlier, Sri Lanka’s ruling and opposition parties strongly opposed the US move to impose a travel ban on Lt Gen Silva.

“Silva was only conducting a war against a designated terrorist group which was the LTTE. The US themselves named many organisations terrorist after 9/11 attacks,” Gunawardena told reporters.

Sajith Premadasa, the main opposition leader, echoed a similar view.

“Imposition of a travel ban on army commander Shavendra Silva and his immediate family is regrettable and unfortunate. He is one of the heroic field commanders who spearheaded the national effort to eradicate terrorism,” Premadasa tweeted.

“All of us stand by him and his family at this hour of need. As a country we shall always stand with the war heroes that brought about an end to 30 years of terrorism,” he said.

Other opposition figures also said that Silva was doing his job as a battle commander and should therefore not be punished for fighting the LTTE.

Lt Gen Silva, 55, was appointed as the Sri Lankan Army Commander last year and previously headed the Army’s 58th Division in the final battle against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels of the civil war in 2009.

His brigade was accused of attacking civilians, hospitals and stopping humanitarian supplies to trapped Tamil civilians.

The Sri Lanka Army has denied the alleged rights abuses. After the brutal civil war ended, Silva served in New York as Sri Lanka’s Deputy Permanent Representative at the UN Mission. According to a United Nations report, some 45,000 Tamil civilians were killed in the last months of the war alone.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/lanka-asks-us-to-review-travel-ban-on-its-army-chief.html
168,17-2-20,South Sudan rebels reject Prez’s peace compromise,"South Sudan rebels rejected on Sunday a government peace offer to return to a system of 10 states, dashing hopes of ending a six-year war that has left 380,000 dead.

President Salva Kiir had said he would compromise by cutting the current 32 regional states back down to the original 10 -- a key rebel demand -- to pave the way for a unity government. But Kiir also included on top of the 10, three “administrative areas” of Pibor, Ruweng and Abyei.

Rebel chief Riek Machar said he opposed those three areas, saying it “cannot be referred to as reverting to 10 states” and “as such cannot be accepted”. “We therefore call upon President Kiir to reconsider this idea of creating administrative areas,” he said in a statement. Machar warned the three areas risked causing further problems, calling the issue a “Pandora’s box”.

Kiir and Machar — who lives in exile — are under increasing international pressure to resolve their differences before a February 22 deadline.

Machar has repeatedly said he could not return to his old job as vice-president if country’s structure of states did not return to its original form.

The number of states is contentious because the borders will determine the divisions of power in the country.

When it gained independence from Sudan in 2011, South Sudan had 10 states, as set out in its constitution. Kiir increased that in 2015 to 28, then 32 -- and has now reduced them back to 10, plus the three areas. He issued an order late Saturday relieving all governors of the 32 states of their posts. He has said the final matter of states would be debated once the unity government forms.

Of the three areas, the most contentious is thought to be oil-rich Ruweng, in the north. Oil provides almost all of the government’s revenue in South Sudan, one of the world’s most oil dependent nations.

Ruweng has been one of the most heavily fought over areas in the civil war and is claimed by both the Dinka people of Kiir and the Nuer of Machar. Abyei, another of the three areas, is a border zone contested with neighbouring Sudan. Pibor lies in the eastern Jonglei region, an area long troubled by militias and rebels fighting over local grievances.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/south-sudan-rebels-reject-prez---s-peace-compromise.html

170,17-2-20,"China says significant drop in cases, toll climbs to 1,665","China on Sunday announced a “significant drop” in coronavirus cases, as the WHO team scrambled to assist Beijing in containing the spread of the virus that has claimed 1,665 lives so far.

The death toll from China’s coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic has climbed to 1,665 on Saturday after 142 more people died, mostly in the worst-hit Hubei Province, and the confirmed cases jumped to 68,500.

China’s National Health Commission(NHC) confirmed 2,009 new cases across the country.

Hubei and its provincial capital Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December, reported 1,843 of the new cases. The latest report brought the total confirmed cases in Hubei to 56,249 cases.

Of the new deaths, 139 were in Hubei, two in Sichuan, and one in Hunan, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

The report said 9,419 infected patients had been discharged from hospitals after recovery so far.

The Commission announced that the proportion of severe and critical cases of the novel coronavirus disease among all confirmed cases has decreased significantly in China.

“In Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic, the proportion of severe cases among the confirmed cases fell from a peak of 32.4 per cent on January 28 to 21.6 per cent on February 15,” Mi Feng, a spokesperson with the NHC said during a media briefing here.

Mi said the proportion in other parts of Hubei Province also dropped from a peak of 18.4 per cent on January 27 to 11.1 per cent on February 15.

The percentage in other provinces in China also decreased significantly, falling from a peak of 15.9 per cent on January 27 to 7.2 per cent on February 15, Mi was quoted as saying by the Xinhua news agency.

He said the change in status of the coronavirus cases has proven the current epidemic prevention and control measures were effective.

It is the fifth recorded death outside mainland China — previous victims were in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan, and France.

“This latest case was an unlicensed taxi driver. His main clients were people who had been to China, Hong Kong and Macao,” health and welfare minister Chen Shih-chung told reporters.

Chen said authorities were examining the driver’s client list and their travel history, in an attempt to trace the possible source of infection.

A 50-year-old male relative of the victim was later confirmed to have contracted the virus, Chen added, although he was not showing any symptoms.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/taiwan-records-its-first-death.html

Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Mohammad Shtayyeh said the US plan was “no more than a memo of understanding between (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu and Trump.”

Shtayyeh criticised the fact that the proposal would leave a future Palestinian state fragmented and with “no sovereignty,” allowing Israel to annex large parts of the West Bank.

He urged other countries to reject the Trump proposal while maintaining that Palestinians “are open to serious negotiations.”

Shtayyeh suggested the Palestinians would seek to increase pressure on Israel through international organisations, citing the recent release by the UN human rights office of a list of more than 100 companies allegedly complicit in violating Palestinian human rights by operating in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.

Referring to the upcoming Israeli election, Shtayyeh said the difference between Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz and Netanyahu was “not more than the difference between Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump---s-west-asia-plan-will-be-buried--says-palestinian-pm.html

175,17-2-20,"‘Airtel, Voda Idea, Tata Tele likely to pay AGR dues today’","Telecom operators Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices are likely to make payment for adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues on Monday to avoid stringent punitive action from the Telecom Department, according to an official source.

The three companies are jointly liable to pay dues of over Rs 1 lakh crore, but they have informed the Department of Telecom (DoT) of making only partial payment, as per their representatives.

“Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices have said that they will make payments on Monday. DoT will take action after evaluating the amount paid by them,” an official source told PTI. Earlier on Friday, Bharti Airtel offered the DoT to pay Rs 10,000 crore by February 20, but a DoT official said that the department can’t grant any extension.

Vodafone Idea on Saturday said that it is assessing the amount that can be paid towards AGR dues, even as it flagged concerns over the continuation of its business.

Telecom operators are collectively liable to pay Rs 1.47 lakh crore in AGR dues as per the Supreme Court order dated October 24, 2019. The deadline to pay the amount ended on January 23, but none of the telecom operators, except Reliance Jio, paid the amount.

Even state-owned BSNL and MTNL did not pay the dues. As per the last available estimates, Airtel owes nearly Rs 35,586 crore, including licence fee and spectrum usage charges, to the government.

Vodafone Idea is staring at dues worth Rs 53,000 crore, which includes up to Rs 24,729 crore of spectrum dues and another Rs 28,309 crore in licence fee. Tata Teleservices owes around Rs 13,800 crore, BSNL Rs 4,989 crore and MTNL Rs 3,122 crore.

Out of Rs 1.47 lakh crore, around Rs 1.13 lakh crore is likely to be recovered, as other companies, which are liable to pay AGR dues, have folded up their businesses. Reliance Communications and Aircel are going through insolvency proceedings. The apex court on Friday came down heavily on the Telecom Department for not taking steps to recover statutory dues, estimated to be around Rs 1.47 lakh crore from operators. The DoT issued fifth and final notice to telecom operators on February 14 for making payment on the same day, but none of the companies paid the dues.

When asked about telecom operators having sought time to assess the amount they have to pay, the DoT official said that the court gave them three months to do so and even after missing January 23 deadline telecom operators had sufficient time to calculate their dues.

“Before the due date, DoT has sent telecom operators 4 notices and reminders to pay to avoid punitive action under license condition. After court order on modification plea, telecom players are not left with any excuse to delay the payment and the DoT can take action against them without serving any further notice,” the source said.

The SC pulled up telecom operators and the government on non-payment of AGR dues despite its order. It has asked managing directors and directors of the company to be present in person before court on the next hearing, scheduled for March 17, in case there is violation of its order in the AGR case.

Public sector companies, that do not sell telecom services, owe DoT around Rs 2.65 lakh crore, with GAIL India alone owing around 65 per cent of the total amount. However, these PSUs have the option to approach court for a legal recourse.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---airtel--voda-idea--tata-tele-likely-to-pay-agr-dues-today----2020-02-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/---airtel--voda-idea--tata-tele-likely-to-pay-agr-dues-today---.html

177,17-2-20,Lack of understanding of financial products hindering MSME progress: RBI official,"The lack of basic understanding of financial products and services is hindering the progress of MSMEs, a senior RBI official has said.

Micro, small and medium enterprises play a significant role in economic development, in terms of their contribution to employment generation, innovation, exports and inclusive growth, he said.

The union government and the RBI have undertaken several measures for orderly growth of the sector, said RBI Regional Director for North Eastern Region, Manoranjan Dash, while inaugurating the 'Financial Literacy Week 2020' here.

""The lack of basic understanding of financial products and services, banking procedures and risk-return framework inhibit the progress of MSME units,"" Dash was quoted as saying in a release issued by the central bank on Monday.

The fourth edition of the Financial Literacy Week held from February 10-14 on the theme of MSMEs focused on collateral free loans, trade receivables discounting system (TReDS), formalisation and timely repayment of loans, and how they benefit by being a part of the formal banking system.

With a network of about 6.34 crore enterprises, the sector contributes about 45 per cent to manufacturing output, more than 40 per cent of exports, over 28 per cent of the GDP, while creating employment for about 11 crore people, the RBI release said.

The Expert Committee on MSMEs (June 2019) constituted by the RBI has made several recommendations for addressing problems persisting in the MSME sector, Dash said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/lack-of-understanding-of-financial-products-hindering-msme-progress--rbi-official-2020-02-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/lack-of-understanding-of-financial-products-hindering-msme-progress--rbi-official.html

179,17-2-20,Trump expected to raise $10 mn during Florida stop,"President Donald Trump mixed reelection business with pleasure during a weekend stop at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, attending a fundraiser on Saturday evening expected to raise USD 10 million for his campaign and the Republican National Committee.

The event was believed to be his most expensive fundraiser ever, with invitations going to donors who gave $580,600 per couple, according to The Washington Post, which obtained an invitation to the event at the Palm Beach estate of billionaire investor Nelson Peltz. Pro-Trump groups have been shattering fundraising records on the path toward a goal of raising $1 billion this election cycle.

Advocacy groups that have sought campaign finance reform said the Supreme Court paved the way for such fundraising hauls by striking down in 2014 the limit on the total amount of money an individual could give to all political party committees in a two-year election cycle.

“The ability of Trump to raise these astronomical amounts of influence money from billionaires and multimillionaires is a direct result of the Supreme Court’s utter failure to understand the nation’s campaign finance laws or the implications of its decision,” said Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer in an op-ed published in Medium.

In that 5-4 decision the Supreme Court found that limits on the total amount of money donors can give to all candidates, committees and political parties were unconstitutional.

Sen Bernie Sanders has criticized some of his fellow Democratic presidential candidates for accepting campaign donations from the extremely wealthy, questioning whether those who accept the donations would stand up to those who provide them if the situation called for it.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump-expected-to-raise--10-mn-during-florida-stop.html
180,17-2-20,Saudi women smoke in public to ‘complete’ their freedom,"Rima settles in a chair at an upscale Riyadh cafe, looks around carefully, and seeing no one she recognises, drags on her electronic cigarette and exhales a cloud of smoke.

“I feel that smoking in public is a part of exercising my newly won freedoms. I am happy that now that I can choose,” the 27-year-old Saudi who works for a private company in the capital told AFP.

Like Western feminists of the early 20th century, in an era of social change in Saudi Arabia some women are embracing cigarettes, shisha pipes or vaping as a symbol of emancipation.

The sight of women smoking in public has become much more common in recent months, an unthinkable prospect before the introduction of sweeping reforms in the ultra-conservative kingdom.

The kingdom’s ambitious de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has rolled out an array of economic and social innovations to project a moderate, business-friendly image.

Women are now allowed to drive, attend public sporting events and concerts, and obtain passports without the approval of a male guardian.

Rima, who started smoking two years ago, dismisses concerns about the harmful effects of tobacco, but is worried her family will find out.

She says she is prepared for a showdown.

“I won’t tell them that this is about my personality liberty, because they won’t understand that women are free to smoke like men,” said Rima, dressed in a traditional black abaya with gold embroidery matching the hijab that covered her hair.

Najla, 26, who like Rima asked to use a pseudonym, said that despite the rapid social changes, double standards still existed, and that it was still considered a “scandal and disgrace” if women smoked.

The only woman lighting up amid several tables of male smokers, she said she intended to “challenge society” and ignore the occasional dirty looks.

“My rights will be fully respected when my family accepts me as a smoker,” she said, recalling that a friend was sent to an addiction clinic when her parents found out about her smoking.

Najla started smoking while still a school student, and like her, up to 65 percent of female Saudi high schoolers light up secretly, according to a 2015 study by the medical faculty at King Abdulaziz University cited by Arab News.

Despite the limitations, in a country where until just a few years ago religious police would chase and hit women for infractions like wearing nail polish or allowing a strand of hair to escape from their hijab, the changes have been head-spinning.

“Most of our women clients order shisha. It’s something that was totally unimaginable just three months ago,” a Lebanese waiter told AFP at an upscale cafe in north Riyadh.

Heba, a 36-year-old longtime smoker who sat at a table nearby, described growing up in a closed country where “everything was forbidden to women”. “I never imagined I would be able to smoke shisha in public next to men,” she told AFP.

“Now, everything is allowed. Women venture out without hijab, without abaya and they even smoke publicly.” But even as the kingdom has introduced reforms, it has attracted condemnation for a heavy-handed crackdown on dissidents including intellectuals, clerics and female activists.

In 2018, authorities arrested at least a dozen women activists just before the historic lifting of the decades-long ban on female motorists.

Many of the detained have accused interrogators of sexual harassment and torture. Saudi authorities reject the accusations.

“There is no doubt that at the persona level there is more freedom,” said Walid al-Hathloul, whose sister Loujain is on trial over allegations of having contacts with foreign media and diplomats.

“But the reforms in favour of women are part of a public relations campaign to improve the kingdom’s human rights record,” he told AFP. “The arrest and demonisation of women activists is proof of this — it’s designed so that the reforms will not be credited to the activists,” he told AFP.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/saudi-women-smoke-in-public-to----complete----their-freedom.html
181,17-2-20,Who will grab Laureus honour? Verdict today,"Golfer Tiger Woods, champion marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge and F1 driver Lewis Hamilton are the top contenders to grab the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year award in Berlin today.

Woods is in the running for his career-redeeming first major title in 11 years, while Kipchoge’s incredible sub-two-hour marathon run and Hamilton’s sixth F1 world title also put them in contention for the prestigious award.

The Laureus World Sports Awards is the pinnacle of sport, honouring the world’s greatest achievers and recognising sport’s ability to change lives for the better.

Kipchoge, became the first athlete to run a marathon in under two hours. The 34-year-old recorded 1hr 59mins 40secs, in Vienna, although the time is not recognised as an official world record because it was not in open competition and he used a team of pacemakers.

Woods, who has grabbed the 2019 comeback of the year award, won his 15th Major Championship at the Masters in April. It was his first Major title since the US Open-winning effort in 2008.

Hamilton is also among the six nominees in the list, which also has tennis great Rafael Nadal, Lionel Messi and Marc Marquez.

The British F1 ace won his sixth World C’ship title in 2019 to be second in the all-time list, one behind the inspirational Michael Schumacher.

Hamilton won 11 of the 21 Grand Prix during the 2019 calendar, taking his tally to 84 career race victories, seven behind Schumacher.

Barcelona skipper Messi scored his 600th career goal for Barcelona. With 36 goals in 2018-19, he was the top scorer in La Liga for the sixth time. In November he passed 40 goals in a year for the 11th time.

The 26-year-old Marquez, one of the most successful motor cycle racers of all time, won his sixth World MotoGP title in 2019.

After being nominated four times before, it remains to be seen if Jamaican great Shally-Ann Fraser-Pryce gets lucky this year. She was nominated for World Sports woman of the year in 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2016 but could not win it.

After winning her fourth world 100m title at the Doha Worlds, she will be a strong candidate this time.

She is competing with two-time winner American Simone Biles, the most decorated gymnast, who has five world Gold medals.

Also competing is American footballer Megan Rapinoe, who at the age of 34 is the oldest to score a goal in a World Cup final. She won the golden ball and the golden boot in USA’s title-winning triumph last year.

Japanese tennis sensation Naomi Osaka has been struggling of late and was even recently benched during the Fed Cup by her team but her Australian Open winning performance in 2019 made her the first woman to win consecutive Grand Slam titles since Serena Williams in 2015.

American track and field athlete Allyson Felix is also in the race after winning two gold at the Doha Worlds. She has won 13 world titles so far.

Considered the greatest woman skier ever, Mikaela Shiffrin won her third straight World Cup in 2019.

184,17-2-20,Clijsters says comeback down to inner ‘feeling' and husband,"Four-time Grand Slam champion Kim Clijsters revealed on Sunday that a persistent inner feeling and advice from her husband served as the key to her WTA return at the Dubai C’ships.

“It was a feeling that I had inside for a little while,” the 36-year-old mother-of-three said. “Once in a while that feeling would go away when I was home with the (three) kids. A couple times it would come back. It got stronger and stronger.”

The Belgian has been handed a tough first round assignment against last month’s Australian Open finalist Garbine Muguruza for her first match since the 2012 US Open today.

Clijsters retired initially in 2007 to marry and have her first child, returned in 2009 winning three of her four titles at the Majors.

“I talked to my husband. He was like, ‘stop worrying about why and ask yourself why not.’ “He made a very good point. I was like, ‘There is no ‘why not’. Why wouldn’t I do it?”

Clijsters, playing as a wild card entry at her debut in the emirate, added: “I’ve enjoyed the challenge since the day I’ve decided to go for it. It’s been with ups and downs.

“Being 36 years old, you know that’s how it’s been for your whole career. It’s how you mentally stay through it, how strong you stay through those kind of situations.”

Clijsters had originally planned to return for the Australian Open last month, but the date was put back due to an elbow injury.

“When things don’t go well, that’s obviously when you have to be committed and focused. I’ve been doing that.

“It’s been an interesting but very challenging process that I’m really enjoying,” said the winner of 41 singles titles.

185,17-2-20,Bayern reclaim first place,"Germany winger Serge Gnabry netted twice as Bayern Munich swept back to the top of the Bundesliga on Sunday with a 4-1 away win at Cologne.

After RB Leipzig had claimed top spot in Germany’s top flight for 24 hours with a 3-0 home win against Werder Bremen on Saturday, Bayern wasted no time in regaining first place in Cologne.

Bayern have won seven of their last eight league games, which includes last Sunday’s goalless draw with Leipzig.

Lewandowski and Kingsley Coman netted for Bayern to add to Gnabry’s brace while Mark Uth, on loan from Schalke, scored Cologne’s consolation goal.

Bayern were 3-0 up after 12 minutes as they blitzed the Cologne defence.

The Bundesliga’s top scorer Robert Lewandowski claimed his 23rd league goal with clinical finishing after Thomas Mueller’s pass put him in behind the defence on three minutes.

Lewandowski then moved the ball in the box to Mueller, whose pass found Coman to beat Cologne goalkeeper Timo Horn, making it 2-0 after only five minutes.

It was Mueller’s 14th assist this season, leaving him second only to Manchester City’s Kevin de Bruyne, on 16, for chances created in Europe's top five leagues.

Gnabry then made it 3-0 when his shot gave Horn no chance on it’s way into the bottom corner to leave the home crowd stunned.

With 15 minutes gone, Horn was the only Cologne player in double figures for touches of the ball — three of his 10 were picking the ball out of his net.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bayern-reclaim-first-place.html
186,17-2-20,Juve back on top in see-saw race,"Paulo Dybala and Juan Cuadrado scored as Juventus rediscovered winning form, beating 10-man Brescia 2-0 on Sunday to reclaim top spot in Serie A before title rivals Inter Milan and Lazio clash later.

Argentine forward Dybala curled in a perfect free kick eight minutes before the break after Brescia’s Florian Aye was sent off for two yellow cards in quick succession.

Colombian Cuadrado tapped in the second from close range after a Blaise Matuidi cross with 15 minutes to go, as the champions bounced back from last weekend’s shock defeat at Hellas Verona.

Juventus move three points clear of Inter Milan, with third-placed Lazio third, four points adrift of the leaders, before hosting Antonio Conte’s title rivals in the Stadio Olimpico.

Cristiano Ronaldo was rested for Sunday’s game in Turin, but veteran defender Giorgio Chiellini returned after a long injury layoff.

Captain Chiellini came on for the final 12 minutes over five-months after rupturing cruciate ligaments in the right knee.

Brescia goalkeeper Enrico Alfonso went off after just 10 minutes following a knock to the head, with substitute keeper Lorenzo Andrenacci pulling off some fine saves against the champions.

Andrenacci smothered a second Dybala effort on the line minutes after the opener with the Brescia 'keeper also denying Gonzalo Higuain just after the break.

Dybala missed the chance for a second just before the final whistle, clipping the bar with Andrenacci beaten.

Brescia fell to their fifth defeat in seven games, as they sit second last in the table.

Earlier Hellas Verona missed the chance to close in on fifth-placed Roma, who fell 2-1 at Atalanta on Saturday, with a goalless draw at Udinese.

Sixth-placed Verona extended their unbeaten run to nine games and occupy the final Europa League berth ahead of Parma on goal difference.

Parma got back winning at Sassuolo with Ivorian Gervinho scoring the only goal after 25 minutes.

Fiorentina, in 13th, crushed struggling Sampdoria 5-1 after consecutive defeats to Juventus and Atalanta.

Federico Chiesa and Dusan Vlahovic bagged a brace each with the Tuscany side’s first goal a gift from Sampdoria midfielder Morten Thorsby who turned into his own net after eight minutes in Genoa.

On Saturday late night fixture, Mario Pasalic scored the winner seconds after coming off the bench as Atalanta came from behind to beat Roma 2-1 and consolidate fourth place at the expense of their Champions League rivals from the capital.

The Croatia midfielder came on just before the hour mark in Bergamo to fire in the crucial goal 19 seconds later, to boost confidence ahead of his side’s first ever Champions League last 16 game against Valencia at the San Siro next week.

It was Roma who broke through first with Edin Dzeko pouncing on a defending blunder from Jose Luis Palomino.

Dzeko dispossessed the centre-back to rifle in past a helpless Pierluigi Golini in the Atalanta goal.

Palomino made up for his earlier error just after the break volleying in the equaliser in an action started off a Papu Gomez corner.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/juve-back-on-top-in-see-saw-race.html
187,17-2-20,Son books Villa for Spurs,"Son Heung-min struck deep into stoppage time as Tottenham’s chances of Champions League football next season were boosted by a 3-2 win at Aston Villa on Sunday.

A third consecutive Premier League victory lifts Spurs up to fifth — which could be enough to secure Champions League qualification with Manchester City facing a two-season ban from the competition — and within one point of fourth-placed Chelsea.

Jose Mourinho’s men were worthy of their victory after bouncing back from a nightmare start when Toby Alderweireld sliced into his own goal.

The Belgian quickly made amends at the other end with a thumping finish before Son followed up after Pepe Reina had saved his penalty to put the visitors in front.

Slack defending threatened to cost Tottenham all three points when they allowed Bjorn Engels to equalise early in the second half.

However, Engels was the culprit to cost Villa a point in their battle to beat the drop as he miscontrolled a long ball forward in the 94th minute and Son sprinted clear to finish calmly.

No team in the Premier League have now conceded more than Dean Smith’s men.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/son-books-villa-for-spurs.html
188,17-2-20,Message in a room,"Through songs and poems of literary figures, and objects telling tales of their existence, the India Design Week 2020 had meaning woven deep within its exhibits, says Sakshi Sharma

A small, white tent made of mild steel and tensile fabric stood in the middle of interior designer Iram Sultan’s booth at the India Design Week. Titled One, the words, “create,” “happy” and “love” were written in various Indian languages on its surface. Rabindranath Tagore’s poem, Let My Country Awake, occupied its centre. It invited people to question their existence and define themselves in a world divided by hate. At a distance, was another installation, Hope Has Wings. It was a curved black board depicting different shades of human emotions through a number of corked pegs spread in the shape of a butterfly. As one crossed the installation, one could hear Emily Dickinsons’ poem Hope Is A Thing With Feathers, on loop. It was narrated by voices of different age groups. If there was one message that went out, it was that creativity is about unboxing the mind and setting it free. Surely, this will inform design disciplines of our times.

Another major design with a message was What’s Your Story, a collection of 30 objects from around the country, each telling a tale. Presented by Bengaluru-based architect and designer-duo Sandeep and Tania Khosla, the stories were broadly divided into themes like — craftsmanship, conscious consumption, whimsy and beauty, nostalgia and memory, and functionality and accessibility. The objects, ranging from layered bowls to bamboo armchairs, low-lying wooden tables and penta-cluster lamps, drew attention because of their uniqueness and neatness. However, it was the asymmetrical single seater swing, Cocoon, by Nishita Kamdar and Veeram Shah, that stood out. Made from teak wood, cane and brass accents, the piece stirred nostalgia and reminded one of the single-seater wooden swings in the aangan (lobby) of Indian homes — just with a hint of luxury. It reflected the idea of sitting completely at ease or reading a book with a lavish armrest to lean on.

For Sandeep, his collection isn’t just a piece of “good design” but also a result of his various questions to himself, the most important of them being, “Why do we make whatever we make?” He said, “How does an object add value to our already cluttered lives? Does it connect with us emotively, to transcend time and to sustain, not just physically but in our beings? Does it uplift us from our everyday monotony? Should objects be providing sustenance and livelihood to communities that make them? Should beautiful objects and good design be for a privileged few or is accessibility an important filter? In putting objects together for this show, we have considered these compelling questions. We paused to ask ourselves why we respond to certain objects and began digging deeper to uncover the stories behind them. We took a step back to think about what objects really have a ‘reason to exist’ — in these manic times of excessive consumption, transience and a depleting planet.”

If mindful living is the new credo, then there are more ideas to be inspired by at the design fair.

Less is more

A lagoon bed by Script would make one recall the minimalistic decor trends that have been ruling for a while. Products like storage beds, sofa-cum-beds, collapsible shelves and storage seaters have been in great demand and will continue to be, but here, we found some twists. The sound-absorbent bed, with acoustic foam on its sides, at the booth catered to aesthetic as well as functional needs. A small side table and a book shelf was attached to it and there was extra lumbar support for a comfortable seating — a perfect space optimisation, especially for the urban loft.

We came across a gender-neutral kids’ bedroom. With a subtle play of pastel green and blue, and grey, the bed had a hut-like slope on its head. On its corner, was a quirky desk attached to make study space a bit more exciting. With wooden panels on its other corner, it seemed as though little windows were attached to the bed’s end. An orange clock was hung on its side, the perfect angle of placing it in the room. Conceptualised by Habios, spokesperson Abu Laskar said, “The minimalistic trend seems to be rising. That is why we have brought such a kids’ bedroom this time, which occupied less space yet comprises more elements. We’re glad people are liking it.”

Glued to blue

We all know that the Pantone colour for 2020 is Classic Blue. The fair made the most of it. Almost every product had an accent — some minute, some overpowering.

Bathline had it all blue — right from the flooring to the ceramic basins. Said owner Mehak Jain, “Blue has been the favourite colour of bathrooms initially too and now the trend seems to be back.”

Next in line, Nivasa showcased how the colour is alluring but needs proper use. “The best part about this colour is that it can be used in various patterns, furniture, wallpaper, accessories and much more,” said the spokesperson.

Wildlife... save it to cherish or leave it to perish

Wooden plates shaped as turtles, silver-coloured crocodile sculptures, showpieces with animal prints, and many more such pieces that had in them an element of wildlife, seemed to have taken the centre stage. Lotus arts de vivre, a home-décor, jewellery and handbag company that deals with natural wood, exhibited the Spiriting Cheetah — its only installation — at the centre of the booth, called the Safari collection. Made from bamboo, iron and teak wood, the artwork was a major attraction for the viewers. “It weighs 100 kg. It took two months for us to prepare it,” said the spokesperson. Beside it, was a tree trunk, which appeared to have retained its original shape. On it lay a small silver cheetah and some silver-coloured artificial leaves. They have tried to retain the original texture of the wood so that it appears more natural.

The perfect match

The fair seemed to strike a balance between luxury and sustainability as a more mindful way of life. Sustainability will continue to define our choices in climate-challenged times.

Brands such as Emanate Homes and The Park Hotels exhibited transterior spaces, ones which are open and mix the interior with the exterior effortlessly to utilise a room in multiple ways. The French doors that allow natural lighting is another judicious way to utilise energy.

Edida India featured bamboo chairs, buckets, stools, chandeliers and mats. Hung on a teal blue wall, the products reflected this concept well. There were some carpets made from different coloured natural fibre, Sisal, and the leaves of agave plant, too.

Iqrup and Ritz’s peacock indoor cane chair was a perfect example of how durability and sustainability goes hand in hand. “We have attempted to span from limited-edition and luxe to mass-produced and accessible — each resonates with us as a piece of ‘good design’.”

Inspired by opera, an Ophelia table lamp, by Josmo studio, gave a setup of eclectic colours, transporting one to a theatre evening.

Back to the roots

Sustainability means that there has been a cultural shift back to tradition manifesting itself in tribal artforms, indigenous artworks and much more. A first timer brought Mata-ni-Pachedi paintings, a form of Gujarati Kalamkari.

What grabbed our attention were the Gond sculptures from Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, which were basically faces carved out of wood in the form of some protective deities. Besides it, the ‘Bhuta’ masks from Kerala, made from bronze metal casters, looked like a symbol of god. “It originated in Tulu district of South Karnataka where Bhuta is celebrated every year to honour local deities. We wanted to showcase all our works at a cultural level so that they represent the process that an Indian has gone through over the years,” said the mask-maker.

Jaipur Rugs, known for launching something new every year at the fair, exhibited a carpet with over 3,000 colours. It launched a new collection by Italian designer Matteo, Jaipur Wunderkammer. It was inspired by the designer’s visit to the city. A pink wool and viscose rug, showcasing ghungroos tied to a foot on its four sides, was inspired by a dance performance that the designer had seen at the Hawa Mahal. Lying on the floor was another brown-coloured carpet with orange linings and blue intersections. “It depicts the architecture of Jaipur’s various palaces through vintage doors and jharokas (windows). We set the trend every year,” said representative Vikas Chaudhary.

What’s Your Story, too, had a section of hand-knotted Kolam carpets inspired from ancient South Indian ritual of creating patterns with rice powder.

Well, when more than 20 architects and designers come together, objects have a reason to exist, are timeless and certainly add value to people’s everyday lives.

190,17-2-20,A confluence of music,"While continuing the legacy of their father, Ustaad Amjad Ali Khan, Amaan and Ayaan Ali Bangash have developed a grammar that makes the sarod more relevant to contemporary times. By Team Viva

What has been your creative process?

Amaan Ali Bangash: To be a musician is in itself a blessing as you are really not answerable to anyone but yourself. For the few hours when you are onstage, you are in a creative frenzy, sometimes supernaturally unreal. There are times when you get off stage only to realise that something special happened up there on stage that day.

Ayaan Ali Bangash: It’s a blessing to be in a profession where you love what you are doing. It is also non-debatable that music is indeed the best way to connect to that supreme power who we have never seen. Be it any religion, music has always been the pathway to spirituality. It’s therefore not time-bound but a part of a larger journey.

What would you say about the charm of Sufi music? Do you think it’s charm is still intact?

Amaan: Frankly there is no such thing or term as sufi music. Only the text can be sufi not the musical notes. Therefore the songs or compositions of course are within the same 12 notes of music. Though it’s a spiritual path for us, the text makes it sufi or otherwise.

Ayaan: The base is 13th century sufi songs composed by Amir Khusro. He was not just an Indian musician, scholar and poet but also an iconic figure in the cultural history of the Indian subcontinent. A sufi mystic and a spiritual disciple of Nizamuddin Auliya of Delhi, Amir Khusro was not only a notable poet but also a prolific and seminal musician. He wrote poetry primarily in Persian, but also in Hindavi. This album has us on the sarod and vocals along with the traditional qawwali singers who sing at Khusro’s shrine in Delhi. Qawwalis and folk songs, the most popular genres in the Khusro tradition, have kept his name alive among the masses for more than seven centuries. These are our interpretations.

What are the music trends of 2020?

Amaan: We have been very fortunate to have had a certain kind of a grooming where music for us wasn’t a profession but a way of life. Today there is talent in abundance but there is a lack of consistency. It’s a very long journey and one has to have patience, tolerance and perseverance. Having been reared on a diet of tradition and continuity, it’s difficult to be living in a modern world with classic values. Yet, we chose to belong to a system, where oral knowledge is passed on from guru to student along with actual music lessons.

How can emerging artistes imbibe traditions in their art?

Ayaan: We’re doing a lot of stuff ourselves. The instant success of any of these, as opposed to the long hours of dedication required in the traditional set up, sometimes stands in the way of progress. We think it’s great to imbibe cultures from all around the world but let’s not forget who we are or what we have to offer. We need to be, first and foremost, proud of ourselves. Let’s not get embarrassed about the Indian way.

How have you explored different music genres over the years?

Ayaan: It’s a great time for creativity. We recently heard a Jazz bhajan in a studio in Chennai. We have been very fortunate to have worked with some fabulous artists. Rahim Alhaj of course was the most recent one who is also a three time Grammy nominee. We have also collaborated with Derek Trucks, who is one of the top 10 guitarists in the world, at Savanaah Music Festival in Georgia as well as the Evelyn Glinnie, New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, Joe Walsh and many others. Every collaboration has had it own beauty, charm and journey.

Over the years, we feel very blessed to have received so much love and warmth from music lovers. It’s always both inspiring and challenging to perform here. We look forward to the concerts with Sharon Isbin. The idea is to achieve a cross-fertilisation at both the cellular and cosmic levels of two classical music traditions, which are often held to be radically different.

Amaan: Our goal through this process is to engage and celebrate the shared and discrete musical “DNA” of both traditions from a perspective of abundance. This is a blissful dream of a project, infused with the unique amalgamated contributions of artistes united under a common aegis, regardless of their diverse background, cultures, traditions, generations, genders, religions, upbringing, and career paths. I am looking forward to our concerts coming up with Singapore Chinese Orchestra and Chicago Philharmonic Orchestra.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-confluence-of-music-2020-02-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-confluence-of-music.html
191,17-2-20,Circle around Sonam,"Sonam Sherpa, founding member and the lead guitarist of the Indian rock band Parikrama, passed away at the age of 48 on Friday. Although no cause of death was specified in the official tweet, an online portal quoted a bandmate saying that Sherpa had suffered a cardiac arrest.

Among the first to offer condolences was actor-singer Farhan Akhtar, who has performed with the guitarist. He took to Instagram to pay tribute, along with a picture of himself with Sherpa. “In 2008, post Rock On!!, I was part of a four city tour with the amazing Parikrama and I can never forget or adequately say how thankful I am for the love and warmth that he extended to this first timer on stage. He was a gifted guitarist, a supremely cool and a true rock star. RIP brother. Deepest condolences to his family,” wrote Farhan.

He was born in the West Bengal hill town of Kalimpong on October 8, 1971. Along with Subir Malik, he formed Parikrama in Delhi on June 17, 1991. The band’s memorable songs include But it rained, Till I’m no one again, Open skies, Whiskey blues, Am I dreaming and Superhero.

The band’s 1996 single, But it rained, made it to the list of “25 Greatest Indian Rock Songs Of The Last 25 Years” of Rolling Stone India.

Nitin Malik, vocals, Parikrama says, “We (Subir Malik, Sherpa and I, started the journey together in 1991. Sonam meant so much to all of us. To him, the most important thing was to have fun but at the same time, I’ve never seen a more disciplined musicians. He would practise a difficult piece through the night and could show up for a session at four in the morning. He was certainly the best musician among us all. He was like family. In a band, you end up travelling more with the members than you would ever do with your own family. Every outstation concert was like a vacation for us as we had so much fun together. We were almost like, to use a cliche, a band of brothers. We were the first ones to be there in case of an emergency. Even right now Subir is with the family in Kalimpong.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/circle-around-sonam-2020-02-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/circle-around-sonam.html
192,17-2-20,A ray of hope,"Ravindra Chhagan Chaudhary worked tirelessly to combat malnourishment by tackling the attendant causes. By Amol Gutte

Ravindra Chhagan Chaudhary, 29, lives with his two children in a joint family in Toranmal Dhadgaon, Nandurbar. He has worked extensively in his area to fight against malnutrition. After completing his SSC Board exams, he started assisting other villagers’ in everyday governance.

Toranmal is an area whose primary residents are Adivasis. The number of malnourished children is staggering despite UNICEF, Shabari, CORO and a number of organisations having joined hands to end the problem which continued to persist.

Ravindra’s journey

Ravindra was an avid reader since childhood. It helped him to understand the social realities around him better. He developed a social conscience and was acutely distressed about the issues around him. The chronic malnutrition in Nandurbar troubled him even more when a close relative’s daughter was diagnosed with it. No one around him even knew the word at the time. With the help of the local Primary Health Centre and Anganwadi workers, he tried to decode this word and, also, resolve the issue. Ravindra resolved to create a generation of adivasis who were not only aware of malnutrition, but also free from it. At about the same time, Shabari Foundation was working to boost the levels of nutrition in the village. Ravindra joined hands with their effort and this was the beginning of a decade and a half long fight for children’s nutritional rights in his village.

Ravindra’s work and the issues in Toranmal

Ravindra procured a list of all the malnourished children in the village with the help of Anganwadi sevikas. Most of the children in his neighbourhood weren’t even registered in the local Anganwadi. He visited every house which had a malnourished child. He started peer counseling and told every family about malnourishment and its grave effects. He realised that nourishment was intrinsically related to other social realities in the village as well. Early marriage and pregnancy, toiling day and night for earning a decent livelihood, delay in breastfeeding children due to erratic work hours, lack of appropriate nourishment, were the chronic and interlinked reasons for the malnourishment. Over a time, he slowly started exploring ideas of nourishment and nutrition from the Anganwadi sevikas.

To break this cycle, with the help of his peer circle, he started opposing child marriage in his area. When they went together and in large numbers, most houses were willing to listen and started coming on board. Together, they started keeping a vigilant eye on every child born in the area. Their weight, food intake and the frequency of breastfeeding were strictly monitored through peer counseling and home visits. Another area of focus was the mother’s nutritional intake, cleanliness and breastfeeding practices. In this manner, every child’s growth and progress was monitored and the community also felt involved in the solution.

Every three months, Ravindra addresses at least a hundred houses. Ravindra and his group counselled families who migrated for work and requested them to not to take their child along. He insisted that this was a question of the child’s rights.

Impact of his work

Ravindra’s work inspired the youth around him. Some of them started this work from their own families. Since children were the focus, they also took up other child rights-related issues with the help of the Gram Panchayat. They’ve had to continually face the resistance from blind-faith and ignorant mindsets, but they persisted working for child rights without losing hope or conviction. Most children whose families were counselled by Ravindra have been declared malnutrition-free. Now, he’s turned his attention towards the neighbouring villages. Seeing the students now, one can easily see hope and aspiration in the community.

Plans Ahead

Ravindra wants to start and organisation in collaboration with the local youth and get it registered. This would focus extensively on children’s rights. Going beyond peer counseling, they now want to create decent and dignified livelihood opportunities in Nandurbar itself. They’re hoping livelihood would address both economic and social realities which form the root cause of malnutrition in the area. They want to make Toranmal a self-reliant village, leveraging the experience they’ve gathered from working with different organisations over the years.

Ravindra’s Message

Ravindra is firmly convinced that each one of us needs to work hand in hand to end malnutrition. Only then will our future generations and our nation will have able and strong-willed citizens.

His efforts have significantly reduced malnutrition in Toranmal and have paved the way for creating a healthier future. His work is inspirational as it creates a possibility for a healthier, happier life for children in his area.

193,17-2-20,"Restore divinity, improve the world","The presence of demoniacal qualities in humans results in sorrow and sufferings for the individual and his surroundings, says Rajyogi Brahmakumar Nikunj Ji

According to scriptures, there are 36 divine qualities in a human being (36 gun). If one does not possess any one out of these, it means s/he has the opposite — demoniacal qualities — which result in sorrow and sufferings. Most people do not know that the absence of these qualities is the major cause of misery. They, therefore, try to find out its cause in political, economic, cultural or social system. The truth, however, is that positive or negative qualities manifest themselves through human behaviour or activity, whether it be political, economic, cultural or any social activity. One should, therefore, try to trace the negativity and work for positivity rather than searching for the cause elsewhere.

Society has made progress in various fields but emotionally it is much weaker than before. Man has not been able to control his impulsiveness, ambitions, anger and anxiety. Imbalance has been created by rapid advancement in science and technology on the one hand and lack or absence of parallel progress in emotional maturity, self-control and ethics on the other hand. This has resulted in many problems that we are facing today. It can thus be said that the qualities in a person determine the quality of his/her life whether it is peaceful and happy or peaceless and sorrowful. But, it is a pity that people are trying to find happiness in ruling over big territories, possessing a large amount of property or wealth. Therefore all efforts are directed towards economic prosperity even at the cost of adopting demoniac qualities. People try to achieve success, name and fame or political and economic power even if the soul has to give up divine qualities. This has, evidently, led to corruption of the soul, degeneration of the society and to disturbance and sufferings. If we accept this analysis of our present predicament, then we have to admit that our moral values and divine qualities have fallen and what we require today is to extricate and uplift ourselves from this situation with the help of education that can restore these. All our other efforts to make the world a better place to live in would be of no avail until and unless there is a qualitative change in our nature and behaviour. Complete peace, it should be remembered, comes from complete purity or divine nature. Even a fraction of one demoniacal quality leads to lessening of peace in that proportion if not more. It should also be noted that demoniacal qualities have linkages among themselves even as divine qualities are connected among themselves and strengthen and sustain each other. So liberation from one negative quality leads to at least some liberation from other negative qualities. Thus even our little effort to inculcate, in ourselves, some divine qualities leads ultimately to a great over-all change in our nature and results in enhancement in the quality of our inner happiness. One must, therefore, in one’s own interest and in that of building a better world, pay attention to the task of restoration of divine qualities and elimination of the devilish qualities or negative traits. In doing this lies the hope of our own liberation and improvement of the world-conditions.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/restore-divinity--improve-the-world-2020-02-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/restore-divinity--improve-the-world.html
194,17-2-20,Camellia moves farther north,"The evergreen East Asian shrub spreads its single, semi-double or double blossoms up to five inches during fall, winter or early spring. However, it differs with relation to the level of cold it can tolerate, say experts

Remind me not to plant camellias. Not that camellias (Camellia japonica) aren’t wonderful plants, with their elegant, sometimes fragrant, blossoms and their glossy, evergreen foliage. But where I garden, with winter lows dipping to minus 20 degrees fahrenheit, it’s just too dang cold for camellias — outdoors, at least. Still, some new, relatively cold-hardy varieties are bringing camellias farther North than they used to grow.

SOME TOLERATE MORE COLD THAN OTHERS

Camellias are among the Southern belles that I and many other gardeners contending with frigid winters long for. (Two other favourites of mine are southern magnolia and gardenia. I can just imagine the fragrance of a full-size gardenia in bloom near my terrace!). Camellias are generally considered to be reliably cold-hardy where temperatures stay above about 10 degrees fahrenheit. Even there, they are occasionally burned back by cold or killed.

Most of the 2,000-plus varieties are so-called Japanese camellias. They are the ones that spread their single, semi-double or double blossoms up to five inches in diameter in fall, winter or early spring. In mild winter climates, this plant might grow 20 feet high. Varieties differ in how much cold they can tolerate, with Lady Clare, White Empress, Bernice Boddy, Governor Mouton, Kumasaka and Pink Perfection being among the toughest.

NEW, COLD-HARDIER CAMELLIAS

Sasanqua camellia, another species (C. sasanqua), is cold-hardy below zero but not much below zero. It has smaller flowers, leaves and stature than Japanese camellias, and a more lax and open growth habit. Still, it would be folly to try growing either sasanqua camellia or Japanese camellia this far North.

My near foray into the world of camellias can be blamed on William Ackerman, a plant breeder at the US National Arboretum. We can also blame Maryland’s frigid winter of 1977 because that winter decimated most of the arboretum’s camellia collection, survivors spurred interest in cold-hardier camellias.

Among the survivors of that 1977 onslaught was a variety of Tea Oil camellia (C. oleifera ) named Lu Shan Snow. Although Tea Oil camellia is not particularly hardy, Lu Shan Snow is, and Ackerman incorporated it into bloodlines for the super-hardy camellias he developed. Lu Shan Snow, incidentally, was a find in its own right. Its fragrant flowers appear in late fall or in colder areas, early spring. The plant tolerates temperatures to minus 10 degrees fahrenheit!

Ackerman’s hybrids are a bit hardier than even Lu Shan Snow, down to about minus 12 degrees. They blossom in fall, the blossoming season lasting a month or more and beginning at a very young age. These new hybrid varieties include Polar Ice, Snow Flurry, Winter’s Hope, Winter’s Rose, Winter’s Star, and Winter’s Charm.

ATTENTION TO SITE AND SOIL

Cold-hardy or not, camellia is not the kind of plant you just stick in the ground and then watch grow. These plants demand an acidic soil that is high in humus and moisture but well drained and low in fertility. They also enjoy a bit of shade as well as shelter from winter winds, the latter, especially important the further north camellias are planted. An organic mulch is a must.

These conditions are almost the same as those enjoyed by mountain laurels and rhododendron’s. A camellia would look nice in the partially shaded bed of rhododendron’s and mountain laurels I planted near my house. I’m tempted but I don’t want to push the limits of a camellia’s cold endurance. Just a little more cold-hardiness please.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/camellia-moves-farther-north-2020-02-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/camellia-moves-farther-north.html
195,17-2-20,City’s ban shocks Klopp,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said on Saturday he felt a sense of “shock” after Premier League rivals Manchester City were hit with a two-season ban from European football.

“It was a shock,” said Klopp, whose Champions League title holders are well on the way to succeeding City as champions of England.

“Complete wow. The only thing I can say is about football,” added the German as he expressed sympathy for City counterpart Pep Guardiola.

“What they have done on the football pitch is exceptional. The rest, I don’t know.

“You believe the people you work with, that’s how it is,” added Klopp.

“I really feel for them, Pep and the players, but that is how it is. They can appeal so we will see what happens then. It is obviously serious.

“But the football they played was exceptional and will always be exceptional,” insisted Klopp.

Meanwhile former City midfielder Joe Barton said it would be a blow to English football if his old club’s European ban was upheld.

“I don’t like the thought of seeing City not in the Champions League,” said Barton, now the manager of third-tier Fleetwood.

“With that level of a manager and players...you have to be in Europe’s major competition.

196,17-2-20,De Villiers needs to prove himself to earn T20 World Cup place: Boucher,"The retired AB de Villiers will be considered for a place in the South African T20 World Cup squad only if he shows good form and proves himself to be the ""best man for the job"", says the team's head coach Mark Boucher.

Soon after taking charge as South Africa's head coach in December last year, Boucher said he may try to persuade a few recent retirees, including de Villiers, to return to the South Africa squad ahead of the T20 World Cup to be held in Australia in October-November.

""He's (de Villiers) a discussion in the media and in the public but he is no discussion for me. I have had chats with him and we will probably know pretty soon what's going to happen with him,"" Boucher said after South Africa's 1-2 defeat to England in the just-concluded three-match T20 series at home.

""Like I said from day one when I took over, if we are going to a World Cup, I would like to have our best players there.

""If AB is in good form and he is raring to go and he makes himself available for the time we have asked him to be available; if he is the best man for the job, then he must go,"" he added.

Boucher said ""ego"" would not come in the way of taking de Villiers back, whose previous request for a comeback before last year's ODI World Cup was turned down by the then team management and the national selectors.

""It's not about egos or anything like that, it's about sending your best team to the World Cup to try and win that competition,"" he added.

197,17-2-20,Du Plessis quits as South Africa captain,"Senior batsman Faf du Plessis on Monday stepped down as captain of South Africa's Test and T20 teams with immediate effect.

Du Plessis was rested for the three-match T20 series against England which South Africa lost 1-2 on Sunday.

The decision comes less than a week from the start of South Africa's T20 campaign against Australia.

Du Plessis, who gave away the ODI captaincy to wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock, for the recent series against England, said he took the decision to help South Africa start a new era.

""In a perfect world I would have loved to lead the team in the Tests for the rest of the season as well as the T20 World Cup,"" du Plessis said in a statement.

""But sometimes the most important attribute of a leader is to be selfless.

The training camp started on Monday and will end on March 3.

This will be her second stint at the NBA Global Academy after attending a camp from November 7 to 24 last year.

""I am thrilled to go back to The NBA Global Academy in what will be yet another opportunity for me to sharpen my skills further,"" said Harsimran.

""My first camp in November 2019 gave me a lot of insight on various aspects of my game and how I can improve. I expect this camp to help me find a clear pathway to make it to professional ranks.""

The 16-year-old will travel to Canberra from Chicago after attending the sixth annual Basketball Without Borders (BWB) Global Camp, which was held from February 14 to February 16 at Quest Multisport as part of the NBA All-Star 2020.

During her time in Canberra, Harsimran will participate in practices, three-on-three scrimmages and weight training sessions alongside top Australian prospects and under the guidance of coaches from the NBA Academy and Basketball Australia's Centre of Excellence.

She was one of 64 prospects from more than 30 countries that participated in BWB Global as a part of NBA All-Star 2020.

Harsimran was named MVP at the third NBA Academies women's program camp held in Mumbai from October 2 to 5.

The youth player from Punjab has represented India at multiple events, including the 3x3 Asian Championships held in Jakarta in August 2019.

200,17-2-20,Trump''s India visit preparations show ''slave mentality'': Sena,"The Shiv Sena on Monday said the Ongoing preparation for the much awaited visit of US President Donald Trump is a reflection of the ""slave mentality"" of Indians.

Trump's India trip is like the visit of a ""Badshah"" (emperor), an editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' said.

Taking a dig at the construction of a wall on a plot having several slum structures in Ahmedabad ahead of Trump's visit there, the Sena said the US president's trip would neither stop the fall of rupee's value in forex market nor offer betterment to those (slum dwellers) behind the wall.

""Before Independence, British King or Queen used to visit one of their slave nations like India. The kind of preparations going on from taxpayers' money for the arrival of Trump is similar to it. This reflects the slave mentality of Indians,"" it said.

The Sena also took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation's (AMC) move to build wall on a plot to ""hide the slums"" on the route through which Trump's convoy would pass.

""Former prime minister Indira Gandhi had once given the slogan 'Garibi Hatao', which was ridiculed for a long time. It seems now Modi's plan is 'Garibi chupao' (hide poverty),"" the Marathi publication said.

Is there any financial allocation for such a wall being built in Ahmedabad? Is the US going to offer loan to India to build such walls across the country? it wondered.

""We have heard Trump is going to be in Ahmedabad for only three hours but the wall construction is costing almost Rs 100 crore to the state exchequer,"" it said.

It is basically a political arrangement between Prime Minister Modi and US President Trump, the Sena claimed.

Last year, 'Howdy, Modi!' (a mega event jointly addressed by the Indian prime minister and Trump) was organised in the US, it noted.

A similar programme, ""Kem Chho Trump"" (Gujarati expression for how are you Trump), has been now organised (in Ahmedabad) ahead of the US elections, chiefly because of a sizable number of Gujarati people living in America, the Shiv Sena claimed.

""But this visit of President Trump is neither going to stop further fall of rupee in the forex market nor offer betterment to those behind the wall (being built in front of slums in Ahmedabad),"" it said.

The Sena said Trump is ""not someone very wise or a statesman or someone who cares for the whole world"", but he has to be treated with respect as he represents the mighty US.

""Sometimes you have to treat someone with respect to get your things done,"" it quipped.

The AMC on Friday said the construction of the wall, around four feet in height, was approved much before Trump's Gujarat visit was finalised.

Trump is scheduled to visit Modi's home state Gujarat on February 24.

He will visit the famous Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad and take part in a roadshow with Modi. After that, the two leaders will inaugurate a new cricket stadium in Motera and address a gathering there, with an expected audience of over a lakh people.

While it was earlier speculated that the programme would be called 'Kem Chho Trump', the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation on Sunday tweeted a series of posters confirming that the event is now christened as 'Namaste Trump', apparently to give it a pan-India appeal.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump--s-india-visit-preparations-show---slave-mentality----sena-2020-02-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/trump--s-india-visit-preparations-show---slave-mentality----sena.html

A bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud rejected the Centre's argument of physiological limitations and social norms for denying them permanent commission and command postings, saying it is disturbing and against the concept of equality.

The bench said women officers in the past have brought laurels to the country and change of mindset is required on the part of the government to put an end to gender bias in armed forces.

203,17-2-20,Mane Man,"Jurgen Klopp described his team’s 25-point lead at the top of the Premier League as “insane” after Sadio Mane struck to give Liverpool a 1-0 win at storm-hit Norwich on Saturday.

The champions-elect were short of their fluent best in blustery conditions caused by Storm Dennis at Carrow Road but returned immediately to winning ways after their winter break.

They have now gone 43 top-flight matches unbeaten, just six behind Arsenal’s record of 49 games in 2003-04 and are sprinting towards their first league title for 30 years.

Liverpool have earned 103 points from the past 105 available to them in the Premier League, winning 34 of their past 35 matches, and have one more point — 76 — than Manchester United accrued in winning the league in 1996/97.

Klopp said the wind and Norwich’s organisation made it a tricky game but that his players remained calm.

“I could tell in all the players’ faces that they weren’t nervous, they were enjoying it, and if one team was going to score it was going to be us,” he told Sky Sports.

“We protected against the counter-attack well too. It’s really all about these wonderful football players.

“The gap is so insane, I don’t really understand it. I’m not smart enough. I’ve not had that before. It’s outstanding, it’s so difficult. I go back into the changing room and we chat about the things and then I’m like’oh, but congratulations. We won the game, another three points’.”

The result leaves Daniel Farke’s Norwich rooted to the bottom of the table, six points behind 19th-placed Watford. They look set for an immediate return to the Championship despite their battling performance.

Klopp brought back midfielder Naby Keita for his first start in a Premier League match since December and Mane was on the bench as Liverpool started full of confidence.

The visitors controlled possession in the early stages without creating many clear-cut openings but Norwich managed some brief spells of attractive passing football themselves.

Liverpool forward Roberto Firmino was particularly impressive, producing an exquisite piece of skill to control a long Jordan Henderson pass before the ball was stolen off his toes as he shaped to shoot.

But Farke’s men kept Liverpool quiet and came close to snatching the lead themselves.

Mane breaks deadlock

Liverpool were quickly on top again in the second half but struggled to create clear chances until Keita tested Tim Krul from distance in the 58th minute.

Keita should have done better when he reacted quickly to a rebound off Krul but the goalkeeper dived to his right to deny the Guinea international.

Alexander Tettey almost caught Becker out on a rare Norwich foray into the Liverpool half, thundering a shot against the near post as the home crowd roared their team on.

Just when it seemed Norwich could become only the second team this season, after Manchester United, to deny Liverpool all three points, Mane broke the deadlock.

The second-half substitute controlled a long ball from Henderson with his right foot in the 78th minute before lashing home with his left.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mane-man-2020-02-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mane-man.html
204,17-2-20,Morgan takes Eng to series win,"England captain Eoin Morgan went on a six-hitting spree to take his side to a series win in a high-scoring third and final Twenty20I against South Africa at SuperSport Park on Sunday.

Morgan slammed seven sixes in an innings of 57 not out off 22 balls as England chased down South Africa’s 222 for six with five wickets and five balls to spare.

“It’s a nice note to leave this tour on,” said Morgan.

But Morgan had sympathy for the bowlers on a day when a capacity crowd were peppered with 28 sixes as the batsmen took advantage of a true pitch and the thin air of the South African highveld.

“It was a helluva game,” said Morgan. “You have to commend both sides’ bowlers. It’s not the easiest ground to bowl on, especially with a wicket like this.”

Heinrich Klaasen, playing in his first match of the South African home international season, hit 66 off 33 balls for the hosts after Temba Bavuma (49) and captain Quinton de Kock (35) hammered 84 for the first wicket off 46 balls.

“When any side posts 220 it’s a tough ask but going back to the 2016 World Cup with this group of players we chased down 230 against South Africa in Mumbai. So we always had this belief,” added Morgan.

Jason Roy was out early but Jos Buttler (57) and Jonny Bairstow (64) put on 91 off 50 balls for the second wicket to put England in a strong position.

But 78 runs were still needed off 38 balls when Dawid Malan was fourth out with the total on 145.

Ben Stokes joined Morgan and the pair added 61 off 27 balls before Stokes was caught on the boundary with 17 still needed off 11 balls.

Morgan hit two sixes off successive balls from Lungi Ngidi in the same over and the contest was effectively ended.

Morgan was named man of the match and man of the series after pipping opposite number De Kock as the leading run-scorer in the series.

“We knew it would be a high-scoring game but we’re a bit disappointed not to get over the line,” said De Kock.

“We had mixed emotions (after the first innings), the guys were confident but we knew it was a great wicket.”

It was the last match for England after a tour in which they won a four-match Test series and shared a one-day series.

South Africa will be back in action on Friday when they play Australia in Johannesburg in the first of three Twenty20 internationals, which will be followed by three one-day internationals.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/morgan-takes-eng-to-series-win.html
205,17-2-20,B’desh axe Mahmudullah for Zim Test,"Bangladesh have dropped batsman Mahmudullah and recalled pace bowler Mustafizur Rahman for the one-off Test against Zimbabwe starting next Saturday.

Wicketkeeper-batsman Mushfiqur Rahim also returns to the side for the Dhaka match after opting out of the Test against Pakistan earlier this month over safety concerns.

The 16-member squad named on Sunday has four changes from the team that lost to Pakistan by an innings and 44 runs in Rawalpindi.

Spinner Mehidy Hasan and pacer Taskin Ahmed are back after recovering from injury while batsman Soumya Sarkar, pacers Rubel Hossain and Al-Amin Hossain were dropped.

Batsman Yasir Ali Chowdhury and fast bowler Hasan Mahmud are the two uncapped players in the squad.

“I believe we have selected the best possible Test squad under present circumstances. There is a very nice blend of experience and potential,” chairman of the selection panel, Minhajul Abedin said.

“It is unfortunate that some players had to miss out but our priority has been to ensure balance and continuity. We felt that Mahmudullah needed a break from the red ball.”

Mahmudullah has scored only one half-century since making 146 runs against New Zealand in March 2019.

Bangladesh are currently on a bad run of form in Tests, losing their last six matches — three of them by an innings margin.

The hosts will also play three one-day and two Twenty20s in the upcoming series in March.

Squad: Mominul Haque (captain), Tamim Iqbal, Saif Hassan, Najmul Hossain, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mohammad Mithun, Liton Das, Taijul Islam, Abu Jayed, Nayeem Hasan, Ebadat Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Mehidy Hasan, Mustafizur Rahman, Hasan Mahmud, Yasir Ali.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/b---desh-axe-mahmudullah-for-zim-test.html
206,17-2-20,India will play D,"India will play a day-night Test during their much-anticipated tour of Australia later this year, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly said on Sunday.

This comes a month after captain Virat Kohli asserted that his team was ready to play a day-night Test anywhere in Australia.

“Yes, India will play a Day/Night Test in Australia. A formal announcement will be made soon,” BCCI president Sourav Ganguly said.

Ganguly, a former captain, also said that the second Test of the next home series against England will be a day-night affair. He added that the Board will try to have at least one day-night Test in each series moving forward.

India played their maiden day-night Test against Bangladesh last November at the Eden Gardens, winning the match quite comfortably with plenty of time to spare.

While the venue has not been finalised yet, the pink ball game is likely to be held in either Adelaide or Perth. Hosting the game in one of these venues makes sense given the better time slot for Indian broadcast audience.

On the eve of India’s three-match ODI series opener at home against Australia last month, Kohli had said, “We’re ready and up for the challenge — whether it’s Gabba, Perth... It doesn’t matter to us. It’s become a very exciting feature of any Test series and we’re open to playing day-night Tests.”

India declined Australia’s offer to play a day-night Test in Adelaide in 2018-19, citing lack of experience.

However, with day-night match seen as a possible answer to Test cricket’s dwindling attendances, Australia had been hoping that India will agree to play one game at the Gabba this year.

A Cricket Australia (CA) delegation met top BCCI officials on the sidelines of a limited-overs series in January with the day-night Test figuring on the agenda.

Meanwhile, it is also learnt that India is set to play three ODIs and three T20Is in Sri Lanka after the IPL.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-will-play-d-n-test-in-aus.html

Heavy downpour resulted in the match being called off without the toss being held at the Allan Border Field, days of the showpiece starting February 21.

India will face West Indies in their second and final warm-up game at the same ground on February 18 (Tuesday).

The T20 World Cup will begin on February 21 with a mouth-watering contest between the Indian women and current champions and four-time winners Australia women in Sydney.

Elsewhere, England defeated New Zealand by six wickets in Adelaide in their first official warm-up game.

Australia’s preparations were also hampered as they were unable to play their warm-up match against the West Indies here on Saturday due to a wet outfield.

208,17-2-20,Agarwal not thinking about poor run of form,"India’s Mayank Agarwal avoided fretting about what went wrong during his wretched run on the tour of New Zealand, which he finally ended with a morale-boosting 81 in a warm-up game on Sunday.

Prior to his latest knock, Agarwal’s series of scores read 8, 32, 29, 37, 24, 0, 0, 32, 3, 1, 1, raising questions about his confidence going into the two-Test series against the Black Caps.

“It’s been a little different playing here but I want to leave all that behind. Whatever has happened has happened. Yes, I got an 81 in the second innings of this practice game and I want to take this confidence forward into the Test match,” Agarwal told reporters.

While he wasn’t keen on dissecting what went wrong, Agarwal did say that he had sessions with batting coach Vikram Rathour to sort out the technical glitches that might have cropped into his batting.

“Vikram sir and me, we have sat down and spoken about the areas where we need to improve. Yes, we have worked on it. After I got out in the first innings, I went back behind to the nets, did a lot of drills. I am happy whatever I have worked on is coming good now.”

When asked about the specifics, he said that one of the issues was his closed stance.

“Just being a little too closed. That’s just one part of it. But it is what it is and I don’t want to discuss too much about it. Yes, we worked on and we’ve moved forward and I would leave all that behind.

“It’s just one of those things that has happened while batting and I am glad that we are able to rectify it and move ahead.”

Agarwal believed in letting bygones be bygones and wants to now cash in on the new-found form.

“There’s no point thinking about what’s happened. Obviously, I can’t bring that back. The last thing I can tell myself is yes, I have got 81 not out here and I can carry that into the Test match.”

So what exactly is his go to shot which tells him that he is in the groove?

“I got a couple of on-drives in this innings and as a batsman, you know that you have to be doing a lot of things correct to hit an on-drive. When I got a couple of those, it gave me the assurance that was required.”

Agarwal and Prithvi Shaw are likely to be the new opening pair in Wellington and the latter is confident that communication between them will work wonders for him.

“We (him and Shaw) have played a lot of cricket together and we have a good understanding. Whatever needs to be communicated between us, we do that,” he concluded.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/agarwal-not-thinking-about-poor-run-of-form.html
209,17-2-20,"Mayank, Pant back among runs","Mayank Agarwal found form on his birthday and Rishabh Pant mixed caution with his customary aggression as India’s warm-up fixture against New Zealand XI ended in a draw at Seddon Park on Sunday.

The match was called off an hour after lunch with India reaching 252 for four just 48 overs into their second innings.

Agarwal, who had gone through a wretched period since the second Test against Bangladesh, retired on 81 off 99 balls with 10 fours and three sixes to his name.

To the relief of the Indian team management, Pant played in his customary manner to reach 70 off 65 balls, but also showed discretion when the opposition bowlers were in the midst of a good spell.

There were four sixes — two each off leg-spinner Ish Sodhi and off-spinner Henry Cooper.

While Sodhi was hit down the ground, Cooper was dispatched over extra cover on a couple of occasions. He didn’t curb his aggression though; there were times when he was ready to defend against the spinners and also leave some of the deliveries that the Kiwi pacers bowled.

Even though Pant is easily the better batsman compared to his senior Wriddhiman Saha, the innings might have come too late in the day considering that the latter is a better keeper and possibly a more responsible batsman in pressure situations.

The biggest positive to have emerged from the New Zealand second innings is Agarwal’s poor run coming to an end. The Seddon Park track easing out was definitely a factor but Agarwal’s footwork was more assured as he played some glorious on-drives and pull-shots off fast bowlers.

Before this game, Agarwal had played 10 competitive games including first-class, ODIs and List A matches and couldn’t cross the 40-run mark in 11 completed innings. He even bagged a pair against New Zealand A in an unofficial Test match.

Once he had got his form back, he didn’t come out to bat after lunch giving Saha an opportunity to score an unbeaten 30, his runs coming mostly against non-regular bowlers.

The Agarwal-Pant pair added 100 runs in 14.3 overs and it also helped that part-timers like Cooper was introduced into the action.

In the morning, Prithvi Shaw (39 off 31 balls) was bowled through the gate by Daryl Mitchell as the batsman left a gaping hole between his bat and pad.

Shaw, though, seemed to have done enough during his brisk 72-run stand with Agarwal, which could put an end to the debate around the opening slot even though the tracks in Wellington and Christchurch could be a test of technique for the flamboyant Mumbaikar. It was a match that Shubman Gill would perhaps like to forget in a hurry as he was dismissed cheaply for the second time in a row. He scored 8 before Daryl Mitchell trapped him leg before.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mayank--pant-back-among-runs-2020-02-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mayank--pant-back-among-runs.html

Labour Party MP Debbie Abraham's charge of a valid visa was rebutted by India's Home ministry which said she was informed about her e-visa being cancelled.

Abrahams, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group for Kashmir, said she was travelling on a valid e-visa to India to visit family and friends but her visa was revoked without explanation.

A Home Ministry spokesperson in New Delhi said the British parliamentarian had been duly informed that her visa was cancelled and she arrived Delhi despite knowing this.

When contacted, Abrahams told PTI she ""had not received any emails before February 13"". After that, she had been travelling and was away from office.

Her office in the UK confirmed she was put on a plane to Dubai, which is where she flew into Delhi from earlier on Monday.

Her e-visa was reportedly issued last October, and was valid until October 2020.

Recounting her experience at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport, she said in a statement on Twitter that she arrived here on Monday morning and was informed that her e-visa been cancelled.

In her statement, Abrahams said she had presented herself at the immigration desk along with her documents and e-visa.

""...The official looked at his screen and started shaking his head. Then he told me my visa was rejected took my passport and disappeared for about 10 minutes.

""When he came back he was very rude and aggressive shouting at me to 'come with me'. I told him not to speak to me like that and was then taken to a cordoned off area marked as a Deportee Cell. He then ordered me to sit down and I refused. I didn't know what they might do or where else they may take me, so I wanted people to see me,"" the British MP said.

She said later several immigration officials came to her but none of them knew why her e-visa was cancelled. ""Even the person who seemed to be in charge said he didn't know and was really sorry about what had happened.""

Abrahams was among a group of MPs who issued formal letters following the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370 in August last year.

It also appealed to the Centre ""not to discriminate"" on the basis of religion in granting citizenship to anyone.

The Cabinet, chaired by Chief Minister Rao, felt the CAA would lead to discrimination on the basis of religion in grant of citizenship and jeopardise secularism envisaged in the Constitution.

“The Cabinet further requested the central government to take measures to abrogate the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 which will lead to discrimination on the basis of religion while granting citizenship and thereby jeopardising secularism envisaged in the constitution,” the release said.

The state Cabinet decided to pass the anti-CAA resolution in the state assembly on the lines of the ones passed by Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan and West Bengal, it said.

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar was initially of the view that the petitioner ought to have filed a civil suit if he was seeking compensation as the claims made by him would have to be proved through evidence which cannot be done in a writ petition.

""These are matters of evidence. Why are you not filing a suit for damages? On the basis of annexures in a writ, claims cannot be proved,"" the court said and added that ""it has become a fashion in Delhi to file a writ for everything"".

However, the bench subsequently issued notices to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the university, the Delhi government and the police seeking their stand on the plea in which the student has alleged his both legs got fractured in the ""brutal violence carried out"" by security personnel.

In his plea filed through advocate Nabila Hasan, Shayaan Mujeeb has contended that he was in the university library on December 15, 2019 studying, when police personnel entered the building and allegedly beat up the students there.

Hasan told the bench available CCTV footage show the police entering the library and beating up the students.

Apart from seeking a Rs 2-crore compensation for the injuries suffered, Mujeeb has also sought registration of an FIR for the offences allegedly committed by the police.

The petitioner has also sought reimbursement of Rs 2 lakh, claiming he spent the amount on treatment of his broken legs, in one of which a rod has to be inserted due to the severity of the fracture.

Earlier, another student, Mohd Minhajuddin, had moved a plea seeking a probe into the incident and demanding compensation for injuries he suffered.

Minhajuddin, according to his plea, lost vision in one eye in the incident.

On December 15 last year, a protest against the CAA near Jamia turned violent, with demonstrators pelting stones at police and setting public buses and private vehicles on fire.

Police later entered the university, firing teargas shells and baton-charging students.

226,17-2-20,"Firm on Art 370, CAA despite pressure: PM","Modi lays foundation of 50 projects worth Rs 1,254 crore

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said his Government took major decisions, including abolition of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir and introduction of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the best interest of the nation and added that on such issues “hum kaayam hain aur aage bhi kaayam rehenge” (we’re firm and will remain firm on our stand)”, giving a clear message to all those who are opposing the same in various parts of the country.

Though Modi did not name Shaheen Bagh while addressing a public meeting after inaugurating the first phase of Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyay Smriti Sthal at trans-Ganga Parao and about 50 projects worth over Rs 1,254 crores, apart from flagging off the Kashi-Mahakal Express here on Sunday afternoon, he gave a clear message that his Government is determined on the CAA.

Not only this, in an earlier address at the Jangambadi Math, where he released the Shree Siddhanth Sikhamani Granth in 19 languages and Shivshree Vedika mobile app, Modi said, “It’s an important period in history when all hurdles delaying the construction of grand Ram Temple in Ayodhya were removed and the Government had also handed over its acquired 67 acres of land to the Ram Janambhoomi Kshetra Trust apart from being development of Kashi Vishwanath Dham in this holy city.”

“Be it the scrapping of Article 370 from Jammu & Kashmir or the Citizenship Amendment Act, the country waited for decisions on these for years,” he told a public meeting here during a day-long visit to his Lok Sabha constituency.

“These decisions were necessary in the interest of the nation. Duniya bhar ke saarey dababo ke bawjood, inn faislon par hum qayam hain aur qayam rahengey (Despite pressure from all sides, we remain firm on these decisions and will continue to remain firm,” Modi said.

Provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution, which accorded special powers to the erstwhile State of Jammu & Kashmir, were abrogated by the Government in August last year.

Citing certain key decisions of his Government, Modi referred to the trust set up for the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya and asserted that it would work “rapidly”.

“A trust has been formed for the construction of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya. This trust will work rapidly,” he said.

He said that after setting up of the trust, the work on the construction of ‘Ram dham’ will start with fast speed and added that his Government has also decided to transfer 67 acres of land to the trust.

The Government had recently set up the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra on the Supreme Court’s directive to the Union Government to form a trust that can look into the construction and management of the temple.

The Prime Minister dedicated to the nation the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Memorial Centre and unveiled a 63-foot statue of the RSS ideologue - the tallest statue of the leader in the country.

“The soul of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya give us encouragement. We are working for uplift of Dalits, deprived and others sections. And this is what Upadhyaya’s ‘Antyoday’ says - to give all facilities to last beneficiary in the queue,” Modi said. He also inaugurated a 430-bed super-speciality Government hospital here.

He said that in past few years, Rs 25,000 crore worth of developmental projects have either completed or were going on in fast speed in Varanasi.

The Prime Minister also laid emphasis on better connectivity of heritage and religious sites, saying that tourism will be the main source of making the country 5 trillion dollar economy. He said, “Our behaviour as a citizen will decide direction of the country in future. Country is not made by Governments only, but values of people residing here.”

Soon after his arrival here, Modi participated in the closing ceremony of the centenary celebrations of the Shri Jagadguru Vishwaradhya Gurukul and released the translated version of the Shri Siddhant Shikhamani Granth in 19 languages and its mobile application.

Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel, Chief Minster Yogi Adityanath and Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa were present on the occasion.

Launching the ‘Shri Siddhant Shikhamani Granth’ Mobile App, the Prime Minister said it is a coincidence that the centenary celebrations are taking place at the beginning of a new decade and that this decade will once again establish India’s role in 21st century in the world. He said the digitisation of Shri Siddhant Shikhamani Granth via mobile app will further strengthen the engagement with the younger generation and will also inspire their lives.

Modi suggested conducting an annual quiz competition on topics related to Granth, via this mobile app.

He said following the path shown by the saints, we have to fulfil the aspirations of our lives and continue to cooperate fully in nation building.

Modi appreciated people’s contributions in creating awareness about cleanliness and taking the Swachchhta Mission to each and every corner of the country. He urged them to use ‘Made-in-India’ products.

The Prime Minister said a significant and visible improvement was made in cleaning the Ganga River. This, he said, could be achieved only because of the public participation.

He said under Namami Gange Programme, projects worth Rs 7,000 crores have been completed while work on projects worth Rs 21,000 crores is under progress.

Modi inaugurated ‘Kashi Ek, Roop Anek’, an arts and handicrafts exhibition, at the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Hastkala Sankul here.

He evinced keen interest in the products on display as he went around several stalls and personally interacted with buyers and artisans coming from different countries, including the US, England and Australia.

‘Kashi Ek Roop Anek’ showcased products from over 10,000 artisans from all over Uttar Pradesh. There are 23 lakh artisans and weavers residing in Uttar Pradesh. Of them, about 35,800 artisans and 1.5 lakh weavers stay in Varanasi alone.

227,17-2-20,Deal with miscreants calmly: HM to police,"Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday advised the rank and file of the Delhi Police to deal with miscreants with “firm hands”, and at the same time remain calm despite “provocation”.

Addressing the men and officers of the Delhi Police on its 73rd Raising Day ceremony at the police lines, Kingsway Camp, the Home Minister hailed the Delhi Police as one of the finest metropolitan police forces which has foiled attempts to create disturbance without any fail.

Quoting a speech of India’s first Home Minister ‘Iron Man’ Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in 1950, Shah said, “Despite all the anger and provocation, the Delhi Police should remain calm but it should also be ready to deal with the miscreants with firm hands to protect the people.”

“I believe, on many occasions the Delhi Police has lived up to this advice of Saradar Patel,” the Home Minister said.

Shah made special mention of the exemplary tasks performed by the Delhi Police in maintaining law and order in the city and also helping the Government on important occasions like celebrations of Independence Day and Republic Day, festivals and visits by foreign dignitaries.

The Home Minister welcomed the constructive criticism of the police but cautioned people that they should also remember that that more than 35,000 police personnel laid down their lives on the line of duty.

228,17-2-20,Shaheen Bagh protesters shelve march to Shah,"Police refuse permission

Unable to get the requisite permission from the police to march towards the residence of Home Minister Amit Shah for a dialogue over the new citizenship law on Sunday, the anti-CAA protesters of Shaheen Bagh returned to the venue.

Before taking out the march, the protesters chose an eight-member delegation, including the elderly women called the ‘dadis’ of Shaheen Bagh, to approach the police “to allow them” to meet Shah and asserted that they will carry out the march peacefully. But they failed to impress upon the police which denied them permission to march.

“Police said they have forwarded our request to meet the Home Minister and have sought some time to arrange it,” Javed Khan, one of the protesters, said. He said the protesters will replan their march after getting confirmation from the police.

Anticipating trouble, the Delhi Police top brass further beefed up the security at Shaheen Bagh in south-east Delhi where hundreds of women protesters gathered to march towards the residence of Shah for a dialogue over the CAA. Barricades were placed at the site and the protesters were stopped after a little distance.

Police officials including DCP (Southeast) RP Meena, Additional DCP (Southeast) Kumar Gyanesh and Shaheen Bagh SHO held talks with a group of protesters and gave them assurance that their application has been forwarded to the authorities concerned for further action.

“The protesters wanted to know about the status of their application. This was regarding permission for marching from Shaheen Bagh to the residence of the Home Minister, which they had given to us. We told them that the application was given to DCP New Delhi and it will be further submitted to the police headquarters which will take a final call on it,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) Meena said.

Three days ago, Shah had said anyone who wants to discuss issues related to Citizenship (Amendment) Act with him can seek time from his office. “(We) will give time within three days,” the Home Minister had said.

The protesters at Shaheen Bagh, mainly women, have been staging a sit-in against the CAA, National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR) for the past two months.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shaheen-bagh-protesters--shelve-march-to-shah-2020-02-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/shaheen-bagh-protesters--shelve-march-to-shah.html

230,17-2-20,Pakistan launches nationwide anti-polio campaign,"Pakistan on Monday launched a countrywide anti-polio campaign to vaccinate about 39.6 million children under the age of five in the country as the government appealed to the people for their support to eradicate the crippling disease.

Special Assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan on Health Services Zafar Mirza said the government is committed to reach every child with the polio vaccine.

According to the World Health Organisation, Pakistan is one of the three countries, along with Afghanistan and Nigeria, where polio is still endemic.

“We have critically reviewed our performance during last campaign and worked with provincial and district teams for an even better preparedness for this nationwide vaccination drive,” he said.

Mirza appealed to the people to join hands with the government to eradicate the polio virus from the country.

Over 2,65,000 polio workers will go door-to-door to administer polio drops to about 39.6 million children, officials said.

The initiative has come days after Pakistan confirmed 5 new polio cases, taking the number of those affected by the disease this year to 17.

Last year, 144 polio cases were reported nationwide, far higher than 12 in 2018 and eight in 2017.

Prime Minister Khan had in December said that it was a ""matter of shame"" that Pakistan was among the countries where polio was still prevalent.

Attempts to eradicate the disease have been seriously hampered by deadly targeting of vaccination teams in recent years by militants, who oppose the drives, claiming the polio drops cause infertility.

Attacks on immunisation teams have claimed nearly 70 lives since December 2012.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pakistan-launches-nationwide-anti-polio-campaign-2020-02-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/pakistan-launches-nationwide-anti-polio-campaign.html
231,17-2-20,Does smoking marijuana affect your sperm count?,"Cannabis is by far the most widely cultivated, trafficked and abused illicit drug. Cannabis is a generic term used to denote the several psychoactive preparations of the plant Cannabis sativa. The major psychoactive constituent in cannabis is THC.

Dr Dushyant Nadar, Director & Head of Department, Urology & Renal Transplant, Fortis Hospital, Noida shares more information:

The geographical spread of those seizures is also global, covering practically every country of the world. About 147 million people, 2.5 per cent of the world population, consume cannabis (annual prevalence) compared with 0.2% consuming cocaine and 0.2 percent consuming opiates. The use of cannabis can cause some serious side effects.

**Acute health effects of cannabis use

Cannabis impairs cognitive development (capabilities of learning), including associative processes Cannabis impairs psychomotor performance in a wide variety of tasks, such as motor coordination, divided attention, and operative tasks of many types. Human performance on complex machinery can be impaired for as long as 24 hours after smoking as little as 20 mg of THC in cannabis. There is an increased risk of motor vehicle accidents among persons who drive when intoxicated by cannabis.

**Chronic health effects of cannabis use

Selective impairment of cognitive functioning which include the organization and integration of complex information involving various mechanisms of attention and memory processes.

Prolonged use may lead to greater impairment, which may not recover with cessation of use, and which could affect daily life functions; Development of a cannabis dependence syndrome characterized by a loss of control over cannabis use is likely in chronic users; Cannabis use can exacerbate schizophrenia in affected individuals; Epithelial injury of the trachea and major bronchi is caused by long-term cannabis smoking; Airway injury, lung inflammation, and impaired pulmonary defense against infection from persistent cannabis consumption over prolonged periods; Heavy cannabis consumption is associated with a higher prevalence of symptoms of chronic bronchitis and a higher incidence of acute bronchitis than in the non-smoking cohort;

**Effect of cannabis on male infertility

Infertility affects 10-15% of couples, and it has been estimated that a male factor is responsible in approximately half of these cases. Male infertility is diagnosed with the analysis of several semen parameters, such as the number of total sperm, sperm motility, and percentage of sperm cells with a normal morphology. It is known that marijuana, the commonest recreational drug of abuse, has adverse effects on male reproductive physiology. Its use is associated with impotence, decreased testosterone plasma level, impairment of spermatogenesis, production of spermatozoa with abnormal morphology, reduction of sperm motility and viability and, more recently, with the occurrence of non-seminoma germ cell tumors.

The biological mechanisms by which marijuana affects semen quality and hormone levels are not fully known. The active component of cannabis, ?9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), binds to the human cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. CB1 receptors are found in the anterior pituitary but have also been identified in the testis, vas deferens, and human sperm cells, leading to a dose-dependent decreased sperm motility and decreased mitochondrial activity in spermatozoa when activated.

This makes it possible for marijuana to affect hormone levels and spermatogenesis, as well as the mature sperm cells. A study found that men who used marijuana have an unhealthier lifestyle and health behavior, are often smokers, consume more alcohol, had a higher caffeine intake, were more likely to have had a sexually transmitted disease, and were more likely to have used recreational drugs other than marijuana.

232,17-2-20,Sitting more may raise heart disease risk in older women,"Spending a lot of time sitting may increase heart disease risk among overweight and obese post-menopausal women, warns a study.

""Reducing sitting time improves glucose control and blood flow, and engaging in physical activities, even light-intensity daily life activities like cooking and shopping, show favourable associations with reduced mortality risk and prevention of heart disease and stroke,"" said lead study author Dorothy Sears, Professor of Nutrition at the Arizona State University College of Health Solutions in Phoenix, US.

In this study, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, the researchers measured the sitting habits of older women and who were overweight or obese.

The study included a total of 518 women with an average age of 63 years and an average body mass index (BMI) of 31 kg/m2.

Study participants wore accelerometers on their right hip for up to 14 days, removing the devices only to sleep, shower or swim.

The accelerometers were used to track and record sitting and physical activity of the study participants throughout the day.

A single blood test, concurrent with accelerometer wear, measured blood sugar and insulin resistance.

Each additional hour of sitting time per day was linked with a more than 6 per cent higher fasting insulin and a more than 7 per cent increase in insulin resistance, the results showed.

Each additional 15 minutes in average sitting period was associated with a greater than 7 per cent higher fasting insulin and an almost 9 per cent increase in insulin resistance.

""We were surprised to observe such a strong negative link between the amount of time spent sitting and insulin resistance, and that this association was still strong after we accounted for exercise and obesity,"" Sears said.

237,17-2-20,Kejriwal seeks Modi’s blessings in 3rd innings,"Says want to work with Centre for smooth governance, development

Riding over a massive mandate, Arvind Kejriwal took oath as Chief Minister of Delhi for the third time in a row, becoming the second CM to have done so apart from Sheila Dikshit who had a 15-year uninterrupted run from 1998 to 2013.

Kejriwal took oath of “office and secrecy”, along with six of his Cabinet colleagues, amid the thunderous ovation of his party supporters and people from all walks of life who had gathered at the historic Ram Lila Maidan carrying national flags, AAP flags, Hanuman printed flags, posters and placard chanting, “We love you Kejriwal”.

In his thanksgiving speech, Kejriwal sought to allay apprehensions about his Government’s style of functioning and promised that he will be the CM for all the people of Delhi and there will be no discrimination on political party lines. He said he will work with the same zeal and drive for the welfare of the each and every citizen of Delhi and will be equally receptive to the problems of the BJP and the Congress leaders.

“Some people voted for the AAP, some cast their votes for the BJP and the Congress but the elections are over now and I am Chief Minister to every Delhiites even if s/he does not support my party or belong to some other party.

“Everyone is welcome to my office with their problem and issues and I will meet you, address the issue and will provide a solution to you all. You come from any party, caste, religion, rich, poor, you are my family, I will work for you,” said Kejriwal. “The elections are over and the politics is also over. I forgive all the opponents who made bad remarks on me and whatever they said about me. Now, we all should focus on the development of Delhi. I will work with the Central Government and will go to any point to develop and work to make Delhi a world number one city, he said.

Kejriwal said, “I invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi also but he could not attend the swearing-in ceremony as he is busy with some other important schedule and meeting but I need his blessings on this day for smooth governance of Delhi.” He began his address with, ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’, ‘Inquilab Zinadabad’ and Vande Matram and ended with the patriotic song, ‘Hum Honge Kamyab’ (We shall overcome), the public also repeated the line with him.

“I want to thank each and every one of you. Today, your son has won the CM post for the third time. This win and celebration is not mine, it is yours. I owe this victory to each and every Delhiites, my sisters, mothers, brothers, students, teachers, doctors and every single citizen of this city,” he said.

Calling himself their son, he told the people, “Call your family members in the village and tell them not to worry and not fear for anything because your ‘son’ is back and is going to make Delhi safe.”

“The people of Delhi have created a new history by choosing and electing us. A new politics based on work, welfare, 24-hour electricity, better transport facility, heath, education, woman empowerment and a corruption free governance has born in this Delhi Assembly elections,” Kejriwal said.

Commenting on the Opposition and people who call the AAP Government initiatives a ‘freebies’ scheme, Kejriwal said, “The entire vital things created on this earth are made free by the God. Be it nature, mother’s love, father’s blessing or Shravan’s dedication towards his parents.”

“Thus, how can I charge fees from my daughter and son to study in a school? An ill person is admitted to hospital and is fighting for his life and you want me to charge money to treat him and operate him? It will be a shame on me and my party, if I charge people for their own rights,” he said.

Kejriwal said, “Politicians come and go but it’s you who make this city. But lakhs of “nirmatas” (makers) like you all run Delhi, not the politicians. You effort and hard work make the city feel proud.”

Around 50 people from different professions ranging from students to doctors, woman metro pilots, teachers, auto drivers and others who contributed in the development of the national Capital in the last five years, were invited as “Delhi ke nirmata” and also invited to share the stage with the CM during his swearing-in ceremony as Special Guests.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kejriwal-seeks-modi---s-blessings-in-3rd-innings-2020-02-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/kejriwal-seeks-modi---s-blessings-in-3rd-innings.html

The embassy in a tweet on Sunday said the number of infected Indians on the ship, Diamond Princess, rose to five with two more testing positive for the disease.

However, on Monday, the mission revised the figure to four.

""All 4 #COVID19 positive Indian nationals as on today receiving medical attention onshore are responding well to the treatment,"" it said in a tweet.

""@IndianEmbTokyo is in regular touch with Indians on-board #DiamondPrincess. They understand public health safety concerns in such situations,"" it added.

Meanwhile, the total number of people infected with COVID-19 on the ship rose to 454 after 99 more people tested positive for the disease.

A total of 138 Indians, including 132 crew and 6 passengers, were among the 3,711 people on board the ship that arrived at the Japanese coast earlier this month.

The ship was quarantined after a passenger who de-boarded last month in Hong Kong was found to be the carrier of the COVID-19 on the ship.

The Embassy said it was making efforts for early de-boarding of all the Indians from the ship after the end of the quarantine period and was in discussions with the Japanese government and the ship management company for the disembarkation modalities and welfare of Indians.

The US on Monday evacuated its 340 nationals from the ship.

According to a report in the AFP, the US embassy in Japan confirmed two jets took off from Japan with its citizens evacuated from the ship and those on board were expected to undergo a further 14-day quarantine period on US soil.

The US state department later said that 14 of the evacuees received had the virus, the report said.

China, where the virus outbreak occurred, is grappling to contain the deadly disease as the death toll climbed to 1,770 after 105 more people died, mostly in the worst-hit Hubei province, officials said on Monday.

Of the new deaths, 100 were from Hubei, three in Henan, and two in Guangdong.

The coronavirus outbreak originated in central China's Hubei province in December last year and has spread to several countries, including India.

244,17-2-20,Pakistan no longer a 'safe haven' for terror groups: Imran Khan,"There are no ""safe havens"" for terror groups in Pakistan ""right now"", Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Monday while admitting publicly that it was possibly not the case under previous regimes.

Addressing an international conference marking 40 years of hosting Afghan refugees in the country, he said Pakistan seeks peace in Afghanistan and instability in the war-torn neighbouring country was not in its interest.

Khan's assertion on terror safe havens came as the Financial Action Task Force, the global anti-money laundering watchdog, began a crucial meeting in Paris where Pakistan is trying to wriggle out of being blacklisted for not doing enough to combat terror financing.

The United States, India and Afghanistan have long accused Pakistan of providing safe havens to terror groups like the Taliban, the Haqqani network, the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed.

""I can tell you that there are no safe havens here,"" Khan said at a conference here, also attended by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.

""Whatever the situation might have been in the past, right now, I can tell you... There is one thing we want: peace in Afghanistan."" Khan said.

He admitted that it was possible that such safe heavens were operating in the country after 9/11 in the Afghan refugee camps, The News reported.

""How is the government capable of checking how militants operate from the camps,"" Khan said, adding that it was not possible because the Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan have had a population of over 100,000.

Meanwhile, Guterres also termed the improved security situation in Pakistan as ""absolutely remarkable"", Dawn News reported.

He said that Pakistan which looked like a ""fortress"" a few years back had now become a family station for the world body's staff.

Guterres was responding to a question regarding ""Pakistan's journey from terrorism to tourism"" after a seminar at Islamabad's National University of Sciences and Technology, the report said.

""We are witnessing the state becoming present, both from the point of view of security [... And] basic service, development in an absolutely remarkable transformation,"" he said.

Prime Minister Khan's assertion on the non-existence of terror safe havens came after Afghanistan's second vice president, Sarwar Danish accused Pakistan of allowing the Taliban to recruit new fighters from Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan to launch attacks in his country.

While Pakistan cannot fully guarantee that no Taliban militants are hiding among the huge number of Afghans living in Pakistan, Khan said his government had done all it can to prevent attacks in Afghanistan, including by building a border fence.

The whole country is on the same page on Afghanistan, he said, adding that previously it was said that the government and the country's security forces were not on the same page. However, this was not the case now, he said.

He highlighted that Pakistan was not seeking peace in Afghanistan because it has been hosting 1.4 million Afghan refugees, but because the people of Afghanistan deserve peace.

Earlier, Earlier, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres in his address stated that the people of Pakistan for 40 years have responded with generosity in hosting the Afghan refugees.

""Even though major conflict has erupted in some other part of the world; Pakistan is still the second largest refugee host. I am struck by the extraordinary solidarity and compassion,"" he said.

At the same time, he urged the international community to step up support for Pakistan in tackling the problem of Afghan refugees.

""The global community must step up,"" Guterres said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pakistan-no-longer-a--safe-haven--for-terror-groups--imran-khan-2020-02-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/pakistan-no-longer-a--safe-haven--for-terror-groups--imran-khan.html
245,17-2-20,"25,000 practices documented to save desi healing","To save its ancient old local health traditions and ethno medical practices followed in the country for years from extinction, India has started documenting these age-old repositories to conserve them for future generations. So far over 25 thousand local medical practices have been documented and the process is going on, said Union Ayush Secretary Rajesh Kotecha.

The ethno-medicine is one of the form of healing diseases by using medicinally valued plants and is being practiced from ancient times.

Kotecha said the traditional healers are the repositories of centuries of wisdom and knowledge of health practices, transmitted through an incredibly effective system of oral transmission inherited through family lineage, at times also acquired under the Guru Shishya Parampara or through observation and experience.

The official said in the process (during documentation of ethno-medical practices), it will be ensured that rights of the traditional healers are protected. “We are also firming up plans to ensure that they are not exploited and cheated by the commercial pharma firms as they share their traditional knowledge outside their lineage.”

Also, the official said in order to give formal recognition to traditional healers in the country, the Quality Council of India (QCI) has launched national voluntary certification scheme to certify their knowledge and skills and bring them in the mainstream.

This is ongoing process, KG Dhiman, DG of the Delhi-based Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) said, adding that a brainstorming session was held a few months ago with scientists and stakeholders on the issue.

Dhiman said the CCRAS, along with other stakeholders, agreed that a combined mainstreaming of the folklore knowledge is needed to protect our traditions.

He was sharing his views on the sidelines of the second day of the 7th International Congress of the Society for Ethnopharmacology (SFEC 2020) being held at Jamia Hamdard here where 60 renowned speakers and about 1,700 delegates from 40 countries, including India, are deliberating on crucial issues related to ethnomedicine, ethnopharmocology, medicinal plants research and the regulatory aspects.

Many traditional healers from Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu are also participating at the three-day event.

KK Sharma from AIMIL Pharma, which is engaged in manufacturing herbal-based drugs like BGR-34 (anti-diabetic formulation based on six herbs) and NEERI-KFT (for managing kidney ailments), welcomed the move to bring the traditional healers in the mainstream, noting that traditional knowledge can be promoted by integrating with scientific method.

Dr Ibrahim Jantan, Professor of Medicinal and Natural Products Chemistry at Taylor’s University, Malaysia, echoed similar views stating that while his country is yet to officially recognise AYUSH as mainstream medicine, many traditional healers have preserved and promoted indigenous herbal medicines for curing various serious ailments.

According to an estimate, there are around 1 million traditional healers in the country but many work in the far flung, inaccessible areas.

In the absence of the public health system, a large part of India, especially rural and tribal areas, is mostly serviced by these healers who rely on the tradition of local health practices to cure serious diseases.

There are an estimated 1 million traditional healers in the country and yet while they exist in practice, there is no formal recognition for such healers. A large part of India, especially rural and tribal areas, is mostly serviced by traditional healers who rely on the tradition of local health practices for providing healthcare services mostly for the inaccessible far flung areas.

In 2018, the Government had conferred Padma awards on 3 such traditional healers from Kerala, Karnataka and Tibet thus bestowing an unprecedented honour to this segment of community healthcare workers.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/25-000-practices-documented-to-save-desi-healing-2020-02-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/25-000-practices-documented-to-save-desi-healing.html

248,17-2-20,Bieber admits to being 'reckless' in previous relationship,"Singer Justin Bieber, who dated singer-actress Selena Gomez on-and-off for years, has spoken about his past mistakes.

During an interview with Zane Lowe, while talking about his new album, ""Changes"", and a song that's about true love, Bieber was asked about knowing he needed time to work on himself before he took things further with Hailey, reports etonline.com.

""I'd let her know prior to the tour when we were hanging a lot. I said, 'Listen, I'm still really hurt and still trying to figure out my way, and I'm not ready to make a commitment to you in a way that... I just don't want to say something and do the opposite',"" he recalled telling Hailey.

""Because I was at the point where I'd done that in the past. And I just was honest with her, I was like, 'I'm not in a place to be faithful', and all this sort of stuff, that I wanted to be, but I just wasn't there yet.""

When Lowe asked what was hurting Bieber at the time, he replied without naming Gomez: ""I think I was just hurt from my previous relationship"".

""I think I still was dealing with a lot of 'unforgiveness' and all that sort of stuff. To be honest, I don't think I even knew what I was really struggling with at the time,"" he explained.

""I don't think I knew I was dealing with unforgiveness. I was just in a place where I knew I didn't want to tell (Hailey) one thing and... I felt like she respected me at the time and I had a lot of respect for her, and so I just didn't want to say something and then she'd see me off doing some other thing.""

""But either way, she loved me and seeing me with other people hurt her,"" Bieber continued. ""And so with that being said, she went out and did things that hurt me. And so just this hurt, I've hurt her, she hurt me. And then before tour we just really stopped talking, I was really upset.""

Then he spoke about his past relationship. ""Before that, in my previous relationship, I went off and just went crazy and went wild, just was being reckless,"" he said.

249,17-2-20,Trump threatens intelligence block over Huawei: US diplomat,"The United States' ambassador to Germany said Sunday that President Donald Trump had threatened to cut off intelligence-sharing with countries that dealt with Chinese tech firm Huawei.

Washington has been pressing allies to ban Huawei, one of the world's largest tech firms, from next-generation 5G mobile data networks, saying it is a security risk.

Ambassador Richard Grenell said Trump ""instructed me to make clear that any nation who chooses to use an untrustworthy 5G vendor will jeopardize our ability to share intelligence and information at the highest level.""

Grenell said on Twitter that the president had called him on Sunday from Air Force One, the presidential plane, to convey the message.

Key US allies in Europe, notably Britain and France, have said they will not ban Huawei from building 5G networks but will impose restrictions.

Publicly, the US has been restrained in its response, but Trump was reportedly furious with London.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the Munich Security Conference on Saturday that Huawei was a ""Trojan horse for Chinese intelligence.""

The tech company vehemently denies the US allegations, and Beijing has characterized its treatment as ""economic bullying.""

The National Health Commission said 2,048 new cases of the virus have been confirmed, taking the total number of COVID-19 infected cases to 70,548, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Of the new deaths, 100 were from Hubei Province, three in Henan, and two in Guangdong.

Though 10,844 people had been discharged from hospitals after recovery, the commission said in its daily report said that 7,264 people were still suspected to be infected by the deadly virus.

By Sunday, 57 confirmed cases including one death had been reported from Hong Kong, 10 in Macao, and 20 in Taiwan including one death.

Hubei, where 18 cities with over 50 million people are under lockdown since January 23, announced a slew of more stringent measures to control the epidemic, including enforcing province-wide traffic restrictions on all non-emergency vehicles and closing all non-essential public venues.

A circular by the provincial government said the health screening campaign should be strengthened and no one should be missed. Also, companies should not resume production unless allowed by local authorities. Those that have resumed work including public institutions should follow strict prevention measures.

The measures came as the situation remains ""grave"", the circular added.

However on Sunday, the commission announced a “significant drop” in new cases, suggesting that epidemic control measures were taking effect.

""In Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic, the proportion of severe cases among the confirmed cases fell from a peak of 32.4 per cent on January 28 to 21.6 per cent on February 15,"" Mi Feng, a spokesperson with the NHC, said during a media briefing.

Special Assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan on Health Services Zafar Mirza said the government is committed to reach every child with the polio vaccine.

According to the World Health Organisation, Pakistan is one of the three countries, along with Afghanistan and Nigeria, where polio is still endemic.

“We have critically reviewed our performance during last campaign and worked with provincial and district teams for an even better preparedness for this nationwide vaccination drive,” he said.

Mirza appealed to the people to join hands with the government to eradicate the polio virus from the country.

Over 2,65,000 polio workers will go door-to-door to administer polio drops to about 39.6 million children, officials said.

The initiative has come days after Pakistan confirmed 5 new polio cases, taking the number of those affected by the disease this year to 17.

Last year, 144 polio cases were reported nationwide, far higher than 12 in 2018 and eight in 2017.

Prime Minister Khan had in December said that it was a ""matter of shame"" that Pakistan was among the countries where polio was still prevalent.

Attempts to eradicate the disease have been seriously hampered by deadly targeting of vaccination teams in recent years by militants, who oppose the drives, claiming the polio drops cause infertility.

256,17-2-20,Google shuts free public Wi-Fi at railway stations in India,"Google on Monday announced it is gradually winding down its free public Wi-Fi Station programme currently available at over 400 railway stations in India, and will work with the Indian Railways and Railtel Corporation to help them with existing sites so they can remain useful resources for people.

Google launched its Station initiative in India in 2015 to bring fast, free public Wi-Fi to over 400 of the busiest railway stations in the country by mid-2020.

""We crossed that number by June 2018 and implemented Station in thousands of other locations around the country in partnership with telecommunications companies, ISPs and local authorities,"" Caesar Sengupta, Vice President, Payments and Next Billion Users, Google, said in a statement.

""Over time, partners in other countries asked for Station too and we responded accordingly. We're grateful for these partnerships, especially with the Indian Railways and the Government of India, that helped us serve millions of users over the last few years,"" he added.

According to Google, the decision to shut Station has been taken keeping the affordable mobile data plans and mobile connectivity in mind that is improving globally including in India.

""India, specifically now has among the cheapest mobile data per GB in the world, with mobile data prices having reduced by 95 per cent in the last 5 years, as per TRAI in 2019,"" said Sengupta.

The Indian users consume close to 10GB of data, each month, on average, according to reports.

""Our commitment to supporting the next billion users remains stronger than ever, from continuing our efforts to make the internet work for more people and building more relevant and helpful apps and services,"" Sengupta noted.

Global networking giant Cisco last year teamed up with Google to roll out free, high-speed public Wi-Fi access globally, starting with India.

The first pilot under the partnership was rolled out at 35 locations in Bengaluru.

Sengupta said that in addition to the changed context, the challenge of varying technical requirements and infrastructure among our partners across countries has also made it difficult for Station to scale and be sustainable, especially for our partners.

""And when we evaluate where we can truly make an impact in the future, we see greater need and bigger opportunities in building products and features tailored to work better for the next billion user markets,"" he said.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/google-shuts-free-public-wi-fi-at-railway-stations-in-india-2020-02-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/google-shuts-free-public-wi-fi-at-railway-stations-in-india.html
257,17-2-20,Samsung Galaxy Z Flip fails durability test,"Samsung Electronics' newly launched foldable smartphone that aims to popularise the foldable form factor in the market has failed at the ""famous"" JerryRigEverything durability test.

When Zack Nelson from JerryRigEverything performed his signature durability test on Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, the top layer of its UTG screen suffered level 2 scratches on Mohs' scale for mineral hardness, GSMArena reported on Monday.

According to reports, the Z Flip's screen starts showing permanent marks and scratches far earlier than actual glass would. The Z Flip starts picking up damage at level 2, and more significantly at 3, which is on par with the plastic screens of the Galaxy Fold and more recent Motorola Razr.

""This screen is in no way scratch-resistant whatsoever,"" Nelson said at the end of the video. At the end of the clip, he could be seen poking holes in the screen that make the OLED panel go on the fritz, but there's no sign of any glass fracturing, according to The Verge.

259,17-2-20,"Boult back for India Tests, Jamieson and Patel earn call-ups","Fit-again senior pacer Trent Boult has been named in the 13-member New Zealand squad for the first Test against India starting here on February 21.

According to a media release issued by New Zealand Cricket, the 6 feet 8 inch giant pacer Kyle Jamieson, who made his ODI debut against India in the recent series, has also earned his call up in the Test squad, which will have slow left-arm orthodox Ajaz Patel as the only spinner.

Boult's comeback is a big boost for the New Zealand side as he missed the entire limited overs leg due to a fractured right hand sustained during the Boxing Day Test against Australia at the MCG.

""It's terrific to have Trent back with us and we're looking forward to the energy and experience he adds to the group alongside his obvious class with the ball in hand,"" head coach and chief selector Gary Stead said.

Jamieson, on the other hand, has been included in a pre-series Test squad for the first time. He had replaced injured Lockie Ferguson midway in Australia in December last year.

""Kyle will offer us a point of difference with the bounce he could extract on what is traditionally a good surface in Wellington,"" Stead said.

Mumbai-born Patel was chosen over leg-spinner Ish Sodhi because of his consistency.

""We're excited to welcome back Ajaz (Patel) who has done a great job for us overseas and has a proven domestic record in New Zealand conditions,"" the coach said.

Daryl Mitchell of Northern Districts is also in the squad as a batting all-rounder.

""Daryl showed his batting prowess in his Test debut against England in Hamilton and he naturally offers us great versatility with the different roles he can play,"" Stead said.

Tom Blundell will continue to open the batting along side Tom Latham following his breakthrough century in Melbourne.

The Wellington Test will also be Ross Taylor's 100th Test, joining ranks with his former teammates Brendon McCullum, Daniel Vettori and Stephen Fleming.

Taylor will become the first cricketer in the world to complete 100 games across three international formats.

""To play 100 Tests for your country is an incredible achievement and a testament to his work ethic and complete professionalism,"" Stead said of Taylor.

The coach, however, acknowledged that they had to make some tough decisions while selecting the squad.

""With a squad of 13 we've put a priority on balance and making sure we have the needed variety and different options depending on the pitch conditions at the Basin Reserve,"" Stead said.

260,17-2-20,Elton John cuts concert short due to walking pneumonia,"Music legend Elton John was forced to halt a show in New Zealand after being diagnosed with walking pneumonia.

The 72-year-old musician lost his voice in the middle of his performance at Auckland's Mount Smart Stadium on Sunday, reported BBC.

""I've just completely lost my voice. I can't sing. I've got to go. I'm sorry,"" an emotional John told the crowd.

The concert was part of the Oscar winner's New Zealand leg of Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour.

Walking pneumonia, also called atypical pneumonia, is a type of lung infection often caused by bacteria or viruses. Its symptoms are comparable to those of a bad cold, often including a cough, chest pain, a sore throat and a headache.

John was checked by a medic halfway through the show and, despite his illness, he was able to perform classics such as ""Candle in the Wind"" and ""All the Girls Love Alice"".

But his voice gave way as he tried to sing ""Daniel"", after which he called off the set.

After he left the stage, the singer posted an apology to his fans on Instagram.

""I played and sang my heart out, until my voice could sing no more. I'm disappointed, deeply upset and sorry. I gave it all I had.

""Thank you so much for your extraordinary support and all the love you showed me during tonight's performance. I am eternally grateful. Love, Elton xx,"" he wrote.

John announced in 2018 that he would stop touring in order to prioritise his family, but only after embarking on the three-year Farewell Yellow Brick Road global tour.

The musician's next shows in Auckland on Tuesday and Thursday would go ahead as planned, the tour promoters said.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/elton-john-cuts-concert-short-due-to-walking-pneumonia-2020-02-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/elton-john-cuts-concert-short-due-to-walking-pneumonia.html

""For me, the yardstick of success has never just been about how much money a project makes.

""Success has given me the confidence that I am heading in the right direction and my judgment on films are right. So, my choices of films are the gift of success. If I give inputs in the process of making a film and people listen to me, it is because I have managed to become a bankable actor. Filmmaking is a business and unless producers have the confidence that investing in my films will get a financial return, why would they put their money,"" Taapsee told IANS.

The actress recently won the Best Actress (critics) award at a popular awards gala along with Bhumi Pednekar for her 2019 Diwali release ""Saand Ki Aankh"". Last year Taapsee also played pivotal roles in films like ""Badla"", ""Game Over"", and ""Mission Mangal"".

Starting her career with regular fare in the south Indian film industry, she made her debut in Bollywood with the David Dhawan slapstick ""Chashme Baddoor"" in 2012, but went on to become a face of content-driven cinema after her role in Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury's 2016 film, ""Pink"". She also gained popularity with strong performances in films like ""Baby"", ""Naam Shabana"", ""Mulk"" and ""Manmarziyaan"".

""How I stand for gender equality and women's right has nothing to do with success, but everything to do with upbringing. I was never told that I am any less because I am a girl. I have a sister and, whether it is education, jobs or any other choice we made, in our house my parents never questioned it because we are girls. So the choice of films that I make is a reflection of my mindset. My audience sees my belief in my choices,"" she said.

Currently, Taapsee is gearing up for the release of Anubhav Sinha's directorial venture ""Thappad"". The film is scheduled to open on February 28.
