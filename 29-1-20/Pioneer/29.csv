0,29-1-20,Fix ailing healthcare sector,"Health is a State subject but with the Finance Commission’s advice to move it to the Concurrent list, in future we can expect higher budgetary allocations by the Centre

The Union Budget has always been the reflection of how we prioritise and allocate limited resources to the efforts of nation-building and nurturing across sectors. While India has set aspirational targets regarding the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) we are one of the nations with the lowest Government spending on healthcare (less than two per cent), with the highest burden of communicable diseases like Tuberculosis (TB) while bearing an epidemiological transition towards a crescendo of non-communicable diseases. India aspires to invest about 2.5 per cent of the GDP into healthcare by 2025, which is a lower target than the global average of six per cent. At the same time we aspire to end the epidemics of TB, AIDS and malaria by 2030. In some ways we are making progress and moving forward but are we putting enough on the table?

Most of the SDG goals that India aspires to achieve, as per the NITI Aayog SDG Index, are aligned towards primary care and human resources for health. It selects indicators for reducing maternal mortality, under-five mortality and TB burden while increasing immunisation coverage and human resources for health. The National Health Mission, including rural and urban, (NRHM and NUHM) is the core of the healthcare delivery services and thus will be the conduit to deliver on the promises of better health. NRHM has received a marginal increase of seven per cent to reach Rs 27,039 crore while NUHM was allocated Rs 950 crore, a nine per cent increase from the previous year. A large part of this Budget, Rs 1,550 crore has been earmarked for the development of Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs). About 1.5 lakh HWCs envisioned for 2022 and 40,000 centres to be built by 2019-20 allow for about Rs 4 lakh per centre (considering both years’ budgets), which is a pittance given the aspiration of infrastructure upgrade and manpower needed.

The Government claims that 28,500 HWCs have been established and to strengthen the primary and preventive care foundations, there needs to be more focussed cash-flow and implementation at the first level of contact with the patients. On the optimistic side, there is a 94 per cent increase in ASHA benefit package (Rs 400 crore) which is a great step towards ensuring delivery at the last mile. ASHA workers being the face of almost all health schemes and services, this has the potential to impact all four SDG India Index indicators.

Tertiary care schemes, however, have seen their funds being jettisoned. The National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) received only Rs 175 crore as opposed to Rs 300 crore in 2017-18. Keeping in mind the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases and the focus on screening at the HWCs, there needs to be a higher allocation of cash towards this programme.

The National Mental Health Programme, which saw a budget estimate of Rs 50 crore but a dismal revised estimate of Rs 5.5 crore in the previous Budget, has again received a budget estimate of only Rs 40 crore. It remains to be seen how much is finally allocated to this programme but as a nation we are still neglecting mental health issues that are silently affecting everyone across the socio-economic spectrum, from industrialists to numerous college students.

The National Crime Records Bureau mentions that in 2015, a whopping 8,934 student suicides were recorded in India. A much larger number goes unreported. It would be encouraging to see more efforts made towards the much-neglected mental health delivery system.

No discussion is complete without perspectives on the Ayushman Bharat (AB) insurance scheme. The previous two Budgets saw a more than two-fold increase in commitment from Rs 2,400 crore to Rs 6,400 crore and it is fair to expect that the allocation will increase. While the initial plan was to cover 10 crore families, there have been aspirations to cover 50 crore. However, the challenge here is not allocation of money but optimal utilisation of it. While on one hand demand has been created, there is a deficit in the supply of health services as well as a reticence in current capacity of healthcare providers to participate, given the challenging pricing of the health packages.

The massive demand and the challenging prices claiming margins at scale can only be serviced by a greater supply of the healthcare delivery taskforce. This is also reflected in SDG 3.8 (human resources for health) and is the most critical piece of the healthcare puzzle, without which all other efforts will fall short. According to the Global Health Workforce Alliance, India falls in the category of countries with a “risk of severe crisis in availability of human resources for health.” Against the WHO-recommended 22.8 (revised 44.5) qualified health professionals per 10,000, India only has 16 (adjusted for qualification) per 10,000. This massive gap is either completely un-serviced or is filled by quacks.

We have often seen fallouts of this in overpopulated, understaffed Government hospitals. Last year, scores of children died due to Acute Encephalitis Syndrome in Muzaffarpur in Bihar. A condition manageable by adequate medical care, the deaths were attributed to malnutrition of the children and poor logistics in the hospital(s).

The issue of workforce shortage affects the entire health ecosystem but the gargantuan demand created by AB will highlight the challenges much more, with a higher relative demand-supply gap shaping up. Private hospitals that are not participating in the specific health service packages or as a whole in AB are already saying that the high volume, low margin play is not realistic since they are limited in capacity of skilled workforce. In the absence of a commensurate health workforce, the hospitals will never reach the scale at which the volumes can be serviced so that the low margins will make sense with the challenging prices.

In areas where fundamental health infrastructure (both public and private) itself is low, the scheme is bound to have low adoption. This is reflected in minimum utilisation of the scheme in the North-eastern States, Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli, where the supply for health services is extremely low. We need more doctors, nurses and allied staff with institutions to train them. Investments are required towards building more public institutions for training.

There has been only a 0.7 per cent increase in the Budget for human resources for health and medical education in the last two years. Most of the Budget has been allocated to increasing undergraduate seats at existing institutes and postgraduate seats in district hospitals. The Budget for creating new medical colleges has been reduced to Rs 2,000 crore, the lowest in the last three years. If we increase seats in existing colleges, without creating new ones, we walk a thin line of quality education trade off with quantity as the number of medical college seats to number of beds in its associated hospital is a fixed ratio, maintained to safeguard quality education. It is here that the NITI Aayog has proposed allowing private medical colleges to work with public district hospitals to generate more medical seats in their paper Scheme to link new and/or existing private medical colleges with functional district hospitals through PPP. This could potentially be a way to bring in some numbers for the skill pool but needs careful craftsmanship to keep the public sentiments at the centre for care delivery while allowing enough room for market forces to sustain. Additionally, the outlay for paramedical and allied health services has been dismal. The Budget for setting up state institutions for paramedical training has been a pitiful Rs 20 crore, same as 2018-19. Strengthening of nursing services received only Rs 64 crore while pharmacy colleges received a paltry Rs 5 crore. The need for upskilling allied health skilled professionals is more pressing now than ever, at the face of absolute and relative shortage of doctors to serve the impending gargantuan demand. It would be encouraging to see the same being reflected in the pecuniary commitments. Only then can we create an ecosystem of health services, public and private, that can serve the ambitions of the AB at the desired nexus of quality and cost. Since health is still a State subject, the Centre’s contribution is limited to infrastructure development. With a more rights-based approach to health and the Finance Commission’s recommendations to move it to a Concurrent subject, in the near future we can expect greater accountability and thus higher budgetary allocations by the Centre. Till that time, it needs to support the trailing States more so that health infrastructure can be built and markets be created for AB to find takers.

2,29-1-20,Girl throws acid on stalker,"Fed up with being stalked and being subjected to lewd advances, an irate girl threw acid on a youth at a shop in Gonamau village of Maurawa police station area of Unnao late on Monday night.

After the incident, additional force was deployed in the area as a precautionary measure as the victim and the stalker belong to different communities. As per police, the 24-year-old suffered 50 burns and was admitted to a hospital where his condition was said to be critical.

Doctors attending to him said that the youth suffered burns on his nape, back, chest and left shoulder. He was later referred to a Lucknow hospital by the doctors. The youth and his 20-year-old love interest are followers of different religions, which restricted the police from acting against the girl in question.

As per reports, Rohit Kumar Yadav (24) was in his dairy at Bhawaniganj on Monday night when the girl threw acid on him. The youth raised an alarm but the girl had fled the scene by then.

Later, locals said the girl was seen waiting since afternoon and late in the night, she entered the dairy and attacked the youth. On being informed by locals, the police rushed to the scene and admitted the victim to a hospital in Unnao.

Later, the police detained the girl and during interrogation, it came to the fore that Rohit was in love with the girl but his feelings were not reciprocated.

“Prima facie, it is a case of one-sided love as the girl was not interested in youth’s overtures but he reportedly stalked her. Till now, no complaint has been lodged in this connection. If a complaint is lodged, the accused girl will be arrested,” Maurawan SHO Rajendra Rajawat said.

As per National Crime Records Bureau’s (NRCB) latest report released in January, UP was witness to 40 cases of acid attacks, mostly on women, and was placed after West Bengal, which recorded the highest number of attacks (50).

Earlier this month, the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court had sought a reply from the Centre and UP government on a plea pertaining to compliance of directions issued by the Supreme Court to regulate the sale and distribution of acid.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/girl-throws-acid--on-stalker.html

8,29-1-20,A new low in country’s history,"By advocating violence, Anurag Thakur has opened a new dimension in Indian politics and the masses have just lapped it up

Union Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur must be “credited” for taking Indian politics to a higher virulent and toxic level than ever before. At an election rally for the forthcoming Delhi Assembly elections on February 8, he shouted from a podium, “Desh ke gaddaaron ko (Traitors of the nation)”, and sure enough, the bloodthirsty mob, like the one calling for hanging of Cinna, the poet, merely because he bore the same name as one of the murderers of Caesar (in Shakespeare’s play Julius Caesar) shouted in response, “Goli maaro... (must be shot).” Everyone knows that in India elections are not contested on real issues like poverty, unemployment, malnourishment, lack of healthcare and good education, but on emotional issues like building the Ram temple (which increased the BJP’s seats in the Lok Sabha from two in 1984 to 183 in 1999), cow protection and Pakistan-bashing (the Balakot attack was of great help to the BJP in the 2019 elections and gave it 303 seats). But the sheer brazenness of Thakur’s slogan really takes the cake. And the beauty of it is that it cannot be called an election corrupt practice under Section 123 (3A) of the Representation of People’s Act, 1951, since it is delightfully vague.

Section 123(3A) regards as a corrupt practice, “The promotion or attempt to promote, feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of citizens of India on grounds of religion, race, caste, community or language by a candidate or his agent or any other person with the consent of a candidate or his election agent for the furtherance of the prospects of the election of that candidate or for prejudicially affecting the election of any candidate.”

Now the candidate was present in the meeting in which Thakur said this, so his statement was certainly with the consent of the candidate. But did it promote feelings of enmity or hatred between different communities or castes? There is nothing in the statement which expressly does so and it is well settled that an election malpractice must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, like a criminal offence. Who are the traitors who deserve to be shot? The expression can have any number of meanings. It can mean minorities who are perceived as terrorists and anti-national. It can mean all those who are anti-BJP. It can mean liberals. It can mean JNU, AMU and Jamia students (the tukde, tukde gang). It can mean many other things. Thakur claims that he never said “goli maaro”, that was chanted by the crowd. But, of course, no one will be deceived by this obfuscation.

If the BJP wins the forthcoming Delhi Assembly elections, the primary credit must go to Thakur, much more than to Amit Shah. The latter only spoke of pressing the button of an EVM machine to disperse the anti-CAA crowd in Shaheen Bagh. The former, on the other hand, has raised hatred against the undefined traitors to a feverish, venomous pitch and now the bloodthirsty mob will seek out the Cinnas to hang them for their bad verses.

By advocating violence, Thakur has opened a new dimension in Indian politics, which will resemble the last years of the Weimar Republic in Germany when strong arm thugs like the SA and SS roamed the streets of Berlin and Munich winning arguments not by words but by breaking skulls.

Though the Preamble to our Constitution declares India as a secular Republic, the ground reality is very different. In India most Hindus and Muslims are communal. This is because secularism is a feature of industrial society, but India is still semi-feudal. Till 2014, communalism was usually latent in India and erupted only occasionally but thereafter, it has become open, virulent and continuous. Thakur’s statement will open up a Nazi era in Indian politics.

Several BJP Ministers were present with Thakur, including Manish Chaudury, the party’s candidate from Rithala. Shah also addressed the same rally. The party’s divisive politics by blatantly spreading hatred of minorities has been present ever since its inception but now it has reached a superlative violent level. With the advent of the BJP-ruled Government in 2014, India’s latent communalism has become open and virulent. We are now plagued with political leaders who fearlessly spread hatred and spout venom against the minorities and anyone who dares to speak in their support. The gullible masses have been largely polarised by the Goebbelsian propaganda of our politicians and now, just like the fickle Roman mob was whipped up by Mark Antony into a murderous frenzy, they are being goaded on to a murderous path.

Though the Election Commission had asked for a full transcript of Thakur’s speech from the Delhi CEO office along with videos, one is sceptical anything concrete will be done.

Some people may think that Thakur’s speech will adversely affect BJP’s poll prospects but the truth is otherwise. The BJP thrives on Muslim-bashing and will greatly benefit by this blatant appeal to violence. The great German leader Bismarck in a speech in 1862 to the Prussian Landtag said, “The great issues of the day will not be decided by votes and speeches but by blood and iron.” Indian politics, too, seems to be headed in the same direction, though in a very different sense.

9,29-1-20,"Debate key issues, don’t stall House","Members of Parliament should not fail in their basic duties of legislation, scrutiny of the Budget and holding the Government accountable. After all, the people have elected them for this purpose

All eyes will be on the Union Budget which will be presented at the end of this week on February 1. The Budget Session is all set to begin with the customary President’s address to the joint session of Parliament on January 31. The session is important because this is when the Parliament scrutinises the fiscal proposals of the Government and votes for the Budget.

There will be two phases of the Budget Session, with the first scheduled from January 31 to February 11 and the second from March 2 to April 3. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who will be presenting her second Union Budget, would attempt to stage a reversal of the sharp decline that has gripped the economy and is expected to announce a slew of measures to boost it. According to official data, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is likely to shrink to five per cent this fiscal, the slowest pace in about a decade. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has slashed India’s GDP growth rate to 4.8 per cent for the current fiscal and 5.8 per cent for 2020-21. Though fiscal indicators suggest that the economy will bounce back in the first half of 2020, a lot depends on the Government’s budgetary announcements. It is likely that the Union Government may skip all populist measures to focus on industry-specific boosters.

Sitharaman has already announced certain steps like support to exporters, the housing industry, Micro and Small Enterprises and Non-Banking Financial Companies. Some new income tax slabs with simple and fairer income tax, relaxation in Long-Term Capital Gain (LTCG) and relief in Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) are also expected.

Incidentally, the last Budget Session was one of the busiest in the last two decades. According to official data, both Houses spent nearly half their time on legislative business, passing 30 Bills and working more than 70 hours extra.

However, for all this to happen, the Parliament needs to function normally. In the last decade, the Parliament has not functioned well with several disruptions and adjournments. Of late, some Bills were even passed without discussion in the House. A total of 42 Bills are pending before the Parliament to be cleared during the forthcoming session. Will this session be more productive and peaceful? Most probably not, in view of issues like the economic downturn and the resultant job losses, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC), the National Population Register (NPR) and the countrywide protests plaguing the country right now.

The student community and civil society have shown their apprehensions over the twin measures with students taking a lead over others. So these issues are bound to top the list of the Opposition, with the Congress Party already giving an indication to this effect.

The second issue which the Opposition is likely to beat the NDA Government with is the sliding economy. The Opposition could put the Government on the mat for the consistent decline in the GDP as several macro indicators signalling recovery reveal that it could take some more time. The Finance Minister has to address issues like the lack of jobs and decline of growth in almost all sectors, including manufacturing, civil aviation, agriculture, infrastructure and banking.

The third area of concern is the state of affairs in the former State of Jammu and Kashmir. Though the Bill for its bifurcation was passed in the last session, normalcy is yet to return in the Valley and the Congress and other parties are likely to push for a discussion on the situation.

The Centre wants to get the Personal Data Protection Bill passed, which will allow data to be stored abroad with consent and mirror images in India. A Bill to link the Aadhaar to voter identity cards for new voters is also likely to be introduced. The sale of Air India is another controversial issue. While the Government is looking at completing disinvestment of Air India in the current fiscal, half a dozen AAI airports are to be bid out on a PPP model. It is not clear whether the Opposition will chalk out a joint strategy to take on the Government or not. The Modi Government is banking upon a divided Opposition, which has helped the Government push through even contentious Bills like the abrogation of Article 370 and the recent CAB, in the past. The Congress wants to take a leadership role in uniting various political parties but there is resistance from major players like the Trinamool Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party. It would be better if Parliamentarians decide to debate key issues instead of walking out and making noisy scenes. In a democracy, a civilised discussion would go a long way in solving problems. The members should not fail in their basic duties of legislation, scrutiny of the Budget and holding the Government accountable. After all, the people have elected them for this purpose.

The format of the Republic Day parade is still evolving in finding the right balance between displaying military prowess, cultural heritage, technological growth and socio-economic developments. When it was first held in 1950 at the National Stadium, it was entirely a military parade, affirming, indeed asserting, civilian political control over the erstwhile colonial armed forces, two of whose service chiefs were still British. The parade was the acme of military traditions, customs and ethos, synthesising the services into an apolitical, professional and secular fighting machine.

Even today, when soldiers get into the battlefield, there is no uniform war cry. In different fighting units, it is as varied as Allah hu Akbar to Jai Mata Di to Aayo Gorkhali. This richness in diversity of military ethos was and is still embodied in the code of conduct contained in the credo set for officers passing out of the Indian Military Academy, which was established in 1932 by Field Marshal Philip Chetwode. It was about dedication to country first, devotion to soldiers under command next and personal safety remaining last, always and every time. This gold standard has been seamlessly blended with the eternal values of the Indian Constitution that are currently under test on account of a variety of national issues. Most of them affect the heart and soul of the military where customs and traditions are sacrosanct.

Seemingly odd customs have a place, too. Like 13 hobnails on the sole of “ammunition boots.” In the photographs that appeared of Captain Tania Shergill leading the all-male Corps of Signals contingent, one can count the number of nails on her boots. These show on dead soldiers in trenches in celebrated World War films like 1917 and Dunkirk. In World War I, India lost 74,000 soldiers but names of just 13,516 of them are etched on the walls of India Gate. Around 80,000 lives were sacrificed in World War II, which have gone completely anonymous. This is a serious omission and needs to be rectified by constructing a monument in the name of the unknown soldier if names of the dead are not traceable.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi was instrumental in hastening the construction of the National War Memorial (NWM) behind India Gate, which bears the names of 25,942 martyrs since independence. Last year, the Army alone suffered 80 fatal casualties in Jammu & Kashmir, the North-east and the United Nations Peacekeeping Operations, according to a Press report released on Army Day, January 15.

Last Sunday’s parade was blessed with good weather and recorded many firsts. Instead of the Amar Jawan Jyoti at India Gate, martyrs — sadly only post-independence ones — were remembered by Prime Minister Modi at the NWM; the new Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen Bipin Rawat, joined the other three service Chiefs and Defence Secretary as official hosts of the parade. The Air Defence Regiment made its marching debut, so did several US hi-tech fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters in the flypast, marking a significant shift from an inventory wholly Soviet/Russian to one significantly diversified.

The indigenous anti-satellite weapon and gravity-defying stunts by women bikers of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) took a bow. Absent perhaps for the first time was a Gorkha-marching contingent though the Kumaon Regiment in Gorkha hats made up for it. But not quite. Altogether, 16 marching contingents and 22 tableaux comprised the parade. The tableau from Jammu & Kashmir was a brazen attempt to portray it as a normal State after the abrogation of Article 370 and its demotion from a full-fledged State to a Union Territory. Both matters are now in the Supreme Court.

As in the past, the climax of the parade was the flypast by the Indian Air Force (IAF). Most aircraft on the ORBAT joined the show, which started with the newly-arrived American CH-47F Chinook heavy-lift helicopter and the AH-64E Apache attack helicopter. These were followed by Made in India Dorniers, C-130J Super Hercules special operations aircraft and the game-changing strategic airlift C-17 Globemaster III. The Russian aircraft in the flypast included Sukhoi 30 MKI, MiG 29 and Mi17 medium-lift helicopters.

Making its debut in the flypast was the indigenously-developed Netra airborne early warning and control system on a Brazilian Embraer aircraft flanked by two Sukhoi MKIs, which should have pleased the chief guest, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. British-made upgraded Jaguars flew in formation as did the MiG 29 fighters. As always, aerobatics were left to a single Sukhoi 30 MKI, which appeared low and then disappeared into a vertical shoot into cumulo-nimbus, distressing palpitating hearts.

The Republic Day parade did not end with the flypast but as has become the norm, with Prime Minister Modi’s roadshow, walking down the Rajpath, accompanied by six Tata-made Range Rovers and 25 dark-suited security personnel carrying the briefcase with nuclear security codes. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, anxious to leave, was seen gesticulating towards the Modi cavalcade, virtually enquiring if the marchpast was over.

The Modi Government has delivered on One Rank, One Pension (OROP), accelerated the construction of NWM, conducted surgical ground and airstrikes and appointed a CDS. These are all pretty hefty achievements. Speaking at a media conclave last week, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar listed the achievements of the Modi Government: Triple talaq, Article 370, Ram mandir, Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC)… The maximum applause he attracted was from his reference to the Balakot airstrikes. Yet, as the fiscal budget for 2020-21 will show on Saturday, the investment made by the Government towards defence modernisation is to borrow a famous phrase by General Zia-ul Haq, “peanuts”, barely sufficient for the payment of carryover liabilities.

The truth is that the focus of the Government is on symbolism and over time, further politicising the military. Like yesterday, even at the annual National Cadet Corps (NCC) parade at Cariappa Parade Ground in New Delhi, Modi made an inappropriate election speech. It was, therefore, heartening to see that the new Army Chief, Gen MM Naravane, while briefing the media before the Army Day, talked of the Constitution and its Preamble, which is being widely read out by the youth across the country in reaction to CAA. The General hinted that the military is not committed to the ideology of any political party in power. But the very next week, during the Army Day parade, unsuspectingly he read out chapter and verse of Government-stated virtues of nullifying Article 370, a matter sub-judice in the Supreme Court.

Later today, you will listen to the solemn hymn and melody, Abide With Me, bringing down the flag at the Beating Retreat ceremony, signalling the end of the annual January series of parades, reflecting pomp, pageantry and pride. Momentarily banished, this immortal piece of music will, after all, be played. People protested against its removal in order to “Indianise” the ceremony because it was a Christian and colonial melody without knowing its relevance to military tradition and customs. More absurd changes were attempted in the past.

11,29-1-20,"Shaheen Bagh, again","The BJP is weaponising protests to fan hypernationalism in the hope of diluting AAP’s record of performance

So far, the women-led protest at Shaheen Bagh against the Government’s citizenship and identity policies has been an example of civil society’s spontaneous combustion. But now its sincerity of purpose has lost out to political weaponisation. And days before the Delhi Assembly elections, Shaheen Bagh has been swiftly turned into a test case of nationalism from being an anti-establishment forum, becoming a simplistic referendum on whether minority intrusion can disrupt a majority lives — in this case blockade-hit Delhiites. Or whether it is a mini-Pakistan that needs to be surgically cut out from the heart of the city. The BJP, which has clearly nothing to show for governance compared to that of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), has little ammunition to engage its opponent in a duel. So in a predictable play, it is fanning popular sentiments in the last leg by claiming victimhood of a Hindu way of life by liberal thought. Even if it means deploying one of its crudest MPs to brand all protesters as public enemies, who would be threatening the city with a Gothamesque run as “rapists and killers.” In the process, it is trying to run down the clinical agenda-driven campaign of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who has walked the talk on livelihood issues of water, education, health and electricity. Not only that, the BJP is trying to force him into taking a stand on the polarised debate, a trap Kejriwal has meticulously avoided by not talking about politics at all. In fact, he has experimented with the idea of an apolitical public life, asking even Congress and BJP loyalists to vote for him if they want a better city. With no opponent to justify its brand of politics, the BJP has lionised Shaheen Bagh to push AAP into a corner and compel Kejriwal into making that one remark that would help it divide the citizenry and swing an emotional tide. The BJP knows that unlike it, AAP would require the 13 per cent Muslim vote. But Kejriwal has been diplomatic about not overtly doing anything which could be interpreted as minority appeasement. Even when deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia recently said he would “stand with the protesters”, Kejriwal remained non-committal, saying that people have a right to protest but not at the cost of other people. He even reiterated that AAP’s position against citizenship policies was well-documented and people knew about it. Now BJP’s master strategist Amit Shah is trying to reel him in to a contest on his terms, beginning with purely civic issues, like the traffic mess that citizens have had to put up with over the last 44 days because of protests and sit-ins. He has been releasing videos that “expose” the chinks in AAP’s armour, be it of poor wi-fi or condition of Government schools. Kejriwal has rebutted these, showing how BJP leaders made a video of non-functional schools. And it is this emphasis that Kejriwal is using to hold the BJP to account on its much vaunted claim of sabka vikas. In fact, AAP has the BJP in a bind by refusing to reduce Delhi as a microcosm for the rest of India but magnify it as a city-state circumscribed by its own specifics and a model of governance.

The BJP, which has been out of power in the city for 20 long years, can hardly claim ownership of the citizens’ charter of demands. But Delhiites have reposed faith in it during the Lok Sabha elections and the party is hoping to capitalise on that voteshare surge, particularly among heartland communities. So it is on Shaheen Bagh that Shah is pitching himself to be on stronger ground, deliberately aggravating it with party leaders’ grossly irresponsible and communal remarks on protesters. Kejriwal has so far held himself well against such provocation. In fact, he is continuously reminding Shah that law and order is a subject of the Home Ministry, which the latter heads, and to that extent, he should settle Shaheen Bagh by clearing it in a day and arrest those he thinks are engaged in sedition. He has even claimed the Government was using the protesters as a ruse to consolidate all the anti-AAP and Congress votes and get ahead on percentages. Question is whether Kejriwal can afford to remain ambiguous given the very strident grilling by Shah on Shaheen Bagh and appear as a pragmatist or an escapist. The BJP is hoping this will polarise voters and if it indeed does dominate the discourse in the last leg, the cascading effect could be the swell it needs. Issues after all work from constituency to constituency. But then AAP has a solid legacy as a deliverer of promises. And the Delhiite is a demanding voter.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shaheen-bagh--again-2020-01-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/shaheen-bagh--again.html
12,29-1-20,The road builder,"Nitin Gadkari wants to leave a legacy as the Expressway man. But can he go beyond doing just that?

Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee will always be remembered as the architect of the Golden Quadrilateral, the series of modern highways that connected the four corners of the country. But his vision of a truly connected India is now being brought to complete fruition by Union Road, Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari. He has already overseen the rapid construction of the long-delayed Eastern and Western Peripheral Expressways around Delhi, which have helped mitigate traffic and pollution. Now, he is determined to finish the flagship Delhi-Mumbai corridor in the next three years and this will be a part of 22 expressways and highways, of which 16 are greenfield projects. The total cost of the project to be completed by 2025 is Rs 3.10 lakh crore. This is truly a massive infrastructure scheme that will connect every part of India with (relatively) high-speed roads. Gadkari has been transformational to Indian roads. His dogged determination led to amendments to the Motor Vehicles Act, a good start to stop the chaos on our roads. While the Minister was roundly mocked for his threat to bulldoze the Indian automotive industry if it does not change a few years ago, major car-makers are now producing electric vehicles. Some manufacturers such as Tata Motors have taken the veils off their “Made In India” electric vehicles, making them available for sale for a smallish premium over regular internal combustion engine vehicles.

However, despite the dramatic building project, Gadkari’s legacy will not be complete until he manages to rein in heavy traffic. There is still wanton ignorance or outright disobedience of traffic rules across the country. While the issuance of licences and managing traffic is a State subject, poor traffic rule compliance is an all-India affliction. In cities like Pune, local politicians of all colours have taken it upon themselves to openly flout helmet provisos. With over 150,000 people dying on India’s roads annually, poor traffic management and road design, India loses at least a percentage point of annual growth if not more to all these causes. At a time when economic growth has anyway stalled, it seems to be as good a time as any to whip order onto Indian roads. The reduction in fatalities and injuries will have as dramatic an impact as all the new expressways that are being built. Roads are the nation’s blood vessels, carrying people and goods across the length and breadth of the country. Like in a human body, when blood vessels get blocked, or in this case choked, the nation suffers economic consequences. Building new roads will solve the problem to a certain degree. For that, Gadkari’s legacy is all but certain. But can he leave a greater legacy?",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-road-builder-2020-01-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/the-road-builder.html
13,29-1-20,Cleanliness of Ganga responsibility of entire society: Dy CM,"Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said on Tuesday that cleanliness of the Ganga river was not the responsibility of the government alone but the entire society.

“The Ganga descended on this earth for our salvation and her cleanliness is not only the government’s responsibility but also of the society. In the fertile Gangetic plains, crops grow without any fertilisers. Those who do not have any feelings for Holy Ganga are questioning Ganga Yatra,” he said.

Maurya was addressing a public meeting at Saidpur ground of Ghazipur on the second day of Ganga Yatra which was started from Ballia and will culminate in Kanpur.

The BJP leader said that the public should be congratulated for the tumultous welcome given to Ganga Yatra.

“This is not an ordinary journey as our elders blessed us saying that there is life as long as there is water in Ganga and Yamuna,’’ he said.

“Everyone knows that 24 crore people from across the world took a dip of faith at Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj and sought blessings from the Ganga last year. Ganga does not belong to any caste or religion, it belongs to everyone. The purpose of Ganga Yatra is to make the river serene and ever-flowing and connect everyone with Ganga’s economy. Ganga parks will be constructed and organic farming carried out in villages along the river. The government is also getting ‘Ganga Talab’ constructed which will develop villages,” he said.

Maurya said that he would call upon farmers along the river to engage in organic farming to get pure form of food and also keep the Ganga clean. “While the state government is making arrangements for such farming, farmers should not allow any one to dump polythene or its products into the holy river as it makes everyone sick. Also, do not perform last rites on the banks of Ganga as it pollutes the river. We have to bring back the old form of Ganga,” he said.

Speaking on the occasion, Union Minister Mahendra Nath Pandey said there were some leaders in Uttar Pradesh interested only in increasing their income.

“They are saying that the BJP is misleading people. For these people, Ganga is only water but for us, it is life,” he said.

Pandey said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken the initiative to transform Ganga in true sense.

Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma addressed a public meeting at Garhmukteshwar Ghat on Tuesday. “Ganga Yatra is not only a yatra but a pledge to ensure that the river remains clean and ever-flowing. People’s gathering during the yatra and Ganga aarti has broken caste and religious barriers. People are making society aware about the sanctity of Ganga,” he said.

Earlier, Union Minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti said: “Excitement is visible among people about Ganga Yatra and all are joining by breaking caste and religion barriers.”

Several seniort BJP leaders, including Union minister General VK Singh; UP ministers Chetan Chauhan, Suresh Rana, Kapil Dev Aggarwal and Baldev Singh Aulakh were present on the stage during the meeting.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cleanliness-of-ganga--responsibility-of--entire-society--dy-cm.html
14,29-1-20,"Couple robbed at gun-point, woman gangraped","In a sensational incident in Rampur, armed criminals looted a couple and later gang-raped the woman in Tanda Kotwali police station area on Monday night. The victim later informed police after which senior officers rushed to the spot to take stock of investigations.

As per reports, a man was returning with his wife from his in-laws’ house on a motorcycle when two youths on another bike stopped them in Tanda area. The miscreants took them at the gun-point before robbing them of jewellery, mobile phones and Rs 10,000 in cash. They then dragged the couple to a nearby forest cover and tied the man to a tree before gang-raping his wife in front of him.

After the miscreants escaped, the couple approached local police station. The woman was admitted to a private hospital and a case was registered in this connection. The police launched a manhunt for the culprits.

Meanwhile, three more cases of rape were reported from separate districts in the last 24 hours.

In Muzaffarnagar, a man was booked for raping a woman on the promise of marrying her. Both are natives of the same village and employees of a private company in Dehradun. In her complaint, the woman alleged that Ashutosh Kumar had physical relations with her following promise of marriage. Few months later when she asked him to marry her, he refused. On Tuesday, a case was registered against Kumar, who is siad to be absconding.

In Bhadohi, a 42-year-old woman was raped by the owner of a carpet manufacturing unit and his lawyer friend in Civil Lines area on January 20. The woman is a weaver at the unit and a CCTV footage showed Ram Chandra Gupta and his friend Arun Kumar Dubey dragging her into a room. Her husband was out of town to attend a marriage ceremony when the incident took place.

A case was registered in this connection after her husband lodged a complaint at Kotwali police station on Monday. Gupta and Dubey were arrested and the woman was sent for medical examination.

Meanwhile, in Shahjahanpur, a 10 year-old girl was raped by a neighbour, identified as Jalaluddin (55), at a village while she was all alone in the house on Monday.

15,29-1-20,Take up locust menace in Pb with Pak: Capt to PM,"Concerned over the spate of attacks on crops by swarms of locusts in neighbouring areas of southern Punjab bordering Rajasthan, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday urged the Prime Minister Narendra Modi to direct the Union Ministry of External Affairs and the Indian High Commission in Islamabad to immediately take up the issue with the Government of Pakistan, from where the pests were emanating.

Capt Amarinder, in a letter to the Prime Minister, said that there has been a sustained attack of locust swarms on crops in the state of Rajasthan recently.

A significant number of these pests have also entered into the neighbouring areas of southern Punjab.“Although Rajasthan has been taking the required action to control this locust attack, the best method of control is to manage the breeding ground itself, which incidentally falls in the adjoining desert area of Pakistan,” he wrote.

The Chief Minister thus emphasized the need to take up this issue directly with the Government of Pakistan and press them to take effective steps to sanitize the breeding areas of these locusts.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, which is mandated to control locusts internationally, may also be asked to take effective steps in Pakistan to control breeding to ensure that these do not develop into dangerous swarms which can cause havoc to crops, said the Chief Minister.

At the national level, a coordinated locust control mechanism should be made effective by use of modern technology, helicopters and drones for spraying insecticides, etc to control the spread of the pestilence, he added.

The Chief Minister further suggested that the Union Ministry of Agriculture should also coordinate with the FAO to ensure that the breeding grounds are sanitized and brought under control.

Capt Amarinder warned that any failure to control these swarms could lead to serious implications and consequence for agricultural production in India, especially in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat, which will ultimately affect the commodity prices and food security of the country.

It may be recalled that on the Chief Minister’s directives, the State Agriculture Department has already pressed into service several special monitoring and survey teams in the vulnerable parts of southern Punjab to keep a close tab on the situation around the clock. These teams have been constantly surveying the districts of Bathinda, Sri Muktsar Sahib and Fazilka in the vicinity of Rajasthan border.

Additional Chief Secretary (Development) Viswajeet Khanna is also extensively touring Abohar and the adjoining areas to assess the prevailing situation and evolve a multi-pronged strategy to combat any unforeseen exigency arising out of the locust swarms.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/take-up-locust-menace-in-pb-with-pak--capt-to-pm.html
16,29-1-20,Haryana to recruit 450 doctors soon,"Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij on Tuesday said 450 regular doctors will be recruited through a competitive examination to ensure transparency and merit-based selection in the State.

He said that the State Government is committed to provide better health services to the people of the State. “Recently we had decided to deploy 1652 home guards in all the government hospitals to provide full-proof security to the doctors in the State,” he added.Vij said, “Department received complaints of shortage of doctors in many hospitals of the State. To fill the vacant posts of doctors in various hospitals of the State, we have decided to recruit 450 regular doctors in the State.”

The Health Minister said the complete information about the examination of doctors will be made available to the candidates through various means. 87 posts are reserved for the General Category, 290 for the Scheduled Caste (SC), 17 for the Backward Class A (BCA), 8 for the Backward Class B (BCB), 28 for Ex-Servicemen (ESM) and 17 for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS). This includes the provision of horizontal and vertical reservation for 53 posts of Physically Handicapped (PH) and 5 posts of Eligible Sports Persons (ESP).

Sources in the department said Haryana is witnessing an acute shortage of doctors and there are massive gaps in health infrastructure, contradicting the government’s claims that “health for all” is a priority.

While Community Health Centres (CHCs) have inadequate strength of specialists, Primary Health Centres (PHCs) have insufficient number of doctors. Civil hospitals are facing a severe crunch of specialists. Around 80 doctors hold administrative positions in the department, they added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/haryana-to-recruit-450-doctors-soon.html

According to Beig, “The government wants to mislead people by telling them it is for the benefit of citizens when it is destructive for the whole nation. We don’t want a situation like Assam in the whole country. We have been here for two days protesting against CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC). After reading and being aware of CAA and NRC, people realised how toxic these are for the citizens of the country. People started campaigns against it and now the campaign has reached the international level where people have the same opinion,” she claimed.

On the chief minister’s comment about people coming from outside to instigate protesters in Uttarakhand, she said that no one is getting instigated by anyone. “I am a senior advocate practicing for the last 27 years; can I be instigated by anyone so easily? I have organised this protest which means I have actually read everything about CAA and NRC,” she said. She further added that besides her, other women along with their children are also staying during the nights to support the protest.

According to Asif Hussain, one of the protesters, “India is a secular country but CAA and NRC are based on religion which is against the constitution.

23,29-1-20,Bajwa writes another letter to Capt Amarinder,"Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa on Tuesday shot another letter to Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh alleging that minority institutions were being targeted under the Congress regime which could bring a bad name to the secular party.

At the same time, the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee’s former president has also “requested” the Chief Minister to get the role of “such mischievous elements” probed and their sinister designs nipped in the bud.

Taking up the case of Baring Union Christian College, Batala, Bajwa said that a road was being planned which would be cutting through the playground of the renowned institution.

Bajwa said that some people in our State “intentionally” and with ulterior motive were trying to target minority institutions by damaging their property. “It seems that someone highly placed in political echelons, wants to malign the Congress party government in the state,” he said.

He urged the Chief Minister to stall the plan of building a road that cuts through the playground of Baring Union Christian College, a minority institution in Batala.

“On January 16, local revenue authorities and PWD (B&R) officers barged into the college campus without notice to the management to demarcate the road, creating a tense atmosphere and fear among students and the college management. When they complained, the officials used objectionable language and resorted to intimidating behaviour. It is reprehensible to treat such a reputed minority institution in this manner, maligning the name of the Congress government,” Bajwa wrote.

He said that the road was a misconceived project. “It will lead to nowhere but will ruin the playground being used both by students and people,” he said.“Some people in our State, intentionally and with ulterior motive, are trying to target minority institutions by damaging their property. Someone highly placed in political echelons wants to malign the Congress government in Punjab. The role of such elements needs to be probed and their designs nipped in the bud,” Bajwa added.

Bajwa also invoked the recent resolution passed in Punjab Vidhan Sabha against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), saying that his request was in consonance with the Congress stand against a divisive legislation meant to target minorities.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bajwa-writes-another-letter-to-capt-amarinder.html

27,29-1-20,"Demonetisation, GST, CAA affected integrated farming: Min","Punjab Cabinet Minister Tripat Rajinder Singh Bajwa on Tuesday said that the Union Government's “wrong policies” of demonetisation, GST (Goods and Services Tax), and CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) has badly affected the integrated farming due to which the integrated farmers are suffering huge losses.

Bajwa, the State Rural Development and Animal Husbandry, Dairy Development and Fisheries Minister while addressing one day conference on the ‘Integrated Farming’ organized by the Livelihood Forum-2020 of FICCI and NABARD, said that despite of all these problems and the failures, the need of the hour is to develop, strengthen and promote integrated farming to save small and marginalized farmers.

At the same time, the Minister also stressed on the need for international open market for the success of integrated farming. “The farmers should be allowed to sell their products in the international market without any restrictions,” he said. Bajwa said that practical problems of farmers must be addressed while framing integrated farming polices. “The polices should be jointly framed by the all concerned departments which includes Agriculture, Dairy, Animal Husbandry, Horticulture and even the research institutes such as universities considering all the aspects of success and failures,” he said.

The Minister said that the cost of production is the most important for the success of integrated farming which should be kept in mind while framing and implementing policies.The policy makers and the Government should ensure that integrated farmers are equipped with modern technologies on reasonable rates and supply of quality products to end users, he said while calling for filling sale gap of farmers’ products to the end users to make integrated farming profitable.

Touching another important present day aspect regarding soil fertility, the Minister said that services of sterilization of land and soil test at the doorsteps of the farmers should be provided at very low cost.

He said that the sterilization increases the productivity, but the NABARD and other organizations should come forward to provide assistance for this service as the farmers alone cannot bear this heavy burden of cost.

The Minister added that NABARD should also bear the burden of losses such as death of animals or damage of crops due to natural calamities or any disease.“Punjab’s land is turning barren due to excessive use of chemical fertilizers, groundwater depletion and these have further caused more problems for farmers. Therefore, Punjab should start developing technologies for rainwater harvesting and stop wastage of water,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/demonetisation--gst--caa--affected-integrated-farming--min.html

48,29-1-20,Coronavirus alert sounded in East Singhbhum,"The Health Department has sounded an alert across the district increasing the surveillance of suspects against the deadly ‘China virus’ taking toll on people.

East Singhbhum district civil surgeon, Maheshwar Prasad asked nodal officer of integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP) to start collecting reports from the health hubs and hospitals to ensure whether there is any patient having symptoms of being affected with the coronavirus.

Speaking about the common symptoms of the corona infection, the civil surgeon said at onset of illness are fever, cough and fatigue, the symptoms which are common here in India but later on causes severe respiratory problems.

“We have sounded civil surgeons in all districts to keep a check on the respiratory infections and monitor and report the suspected cases,” said an official. The department clarified that those under surveillance would be those having symptoms like fever, breathing problems and others. It also added that no positive case has been in the state till now.

50,29-1-20,Maps for a Mortal Moon,"The poet is the most conspiratorial of artists. No other artist is privileged to enter another person's mind so invisibly. Poems need nothing but themselves to make themselves felt"", says India's ace poet Adil Jussawalla about a form of art he has excelled, patronised and conspicuously indulged in. But poetry hasn't been his sole vocation. He has edited the now legendary anthology 'New Writing in India', and held diverse editorial positions at newspapers like Times of India and Indian Express, and at Debonair, the men's lifestyle and entertainment magazine modelled after Playboy. Jussawalla also wrote a column for Associated News Features that was syndicated in several newspapers including the widely circulated Deccan Herald and The Afternoon Despatch and Courier.

The pieces comprising Jussawalla's 'Maps for a Mortal Moon' were written over more than 40 years primarily for newspapers and magazines including those aforesaid. One remarkable feature of the book is the timelessness of the pieces presented, as if the writer had written them for eternity.

At the beginning Jussawalla speaks about writers who haven't really found readers befitting their work. Vilas Sarang, Arvind Krishna Mehrotra, Sandipan Chattopadhyay, Dilip Chitre are among them. The Bengali author Sandipan Chattopadhyay's search for readers took ingenious forms when he got his short story 'Biplov-o-Rajmohan' published as a mini-book (4'x3') and put 2000 plus copies of it at a paan-shop at same price as that of a pack of Charminar cigarettes! 'Hey waiter! A pack of CHAMINAR and one MINI-BOOK', customers used to exclaim. Within a week's time the copies were literally looted.

Writers are followed by the author's take on writing - that 'strange old-fashioned pleasure' ! Jussawalla talks wistfully about the joy of 'sensuous writing' accomplished, as it were, through a fountain pen having broad to fine nibs that well suited the fingers and gave great pleasure to their tips. ""A favourite pen destroyed, a favourite pen stolen and you learned what it meant to grow up. It meant a favourite pleasure gone and you had to live with it"".

The book's next part is about reading: 'Unread. And Dead’! The author highlights here the multi-lingual uniqueness of readers in our country.

""Throw in Tamil, take out Urdu, add Bengali here, take out Assamese there and you have a composite picture of the Indian reader basically made from pieces of a linguistic jigsaw in which shades of one language invariably lock in with the colours of another - a leucodermic Barbie doll..."" However, as Ramchandra Guha argues, bilingualism or multilingualism among intelligentsia, being the product of colonialism, and later, of nationalism, has considerably declined lately and the intellectual universe in India is no longer what he terms 'linguidextrous'.

In his 1932 essay 'In Praise of Idleness' Bertrand Russell had provocatively opined: 'I think there's too much work done in the world, and that immense harm is caused by the belief that work is virtuous' and had argued that the road to happiness and prosperity lied in an organised diminution of work ! Jussawalla, in similar vein, writes 'In Praise of Straggling': 'Worried about being late? Anxious that you've missed the bus again? Don't worry. Let others do that. There's pleasure to be had in crawling out of the clockwork, in taking things low... there's more pleasure to be had in straggling than hurrying'. Once the author was invited, he recounts, to a radio interview in Honolulu and he arrived a month late ! ""I was delighted to see how polite hosts could be when stressed. They still had to put me up free""!!

The author is a keen observer. He walks places across continents encountering a veritable kaleidoscope of human behaviour, from love and longings to hatred and xenophobia. He walks with iconic Marathi writer Daya Pawar in Paris and misses Toni Morrison on French media immediately after she had won the Nobel Prize. He has been walking and observing Mumbai since the Bombay days of yore and where he's often been mistaken for a 'foreigner' despite speaking Hindi or Gujarati.

This gives Adil Jussawalla, says Jerry Pinto the anthology's editor, a 'unique position from which to observe; he's always on the periphery of what's happening, the outsider looking in'. No wonder the writer comes out a loner and terribly pessimist while reminiscing about things human. He writes: ""The worst thing about being a human being is being a human being. 'I wish I was bird', as the railway clerk in Nissim Ezekiel's poem says. But if I were, the worst thing about being a bird would be being a bird"". There's a fair chance that a reader might get distracted by Jussawalla's gloom; he even sees a friend as someone who betrays. But then he argues that a dose of pessimism helps set things right and restores human balance. Hmm !

Jussawalla writes about the gamblers of yesteryears sans cynicism and with doses of charm. He evocatively refers to a time when gamblers were 'as common as cockroaches' and lurked in every corner of his childhood 'like question marks or cautionary tales'.

Gambling was once our national addiction but, the author laments, 'alcohol, cocaine and smack have taken its place and the old-fashioned gambler has become small fry, his addiction too trivial for social concern'

Adil Jussawalla's writes with a wry and understated humour. In 'Jokes Apart' , his series of deadpan reports from the year 2099 are as rib-tickling as they can be.

Lastly. Every essay of this anthology is worth its weight in gold. And I insist. The essays offered here in fact ought to be savoured bit by bit and not to be rushed. As I did, finishing the 340-odd pages in well over two weeks. Reading, stopping, reflecting, enjoying. Repeat.

Reading the book there's a regret though; it came my way five years too late. It's indeed sad, besides, that Adil Jussawalla the prose writer isn't with us any longer.

The 12-year-old wild tusker had killed four persons, including a 12-year-old boy, in the Tamka and Jajpur Road Forest Ranges recently, continued creating havoc in the region for the last few days.

Many locals suspected that Forest Department officials would release the rogue elephant in the forest in their area, after which it would again unleash terror in the villages around the forest.

53,29-1-20,BJP protests against Chaibasa killings,"Dumka BJP unit on Tuesday staged a day-long silent protest outside DC office, Dumka here against the killing of seven villagers, allegedly by the supporters of the Pathalgarhi movement, in the Chaibasa region of the State. BJP workers including former Minister Louis Marandi , district BJP president Niwash Mandal sat outside the Dy Commissioner’s office holding placards asking as to why Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have been silent on the death of seven people.

Speaking on the incident that happened in Chaibasa earlier this week, former minister Louis Marandi said, ""The decision taken by Hemant Soren cabinet to withdraw all the cases against the organisers of Pathalgarhi is not in the interest of Jharkhand. I want to say that the law and order situation has finished in the State and Soren has said about the incident in Chaibasa that the persons who killed them is ours and those who have been killed is also ours. Such statements of State’s Chief Minister are quite unfortunate. We have organised a day-long silent protest and we will also give a memorandum to the Governor, through Dumka DC.”

Seven villagers were abducted and killed earlier this week in Chaibasa in the West Singhbhum district of Jharkhand, allegedly by the supporters of the Pathalgadi movement. The mutilated bodies of the victims were recovered from a forest about seven kilometre from Burugulikera village.

According to reports, Pathalgadi supporters had organised a meeting in the Burugulikera village on Sunday. A few villagers in the meeting objected to the way the movement was being carried out in the region and had a heated argument with the supporters. They were later abducted and their decapitated bodies were found in the forest. Chief Minister Hemant Soren has ordered an SIT probe into the incident, which is supposed to submit its report very soon.

BJP district president Niwash Mandal said, “We are protesting against the government's inaction. This situation occurred after this government came to power in the state. The government has failed to control the rising criminal activities in Jharkhand. We demand that people behind this incident be punished.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-protests-against-chaibasa-killings.html

59,29-1-20,Curfew continues in Lohardaga on sixth day,"Curfew continued on the sixth consecutive day in Lohardaga on Tuesday following an attack on pro- CAA procession. A two hour relief was given on Monday evening, but due to the death of one injured Neeraj Gram Prajapati, who was under treatment at RIMS and torching of a truck at Patratoli in Lohardaga the curfew was strictly imposed again in the whole district on Tuesday.

After the administration reviewed the current situation in Lohardaga, curfew was imposed in the entire Lohardaga district on Tuesday and a team of administrative officials is taking command of the review and security at every point by dividing the city into 5 sectors.

Neeraj Prajapati's father Roop Ram Prajapati's health worsened on Tuesday.

He was admitted to Lohardaga Sadar Hospital where after first aid he was referred to RIMS, Ranchi. The body on Neeraj Prajapati was sent home on Tuesday and his last rites were performed in the evening under strict vigil of security forces.

Meanwhile, Lohardaga SP Priyadarshi Alok said that Prajapati was not a victim of the communal violence. “It was just a coincidence that Prajapati had severe bouts of multiple illness, which occurred to him on January 23, when there were communal convulsions in Lohardaga and a few without bothering to know the fact got speculative about his sickness and finally about his fatality,” he said.

“When he fell sick in Lohardaga on January 23 his family rushed him to Sadar hospital there where he was given some primary treatment. He was then taken to Orchid Medical Centre H B Road Ranchi. From here too he was taken to RIMS where he breathed his last while undergoing treatment there,” he added

IG Human Rights Navin Kumar Singh and IG (Operations) Saket Kumar Singh corroborated the version of SP Lohardaga and said that the SP’s version is based on two medical reports one of the Orchid Medical Centre Ranchi and the other of RIMs Ranchi wherein the common medical findings of both these health institutes were Prajapati had no external trauma or injury either on his body or on his head.

IG HR and IG Ops quoting RIMS medical report said, “Patient died on January 27 at 6.15PM due to cardiac arrest, due to septic shock with contributing cause brain stem bleed (cva).

IG HR Navin Kumar Singh said, “Following this gross and blatant distortion of factors behind this death, we decided not to give any break / relaxation in curfew today as police had this information that in the name of cremation there would swell a large number of people and may indulge in hijacking the body for striking any bargain now.”

IG HR said 16 people have been remanded in judicial custody since the outbreak of communal violence here.

Sources said the man was in the Jan 23 procession in Lohardaga and at 4 PM the same evening he returned home with complaints of weakness, numbness and tingling sensation in one half of the body and then in both upper and lower limbs.

What the sources spoke about these symptoms were found written in the medical report of RIMs Ranchi.

RIMS medical report said the man was hypertensive then despite having no previous history of it and had one episode of seizure and fell unconscious.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/curfew-continues-in-lohardaga-on-sixth-day.html

67,29-1-20,Grand alliance doing what it flayed BJP for: Shahdeo,"State BJP Spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo today said that when the Grand Alliance partners were in Opposition they used to term 11 member Cabinet unconstitutional. “According to them 11 member Cabinet cannot even stand for a day, but today in the Hemant Soren government there are 11 ministers in the Cabinet including the Chief Minister.

This is ridiculous that the Grand alliance is doing the same act, for which it used to criticise the BJP earlier,” he said.

Pratul said that this shows the parties’ double political character. He said that even today a ministerial vacancy gives a clear indication that the Congress has tremendous pressure on the coalition Government.

“The Congress is still exerting pressure to take up an additional ministerial position. It is clear that the State government will not run from Jharkhand but at the behest of the Gandhi family of Delhi,” he added.

The State BJP Spokesperson said that the Bharatiya Janata Party is heartbroken by the death of Neeraj Prajapati due to the Lohardagga violence.

The BJP strongly condemns the coalition government's attempt to cover up the entire episode.

Pratul said that the BJP demands a Government job and Rs 50 lakh compensation to the kin of the deceased from the coalition government.

76,29-1-20,Rawat raises various issues at Zonal meet,"Union Home minister Amit Shah presided over the 22nd meeting of the Central Zonal Council at Nava Raipur in Chhattisgarh on Tuesday. Attending the meeting, the Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat raised various issues related to compensatory afforestration, national food security scheme and issues specific to mountainous regions.

Speaking at the meeting, Rawat requested that the Union Government allow compensatory afforestation on degraded forest land for all centrally funded, externally aided and state funded schemes. He also sought increase in the allocation to Uttarakhand for state police modernisation.

Further, under the national food security scheme, the government of India should bear the full expense of transporting the food grains. While the subsidy on pulses should be continued, assistance should also be provided for expanding the storage capacity in mountainous regions.

Elaborating on these issues, Rawat requested that the Rs 15 per kilogramme subsidy on pulses should be continued. He said that the Mukhyamantri Dal Poshit Yojana has been started in Uttarakhand under which 23 lakh ration card holders are provided two kilogrammes pulses per month at cheap rates. Further, under the national food security scheme and Antyodaya Ann Yojana, Rs 100 per quintal is being provided for transportation of food grains. However, Uttarakhand being a mountainous state, the transportation cost here is higher than in the plains.

Presently, Rs 237 per quintal expenditure is being incurred on transporting food grains due to which the state government is incurring Rs 65 crore additional expenditure every year. Stating this, Rawat said that the entire transport expense under national food security scheme should be borne by the Centre.

Seeking financial assistance from the Centre for expanding the storage capacity in Uttarakhand, he said advance storage for three months is necessary in the mountains during the rains and winter considering heavy rains, snowfall and landslides. The State needs about 2.5 lakh metric tonnes storage but has about 1.94 lakh metric tonnes storage at present.

Regarding compensatory afforestation for centrally funded, externally aided and state funded schemes, Rawat sought approval for plantation on degraded forest land. The Government of India has permitted compensatory afforestation on degraded forest land for road projects of the Border Roads Organisation and Central Government/Central PSU projects but the same has not been permitted for schemes financed by the state government.

He said that such difference in standards in one state do not appear justified.

Rawat further pointed out that the Territorial Army (TA) is making important contribution in Namami Gange and tree plantation in Uttarakhand.

The TA can also be used for land and water conservation works for which the state government has funds in the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) but under the relevant Act, the state cannot finance works of these units of the TA from CAMPA fund.

Stating this, he requested the Centre to make necessary amendments in the Act to authorise the State Government to fund works of the TA through CAMPA. Otherwise, the Centre should facilitate this through the national CAMPA fund, he said.

On the subject of police modernisation, Rawat requested that the ministry of Home Affairs raise the financial allocation for state police modernisation and also permit the use of the fund for buildings and vehicles too.

Provision for the police should also be considered under the Border Area Development Programme, he suggested.

77,29-1-20,Cong starts damage control exercise,"A day after the revolt of the Dharchula MLA, Harish Dhami, fire fighting exercise has started in the state unit of Congress party. As a damage control measure, the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president, Pritam Singh met Dhami on Tuesday.

In the meeting he tried his best to assuage the hurt pride of the MLA. Talking to The Pioneer, Dhami said that he had a congenial talk with the PCC president.

“He accepted my view point and said that he would have taken a step similar to Dhami in such a situation. The PCC president said that he had sent my name at 16th spot in the list of the special invited members,’’ he said. Dhami clarified that he has no love for any position in the PCC as he already is an MLA but added that the issue is associated with his prestige.

The two time MLA from Dharchula in Pithoragarh is peeved at finding his place at last ( 98th) position in the list of secretaries. Dhami appeared mellowed after meeting with the PCC president but he made it clear that his fight against the Leader of Opposition (LoP), Indira Hridayesh would continue. He added that he want that the sycophants with no grip on ground should be dissuaded and real workers who work hard for party should be promoted. It is worth mentioning here that Dhami on Monday had accused Indira Hridayesh for adopting a soft stance on the government. Dhami also claimed that one of her PROs was appointed in gross violation of norms in SIIDCUL when she was minister.

Dharchula MLA also claimed that eight out of eleven MLAs were not in favour of making her the LoP but everyone accepted the decision of the party high command. He added that party high command would be requested to replace Indira Hridayesh from the position of LoP.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-starts-damage-control-exercise.html
78,29-1-20,Uttarakhand to set up Sainya Dham in Doon,"In sync with the Sainya-Dham notion mooted by the Prime Minister (PM) , Narendra Modi, Uttarakhand government has started deliberations for construction of a mega Sainya Dham in the provisional state capital.

The state administration has started a drive to find a suitable place for the proposed Sainya Dham. The additional secretary, Sainik Kalyan, Pradeep Singh Rawat told The Pioneer that efforts are being made to find 35-40 Bigha of land for the Sainya Dham in and around Dehradun.

He however added that the land has not yet been finalised. It is learnt that the proposed Sainik Dham in Dehradun would be built on the lines of the 'National War Memorial' at New Delhi. The place would have a museum highlighting the sacrifices done by the martyred soldiers.

The Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has made it clear that the proposed Dham should be a majestic structure. He wants that the proposed place completely digital where information about every martyr can be obtained with click of a mouse.

The concept of Sainya Dham was mooted by PM Modi during his public meeting at Rudrapur last year.

At that he had said that since every second family of Uttarakhand is associated with armed forces, the state has a fifth Dham which is Saniya Dham.

Uttarakhand has rich tradition of sending its youth to serve in the armed forces of the country. A rough estimate put the number of armed forces veterans and Veer Naris (widows of armed forces personnel) at 1.70 lakhs .

The state is home to about thirty thousand retired paramilitary forces personnel. Similarly an estimated 1.50 lakh personnel belonging to the state are serving in different wings of armed forces of the country.

The inclination to serve in armed forces of the country is so high in this predominately mountainous state that almost every family has someone who is in armed forces.

The ex -servicemen, the serving armed forces personnel and their families also create a formidable political force in the state.

Considering this in mind, the state government is moving ahead on the concept of Sainya Dham.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/uttarakhand-to-set-up-sainya-dham-in-doon.html
79,29-1-20,Revised traffic plan to be implemented during Smart City work,"After the four-day trial of one-way system as part of a new traffic plan in Dehradun, the same was discontinued on Tuesday.

However the deputy inspector general/Dehradun senior superintendent of police Arun Mohan Joshi said that a revised traffic plan will be implemented later when execution of works for the Smart City project begins.

According to Joshi, “The traffic plan will be revised after reviewing the issues that were faced during the days of the trial. The motive of the trial was to study the plan efficiently so that necessary improvements can be made to make it more proficient.

The revised plan will be implemented by police when the Smart City works begin in Dehradun. The route from Clock Tower to Dilaram Chowk would be dug out during the Smart City work so by then we’ll have to put the revised traffic plan in action.”

He further said that though implementation of the traffic plan was challenging, it was not that troublesome for all the road users. The maximum additional distance one had to cover was 900 metres.

Another aspect witnessed during the trial was that at times, vehicle users wanting to avoid the roads on which the one-way system was implemented, ended up congesting other parts of the city, he added. It is pertinent to mention here that the trial conducted by Dehradun police has elicited a mixed response from commuters. Some members of the business fraternity especially on Rajpur Road and Paltan Bazaar had also objected to the traffic plan stating that it had affected their business negatively. However, some citizens had opined that barring a few hiccups, they did not face any major problem during the trial of the traffic plan.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/revised-traffic-plan-to-be-implemented-during-smart-city-work.html

87,29-1-20,Ranchi airport gets free pick-and-drop lane,"The Birsa Munda Airport in Ranchi on Tuesday opened a dedicated lane for pick-and-drop vehicles, which passengers can use free of cost and avoid additional parking charges, Airport Director Vinod Sharma said. Several passengers, including politicians, businessmen and social activists, had raised objection to the additional parking charge for private vehicles that pick and drop passengers at the airport.

The decision of including a free pick-and-drop lane for vehicles entering the airport was taken at a meeting of the Airport Advisory Committee (AAC) recently.

While airport officials had said that there would be an upper limit on the duration for which pick-and-drop vehicles can use the parking without being charged, Sharma on Tuesday said that there was no upper limit as such but the vehicles should not stay parked in the lane as it would disrupt the traffic.

“The idea behind the dedicated lane is to provide passengers the option to get out of the airport and hop in their car without having to pay extra money. Same is applicable for passengers who board their flights from Ranchi. They can get down and allow the vehicle to leave the airport premises,” Sharma said.

The AAC meeting, which took the decision was presided over by Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth and attended by Rajya Sabha MP Mahesh Poddar, who has been an active member of the committee. Hatia legislator Navin Jaiswal also attended the meeting.

Besides taking the decision of relieving pick-and-drop vehicles from parking charges, the AAC also decided to use funds from Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) treasury of the airport to rehabilitate the villagers who had lost land due to construction and expansion of the airport and beautify the villages surrounding the airport.

The Birsa Munda Airport is fast growing in terms of connectivity with other cities. The largest airport in Jharkhand already has 30 flights connecting Ranchi to important cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore and Hyderabad. The airport also has an international bay, but is yet to get any international flights. The increasing passenger traffic in Ranchi demands for better facilities and the Airport Authority of India (AAI) is consistently working on finding new ways to enhance the travel experience of passengers, said airport officials.

Meanwhile, the airport authorities here have also floated tenders for restaurants and bar in the airport premises. Besides, several shops and showrooms have come up in the airport terminals in order to provide entertainment, refreshment and quality shopping experience to passengers here.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ranchi-airport-gets-free-pick-and-drop-lane.html

93,29-1-20,Mentally-ill from Kerala reunited with kin after 8 yrs,"A mentally-ill man from Kerala, who had gone missing about eight years ago, reunited with his two brothers on the Republic Day with the effort of a Sundargarh man.

According to sources, Ummar Koya (41), a resident of Paniyankara village of Calicut district in Kerala, was mentally ill. During the year 2012, he had reportedly decided to visit Ervadi Dargah in Tamil Nadu and had left for it. He, however, did not return home ever since.

The family members of Ummar had lodged a missing complaint of Ummar and searched him in Kerala and Tamil Nadu but in vain.

Ummar thereafter somehow had reached Sundargarh. He was wandering for more than seven years. He was often spotted loitering in front of District Social Security Officer office and also premises of Sundargarh Collectorate. He was seen wearing dirty clothes and his hair was in shabby condition. He was speaking something in Malayalam. Whoever was giving him food, he was eating and most of the time, he was sleeping on the rest shed in front of Social Security office.

Three years ago, one Shiju Thomas of Sundargarh made a video of Ummar and contacted Asianet News and requested to telecast the news on their channels. After several attempts of Shiju, the video on Ummar was telecast on September 7, 2019 with contact number of Shiju. Shiju also shared about this on social media groups and different platforms and requested to contact him on his mobile number. So many people contacted Shiju but Shiju could not find his actual relatives.

In the meanwhile, during December 2019, Sundargarh District Social Security Officer Ashok Kumar Bisi, after noticing the mentally ill man, informed RC Behera of Halfway home, an NGO. Volunteers of the NGO brought Ummar to Rourkela. Ummer was admitted in a private hospital and after getting treatment there for a month, he slightly recovered.

Shiju went to the hospital and talked to Ummar and after several attempts, Ummar could remember his location and his siblings' names. Ummar said location was in Calicut district of Kerala. Shiju contacted another person of Calicut district and after several chain contacts, Ummar's home and relatives were traced.

Ummar’s two younger brothers identified as Mustaffa and Samsuddin reached Rourkela on January 26 and met their brother after about eight years. They hugged Ummar and got emotional. “We are really very delighted getting our brother back after about eight years,” said Mustaffa and Samsuddin, brothers of Ummar.

Govt serious about one Nation One Std policy

Bhopal: Last year in September, Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan stated that the Government is seriously considering implementing the One Nation One Standard policy. With the intention to ensure the quality of all products and services across different industries, the policy will help in converging all the standards with BIS.

Although the complete details of the policy would be framed out later, its main purpose will be to ensure uniform standards are made mandatory for all products. Further, the Government also stated that the purpose of the policy is not to bring back the inspector raj but to ensure that quality products are made available to all consumers in the country.

Elaborating on the issue, the Consumer Affairs Minister invited SDOs to converge with the national standard framing body. This means, if the Food Safety and Standards Authority (FSSAI) converges its standards, then its products would be known as BIS/FSSAI.

In relation to this, ISHRAE President Vikram Murthy stated, “I share policy is to assist Bureau with participation in their various Sectional Committees. Prior to this, we had also written a Standard on ‘Indoor Environmental Quality’ (IEQ), and we hope that BIS adopts it as a National Standard in the future”.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/in---brief-in---brief-2020-01-29.html

108,29-1-20,"Scanner on NRIs, foreigners visiting J'khand","People traveling to Jharkhand from countries affected by Coronavirus – a mysterious new virus that has claimed around 100 lives in China and infected nearly 5000 people across the globe – will be kept under surveillance for at least 28 days since landing in Ranchi, officials from the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) said on Tuesday.

The surveillance will be a part of the State’s precautionary mechanism to curtail the spread of the airborne virus in Jharkhand, said IDSP Director Rakesh Dayal. “No suspected cases of Coronavirus have been reported yet in Jharkhand. However, we are taking all precautionary measures to prevent the virus from entering the State. Any person travelling to Jharkhand from China or other countries where the virus has spread will be under surveillance for 28 days as a part of the drill,” Dayal added.

Jharkhand has sounded a precautionary alert for Coronavirus, which infects the respiratory tract of patients and causes symptoms similar to common flu. According to news reports, till Monday, a total of 33,552 passengers arriving in India from China in 155 flights have been screened. Suspected cases have been reported from New Delhi, Kerala, Maharashtra and also neighbouring Bihar – a development that rung the alarm bells in Jharkhand.

Jharkhand shares its borders with Bihar and several thousand people travel from Bihar to Jharkhand every day. The virus can easily enter one’s body through the respiratory tract, which means that a person does not need to have any physical contact with an infected person in order to get infected, doctors said. “There is an international airport in Gaya, Bihar. The suspected case may have come from one of those international flights,” said Dayal.

“Since there are no international airports in Jharkhand, we will not have a provision for screening passengers for the virus at the airport. However, agencies in the cities from where these passengers will take a connecting flight to Ranchi will inform us if any person is suspected to have contracted the virus,” said Dayal. No positive cases of the virus have been detected in India so far, he added.

According to the official website of the World Health Organisation (WHO), on December 31, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The virus did not match any other known virus. This raised concern because when a virus is new, it is not known how it may affect people, One week later, on January 7, Chinese authorities confirmed that they had identified a new virus. The new virus is a coronavirus, which is a family of viruses that include the common cold, and viruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). This new virus was temporarily named 2019-nCoV.

The virus has wreaked havoc in China and also spread to the United States of America and United Kingdom. It has reportedly claimed at least 80 lives in Thailand.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/scanner-on-nris--foreigners-visiting-j-khand.html

With today’s Cabinet expansion, which is the first after Soren took oath on December 29 the strength of Cabinet has gone to 11.

Badal, Mahto and Thakur are first-time ministers and Joba Manjhi had been a minister in the previous NDA governments before she joined the JMM. The other four were ministers in the previous UPA governments.

Chief Minister Hemant Soren after expansion of his Cabinet tweeted, “This is not a ministry but it will work as Team Jharkhand. The Team will work for development and progress of State.” The CM in his tweet urged all ministers to make Jharkhand a progressive State.

Sources said that though Hemant Soren has tried to maintain demography and caste equation in his ministry, Kolhan and Santhal region have received lion’s share in Cabinet. From Kolhan, Champai Soren who is popularly known as Kolhan Tiger and MLA from (Saraikela Kharsawan, Joba Manjhi MLA from Manoharpur and whose political career revolves around Jul Jungle Zameen have been inducted in Cabinet.

The other lawmaker from Kolhan region who was made minister in Cabinet expansion is Banna Gupta who comes from Jamshedpur West. Banna, a former Agriculture Minister during Hemant Soren’s first tenure as Chief Minister is likely to get important portfolio.

The Soren Cabinet consists of four tribals including Hemant himself, two minorities, two OBCs, two upper caste and one scheduled caste.

As per the constitutional provisions, Jharkhand can have a maximum of 12 ministers including the chief minister. The previous Raghubar Das government had run the dispensation with only 11 ministers all through its five-year term.

Earlier, the Cabinet expansion was to take place on January 24, but the function was postponed at last hour due to killing of seven tribals at Burugulikera village in Chibasa by alleged pro Pathalgadi supporters.

116,29-1-20,"CM opens virtual PS, 2 other police projects","Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Tuesday launched three transformational projects of the State police under its 5T initiative aimed at reducing human interface with the Government offices.

The three projects are Virtual Police Station, Road Accident Case Documents Module and Medico Legal Opinion System.

“My Government is committed to provide citizen-centric governance under the 5T initiative. The projects launched today will effectively reduce the necessity of citizens to visit police stations,” said the Chief Minister.

The Virtual Police Station is an online mechanism established at the State Crime Records Bureau in Bhubaneswar. It will facilitate online registration of FIR in unknown motor vehicle theft cases. If a case remains undetected for 21 days, final form would be auto generated at CCTNS. It would also benefit citizens for claiming insurance in motor vehicle theft cases. A citizen can also file FIR through Citizens Portal or Sahayata Mobile App.

The Road Accident Case Documents Module is a web-based application which can be accessed by visiting the site www.imsop.odisha.gov.in. It will help insurance companies or the victims in downloading the required documents like FIR, final form, spot map, MVI report, inquest, post-mortem report, driving license, registration certificate or any other document as required. It will do away the role of middlemen and expedite the process of insurance claims. Insurance companies can approach Crime Records Bureau for creation of user IDs and passwords to access the site. Complainants can access the site by filling up requisite details and OTP sent to mobile number mentioned in FIR.

The Medico Legal Opinion System ia also a web-based system helpful to both the police and medical professionals. The police can submit requisitions online for medical examination of victims. Doctors will upload their medical examination reports online which will be down-loaded by police for necessary action. This will ensure transparency and fix accountability in case of any undue delay in getting medical examination reports. It will also help in reducing extraneous considerations or interference while giving medical opinion in sensitive cases. Timely receipt of medical examination reports will help victims in getting compensation in time.

Minister of State for Home Dibya Sankar Mishra said there is a visible transformation marked in the behaviour towards women and children at police stations. DGP Abhaya outlined the details of the three initiatives.

5T Secretary VK Pandian said the Government is receiving good feedback on police activities in the districts. He also expressed happiness over removal of middlemen from institutions like hospitals and RTOs. He also appreciated the police department for taking huge steps for solving industrial disputes. He interacted with the SPs of some districts to get an idea about the understanding of the officials on three transformational projects.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-opens-virtual-ps--2-other-police-projects.html

Seeking an investigation into it and taking appropriate action as per law, Bagh had made a police complaint on December 13, 2009. When police refused to register his complaint as an FIR, Bagh approached the High Court seeking its intervention.

Considering the submissions made in the High Court, Justice Dr BR Sarangi has directed the Birmaharajpur police station IIC to register the complaint of Bagh as an FIR and take follow-up action in accordance with law as laid down by Supreme Court in the Lalita Kumari Vs State of UP case decided in the year 2014.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hc-directs-police-to-book-minister-behera.html

On the directives of East Singhbhum deputy commissioner, Ravi Shankar Shukla, Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee has issued helpline numbers and included 2 dedicated city managers for prompt solution to parking issues.

“We have assigned city manager Ravishankar Bharti for looking after parking bays existing in Jamshedpur East assembly areas and will be available on helpline number 7004787828 while those parking vehicles at dedicated bays in Jamshedpur West assembly areas can dial 9631226455 and our city manager Ambuj Kumar will be available for prompt solution to their woes,” said JNAC special officer Krishna Kumar.

Meanwhile, the civic body has also directed the private contractors entrusted to manage the parking bays to ensure the safety of the vehicles.

Incidentally, the road stretch on Straight Mile Road witnesses heavy traffic around 2 lakhs daily throughout the day as it connects residential areas like Baradwari, Bhalubasa, Sitaramdera, Agrico, Sidhgora and Baridih with commercial hub of Sakchi. Besides private vehicles large number of commercial vehicles use this stretch.

A traffic official said that the road obstruction and congestion due to violation of parking norms has been a problem.

We do carry out prosecution of vehicles for ‘no parking’ violations but vehicle owners plead that they were not aware that this area was a designed ‘no-parking’ spot. There have been road signage installed on the road at different points but people do not bother to take a look at these signage. After consultation with Jusco we have come up with this idea.

Vehicle owners while stopping for parking on the road now cannot plead that they have not seen the signage as it would be clearly visible on road surface. This apart reflective signage will also indicate the zones even at night.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jnac-launches-helpline-numbers-to-end-parking-woes.html

Calling for adherence to the Constitution drafted by BR Ambedkar, BJP lawmaker Narayan Tripathi said, “We should either follow Ambedkar’s Constitution or we should just tear and throw it away.” The BJP MLA’s stance is completely in the line of Congress and other opposition parties like Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party, Nationalist Congress Party and the left parties who have described the law as being “unconstitutional” and against the secular fabric of Indian republic.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-mla-opposes-caa--says-people-shouldn---t-be-divided-in-name-of-religion.html
138,29-1-20,Do everything to not increase stateless people: Luxembourg Min,"nAs the European Union Parliament is set to debate on motions against the Citizenship Amendment Act(CAA) in Brussels on Wednesday, Luxembourg, a European Union member, on Tuesday said here it does not want to “interfere in the domestic policy” of India but asked New Delhi to ‘do everything” to not increase stateless people.

This assertion comes a day after France, a founding member of the European Union, said it considers the new citizenship law an internal political matter of India. Making France’s position clear, French sources had said the CAA is India’s internal political matter and it has been stated on several occasions. They said the European Parliament is an institution independent of member States and the European Commission.

Visiting Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn made his country’s stand clear about non-interference in the domestic policy during talks with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar.

“What I said to the minister (Jaishankar) this morning is ‘do everything you can do to not increase stateless people’. That is something that we have to fight against. Rest concerns India,” Asselborn said during an interactive session at the India International Centre after his meeting with Jaishankar.

With six resolutions moved in the European Parliament against the CAA, Asselborn said Jaishankar could explain his point of view when he visits Europe in February and March.

Replying to a question about the resolutions, Asselborn defended the move, saying the European Parliament also criticises its members often, and takes up “aggressive” positions against them.

“The problem is if you have an addition of migration and religion, it is very difficult to find a solution,” the minister said in reference to the Indian context.

“I don’t want to interfere, but if we have the possibility as Foreign Ministers to have this discussion with him (Jaishankar), if he is also going to the European Parliament...I saw this morning that there is a will not to increase the number of stateless persons,” the Luxembourg Foreign Minister added.

“He (Jaishankar) explained me his position this morning and I think that if we are able to have a discussion for instance on what is happening with this bill in Assam. We have similar problems in the European Union...,” Asselborn said.

India has through out maintained the CAA was an entirely internal matter of India and that the legislation was adopted through democratic means after a debate in both houses of Parliament.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/do-everything-to-not-increase-stateless-people--luxembourg-min.html
139,29-1-20,CRPF carries out vigilance check of its 3L personnel,"The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) has carried out a thorough internal audit of its installations in Jammu & Kashmir and the entire personnel strength of over three lakh to filter any possible “subversive” elements in its ranks following the arrest of rogue police officer Davinder Singh.

CRPF Director General A P Maheshwari said the incident involving Deputy Superintendent of Police Davinder Singh was “grave” and an “area of extreme concern” for the security forces. He also said that all stakeholders should ensure that such things do not occur.

So it was “common sense” to carry out such an audit of its manpower, deployed as the lead force for counter-terrorist and anti-Naxal operations across the country, when any incident like this take place, Maheshwari said.

He further said, “If something happens somewhere, it is a case to revisit ourselves and that is what we have done. We have no doubts about our personnel.”

The counter-intelligence units of the CRPF were recently asked to check the credentials of the personnel after obtaining data from all available sources and they have been asked to be kept on “active mode” for some more time, another official said on the anti-subversive measures adopted by the Force after Davinder Singh’s episode. The CRPF has also undertaken an audit of all its installations in the Valley in order to plug any possible loopholes, the official said.

“No security grid should be allowed to be weakened by such episodes. So, all forces have to keep an internal watch,” Maheshwari he said on the arrest of DSP Singh.

“All forces should maintain vigilance so that there is no such type of subversion or some sort of intrusion within the force...,” the DG told reporters at a paramilitary establishment in Gurgaon.

The Jammu and Kashmir Police had arrested Singh at Mir Bazar in Kulgam district of the Valley along with Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists Naveed Babu and Altaf, besides a lawyer who was operating as an over ground worker for terror outfits earlier this month. The case has since been transferred to the NIA.

Maheshwari said that somebody from a security force trying to collaborate with adversaries is a “serious matter”. However, he added that a lone incident cannot be used to “brand” the entire force which has done onerous work in the past.

“We are further strengthening our systems... Which were already in place,” he said referring to the vigilance and intelligence checks conducted on their personnel in Kashmir valley and other places.

He said the CRPF has “changed” its tactics and bettered its security drills in the Valley after the Pulwama terror attack on its convoy that took place almost a year back.

Maheshwari, however, said no one can guarantee that such incidents will not take place in the future owing to the dynamic nature of counter-terror operations.

But, he said, his force can assure and “guarantee” that terror elements will not have it easy if they have an engagement with the CRPF that has deployed over 70,000 troops for counter-terror operations in Jammu and Kashmir.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/crpf-carries-out-vigilance-check-of-its-3l-personnel.html
140,29-1-20,Pak must take demonstrable steps against terror groups: Rajnath,"Urging countries in South Asia to fight the scourge of terrorism, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday lashed out at Pakistan for using “terror as a State policy” towards India rather than peacefully settling disputes through dialogue. He also urged Pakistan to take demonstrable steps against terror groups.

Making this point here while addressing the 12th South Asia conference, Singh said it is essential that terrorists and their ideological and financial networks are cut off and do not receive state support.

“India is engaged in conversations with its neighbours except one country in order to develop a joint approach for regional peace and security. True pathway to regional peace and security lies in understanding each other’s sensitivities and following basic principles of non-interference in each other’s internal affairs,” he said.

Singh said the South Asia region must unite in its efforts to defeat terrorism. Mumbai, Pathankot, Uri, and Pulwama attacks are grim reminders of state-sponsored terrorism by a neighbouring country. “Pakistan must take demonstrable steps against terror groups,” he said.

Underlining the basic approach of the country, Singh said India has always harboured the philosophy of hospitality driven by ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,’ Singh said as he quoted Sanskrit shlokas to emphasise the idea of India’s ethos of inclusivity and unity. In the Modi government’s second term, the country’s neighbourhood has been recognised as the most important priority of its foreign policy, he said.

Leaders of SAARC were invited by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his swearing-in ceremony in 2014 and BIMSTEC leaders invited for the 2019 oath-taking event, indicating his emphasis on the neighbourhood, the defence minister said.

The office bearers of the PFI and those from Rehab India Foundation have been asked to depose before the Investigating Officer of the case here on Wednesday, they said. The summonses issued under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) come in the backdrop of ED finding that the recent violent protests in Uttar Pradesh and other parts of the country against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act had an alleged “financial link” with PFI but the outfit termed the claims as “baseless”.

The ED had filed the case under the PMLA against the PFI in 2018.

The ED is also probing the remittances and withdrawal of funds from nine bank accounts of Rehab India, they added.

An ED officials on Monday claimed its probe in the PFI case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) revealed that at least Rs 120 crore were deposited in bank accounts in western Uttar Pradesh after the CAA was passed by Parliament late last year.

The PFI was formed in 2006 in Kerala as a successor to the National Democratic Front (NDF) and was suspected to have shifted its headquarters to Shaheen Bagh in the national capital over a decade back.

142,29-1-20,Coronavirus can spread faster than SARS: Scientists,"nNovel coronavirus ( 2019-nCoV) appears to cause similar symptoms to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and seems to be capable of spreading from person to person and between cities, according to the two papers published recently in the journal The Lancet. The studies offer some of the first rigorous analyses of patients who contracted nCoV that has broken out in China and spread to other countries.

SARS, was a viral respiratory disease caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Between November 2002 and July 2003, the eight month outbreak in southern China infected a total of 8,098 people, resulting in 774 deaths in 17 countries. In comparison, the nCoV outbreak had infected 4,515 people, with 106 reported deaths. It means the virus has killed just over 2% of those that have been infected.

The scientists said that nCov can spread faster than the SARS-CoV.

“Taken together, evidence so far indicates human transmission for 2019-nCoV. We are concerned that 2019-nCoV could have acquired the ability for efficient human transmission.

“Airborne precautions, such as a fit-tested N95 respirator, and other personal protective equipment are strongly recommended. To prevent further spread of the disease in health-care settings that are caring for patients infected with 2019-nCoV, onset of fever and respiratory symptoms should be closely monitored among health-care workers,” said a battery of researchers.

The team included Prof C Huang, Prof L Zhang, T Yu, J Xia, Y Wei, Prof W Wu, Prof X Xie from Jin Yin-tan Hospital, Wuhan, China, Y Wang, G Fan, X Gu, H Li, Prof B Cao from Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Center of Respiratory Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseases among others.

In the first new study, preliminary data from China’s Wuhan, the epicenter of the disease indicate some similar symptoms between the first 41 cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus and SARS. The second study, published at the same time, reports person-to-person transmission and inter-city spread of the new coronavirus in six members of the same family.

These early but important findings involve a small number of patients, and the authors stress the need to maximise the chances of containing 2019-nCoV infection through careful surveillance, active contact tracing, and vigorous searches for the animal hosts and transmission routes to humans.

The researchers analyzed that two-thirds of the infected persons had been to a large seafood market that also sold wild animals for meat and is thought to be where the virus jumped from an animal source to people. The median age of the patients was 49.

The researchers also reported that some of the fatal cases caused by the virus have been among people with underlying diseases like diabetes, liver disease, and hypertension, but the majority of the first 41 patients infected with the disease in Wuhan were healthy.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/coronavirus-can-spread-faster-than-sars--scientists.html
143,29-1-20,Expeditious decision on mercy plea can't be ground to assail rejection: Centre to SC,"""Expeditious decision"" by the President on mercy petition cannot be a ground to challenge its rejection by one of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case, the Centre told the Supreme Court on Tuesday.

Delay in deciding the mercy petition by the President would have a ""de-humanising effect"" on the convict, the Centre said.

Opposing the plea of the convict, Mukesh Kumar Singh, against the rejection on his mercy petition, it also said that allegations of ill-treatment in jail cannot be a ground for mercy to a person who has committed such a heinous crime.

While the counsel appearing for Mukesh argued that ""hate the sin, not the sinner"", Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told a bench headed by Justice R Banumathi that the convict cannot be allowed to have this kind of ""luxury litigation"" in the case.

The bench, also comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan and AS Bopanna, asked senior advocate Anjana Prakash, appearing for Mukesh, as to how they can say there was ""non-application of mind"" by the President in rejecting the mercy plea on January 17.

The bench, after hearing arguments from both the sides, reserved its order for Wednesday.

The four death row convicts — Mukesh, Pawan Gupta, Vinay Kumar Sharma and Akshay Kumar — are scheduled to be hanged at 6 AM on February 1.

During the arguments, Prakash told the court that entire materials and records of the case were not placed before the President when he was considering the mercy plea.

Mehta countered the submissions and said, ""Entire material which was required to be considered by the President was sent to the President by the Ministry of Home Affairs"".

""Delay can be an argument to challenge it but expeditious decision on mercy plea can never be an argument to challenge the dismissal of mercy petition,"" Mehta said, ""A person on death row faces death every day. If there is delay, it would have a de-humanising effect. There cannot and should not be any delay in deciding mercy plea"".

Mehta said that as per latest medical report of Mukesh, which was also sent to the President, he is ""fit and fine"".

Referring to an earlier verdict of the apex court, he argued it was said in the judgement that it would not be appropriate for the top court to lay down guidelines as to how the President should use his power under Article 72 of the Constitution.

Article 72 of the Constitution deals with power of the President to grant pardons and to suspend, remit or commute sentences in certain cases.

Mehta placed before the bench two original files, one containing correspondence for consideration of mercy petition filed by Mukesh and another file containing notings.

""Both the files are received and kept for perusal of the court,"" the bench said and declined the request of petitioner's counsel seeking permission to peruse the files.

Prakash told the bench that records relating to certain supervening circumstances, including solitary confinement, were not placed before the President.

Referring to an earlier apex court verdict, she argued that a death row convict can be kept in solitary confinement only after dismissal of his or her mercy plea but in this case, Mukesh was kept in solitary confinement time and again.

Prakash argued that non-application of mind includes non-appreciation of materials and records relating to solitary confinement and custodial torture, including sexual abuse of Mukesh in jail, were never sent to the President.

She said that keeping a convict in solitary confinement is one of the circumstances to commute death penalty.

Mehta, however, argued that keeping a convict in solitary confinement and keeping him or her in a separate cell in jail were different things.

""He (Mukesh) was never kept in solitary confinement. He was kept in a separate cell for some time and this can be done with other prisoners also,"" he said.

Prakash argued that process of deciding the mercy plea cannot be expedited at the ""cost of justice"" as it is a matter of life and death of a person.

When she pointed out to the role of Mukesh in the case, the bench said, ""All these aspects have been dealt with by the trial court, high court and this court"".

Prakash told the bench that jail authorities had forwarded documents like role of Mukesh, his medical report, trial court judgement and details of punishment awarded to him along with the mercy petition.

""Are you contending that he (President) has to look into every documents while dealing with mercy petition?,"" the bench asked.

To this, Prakash said entire records of the case should have been sent to the President for his perusal.

""You punish the sin, but deal with sinner in a different way,"" she said, adding, ""He (Mukesh) was sexually abused in jail. His brother and co-accused (Ram Singh) was murdered in jail.

147,29-1-20,Brought CAA to correct historical injustice: PM,"Defending the Citizenship Amendment Act(CAA), Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the Government has brought the legislation to correct “historical injustice” and to fulfill a promise to religious minorities living in neighbouring countries. His observations came in the backdrop of continuing criticism of the CAA.

Making his Government’s stand clear on the CAA, Modi, while addressing the annual Prime Minister’s National Cadet Corps(NCC) rally here, said the law was brought to “correct a historical injustice and fulfill a promise to minorities in the neighbouring countries.”

He also spoke of the injustices made during partition, when a “line was drawn across a piece of paper”. At the time, Modi said “those who governed an independent India accepted partition.”

“Nehru-Liyaquat pact spoke about protecting minorities, Gandhiji wished the same. The government has introduced CAA to fulfill a promise India made,” he added.

The pact signed in 1950 between then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and his Pakistan counterpart Liaquat Ali Khan was aimed at allowing refugees to return to dispose of their property, return abducted women and looted property and unrecognise forced conversions.

“It is India’s responsibility to give refuge to those people who have been oppressed due to their faith. These people have faced historical injustice... And to stop this and fulfil our old promise, we have brought the CAA,” Modi said.

Attacking political opponents for opposing the CAA for “votebank politics,” he said, without naming anyone, such people are “negating atrocities.” He said “some are acting to be the voice of Dalits, they are the same people who ignore atrocities against Dalits in Pakistan, they forget that most of persecuted who have left Pakistan and come to India are Dalits,” he said.

“Our Government brought in CAA to give citizenship to such people but some political parties are in competition to do vote bank politics. For whose interest are they working? Why can’t they see atrocities faced by these people in Pakistan. “There are many Dalits (among those who have been oppressed). These people have been oppressed... ,” Modi said.

Modi said a sanitation job advertisement by Pakistani Army stated it was only open to non-Muslims, implying it was for Dalits. He also referred to the Enemy Property Act and said those opposing this legislation are also against the CAA.

After partition, those who left India for Pakistan could still lay claim to their properties. The Enemy Property Act 2016 allows transfer of enemy property from the enemy to other persons.

The Opposition, he also said, is spreading propaganda that the Government’s decisions have “affected my reputation in the entire world”. “These rumor-mongers must understand that I don’t work for my reputation, but for India’s repute,” he said.

Modi also said the problem in Jammu and Kashmir persisted since Independence and some families and political parties kept issues in the region “alive”, as a result of which terrorism thrived there. He said the present Government has been trying to solve decades old problems plaguing the country.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/brought-caa-to-correct-historical-injustice--pm.html

He also said currently, not only Jammu & Kashmir, but other parts of the country are also peaceful and the Government has managed to address the aspirations of the northeast region which were neglected for decades.

Kumar said in Patna that leaders of his party “in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha” will make a request to the Government to this effect “even though it is not mandatory to fill up these columns”.

The Chief Minister was talking to reporters at his official residence in Patna after presiding over a meeting of JD(U) parliamentarians, legislators and office-bearers of the party’s Bihar unit, even though disgruntled top leaders like national vice president Prashant Kishor and national general secretary Pavan Varma remained conspicuous by their absence.

Kumar also acknowledged that the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act had led to “unrest” across the country but hoped the misgivings would be addressed by the Supreme Court, which is hearing petitions challenging the contentious legislation.

He, however, voiced disapproval of the inflammatory comments made by Sharjeel Imam, who was arrested in Jehanabad in connection with a sedition case in Delhi, and pointed out “whoever transgresses law, will face action accordingly.

Hundreds of students who gathered at Nazrul Manch the venue of the programme carried “No NRC-No CAA banners” and shouted “go back” slogan even as they blockaded the Governor’s vehicle and then prevented him from rising on the stage forcing him to remain confined inside the green room, sources said.

The programme was stalled for more than an hour and was resumed only after Dhankhar who is also the Chancellor of the University left in a huff in the wake of a verbal assurance by the Vice Chancellor to the students that the “Chancellor will not attend the programme” and that the “degrees will be given away by me.”

Similar incidents took place at JU last year when the agitating students blockaded the Governor and prevented him from attending the convocation. There also Dhankhar was not allowed to give away the awards.

Later in the day Bengal Education Minister and senior Trinamool Congress leader Partho Chatterjee said “such agitations are not desired in the university but the students everywhere do stage protests … in such cases the person against whom the protest is being staged has to realise the reasons behind the agitation… we in the education department do not want that such high posts of the Chancellor gets sullied by controversy but if the person on the post does not understand that and smears his own image than what can we do?”

154,29-1-20,"In U-turn, MNS says only support deportation of illegal Muslim immigrants from Pak, Bangladesh","In a U-turn, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) on Tuesday clarified that contrary to the reports in sections of the media, it had not extended its support to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Citizens Register (NRC), but it has said that it would support the efforts by the Centre to deport all illegal Muslim immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Talking to media persons after party chief Raj Thackeray held a meeting with the party’s office bearers at his ‘Krishna Kunj’ residence near Shivaji Park in north-central Mumbai, senior MNS leader Bala Nandgaonkar said: “The morcha that we are taking out to the Azad Maidan on February 9 is not in support of CAA and NRC but for demanding the immediate deportation of illegal Muslim immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh to their respective countries”.

At his party office bearers’ meeting, Raj made it clear that his party would root for immediate deportation of all illegal Muslim immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh to their respective countries and said that the morcha had nothing to do with either CAA or NRC.

It may be recalled that at the party workers’ rally that he addressed after the party’s convention at NESCO grounds at Goregaon in north Mumbai, Raj had said that more than the CAA and NRC which would happen in due course, the Centre’s top priority should be to “deport"" all illegal Muslim immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh to their respective countries and his party would extend its full support to the Modi government in this task.

As such, the MNS chief had not directly extended his party’s support to the Centre on CAA and NRC. Extending his indirect support to CAA and NRC, Raj had said: “There can be a debate on CAA and NRC. ... But, suddenly there are so many morchas against CAA and NRC.

Thousands of Muslims have come on the streets. Some people told me that the Muslims are venting out their pent up anger against the revocation of Article 370 in Kashmir and the Supreme Court verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi. I would like to know as to how many Indian Muslims participated in these morchas and how many are from outside. If so many Muslims from outside are participating in these morchas, why should we support these morchas?”

Alluding to anti-CAA and NRC morchas being witnessed across the country, Raj had said that one had to respond to morchas with counter morchas. He had gone to announce that his party would take out a massive morcha to the Azad Maidan in south Mumbai on February 9 to demand immediate deportation of illegal Muslim immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh to their respective countries.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/in-u-turn--mns-says-only-support-deportation-of-illegal-muslim-immigrants-from-pak--bangladesh.html
155,29-1-20,NIA faces hurdles in taking over case from Pune police,"A three-member visiting team of National Investigation Agency (NIA), to which the Union Home Ministry has handed over the 2018 Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case, could not take over the investigations in the sensitive case from the Pune police for the second consecutive day on Tuesday, in the absence of a formal order from the office of State Directorate General Police (DGP).

The NIA team, which arrived in Pune on Monday morning and handed over a letter to the police intimating them that it would take over the Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case from the local police, faced hurdles in taking over the case on two fronts.

First, the local police told the visiting team that they had not received any formal orders from the office of State DGP about handing over the case to the Central agency. Secondly, Special Judge SR Navandar, who as the judge designated to hear the cases under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) is currently hearing the politically sensistive 2018 case, had said in the open court on Monday that his court had not received any official communication from either the State Government or the Centre about the transfer of the case.

The Pune police have, meanwhile, taken up the matter with the State DGP’s office for formal orders to hand over the case to the NIA. “Till this evening, we have not received any order from the State DGP’s office to hand over the case to the NIA. Once we received the order, we will complete the necessary formalities and hand over all the investigation papers to the NIA,” a senior Pune police official said.

On his part, State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said: “As the State Home Minister, I have not received any papers from the Centre about the transfer of the case to the NIA. Once we receive the papers, we will study the papers, seek legal opinion and decide on what to do next”.

Asked if the Maharashtra government was opposed to handing over the the Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case to the NIA, Deshmukh said: “Whatever we have learnt about the issue is through the media. Till we receive a official communication from the Centre about handing over the case to the NIA, I do not want to comment on this. We will take necessary steps once we receive a formal letter from the Centre”.

Former Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis downplayed the delay on the part of the Pune police in handing over the Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case. “This is a technical procedure. Once it takes over the case, the NIA has take possession of the papers from the Pune police. The Pune police must be in the process of completing the technical formalities before handing over the papers to the NIA. I am sure that the Maharashtra DGP will personally look into the matters and soirt our issues. I do not think that there would be any dispute between the Maharashtra police and NIA on this,” Fadnavis said.

In a surprise move, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had on Friday last (January 24) handed over the investigations in the Bhima Koregaon-Yelgaar Parishad case to the NIA.

The MHA’s move to hand over the case to the NIA came a day after the MVA government reviewed the charge sheets filed by the Pune police in the case in the light of NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s charge that the previous BJP government had vengefully implicated several activists as accused in the case.

After the review meeting, the Maharashtra government had indicated that it would hand over the case to a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to ascertain whether the Pune – acting allegedly at the behest of the then ruling BJP – had acted against several activists based on “trumped up” charges.

Reacting to the Centre’s decision, a miffed Pawar had charged that the ruling BJP – with an acute *fear of being exposed in the Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad

case – had hurriedly handed over the investigations to the NIA. He demanded that an independent panel to set up to hold comprehensive probe into the manner in which the Pune police had investigated the case. “Only an independent probe will bring out truth in the case,” he had said.

Congress’ former president Rahul Gandhi had also slammed the Centre’s move, by alleging that the move to hand over the case to a central agency was part of the “MOSH ( Modi-Shah) agenda of hate”. “Anyone who opposes the MOSH agenda of hate is an “Urban Naxal”. Bhima-Koregaon is a symbol of resistance that the Government’s NIA stooges can never erase,” Gandhi had tweeted.

The face-off between the Centre and the MVA government in Maharashtra relates to the cases registered against 23 activists in connection with the violence that erupted on January 1, 2018 at a gathering of thousands of Dalits At Bhima-Koregaon in Pune district who were celebrating 200th anniversary of January 1, 1818 victory of British troops over Peshwa Bajirao at Bhima Koregaon in Pune district, and the provocative speeches delivered by the activists at an Elgaar Parishad held in Pune on December 31, 2017, a day before the celebrations at Bhima Koregaon. Nine of the accused hare been booked for their alleged links with the CPI-Maoist links.

It may be recalled that the police had arrested ten CPI (Maoist) activists in two batches in connection with the Elgaar Parishad-cum- Bhima-Koregaon riots case. They were among the 15 activists against whom the police had registered cases. The five are still absconding.

The activists against whom charge-sheets have been filed for serious offences are: Sudhir P. Dhawale, Rona J. Wilson, Surendra P. Gadling, Shoma Sen, Mahesh S. Raut, Varavara Rao, Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Pereira, Sudha Bharadwaj and Gautam Navlakha. They have been booked for their association with the Elgaar Parishad held in Pune a day ahead of the January 1, 2018 Bhima-Koregaon riots and their alleged links with the Maoists.

All of them have been booked for serious offences under unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), 117 ( abetting commission of offence), 120-b ( conspiracy) read with 34 (common intention), 121, 121 (A) (Waging or attempting to wage a war, or abetting waging of war, against the Government of India) 124A (sedition), 153 –A (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot..) and 505-1b (statements conducing public mischief) of Indian Penal Code (IPC).

156,29-1-20,DMK launches 2021 election campaign,"Taking a cue from J Jayalalithaa, the late Chief Minister and AIADMK supremo, the DMK leadership has asked the party cadre to ‘work from now onwards’ to make a clean sweep in the 2021 Assembly election.

Encouraged and enthused by the party’s performance in the Lok Sabha election held in April 2019, when the DMK— led front bagged 38 out of the 39 seats which were in stake from Tamil Nadu, Stalin asked in a personal letter to the party cadre to treat 2020 too as an election year though the Assembly polls are one year away.

“We can reap the benefits only if we start working from now onwards. I want all the party cadre to be out in the field for the whole of 2020 so that the party could wrest the power it lost in 2011 when elections are held in 2021,” Stalin said in n letter he wrote to the party cadre.

Stalin told the cadre that had the elections to the local bodies was held in a fair manner, the DMK would have romped home by winning 90 per cent of the local bodies. But we have done extremely well by winning 60 per cent of the local bodies despite the ruling party (read AIADMK) misusing official machinery and pumping in money,” he said in the letter.

Old timers in Tamil Nadu see a similarity between the exhortation by Stalin and the battle cry by Jayalalithaa immediately after the 2011 Assembly election.

After mauling and battering the DMK in the 2011 Assembly election, Jayalalithaa had asked the AIADMK cadre to go for the giant kill in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. “We should win all the 40 seats at stake from Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.

The AIADMK should be in a position to call the shots and decide who would be the Prime Minister of India,” Amma had exhorted the cadre.

“The AIADMK cadre did not disappoint her and the party bagged 37 out of 39 seats in Tamil Nadu and the lone seat in Puducherry. While the DMK was left without a single seat, the NDA scraped through in two constituencies in Tamil Nadu,” said Govindarajan Sathyamurty, political commentator based in Coimbatore.

The DMK is leaving no stones unturned in Tamil Nadu where it has been out of office since 2011.

The party upped the ante on Monday by staging demonstrations all over the Cauvery Delta region (the five districts of Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Pudukottai and Tiruchirappalli) where the Oil and Natural Commission (ONGC) is going ahead with its projects to extract hydrocarbons, methane and natural gas from the fertile paddy fields.

The DMK and other constituents in its front allege that setting up of the the hydrocarbon and methane extraction plants would convert the Delta region into a desert. They want the Centre to cancel the licenses and lease and licenses given to the public sector as well as private agencies to extract the hydrocarbon and methane gas from the region.

Interestingly, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to set up the plants were signed in 20006 when M Karunanidhi, the then DMK president was the chief minister of Tamil Nadu and Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister.

“Situation was different at that time and that is why we changed out stance now,” said a DMK leader in Cauvery Delta.

Banerjee, a staunch critic of the BJP, said protesting against the decisions of the Centre does not make Opposition parties anti-national and iterated that she will not implement CAA, NRC or NPR in the state.

""It is good if he (Prime Minister) is really interested in opening a dialogue on the CAA. They (BJP) must call all the political parties. They did not call an all-party meeting before taking a decision on

Kashmir and CAA. Before taking the decision, they should have consulted all the parties.

""If the Centre is ready for talks, then it should first repeal CAA. If they repeal it only then can we talk with an open mind. The Prime Minister needs to restore confidence of the countrymen. He needs to assure us that CAA will be repealed, and both NPR and NRC will be dropped,"" she said while talking to reporters at a protest programme against CAA through paintings.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union Government is yet to convene all party meeting on CAA and PM Modi had clearly said last month that his Government has not discussed any proposals regarding pan India NRC, she said.

The TMC supremo also slammed the saffron party for making references to Pakistan, which she said, is a ploy to divert public attention from issues like economic slowdown and growing unemployment.

""Why do they glorify Pakistan every time? I am proud of my country. Is this a BJP ploy to glorify Pakistan? I don’t know whether BJP has become brand ambassadors of Pakistan as they always talk of it and less of Hindustan,"" Banerjee said hitting out at the BJP.

The West Bengal Assembly on Monday passed a resolution demanding immediate repeal of the CAA and dropping plans for a pan-India NRC and NPR, with Banerjee calling the new citizenship law ""against the Constitution and humanity"".

Reacting to Banerjee’s statement, West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh wondered what she and TMC were doing when the bill was placed in Parliament for discussion.

""What was she (Banerjee) and her party doing when the bill was placed in Parliament for discussion? Why did they not place their views then?"" Ghosh said.

West Bengal became the fourth State after Left-ruled Kerala, and Punjab and Rajasthan, where the Congress is in power, to have passed a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment)

Act.

Speaking to reporters at Hubballi, Siddaramaiah claimed there was no internal democracy in the BJP and the Chief Minister has no freedom to exercise his powers.

“The cabinet expansion is Chief Minister’s prerogative.

The BJP (high command) has not given permission to Yediyurappa (to expand ministry), they have not even given him appointment for meeting,” Siddaramaiah, who is leader of the opposition in the State Assembly, said.

“Yediyurappa had promised them (defectors) money and power, now he has to fulfill it,” he said, expressing pity about Yediyurappa, who is “struggling in hardship.”

His statement comes even as Yediyurappa recently indicated that he will expand his cabinet by this month end.

However, lack of clarity on the high commands approval on the matter, amid reports that the Chief Minister may travel to New Delhi to meet BJP national president J P Nadda on Thursday to discuss the matter, has added to speculation.

Further alleging that the state government was facing fund crunch, Siddaramaiah wanted to know if Yediyurappa knew magic to set things right in budget.

For every issue, Yediyurappa says watch out for the budget; I don’t know what he will do, whether he will do any magic or does he have any magic stick?”

Siddaramaiah pointed out that it is during the December-March period that 75 per cent of developmental works get implemented and if the government does not give the money now, how will the work take place.

“If they are unable to give the money now, it is clear that they don’t have the money.

They have not got money from the centre, they have not got money under NREGS, grants have not come, our share of tax money hasn’t come-centre has not given money,” he claimed. Yediyurappa, who also hold the Finance portfolio, is scheduled to present the state budget on March 5.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sidda-slams-bjp-for-delay-in-k---taka-ministry-expansion.html
164,29-1-20,Gadkari asks vehicle owners to get third party insurance,"Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday called for including the road projects in the country into the ambit of insurance.

Addressing a Workshop on Motor Vehicle Insurance and Road Safety in the national Capital, Gadkari stated that the Supreme Court has made it mandatory for all new two wheelers to have a five-year third party insurance. Similarly, for cars and commercial vehicles, it is mandatory to have a three-year third party insurance. In case of default, there is a provision of fine up to Rs 2,000. Under the third party insurance, the responsibility of compensating an accident victim shifts from the vehicle owner to insurance company.

Underlining the importance of insurance, the Minister said, with a little procedural change in insurance practices, the death rate due to road accidents can be brought down significantly.

He said, his Ministry is considering forming a Motor Vehicle Accident Fund, which will fund the amount for compensation for hit and run cases. The Fund will also be used for medical treatment of accident victims. He said, the compensation amount in hit and run cases has been increased to

Rs 2 lakh, while for the injured people in such cases, it is now Rs 50 thousand.

The Minister said, provision has been made in the Motor Vehicles Act to protect those helping the accident victims. The Government is also contemplating making provision for protection of doctors, nurses and other medical staff from hassles in such cases, he said.

He said, several countries in the world are following the practice of insuring infrastructure projects.

168,29-1-20,FinMin takes measures to protect prudent commercial decision of bankers,"With a view to protect prudent commercial decision of bankers, the government has taken a slew of decisions, including doing away with personal responsibilities of MD and CEO of PSBs for compliance in dealing with large value frauds committed by bank officials.

Powers have been delegated by Department of Financial Services (DFS) to the Boards of public sector lenders to put in place a suitable mechanism for ensuring compliance of the various timelines laid down in RBI and CVC circulars, an official statement said. “Similarly, the instructions of DFS of 2015 regarding compulsory examination of fraud for all NPA accounts exceeding Rs 50 crores have been aligned with the CVC circular of January 15, 2020 whereby all such cases of suspicious fraud are to be initially referred to the Advisory Board for Banking and Financial Frauds (ABBFF) headed by former vigilance Commissioner T M Bhasin,” it added. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman at several occasions assured bankers that adequate measures would be taken to protect honest commercial decisions taken by them and distinction would be made between genuine commercial failures and culpability. There are widespread apprehension that bankers could be hauled up for their bona fide commercial decision go wrong.

To assuage concerns, the finance minister had assured the bankers that a distinction would be made between genuine commercial failures and culpability last month in a meeting with heads of the public sector banks (PSBs), which was also attended by the CBI Director. She had also told bankers that the CBI will have discussions, and workshops with the bank officials from the level of vigilance officers, senior managers to general managers to explain and eliminate apprehension from their minds.

Considering the complexities involved in the commercial decisions of managers in public sector firms, the Central Vigilance Commission set up the Advisory Board for Banking and Financial Frauds (ABBFF) for a mandatory first level examination on suspected frauds in excess of Rs 50 crore, involving public servants equivalent in rank to GMs and above, before enquiry or investigations begin. In order to boost staff morale and reduce scope for harassment, Sitharaman had also directed public sector bank heads to clear long pending vigilance cases against their officials for alleged malpractices.

The banks should form a panel headed by General Manager and it should either take decision to pursue the case with timeline or close the file of long pending vigilance cases, she had instructed.

In line with the decision taken in the meeting, the Finance ministry has separately directed banks on January 27 to set up a committee of senior officers to monitor progress of pending disciplinary and internal vigilance cases as procedural delay, on one hand, adversely affects morale of the employees and on the other, breeds inefficiencies in the system.

Therefore, it said, every bank must setup a Committee of Senior Officers to review pending disciplinary and internal vigilance cases and frame timelines to reduce delays in deciding such cases. As part of this endeavour of government, Section 17A was incorporated in Prevention of Corruption Act, requiring prior permission before initiating investigation against a public servant, it said. These measures taken will improve sentiment among bankers and help them take lending decisions to drive economy facing slowdown.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/finmin-takes-measures-to-protect-prudent-commercial-decision-of-bankers.html

“Ever since inception, public sector undertakings have been the driver of growth and value creation. Perhaps they are the only enterprises in India that fulfilled all the objectives laid out according to the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956,” a BMS statement said.

The union also said that it is unfortunate that they (PSUs) are being sold in the name of resource mobilization to fund social spending.

The union is of the view that selling PSU to private players is not going to help the government in mobilizing resources and funding social spending because privatization does not free the Government from its responsibilities.

There are certain segment in which both public as well private sector enterprises are not being able to perform and there are cases in which private players failed to generate own resources, they simply took the money in form of loans from banks (many in the public sector) and then they failed to repay the loan, deepening non-performing asset crisis, it added.

The union also pointed out that while calculating profit and loss of Air India one need to think of the fact that it has been operating many of the low-profit or loss-making routes only to serve the passenger and connecting people with one another promoting national unity - in which any private player will not be operating.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/bms-opposes-air-india-sale--asks-govt-to-revisit-decision.html

179,29-1-20,‘Food-tech industry to grow at 25 per cent by 2022-end’,"Rising internet penetration, increasing ordering frequency and favourable consumer disposition are some of the factors driving growth in the Indian food-tech industry that is poised to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 25-30 per cent to USD 8 billion by the end of 2022, a report by Google and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) said on Tuesday.

“Riding on the wave of higher consumption in a growing market and maturing dynamics on the supply side, we expect the industry to grow from USD 4 billion to USD 8 billion in the next three years, a massive 25 per cent growth rate,” the report titled ‘Demystifying the Online Food Consumer’ said.

It added that funding in the food-tech space has grown by 35 times in the past five years. Macro trends such as rising internet penetration, increasing ordering frequency, favourable consumer disposition, expanding reach in smaller tiers and expanding network of restaurants on food-tech platforms pan-India continue to drive momentum in the industry, the report said. As a consequence, reach of food-tech aggregators has grown six times from 2017 to 2019. At the same time, consumers are spending more than double the time to explore and order online — from 32 minutes per month in 2017 to 72 minutes per month in 2019. The study cited peer or network advocacy (52 per cent) plays a critical role in drawing people to try online food ordering for the first time. This was followed by advertisements (19 per cent) that emerged to be a strong driver in metros and among the higher income groups across the country.

“The food tech industry is nascent but one of the fastest growing in the country... Food tech has now made its presence in greater than 500 cities in India and with consumer confidence growing, there are new opportunities for the players to ‘win with the consumer’ in an evolving market,” Google Director (Travel, BFSI, Classifieds, Gaming, Telco and Payments) Roma Datta Chobey said. Overall, online spending in India is expected to grow at 25 per cent over the next five years to cross USD 130 billion. The report also flagged the impediments that hinder adoption by consumers. A fifth of the respondents stated a lack of trust in the app as the main barrier to usage — they believe that the role and control of the aggregators in the actual food preparation is low. Delivery charges (18 per cent), food quality concerns (13 per cent) and lack of customisation (10 per cent) were other reasons customers cited for not having experimented with online food ordering so far.

Interestingly, while delivery charge was the top reason for not ordering food online in metro cities; in tier-I cities, lack of trust in apps (29 per cent) emerged as the primary roadblock. “Food tech start-ups have revolutionised the way Indians eat. There is now a greater demand for healthy, home-cooked meals leading to emergence of new business models like cloud kitchen and meal subscriptions. Ordering food online is now a habit,” BCG Senior Partner and Managing Director Abheek Singhi said. There is large headroom to increase reach, engagement and usage frequency for food-tech apps, he added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/---food-tech-industry-to-grow-at-25-per-cent-by-2022-end---.html
180,29-1-20,"Budget should revamp SEZ policy to boost food exports, says TPCI","To boost exports and revitalise the agriculture sector, a key trade promotion organisation has recommended to the government to revamp SEZ (special economic zone) policy for food exports.

Accordingly, the Trade Promotion Council of India recommended this step to the government for the upcoming Budget 2020-21. TPCI Chairman Mohit Singla said: “India has huge potential in the food exports and global investors are looking at SEZ as one destination for investing”.

“Due to lack of incentives for value added F&B manufacturing and exports is inhibiting them to come to India,” he added.

According to TPCI, foreign investors should be allowed to import raw materials at zero duty and avail duty rebate proportionate to value addition.

Besides, the council recommended that foreign investors should be incentivised by lower duty on value addition “they achieve, especially for the food sector where duty is already high”.

“It will lead to automatic clusterisation as the incentive will act as a pull factor. This is one incentives which, if announced, will also be WTO compliant. It is to be noted that, exports from SEZs are growing at a faster rate than overall exports from the country,” the TPCI recommendations said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/budget-should-revamp-sez-policy-to-boost-food-exports--says-tpci.html
181,29-1-20,Xi says China fighting ‘demon’ virus as infection spreads abroad,"President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that China was in a struggle against a “demon” epidemic, as the death toll from the new SARS-like virus soared to 106 and the first cases of human-to-human contagion were detected abroad.

Xi made his remarks during talks with head of the World Health Organisation in Beijing as a host of nations prepared to airlift their citizens from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak.

“Chinese people are currently engaged in a serious struggle against an epidemic of a new type of coronavirus infection,” Xi told WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

“The epidemic is a demon, and we cannot let this demon hide,” the Chinese leader said, pledging that the government would be transparent and release information on the virus in a “timely” manner.

His comments came after anger simmered on Chinese social media over the handling of the health emergency by local officials in central Hubei province, where the disease first emerged in December.

Some experts have praised Beijing for being more reactive and open about this virus compared to its handling of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2002-2003.

But others say local cadres had earlier been more focused on projecting stability than responding to the outbreak when it began to spread earlier this month.

Since then, the number of cases has soared — doubling to more than 4,500 in the past 24 hours.

WHO chief Tedros praised China’s response to the crisis during a meeting with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, according to state news agency Xinhua.

The WHO last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global emergency, which could have prompted a more aggressive international response such as travel restrictions.

But global concern has been growing, with Japan and Germany on Tuesday reporting the first human-to-human infections outside China.

Until now, all cases in more than a dozen countries involved people who had been in or around Wuhan.

In Japan, a man in his sixties contracted the virus apparently after driving two groups of tourists from the city earlier in January, the health ministry said. He was hospitalised with flu-like symptoms on Saturday.

On the other side of the world, a 33-year-old German man caught the disease off a Chinese colleague from Shanghai who visited Germany last week, according to health officials. The development came after countries including Sri Lanka, Malaysia and the Philippines announced tighter visa restrictions for people coming from China.

Experts believe the virus came from a wild animal market in Wuhan and then jumped to humans, with Chinese health officials saying on Tuesday that people infect each other through sneezing or coughing, and possibly through contact.

Authorities initially sealed off Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province late last week, trapping more than 50 million people.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/xi-says-china-fighting----demon----virus-as-infection-spreads-abroad.html
182,29-1-20,Japan sends plane to Wuhan to evacuate citizens,"Japan sent a first plane to the Chinese city of Wuhan on Tuesday night to evacuate citizens from the epicentre of a deadly virus outbreak, a foreign ministry official said.

The plane left around 8:00 pm (1100 GMT), the official confirmed and was expected to return to Tokyo on Wednesday morning carrying several hundred Japanese nationals.

Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi earlier announced the plans, saying efforts were being made to arrange additional evacuation flights.

“We will also bring with it aid supplies such as masks and protective suits for Chinese people as well as for Japanese nationals,” he said.

Around 200 people are expected to be on board the first flight, of around 650 Japanese nationals in the area who have expressed an interest in being repatriated.

Health officials will be aboard the plane to monitor passengers during the return flight but there are no plans to quarantine those arriving from Wuhan.

“We will send around four people per plane — a medical doctor, a quarantine officer, a nurse and so on. We will carry out a quarantine on board on their way back,” a health ministry official told AFP.

She said passengers will be required to fill out medical questionnaires and submit contact numbers.

A second official from the ministry added that passengers with a high fever could be prevented from boarding, and that anyone developing symptoms during the flight would be sent to hospital immediately on arrival in Japan.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/japan-sends-plane-to-wuhan-to-evacuate-citizens.html

186,29-1-20,"Trump ignores critics, to unveil Israel-Palestinian peace plan","President Donald Trump on Tuesday will ignore accusations — led by the Palestinians themselves — of pro-Israeli bias and unveil what he says is a peace plan capable of solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Long held secret, the plan will finally be aired jointly by Trump and visiting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House.

Given that it has been rejected by the Palestinians, the latest of many US proposals to address the bitter, multi-generational Mideast conflict might seem to have little future.

But Trump insists he is optimistic and whatever happens, both he and Netanyahu could reap political benefits as they battle respective domestic scandals. “It might have a chance,” Trump said of the plan at an initial Oval Office meeting with Netanyahu on Monday.

Trump, whose impeachment trial in the Senate is entering a critical phase, said his plan was getting widespread support from “many of the Arab nations” and claimed that even Palestinians would come round to the idea.

“It’s very good for them, in fact it’s overly good for them,” Trump told reporters. “We think we will have ultimately the support of the Palestinians.”

Netanyahu, praising Trump as “the greatest friend that Israel’s had in the White House,” described the peace plan as “the deal of the century.”

Netanyahu faces corruption charges, as well as a tense election in just over a month where his right-wing Likud is neck-and-neck with Benny Gantz’s centrist Blue and White party.

On Monday, Trump also met separately with Gantz, but the limelight fell almost entirely on the incumbent prime minister — as will any political dividends from a peace plan favoring Israel.

No Palestinians have been invited to the White House event.

Thousands demonstrated in Gaza, burning pictures of Trump and the American flag, while further rallies were planned for the coming days.

Details of the initiative remained under wraps, but the Palestinians fear it will heavily favour Israel, whose Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was to attend the White House event.

Jewish settlers, for their part, also raised concern, fearing the initiative would support the formation of a Palestinian state.

In a rare event, rival Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah were set to meet in the West Bank city of Ramallah to discuss a response to Trump.

“We invited the Hamas movement to attend the emergency meeting of the leadership and they will take part,” said senior Fatah official Azzam al-Ahmed. The Islamist rulers of Gaza have been at odds with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas’s Fatah movement for years, with Hamas rarely taking part in meetings of the West Bank-based Palestinian leadership.

The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, will officially unveil recommendations to member states on Wednesday, but commissioner Thierry Breton told MEPs that Brussels will choose tight scrutiny over any blanket ban.

“It is not a question of discrimination, it is a question of laying down rules. They will be strict, they will be demanding and of course we will welcome in Europe all operators who are willing to apply them,” he said.

The EU, while never explicitly naming the Chinese giant, is struggling to find a middle way to balance Huawei’s huge dominance in the 5G sector with security concerns pressed by Washington.

The proposal is part of a so-called “toolbox” of recommendations that will guide the EU’s 27 post-Brexit member states as they build crucial 5G networks. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is also expected on Tuesday to risk Washington’s anger with a similar decision to trust strict rules instead of a ban on Huawei.

A ban on Huawei would ultimately be up to an individual member state, but the commission’s middle road recommendation gives cover to European capitals to resist pleas from Washington.

Huawei is one of the world’s leading network technology suppliers, and one of the few — along with European telecom companies Nokia and Ericsson — capable of building 5G networks.

The United States sees the company as a potential threat to cybersecurity and fears it would facilitate cyber espionage by the Chinese government, to which it is said to have close links.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/eu-will-not-ban-huawei--but-impose----strict----5g-rules.html

192,29-1-20,UK approves Huawei role in 5G network,"Britain on Tuesday announced that it will allow Chinese telecom giant Huawei to help build the country’s next generation of super-fast 5G networks with some restrictions, despite intense pressure from the US to block the firm over security concerns.

5G allows greater and faster data processing, and is seen as an integral component of new interconnected technologies such as automated vehicles and smart appliances.

Last month, India said it would allocate airwaves to all telecom service providers for conducting trials of 5G networks, a move welcomed by Huawei. In Brussels, a top European Union official said on Tuesday that the bloc will not ban Huawei or any other company in Europe.

The mobile operators in the UK will be able to use Huawei equipment in their 5G networks but the company will be excluded from “security critical” core areas, according to a statement from the government.

The announcement follows months of public debate in the country over how to respond to concerns raised by the US government about potential national security risks posed by Huawei components.

The Trump administration had been pressing for a total ban on Huawei products, alleging that Beijing could use the equipment for snooping.

The choice has been described as the biggest test of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s post-Brexit strategy to date, the BBC reported.

Johnson was under intense pressure, including from within his Conservative Party, to agree to US demands on Huawei. He discussed the issue with President Donald Trump in a phone call on Friday. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted on Sunday that Britain faced a “momentous” decision on 5G.

Huawei, based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, has consistently denied that it would help the Chinese Government to spy. Ren Zhengfei, the founder of Huawei, has previously worked with China’s People’s Liberation Army and has ties with the ruling Communist Party of China.

The Trump administration has previously warned that US-UK intelligence sharing could be put at risk if London allowed Huawei to participate in the 5G networks.

A Trump administration official said on Tuesday that the US “is disappointed” with the UK’s decision, the report said.

China has previously warned the UK that there could be “substantial” repercussions to other trade and investment plans if Huawei was banned outright from the country’s 5G market.

“Huawei is reassured by the UK government’s confirmation that we can continue working with our customers to keep the 5G rollout on track,” the firm’s UK chief Victor Zhang said in a statement after the government announced its decision.

“It gives the UK access to world-leading technology and ensures a competitive market,” he said. Under the restricted approval, Huawei will be banned from supplying kit to “sensitive parts” of the network, known as the core.

In addition, it will only be allowed to account for 35 per cent of the kit in a network’s periphery, which includes radio masts.

Huawei will be excluded from areas near British military bases and nuclear sites.

Huawei, which is a leader in 5G technology and also one of the world’s biggest sellers of smartphones, has seen its business targeted in a concerted campaign by the US.

But Huawei’s products are often described as superior and cheaper than those sold by European rivals Nokia and Ericsson, CNN reported. It also quoted some experts as saying that Huawei owes part of its success to favourable loans from the Chinese state, an assertion the company disputes.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/uk-approves-huawei-role-in-5g-network-2020-01-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/uk-approves-huawei-role-in-5g-network.html

194,29-1-20,What to expect from Budget 2020?,"With the Union Budget 2020 just around the corner, expectations are aplenty, wish lists are many and all eyes are on what the Finance Minister will present in Parliament on February 1, 2020. While wishes are ranging from LTA for foreign travel and a relief on long-term capital gains, expectations are that the Finance Minister may regulate liquidity by changing income tax slabs and rates.

With higher liquidity, you may consider investing your surplus savings in fixed deposits, equities, mutual funds or monthly investment schemes, as per your risk appetite. However, whatever be the case, the goal of budget 2020 is to revive a faltering economy and hence, you can look forward to some bold fiscal policies being rolled out.Here are 7 things to expect from Budget 2020.

Additional tax benefits for housing schemes

Housing is a crucial sector to pay attention to and in the previous budget the Finance Minister provided an added tax deduction of Rs.1.5 lakh on interest paid on home loans for houses worth less than Rs.45 lakh. The expectation for 2020 is that this ceiling will be raised to Rs.75 lakh. Similarly, in case of more than one property, the limit for housing loan interest deductions may be increased.

Lower GST rates on consumer durables

To boost consumption and drive demand, the Finance Minister may cut GST rates, thereby improving the common man’s purchasing power. This would be ideal if the cuts apply to goods that affect daily living. However, tax reliefs are expected across the board, including the automobile sector, and a single rate may be applied to items attracting a rate between 18% and 28%.

Measures to limit consumer inflation

With the prices of vegetables and onions in particular, leaving the common man teary-eyed, it’s highly likely that measures to curtail consumer inflation, may be taken. An inflation rate of around 7.5% is very high and in the absence of a proportional increase in incomes, consumers are bound to feel the pinch.

A roadmap for manufacturing, construction and infrastructure projects

According to data from the government, manufacturing and construction are set to grow at a snail’s pace during 2019-20, at rates of 2% and 3.2% respectively. To avert losses, some expect the Budget to give a boost to this sector. Similarly, in December 2019, the Government announced infrastructure projects worth Rs.102 crore and eyes are on what this will translate to in terms of the railways, power sector, rural electrification, health and affordable housing.

Reduced interest rates on loans

In 2019 itself, the RBI cut the repo rate 5 times bringing it to a modest 5.15%. However, this reduction hasn’t necessarily trickled down to the level of the consumer and lending rates are still high at private sector banks. Around 1% of the repo rate remains to be transferred and measures to ensure this will boost consumption. It remains to be seen if the Union Budget 2020 will address this.

An increase in the Section 80C deduction limit

When it comes to personal savings, Section 80C deductions play a crucial role and word is out that the Finance Minister will increase the deduction limit from Rs.1.5 lakh to Rs.2.5- or Rs.3 lakh. Section 80C helps individuals save on tax payments and the last limit increase was back in 2014. An increase would incentivise investments and boost public savings.

A relaxation of personal income tax slab rates

Probably the most highly-awaited announcement for the Budget is that of a relief in personal income tax slab rates. The community is abuzz with talk of both an increase of the exemption limit, from Rs.2.5 lakh to Rs.5 lakh, as well as a reduction of rates pertaining to other slabs. For instance, a 10% and not a 20% rate for individuals with taxable income in excess of Rs.5 lakh and less than Rs.10 lakh. A tax revision would put more money in the hands of the public and with surplus finance, you have the power to both spend more and invest large amounts for the future.

However, ahead of the Budget 2020, market volatility is inevitable. Hence, you may consider investing in fixed deposits to save your surplus savings. It is best to plan your investments in advance, with FD Calculator, so you are able to understand what you can gain, even before you invest.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/what-to-expect-from-budget-2020--2020-01-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/what-to-expect-from-budget-2020-.html
195,29-1-20,"Trump team brushes past Bolton, attacks impeachment case","President Donald Trump’s legal team is raising a broad-based attack on the impeachment case against him even as it mostly brushes past allegations in a new book that could undercut a key defense argument at his Senate trial.

Former national security adviser John Bolton writes in a manuscript that Trump wanted to withhold military aid from Ukraine until it committed to helping with investigations into Democratic rival Joe Biden. That assertion matters because Trump and his lawyers have repeatedly insisted that he never tied the suspension of security aid to political investigations. The revelation clouded White House hopes for a swift end to the impeachment trial, as Democrats demanded witnesses and some Republicans expressed openness to the idea. It also distracted from hours of arguments Monday from Trump’s lawyers, who declared anew that no witness has testified to direct knowledge that Trump’s delivery of aid was contingent on investigations into Democrats. Bolton appeared poised to say exactly that if summoned by the Senate.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump-team-brushes-past-bolton--attacks-impeachment-case.html

199,29-1-20,Opportunities galore,"The job market is expected to undergo radical changes in the next few years. This means that there will be an increase in the demand for certain occupations. Dr Narendra Shyamsukha tells you more

The job scenario in India has gone through a sea change in India. We are in the midst of fourth technological revolution, where there is lot of integration of technology that is taking place. By 2020, even the Government’s flagship initiative for job creation and skill enhancement, Make in India, will also create 10 crore new jobs by 2020. Both the initiatives Make in India, and Start up India have been looking to increase investment opportunities in the country.

While the job landscape is expected to undergo radical changes over the next few years, a report published by the World Economic Forum says that there will be certain occupations that are more in demand.

Here’s a look at some of the categories that are expected to see growth in 2020 and beyond.

Accountants

According to payscale.com, the top salary for an accountant, not being a Chartered Accountant, could go up to `487,303 a year. There is steady and assured growth for an accountant over the progression of the career. Accountants, today, may require additional competencies because of the expansion of digitisation to every sphere of business. The SAP is one of the most widely used enterprise application programs being used in industry and to obtain veracity and genuineness of training, it is crucial to choose a SAP authorised training delivery partner to complete your certification in this software.

Ordinarily, commerce graduates with an additional diploma or certification in specialised accounting practices may start working as an accountant. Over time, an accountant may grow into the role of Finance Manager, Account Manager, Financial Controller, Chartered Accountant, Chief Financial Officer or a Finance Director.

Data scientists

According to multinational IT giant IBM, 59 per cent of all Data Science and Analytics job demand is in Finance and Insurance, Professional Services, and IT. Annual demand for the fast-growing new roles of data scientist, data developers, and data engineers will reach nearly 700,000 openings by 2020. The LinkedIn Workforce Report maintains that, in the US, demand for these professional figures has grown six-fold compared to five years ago, and data analysts will continue to be the most sought-after profiles over the next five years.

Engineering

Automation and machines are taking over the world like the way we see in sci-fi thrillers. During the next four years, the demand for those skilled engineers will continue to increase. There will be a huge demand for satellite engineers, electronic engineers and robotic engineers. Specifically, there will be growth for engineers focused on biochemicals, nanotechnology, robotics, and materials. By 2020, two million jobs will be created worldwide for computer, maths, architecture and engineering related fields.

Green Warriors

Clean and green energy is the motto of the Government as they are encouraging us to use alternative sources of power and energy including wind and solar. That means huge demand for specialists who can innovate, advise Governments on green strategies, and ensure compliance across industries. If the Government fulfills their target of target for grid-connected solar energy from 20 GW to 100 GW by 2022, India could generate a million jobs if it reaches its solar power target and another 1,83,500 could come from wind projects.

Drone Operators

The market for drone operators is only going to expand as UAV technology becomes advanced. Drones were actually invented in the early 1990s for surveillance and reconnaissance. By adding cameras, lights, audio sensors, or even a robotic arm, the utility of drones have increased. In India, drones are still primarily used for Defense and law enforcement but the time isn’t far when it will be allowed commercial use of drones, which will open up this space.

Sales People

There will be a growing need for specialised sales people who can explain the company’s offerings to a wide range of clients, including businesses, Governments, consumers, as well as to new clients that the company has never worked with before. With many job prospects, there is a growing need to understand in which sectors jobs are going to be created, what are the skills that are needed by industries and employers, and how productivity can be enhanced with skilling and reskilling people.

200,29-1-20,‘Be aware of current affairs to ace interview’,"Working in a PSU is a dream job for many. AS Pandit shares tips on how to secure a seat at Coal India

Securing a Government job in a Public Service Undertaking (PSU) has been an aspiration for many. The lucrative starting pay packages accompanied by other monetary benefits like free medical insurance, retirement benefits and performance-based incentives are key factors behind this rising inclination towards the sector. However, the biggest advantage is the job security. Imagine having a stable job even during an unstable economic environment! So, how does one secure a job in this sector?

The PSUs emphasize on three ways to recruit candidates; conducting their own exams, shortlisting candidates based on their GATE scores or by employing candidates from the premier institutes in the country like IITs and the IIM. The beginning of 2020 has brought good news to all the aspirants as Coal India Limited has opened an online application for the intake of management trainees. A Maharatna Public Sector Undertaking under the Ministry of Coal, this year has invited applications for 1,326 vacancies across various disciplines.

Eligible candidates till the age of 30 can apply for various management trainee posts through online application mode on or before 19 January 2020 on their official website. The computer-based test is scheduled on February 7 and 28 February, 2020.

Pattern and selection process

It comprises two stages; online exam and interview. The online exam consists of two papers to be completed in three hours. While Paper-I covers objective questions on General Awareness, Reasoning, Numerical Ability, and General English, Paper-II emphasises on questions related to a candidate’s professional knowledge.

Candidates must qualify both the papers along with the medical examination for getting selected for the management trainee post. The entire process aims to assess a candidate’s knowledge and evaluate different aspects of knowledge, skills, understanding, ability and physical fitness. Candidates must score a minimum of 40 marks (General category), 35 marks (OBC category) and 30 marks (SC/ST/PWD) in each paper to qualify the computer-based test. Those who qualify both the papers separately in the computer-based test and rank high on merit as decided by the Coal India will be eligible for the interview.

How to crack interview

Understanding the nature of the management trainee job: Before joining the organisation, a candidate must be aware of the exact nature of the job. They would be expected to have complete knowledge about Coal India as a PSU, about its commencement, current position nationally as well as globally, the duties and responsibilities of a management trainee, and finally, the role of CIL in India in the existing times.

Be thorough with your academic and professional background: This is a necessity for the interview. Candidates should be able to answer questions about their stream of education as well as the reasons behind choosing it. For professionals having relevant work experience, they should be able to answer questions about it.

Stay aware of the ongoing events: Apart from the above basic information, candidates must also have thorough knowledge about the important events taking place across the country. For that, they must read newspapers or follow certain publications like The Hindu or The Indian Express online

Take mock interviews: Once you are done with the interview preparation, enrol yourself for a mock interview series or ask your family and friends to help you conduct a few. Having such kind of verbal confrontations can actually help you in facing the interview panel with ease on the main day.

Coal India Limited is a reputed origination offering a dream job of management trainee not just to the engineering graduates in the country, but even those who belong to non-technical academic streams. Aspirants should, therefore, follow the above mentioned crucial things to increase their chances of working with experienced professionals in Coal India or its subsidiary companies.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/---be-aware-of-current-affairs-to-ace-interview---.html
201,29-1-20,MindIT,"The main areas of intervention that are needed today are: Education, health, livelihoods and disability. This can only be achieved through poverty alleviation, economic inequalities, and 360 degree impact on the quality of life through social development programmes. For this, a wide range of programmes — from grass root level to national level — have been undertaken.

Sustainable development goal is a unique goal focused purely on education. This is the first time such a standalone education goal has been set and ratified by The Hans Foundation which has been working on education as a core thematic area.

“Education is a human right and a public good that is critical to the health and future of the country. Through various partnerships with NGOs working at the community level, we have been making efforts to ensure that children from remotest areas receive affordable education. Our school programme aims to ensure that all students clear high school and are prepared for under-graduate studies,” retd Lt Gen SM Mehta, CEO of The Hans Foundation tells you.

In their effort to bridge the gap of inadequate number of schools in the country, they have been supporting construction of schools across States. These schools provide quality education to children from slums, disadvantaged families, orphans, street children and children of labourers who do not have immediate access to schools. Many of these schools also have been provided with residential facilities for children.

Health and education for all (HEAL) is another area of focus. Founded by Dr Satya Prasad Koneru, it is an international charity, registered in India, the UK, the US, Australia and Spain. The village project at Thotaphalli in Gannavaram Mandal located in the Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh. “The school with the capacity to accommodate 1,000 children is proving quality education and infrastructure to orphans/children living with single parents and children from underprivileged backgrounds,” Mehta says.

The foundation is also working for the marginalised sections of the society where children are first-generation learners. “These children are left out of the mainstream of formal education because of several factors. “This void is filled through non-formal education (NFE) programmes. It imparts continuous education to the participants irrespective of their age, sex and educational background. The scope covers activities ranging from simple memorisation to learning of complicated concepts to get them accustomed to the NCERT syllabus. It covers all areas of formal education, including life skills, nutrition and health and family planning,” he explains.

For those who are interested in to pursue a career in engineering or becoming a doctor studies, there are fellowship programmes. The foundation has collaborated with organisations with an aim to create opportunities for all aspiring and deserving students hailing from economically disadvantaged families especially in Uttarakhand. Efforts have been made to identify top colleges offering BE/BTech/MBBS courses in the State and eligible students from these institutes were selected based on annual family income and the students’ academic records. Around 350 students have been supported.

“There is also a need to work to increase enrollment of children, retention and boost attendance. This can be achieved through improving nutritional levels among children. We have supported three midday meal programmes — supplied nutritious meals to 75 schools benefitting more than 10,000 children. The results have been manifold – from addressing the problem of classroom hunger, to increased enrollment, higher attendance, improved social skills among castes, addressed malnutrition and has also led to women empowerment,” Mehta says.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/mindit-mindit-2020-01-29.html

204,29-1-20,US bombing in Afghan hits 10-year high,"American warplanes dropped more bombs on Afghanistan in 2019 than at any other time in at least a decade, according to the US Air Force, as Washington intensified attacks in the country amid withdrawal talks with the Taliban.

In 2019 alone, the US dropped 7,423 separate munitions on targets in Afghanistan, where the US has been enmeshed in fighting several militant groups since it invaded the country following the September 11, 2001 attacks.

The figure -- published online by US Air Forces Central Command -- represents a dramatic surge in bombings in Afghanistan compared to the peak of President Barack Obama’s “surge” in 2009, when 4,147 bombs were dropped.

Since President Donald Trump was elected in 2016 the US has ramped up bombing runs over Afghanistan as the White House removed earlier restrictions that provided greater oversight over air raids aimed at preventing civilian casualties.

The UN and rights groups have repeatedly voiced concerns that the increase in air strikes across the country by US and Afghan forces have resulted in a major upswing in civilian casualties.

During the first half of 2019 pro-government forces, including the US, killed 717 civilians, an increase of 31 percent from a year earlier, the UN reported last year.

Most of the deaths came from US and Afghan air strikes, often in support of national forces on the ground, the report said.

The increase in bombings comes as Washington and the Taliban continue to wrangle over a possible agreement that would see US troops begin to leave Afghanistan in return for security guarantees.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us-bombing-in-afghan-hits-10-year-high.html

206,29-1-20,Get right guidance with E-Learning,"Preparations for CSE start in the first year of graduation. Many opt for coaching institutions to get right guidance but lakhs of students are unable to do so because of the huge cost. A Pioneer Avenues report

Quite often we hear civil services aspirants and toppers revealing that they stayed off all social media platforms for a considerable time as they prepared for the prestigious exams. But have you heard of aspirants getting hooked on to Instagram, of all platforms, for preparing for one of the most challenging entrance examinations in India?

“Well, nearly 3.50 lakh followers are doing just on the UPSC Guide page that started off as a simple idea on Instagram. “It is now one of the most favourite social media pages among UPSC aspirants,” says Abhijeet Nikam, founder, UPSC Guide.

UPSC Guide also disperses its various courses through video lectures, chatroom discussions, webinars, one-to-one assistance through Skype, phone and other social media handles.

“For many, preparations for the Civil Services Examinations (CSE) start in the very first year of their graduation itself. Many opt for prestigious coaching institutions to get the right guidance but lakhs of students are unable to do so because of the huge cost associated with these coaching institutions.

“To address this problem existing in the system Nikam Education OPC Pvt Ltd, under the brand name UPSC Guide, came up with the solution. In the era of e-learning, we thought what better for the IAS aspirants than an e-learning system where they can get the right guidance sitting at the comfort of their homes,” Nikam adds.

UPSC Guide is a complete e-learning system for UPSC CSE entrance examinations including both prelims and mains exam. It provides different kind of courses depending on the need of the aspirant. Getting into its courses is very simple. Just register on its website, select the preferred course for which payment is online and get started with its online coaching.

The vision behind UPSC Guide is to provide best quality courses to the UPSC aspirants while minimising the cost by approximately 80 per cent and also the time consumed which is a huge factor for these aspirants who shift their base to get into best quality coaching institutes.

Understanding its social responsibility and to help the less privileged aspirants, UPSC Guide provides the complete course, without compromising quality, free of cost to BPL and physically challenged candidates. Enticed by the innovative idea and quality of courses, many UPSC achievers have joined hands with UPSC Guide and provide guidance to new aspirants through this platform.

Within six months of monetisation of UPSC Guide, it has been able to attract thousands of students and already 1600 students are registered under various categories of courses. “The idea was incepted from a simple Instagram page. UPSC Guide has now more than 343k followers on Instagram,” Nikam points out.

This is just the beginning or the first phase of services. Nikam says adding, “In the next phase, we are planning to provide online courses for various other government service examinations like IIT Entrance among others.”

Talking about the economic impact, Nikam says, “Within few months of monetisation, UPSC Guide has been able to generate good revenue, if we maintain the same quality, same pace, same revenue model and considering the kind of interest e-learning platforms are getting, we shall be able to generate revenue close to Rs 1000 crore by 2026.”

208,29-1-20,‘Equal opportunities need to be ensured’,"While there are provisions in the Transgender Bill that prohibit discrimination in employment opportunities, implementation of these provisions is a big challenge, says Sonica Aron

The first-ever study on the rights of transgenders by the National Human Rights Commission gives a clear picture of the scenario of transgender in the country. According to the study, about 92 per cent of transgenders are deprived of the right to participate in any form of economic activity in the country, with even qualified ones refused jobs.

As per 2011 census data, India’s trans population consist of 490,000 people, out of which handful of them only make it to gainful employment. Though there are number of efforts being made to change this narrative. For example, a Chennai-based start-up is working towards the social inclusion of the transgender community, but it has only been able to place 42 trans people in its 14-month existence. So focusing on trans employment at the workplace is the need of the hour.

In 2017, Kerala’s Kochi Metro Rail Limited employed 23 transgender persons, while eight out of them quit their jobs within a month due to refusal by several landlords to give them accommodation. They were left with no remedy but to quit their jobs since their employer had no legal obligation and/ or incentive to step in and help them fight against such discrimination.

It is only Tamil Nadu where some steps have been taken to improve the life of these people by providing them with education, identity cards and subsidised food.

What can be done by Corporates, Society and the Government?

While there are specific provisions in the Transgender Bill that protect transgender interests by prohibiting discrimination in employment opportunities, the implementation of such provisions is a big challenge.

A robust legal mechanism to safeguard transgender interests is the need of the hour and huge penalties must be imposed on offenders/violators. Further, relevant amendments under specific legislation such as the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976, and the Maternity Act, 2013, may need to be revisited to include a trans people in their ambit for rigorous implementation of the provisions of the Bill. This will also safeguard a transgender person against discrimination in the workplace.

Equal opportunity to education and livelihood needs to be ensured. Which means from schools, colleges to workplaces need to be sensitised and prepared to welcome transpersons and ensure that they are not discriminated against.Just like there are education facilities provided from EWS, girl child, physically disabled, there should be mandatory education for children from the trans community.

The Government can take necessary steps to ensure that an employer is complying with such provisions by way of mandating an employer to submit quarterly returns that include details pertaining to the number of vacancies available, interviews conducted for them and the number of positions filled, including percentage of transgender employed therein.

Workplaces need to be more transgender-inclusive with initiatives like equal opportunity hiring, providing infrastructure such as restrooms for the third gender, action against misconduct/ harassment, medical insurance and policies, health care.

And last but not the least we need to be more inclusive for them in our society by treating them equally.

209,29-1-20,Numbers don’t lie,"Numerology deals with numbers. The predication made by numerology depends upon the data which is fed. Any machine will give the output according to the data inputted in the machine. More the data is clean more will be the accuracy of the results.

Numbers speak their own language. It goes with the saying: As you Sow, So you shall Reap. If you are doing a wrong thing, updating wrong data then results will also be wrong. Hence, a good numerologist should be very careful about what kind of data he is taking into consideration. It is the game of Mathematical calculations.

In numerology, every alphabet has been assigned a particular number and the numbers vibrates with definite frequencies. While calculating the name number of any person, numbers should be correctly mentioned of the alphabet as per Chaldean System. If any number has been assigned to any alphabet, then it will change the whole calculation. We do the addition of first name, second name and last name separately and reduce each to single number. Then we add all the three numbers and final resultant again reduced to single number and this becomes the name number for a person.

For example, a person whose name is Ram Kumar Gupta and born on January 8, 2001. So here first we calculate his first name number where value of R is 2, A is 1 and M is 4, on adding these numbers (2+1+4), resultant number comes to 7. Similarly, we will calculate for Kumar, where the value of K is 2, U is 6, M is 4, A is 1, R is 2, on adding these numbers (2+6+4+1+2), resultant number comes to 15, which is further reduced to single number and answer is 6 (1+5) and finally we will calculate for Gupta, where value of G is 3, U is 6, P is 8, T is 4 and A is 1. on adding these numbers (3+6+8+4+1), resultant number comes to 22, which is further reduced to a single number and answer comes 4 (2+2). Now we will add the single number of first name, middle name and last name i.e. 7+6+4, the answer is 17, which is further reduced to single number i.e 8 (1+7), ruled by Saturn.

Now, his date of birth is January 8, 2001, hence is psychic/driver number comes to 8, ruled by Saturn and destiny number/conduction number comes to 8+1+1+2+0+0+1 = 12, which is further reduced to single number and answer comes 3 (1+2). Hence, his destiny/conductor number comes to 3, ruled by Jupiter.

Hence, we can conclude that knowledge of basic arithmetic is required for numerology.

211,29-1-20,Shahbaz’s double strike hurts Delhi’s progress,"Shahbaz Ahmed scalped two batsmen in successive balls as Bengal grabbed four wickets in the final session to put Delhi on the backfoot in their Ranji Trophy group A clash, at Eden Gardens on Tuesday.

Resuming the second day on 286 for five, Bengal endured a terrible first session in which Anustup Majumdar was run out for 99 and that triggered the collapse.

Bengal innings folded for 318 after losing five wickets inside 12 overs.

The hosts though fought back by reducing Delhi to 192 for six at close on day two, taking four wickets for 58 runs in the final session. Delhi are still trailing Bengal by 126 runs.

Aided by two brilliant catches, left-arm spinner Shahbaz dismissed Kshitiz Sharma (nine) and Simarjeet Singh (0) off successive balls at close.

First it was Majumdar who took a low catch at the first slip to dismiss Sharma, and then then Kazi Junaid Saifi caught Singh brilliantly in his second attempt at the forward short-leg to put Shahbaz in line for a second hat-trick.

The rookie Bengal all-rounder had taken a hattrick in their innings and 303-run win over Hyderabad in their last round match at Kalyani.

“At the moment we look better. There's 14 overs left for the new ball and the conditions will be fresh in the morning. We need to bowl well tomorrow,” Bengal coach-cum-mentor Arun Lal said.

With rain forecast for the remaining two days, it remains to be seen whether the match will be completed.

Odisha posts 436 vs Assam

Cuttack: Five batsmen scored half-centuries as Odisha posted a massive 436 and then reduced Assam to 59 for three at stumps on the second day of Group C match.

After Shantanu Mishra (66), Anurag Sarangi (58), Govinda Poddar (54) had scored fifties on the opening day, Abhishek Raut (71) and Debabrata Pradhan (79) also came up with superb half-centuries to ensure that Odisha got past the 400-mark.

In reply, Assam opener Biplab Saikia fell for a duck in the second over and two more wickets fell before Rayan Parag (14 batting) and Rishav Das (24 batting) ensured there were no more setbacks for the team.

In Jammu, no play was possible on the second day of the match against Chhattisgarh. The visiting team led by skipper Harpreet Singh Bhatia’s 116 (196 balls, 16 fours) had made 270 for 4 in 90 on the opening day.

Rain washed out

Dharamsala: The second day’s play in the Elite Group B game between Mumbai and Himachal Pradesh was washed out without a ball being bowled.

On the opening day on Monday, Sarfaraz Khan struck an unbeaten 226 to propel Mumbai to a commanding 372 for five.

A morning drizzle first delayed the start of play and later, umpires S Ravi and Vineet Kulkarni, after consultation with curator Sunil Chauhan, called it off at the picturesque HPCA Stadium.

In other Group B encounters, Karnataka reduced Railways to 160 for seven at the Karnail Singh Stadium in the national capital.

At the Holkar Stadium in Indore, hosts Madhya Pradesh took a crucial first-innings lead after bundling out Uttar Pradesh for 216 and were placed at 105 for three in their second essay, with skipper Naman Ojha unbeaten on 20 in the company of Yash Dubey (4).

Overall, MP led by 119 runs.

At the Motibaug ground in Vadodara, Saurashtra, who are in a spot of bother at 23 for two, need another 177 runs for an outright win against hosts Baroda.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/shahbaz---s-double-strike-hurts-delhi---s-progress.html
212,29-1-20,India breeze into U-19 WC semis,"Pacer Kartik Tyagi blew away the Australian top-order with a sensational spell to power India into the semifinals of the ICC U-19 World Cup with a comfortable 74-run win here on Tuesday.

Kartik’s four wickets came after India recovered through Atharva Ankolekar’s combative half-century to reach 233 for nine, a modest total which the holders defended in impressive fashion.

Riding on Kartik’s spell in which he swung the ball at a good speed, India bundled out Australia for 159 with 6.3 overs to spare in their Super League quarterfinal.

Invited to bat, India lacked a substantial partnership until Atharva and Ravi Bishnoi joined forces to raise a fighting 61-run stand for the seventh wicket.

Atharva scored an unbeaten 55 off 54 balls with five fours and a six, while Bishnoi made 30 off 341 balls.

Tyagi (4/24) then produced a dream spell in which he removed Australian skipper Mackenzie Harvey (4) and Lachlan Hearne (0) in successive balls in his very first over.

This was after Jake Fraser-McGurk had run himself out in the very first ball of their innings.

He did not get a hat-trick but added the scalps of Oliver Davies (2) and Patrick Rowe (21) to take the life out of the Australian chase.

India’s modest total would have given the Australians hope but it became a herculean task after their top order was polished off.

Opener Sam Fanning (75) kept fighting from one end but that only delayed the inevitable. He added 81 runs for the sixth wicket with Liam Scott (35).

The writing was on the wall after that as Akash (3/30) wrapped up the match by adding the wickets of Todd Murphy and Matthew Willans to his tally.

Earlier, only opener Yashaswi Jaiswal put up a semblance of resistance against the Australian attack, scoring an 82-ball 62 with the help of six fours and two sixes.

Divyaansh Saxena (14), Tilak Varma (2), Priyan Garg (5) and Dhruv Juel (15) all struggled.

After losing one partner after another, Jaiswal went for a pull off Tanveer Sangha but edged the ball between his legs on to the stumps.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-breeze-into-u-19-wc-semis.html
213,29-1-20,"‘Hafeez, Malik part of Pak T20 WC plans’","Pakistan head coach and chief selector Misbah-ul-Haq has clearly indicated that senior players Mohd Hafeez and Shoaib Malik are part of the team’s plans for the T20 World Cup in October-November.

The two seniors, who were dropped following the team’s exit from the 2019 ODI World Cup, were recalled for the T20 series at home against Bangladesh.

“I think they have performed well and they still have something to contribute to Pakistan cricket. Age is not an issue as long as a player is fit and in form, he can contribute to his team,” Misbah said.

“I think we require seniors like Hafeez (39) and Malik (37) and even captain, Babar Azam supported their selection,” he said.

Misbah said after the T20 series at home against Sri Lanka and in Australia, he had realised that the team still needed the services of senior players.

“We don’t have much time before the World T20 so we will go along with our best players.”

The former Pakistan captain said that as long as a player was meeting fitness standards and performing he can be selected for Pakistan.

“I think we now have to start building our squad for the World Cup and that is why it was very important for us to win the series against Bangladesh. I am glad Hafeez and Malik both contributed to the wins.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---hafeez--malik-part-of-pak-t20-wc-plans---.html
214,29-1-20,Rain halts SL reply to Zim,"Sri Lanka made a solid start to their first innings reaching 122 for two before bad light and rain brought an early close to the second day of the second Test against Zimbabwe here on Tuesday.

The visitors are still 284 runs behind the hosts who lost their last four wickets in the morning to be bowled out for 406.

Sri Lanka openers Dimuth Karunaratne and Oshada Fernando added 94 for the first wicket before both fell for 44.

Karunaratne was the first to go, the Sri Lankan captain picking the wrong length to sweep a full delivery from off-spinner Raza and falling leg before.

In the meantime, Donald Tiripano was maintaining a steady line and got his reward when, shortly after, Fernando drove loosely.

The left-arm spinner Lasith Embuldeniya, who took a hammering on Monday, mainly at the hands of centurion Sean Williams, picked up three of the last four wickets in the morning session to finish the Zimbabwe innings with four for 182.

Resuming on 352 for six, Zimbabwe lost Chakabva for his overnight 31 in the sixth over of the morning after he gave a faint edge off Embuldeniya to wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella.

Debutant Tinotenda Mutombodzi made 33 before missing a sweep to fall leg before to Dhananjaya de Silva who finished with three for 71.

Some resistance from the last three took the Zimbabwe total past 400 but Embuldeniya accounted for both Tiripano and Nyauchi who was brilliantly caught by De Silva at first slip.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/rain-halts-sl-reply-to-zim.html

In a video shot inside the team bus while it was on its way to Hamilton for the third T20I, Chahal is seen talking to several members of the squad including Jasprit Bumrah, Rishabh Pant and KL Rahul.

Towards the end of the video, he moved to the rear of the bus and pointed to an empty seat which, he said, was the former captain’s preferred spot before he went on a sabbatical last year.

“Yeh woh seat hai jahan ek legend baithate the. Mahi bhai. Abhi bhi yaha koi nahi baithata. Hum unhe bohot miss karte hai (This is the seat that used to be occupied a legend. MS Dhoni.

216,29-1-20,We have identified core players for WC: Rathour,"Batting coach Vikram Rathour on Tuesday called the new generation of Indian cricketers “incredible” and said the team management has already identified the core of players for the T20 World Cup in October-November.

“Adjustments will keep going on till the last minute. But as far as I am concerned and the team management is concerned, we have the core. We know what our team is going to be. Unless there is a case of injury or really bad loss in form, I don’t see many changes happening,” said Rathour.

The T20 team has been doing really well in New Zealand and the young guns have contributed significantly to its success, leaving the batting coach hugely impressed.

“This new generation of cricketers is incredible. I find it amazing actually that they turn up and they are at their best straightaway across different format, different grounds and different countries actually. The amount of time they took to get settled (here in NZ)) was outstanding actually,” he said.

India won the twin matches in Auckland and the batting coach expressed satisfaction that the younger batsmen are stepping forward for the team’s cause.

“The more opportunities that these guys get, they are showing that they are capable. They are showing that they are match-winners on their day. That will help the team, of course, but it will also help their confidence.

“Having seen KL (Rahul) and Shreyas as young cricketers coming through, in my mind, I have absolutely no doubt that they are match-winners. They are getting their opportunities now and they are showing the world what they are capable of, that is great to see,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/we-have-identified-core-players-for-wc--rathour.html

Ben Arfa, 32, has 15 France caps, won the French Cup with Rennes last season but left the club after his contract expired and had not found a new club. The attacking midfielder made his breakthrough with Lyon in 2004 and has since played for Marseille, Newcastle, Hull, Nice and PSG.

Todd Astle announces FC retirement

Wellington: New Zealand leg-spinner Todd Astle has announced his retirement from first-class cricket to focus on the limited-overs formats, ruling him out of the upcoming two-match unofficial Test series against India A starting January 30. The 33-year-old, who made his Test debut in 2012, played a mere five Tests for the national team, claiming seven wickets at 52.57. With the bat, he scored 98 runs at 19.60. Astle, however, will sign off as the top First-Class wicket-taker for Canterbury, clinching 303 of his 334 wickets for the side.

Lyon: Lyon striker Ada Hegerberg, the 2018 women's footballer of the year, will be out until the end of the season after rupturing knee ligaments, the club said on Tuesday. “A date for surgery will be fixed in the coming days,” the club said in a statement. Hegerberg, 24, said the injury to the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) in her right knee was a setback but promised to return “soon.” “I ruptured my ACL this weekend. This is a setback for me, but I'm going to work through this with all my heart and my energy,” she tweeted. “The best is yet to come. YOU'LL SEE ME SOON!”

218,29-1-20,Go for dual degree from a foreign university,"Not all can afford to study abroad but that doesn’t mean that they should give up. There are several options that they can explore. Pioneer Avenues reports

It is not always possible for each student to head abroad to get a degree. However, they can still avail an opportunity of getting a degree from a foreign university. The upGrad has launched a one-of-a-kind dual degree programme in Computer Science.

The programme has been launched as a joint flagship initiative with IIT-Bangalore and Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU), UK.

Owing to the evolution of the IT industry and emergence of newage technology like Blockchain, AI, and Software programming, upGrad has launched this programme with the purpose of upskilling working professionals for future careers in IT.

The 18-month dual-degree program enables learners to choose their specialisation between two base PG diplomas — Full Stack Development or Blockchain.

This programme is an ideal fit for professionals looking to upskill in software development, website design, front end and backend development and dynamic programming.

The learners have the liberty to choose their specialisation after building their foundation and programming basics for the first six months of the programme and obtaining insights from industry experts from IBM, DCB Bank to decide the best fit for their profile.

Post completion of the programme, those interested in pursuing higher education can pursue a Masters in Research with LJMU and graduate with dual credentials: MSc and a specialised PG Diploma. The placement cell assures a minimum of three job interviews and job placement assistance with leading tech firms.

In each specialisation, there are several job opportunities available including Full-Stack Developer, Backend/ Frontend Developer, Blockchain Developer, Ethereum Developer, Hyperledger Developer, Solidity Developer, and Javascript Developer.

This is the company’s second partnership with the university.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/study-abroad---go-for-dual-degree-from-a-foreign-university.html
219,29-1-20,Utd prepare to face City,"Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says Manchester United need to harness the spirit of Paris Saint-Germain and put in a “perfect performance” if they are to overcome Manchester City and reach the League Cup final.

United face an uphill battle after losing the first leg of their semi-final against Pep Guardiola’s men 3-1 at Old Trafford.

Marcus Rashford’s goal gives United a glimmer of hope heading to the Etihad Stadium today and Solskjaer said the stunning comeback win against PSG in the Champions League last March can be an inspiration.

United were 2-0 down after the first leg and then 3-1 down on aggregate in Paris before storming back to win on away goals.

“Well, it looked like it was over at half-time,” he said, referring to the first leg of the City match. “I have to say the second part of that first half, they outplayed us for a while and it’s hard.

“But then when we got the goal, of course you’re back in it, we hope for another one.

“But now we’ve got to go into the memory bank and think PSG because we’ve done it against good teams before and it gives us some hope, and the game in December (when United won 2-1 against City) of course gives us hope that we can do something there.”

Ole confirmed Nemanja Matic is a doubt for the second leg in a press conference that included plenty of transfer talk but no updates.

Meanwhile, Guardiola remains wary of the threat posed by Manchester United after his side were beaten 2-1 at the Etihad in the Premier League earlier this season.

“It’s Manchester United. They can do it, they have done it,” said the City boss. “In these kind of games against incredible teams with incredible history, they have pride and I know how difficult it will be to reach the final.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/utd-prepare-to-face-city.html
220,29-1-20,Eriksen ‘couldn’t wait’ for Inter move,"Christian Eriksen said he was desperate to join Inter Milan this month after completing a protracted move from Tottenham on Tuesday.

Eriksen, 27, has signed a contact until 2024 with the Italian giants after the clubs reached an agreement for a reported transfer fee of 20 million euros (£17 million, $22 million).

“I couldn’t wait to join,” Eriksen told Inter TV. “It’s wonderful to be here and I’m happy to be a new Inter player.

“I’m very excited and can’t wait to introduce myself to the fans. I’ve already experienced their warmth, it’s been a fantastic welcome. I feel great.”

Eriksen made 305 appearances for Spurs after joining from Ajax in 2013, scoring 69 goals.

The Danish international was a key part of the side that reached last season’s Champions League final and finished in the top four of the Premier League for the past four seasons under Mauricio Pochettino.

However, he refused to extend his contract with the north London club beyond the end of this season, meaning a departure was inevitable either this month or on a free transfer at the end of the campaign.

Eriksen was keen for a fresh challenge in Serie A, particularly under the orders of Inter coach Antonio Conte.

“I was able to get to know him when I was at Tottenham, we came up against his Chelsea side and it was very difficult. I’m excited to learn more about him and how his sides play,” added Eriksen.

“The numbers say that I did really well in England. It’s now time to start a new challenge, I’m really happy to have the opportunity to play in Serie A for a big team. Inter is a fantastic club.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/eriksen----couldn---t-wait----for-inter-move.html
221,29-1-20,Young guns take Gunners ahead,"Mikel Arteta hailed Arsenal’s “hungry” youngsters after Bukayo Saka and Eddie Nketiah fired their side into the FA Cup fifth round with a 2-1 win against Bournemouth on Monday.

Arteta turned to youth at Dean Court and Saka, Nketiah and Joe Willock repaid the Arsenal manager’s faith with influential displays that secured a trip to third-tier Portsmouth.

Saka gave Arsenal an early lead as the 18-year-old full-back bagged his third goal of the season with a superb strike.

Nketiah got the second before the interval to ensure Arteta took another step towards emulating his FA Cups triumph as an Arsenal player in 2014 and 2015.

Sam Surridge got one back for Bournemouth in the closing minutes, but it was too late to salvage a replay. “I’m very pleased. Always tough to come here and win, we’ve done it with a young team as well,” Arteta said.

“I have a lot of faith in them. I think they are developing really well. They are willing and hungry and will only get better.”

Languishing in 10th place in the Premier League after failing to win any of their last three games, this was a welcome boost for Arteta as Arsenal built on their hard-fought draw at Chelsea last week.

“It is very important to stay fit as this is the Olympic year. It is not that you should go to tournaments without being 100 percent. It is important to stay healthy and be fit and then go for tournaments,” Sindhu told reporters ahead of Hyderabad Hunters’ Premier Badminton League match against North Eastern Warriors.

“Also personally you have to plan and see which tournament you want to play as it is the Olympic year. So you have to plan accordingly,” added the Indian, who was recently conferred with the Padma Bhushan.

223,29-1-20,Seven point someone,"Swiss great Roger Federer said “I believe in miracles” after he saved seven match points in a five-set nail-biter against 100th-ranked Tennys Sandgren to go into an Australian Open semi-final with Novak Djokovic on Tuesday.

The six-time champion, struggling physically, saved three match points at 4-5 in the fourth set and four more in the tie-breaker to scrape through 6-3, 2-6, 2-6, 7-6 (10/8), 6-3.

Federer, 38, now goes into an unmissable semi-final with Djokovic, who blunted Milos Raonic’s razor serve to win 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (7/1) and move two wins from an eighth Melbourne title.

Djokovic, despite trouble with his contact lenses, ended Raonic’s run of 63 straight games in the tournament without a break of serve and moves smoothly into the semis for the loss of just one set so far.

He paid tribute to the great escape by Federer, ahead of a semi-final that reprises his epic win over the Swiss in last year’s Wimbledon decider.

“What he did today was really amazing, to come back and save seven match points at his age,” Djokovic said.

“He’s still playing such a great tennis and proving that he deserves to be up there. He’s a great fighter. Obviously I have lots of respect for him.”

Federer’s match was incident-packed and he received a rare warning for an audible obscenity before going off-court for treatment on a groin injury.

Still hampered by the injury, he somehow forced a fifth set and began to regain control against the big-serving American.

“I believe in miracles,” Federer said, revealing that he thought his groin strain had ended his chances. “There could be rain, there could be all kinds of stuff.

“(I thought) just let him finish me off in style, and he didn’t do that. I’m incredibly lucky tonight, today — I don’t even know what time it is.”

Sandgren, achingly close to becoming the lowest-ranked player to beat Federer at the Australian Open, can count himself unlucky especially after a ball girl accidentally collided with him during the pivotal tie-breaker, which he lost.

Federer has made heavy weather of reaching his 46th Major semi-final. He was two points from defeat by John Millman in a fifth-set tie-breaker in round three, and dropped a set against 67th-ranked Marton Fucsovics in round four.

‘Quiet little life’

In the women’s draw Australia’s world number one Ashleigh Barty dismissed two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova in impressive style to reach the semis for the first time.

The unflappable Barty beat the Czech 7-6 (8/6), 6-2 and will be favourite in her semi-final against America’s Sofia Kenin — sending hopes soaring of a first home winner in 42 years.

The French Open champion, who once quit tennis to play cricket and has been steadily rising since her return, is the tournament’s poster girl with her image plastered all over Melbourne.

But she said: “I’d prefer to just be sitting at home just living my quiet little life.”

Kenin, whose career is also on the up, made her first Grand Slam semi-final and with it will rise to at least 12 in the rankings — making her the second-highest American behind Serena Williams.

The feisty 21-year-old was a 6-4, 6-4 winner over Ons Jabeur, halting the Tunisian’s historic run which made her the first Arab woman to reach a Major quarter-final.

“She’s a really tough player, I knew she’s going to come out playing strong,” Kenin said. “She’s had really good matches, good wins. It wasn’t an easy battle — all respect to her.”

Jabeur has ignited interest back home with her run to the last eight, even receiving a good-luck phone call from her president.

“I think I proved that I can be in the quarter-finals in a Grand Slam, even if I have a lot of things to improve physically and mentally,” said the 25-year-old, who will now move inside the top 50.

“I proved to myself that I could do a lot of great things. I’m happy that I played this way.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/seven-point-someone.html
224,29-1-20,The escape artist,"Greatness is all about throwing the monkey off your back, or should we say groin this time, considering Roger Federer fought off his below the belt perch at the Australian Open quarter final with the strokes of a master.

Greatness is perseverance against all odds, patience in the face of impossibility and the ability to reach the finish line as a victor when even the commentators have begun to recite elegies.

That was Federer for you with all his vintage staycathon on display when he went on to win the quarter final against an aggressive American, saving seven match points to take the match full stretch. This, despite a stiff groin hampering his stride and stretch of imagination in dealing with the situation at 6-3, 2-6, 2-6 and seven match points in the fourth set.

It was, indeed, the return of the Federer of yore when he had the mind space and the power of youth to tower over the game as the ultimate escape artist from all but lost situations.

Here too, even as Tennys started salivating over the possibility of entering a grand slam semifinal first time ever, that too on the biggest stage against the biggest man in tennis, Federer showed how at 38, he is still the man among the boys.

After a medical break, and when Tennys was all set to finish him off in style, feeding ravenously on his injury, Federer nibbled back the game shot by shot point by point and defeated not just the demons in his body but also in his mind to take the match on five sets when logically it should have been all over in fourth with his opponent at the helm. Four match points in the games of set No 4 turning it into a tie breaker and then saving three more in the tie breaker when the Federer body language suggested he had given up, had the fans in another level of ecstacy. It also meant Federer has finally sorted out the chemical locha in his mind which has, so far, stopped him at the 20th slam title for some years.

Does it mean this brand of Federer is through to the Final? Federer is sceptical and said he felt extremely lucky to have downed the American. He humbly submitted that he did not deserve this victory and that he would have been packed off to Switzerland to skii had Tennys not lost his nerve.

Nothing can be farther to truth than this because it was a tenacious comeback by the swiss.

He is through to the semis now where the smiling and unbreakable assassin waits for him.

No groin or unforced errors or any other chink can work against the Serb and no one knows it better than Federer himself.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/the-escape-artist.html
225,29-1-20,India becoming better away from home: Southee,"Senior New Zealand pacer Tim Southee feels India are becoming “better and better” away from home and a reflection of that is their performance in the ongoing T20 series.

“India have played well. They’re a great side and they’re full of world-class players. The first game is the one that slightly got away on us but we were certainly outplayed in the second game.

“We know it’s always tough when you play against India and they’re becoming a better and better side away from home as well. We know we need to be on top of our game if we need to beat India,” Southee said on the ever of the third T20.

Southee also asked his team’s batsmen to raise their game.

“Change of venue should help us. We need to win this game but I think it goes back to what we need to do as a group. Focus on how we prepare today and if we play the way that we know this team can play then I’m sure the result will take care of itself.

“The guys would have learnt from the first two games. The first one got away from us. We should have defended that. We can’t sort look over our shoulders.

233,29-1-20,First of many,"India poised for maiden T20 series win in New Zealand

A ruthless India are expected to seal their maiden T20I series win in New Zealand and only a special comeback from the struggling hosts in the third game here today can delay what seems inevitable.

India won the twin T20Is in Auckland by margins of six and seven wickets respectively to go 2-0 up in the five-match series.

A third successive win at Seddon Park will give them their first ever T20I series’ win on New Zealand soil, a feat they were unable to achieve on two occasions previously. India lost 0-2 under Mahendra Singh Dhoni back in 2008-09, and last year, they went down 1-2.

Overall, this Indian side has seen an uptick in fortunes and are unbeaten in five T20 series since the 2019 ODI World Cup, including the ongoing one against the Black Caps. The only contest they didn't win was against South Africa, when the three-match series ended 1-1 after one of the games was washed out.

As such, there are no changes to be expected in the Indian line-up for the third T20. On Tuesday, there was an optional practice session with skipper Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Yuzvendra Chahal, Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah, the ones missing in action.

The support staff worked closely with those players who haven’t yet received a chance to play in the series yet. Ravi Shastri paid close attention to Washington Sundar, while batting coach Vikram Rathour was busy with Rishabh Pant. Both are expected to sit out again today.

There is possibility of one change to the Indian line-up. Kuldeep Yadav sat out the first two matches in Auckland, and that could have been a move motivated more by the ground size than anything else.

Chahal provides greater control and his wrist spin moves away from the majority of right-handers in the Black Caps’ line-up, thus against the arc of swing.

Yadav is a tad more adventurous in his flight and the angle of his spin into the right-handers could have been easy fodder at Eden Park’s short boundaries.

Whether Yadav comes back into contention at the regular-sized Seddon Park remains to be seen. Additionally, there is little chance of Chahal-Yadav playing together, a move India have shied away from since the ODI World Cup.

From New Zealand’s perspective, this is the last opportunity for Colin de Grandhomme to make an impression. The all-rounder will be replaced in the squad for the last two T20Is by batsman Tom Bruce.

Grandhomme has played strictly as a batsman so far in this series, and has scores of 0 and 3 in the first two games.

New Zealand are not too worried about their bowling performances in this series, despite India’s relative ease in chasing down totals in the first two matches. Their greater worry is contending with the Indian bowling, in particular Jasprit Bumrah who has regained much of his pre-injury rhythm.

In both matches, they were unable to get him away, whether at the start or during the death overs. For their part, India mixed things up well in the second T20, holding Bumrah back until later in the power play.

New Zealand have had a poor run at Eden Park off late, but their record at Seddon Park holds in good stead. They have won seven out of nine T20Is played here, and will be hoping to stop India from taking an unassailable lead in the series.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/first-of-many-2020-01-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/first-of-many.html
234,29-1-20,Indian women's hockey team lose 0-1 to New Zealand,"The Indian women's hockey team suffered a 0-1 loss to New Zealand in its third match of the ongoing tour here on Wednesday.

New Zealand's Hope Ralph (37th) was the lone scorer of the match.

India had earlier registered a 4-0 win in their first match against the New Zealand Development squad but lost 1-2 in the following match.

India were quick to get off the blocks on an attacking mode, winning a PC in the second minute of play but they missed the chance to convert it and put New Zealand on the back foot.

In the following minutes, New Zealand created two PCs but India's defence was rock solid to deny them a goal.

""Today we tried a few things on the defensive side and that allowed New Zealand to come in our circle and create opportunities but it's better to practice these variations now in the matches as this Tour is more about our preparations for the Olympic Games and see how we can be better,"" explained Chief Coach Sjoerd Marijne after the match.

In the second quarter, Indian strikers did well to create a PC but the hosts denied India a goal through good defence.

Both teams were on par in the second quarter with tactical play that kept each other from creating potential shots on goal.

""Our game is improving every match and today was again better than the previous match. At this moment, results are not important but the process is and we are working on some new tactics that will help us in the long run,"" added Marijne.

After ending the first half with the scoreboard reading 0-0 stalemate, New Zealand began the third quarter on a positive note with Hope Ralph converting a field goal in the 37th minute.

In the last quarter though both teams traded PCs with New Zealand earning two PCs and India creating one, neither found success ending the match with the scoreboard reading 0-1 in favour of New Zealand.

239,29-1-20,Sena slams Centre for handing Elgar Parishad case to NIA,"Attacking the Centre for handing over the probe into the sensitive Elgar Parishad case to the NIA, the Shiv Sena on Wednesday invoked federalism in the country and accused the Modi government of ""interfering"" in the affairs of ""non-BJP"" Maharashtra.

Questioning the sudden move, the Sena, which heads the Maha Vikas Aghadi government comprising the NCP and the Congress, asked whether the Centre wanted the ""truth"" in the case to remain uncovered.

""India is a union of states. Every state has its own rights and pride. The Centre forcing its way is inviting instability,"" the Sena said in an editorial in its Marathi mouthpiece 'Saamana'.

The Centre recently ordered the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to take over the probe into the Elgar case which has been probed by the Pune Police for suspected naxal links.

Police are investigating whether provocative speeches were made at the conclave held on December 31, 2017 which allegedly led to caste violence around Koregaon Bhima village in Pune district the next day.

Police had first used the term 'urban naxals' during the investigation after arresting nine activists and lawyers, including Telugu poet Varavara Rao and Sudha Bharadwaj.

Questioning timing of the Centre's move, Maharashtra Home Minister and NCP leader Anil Deshmukh had last week alleged that the state government was reviewing the investigation.

Accusing the Centre of doing ""vengeful politics"" in the editorial, the Sena questioned its 'selective' approach towards Maharashtra, a state ruled by Opposition parties.

""The NIA has intervened in Maharashtra, but several such incidents are taking place in the states being ruled by the BJP. Why the Centre didn't interfered there? This doesn't augur well.....""it stated.

The Sena, a former ally of the BJP, termed it as a ""shocking and suspicious"" move.

""Given the way the Centre handed over the probe to the NIA, did it not want the truth to come out?"" it questioned.

The Sena said it was told by the previous BJP-led government in the state that the Elgar Parishad--Koregaon Bhima episode was a ""political and national conspiracy"", and that there was a ""secret plot"" to bring down the ""national power"" and harm Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.

The Sena was the main constituent in the erstwhile BJP-led government in Maharashtra.

""The previous government had cited unnamed letters and e-mails as the evidence to drive home its point (of conspiracy theory in the case). However, people have not yet understood exactly what was the conspiracy to bring down the power of the country,"" it stated.

The Uddhav Thackeray-led party further said the Centre ""turned restless"" after NCP chief Sharad Pawar called for reviewing the investigation into the case.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sena-slams-centre-for-handing-elgar-parishad-case-to-nia-2020-01-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sena-slams-centre-for-handing-elgar-parishad-case-to-nia.html

241,29-1-20,Indians poised to fly out of Wuhan,"Special Air India flight to evacuate 240 Indians

As the death toll and infection from the lethal coronavirus outbreak continued to climb up steadily in China, India on Tuesday began process to evacuate nearly 240 of its nationals from Wuhan city in the infection-hit Chinese province of Hubei. Air India will send a special flight to Wuhan to bring back stranded Indian citizens.

Reports said that the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has given mandatory clearance to send a Boeing 747 flight to Wuhan for the evacuation of the Indian citizens.

India has made a formal request to China for facilitating the evacuation and the Civil Aviation Ministry was awaiting the approval of Chinese authorities.

The decision for the evacuation was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba. The meeting carried out a detailed review of the situation arising out of outbreak of coronavirus in China where more than 100 people have died and over 2,000 infected with the disease.

As India started the preparations to evacuate over 250 Indians, mostly students, stuck in the province, its embassy in Beijing said these nationals will have to undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine on their return.

China has reported 24 more deaths on Tuesday from the coronavirus epidemic, taking the number of fatalities to 106 as the confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the outbreak stand at 4,515, the Chinese health authorities said.

The Chinese Government has already locked down Wuhan as also other cities in the Hubei province with strict travel restrictions in and out of the area.

In view of a confirmed case of coronavirus in Nepal, the Centre has asked the five States bordering the neighbouring nation (Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Sikkim) to be alert and keep hospitals ready to meet any emergency. After airports and border areas, it has now initiated entry screening at the international ports having traffic from China.

Asserting that there was no confirmed case of the coronavirus, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said India was making all efforts to detect and check the spread of the virus. As part of the preparedness, India has also increased the number of airports from seven to 20 to do thermal screening of passengers for possible exposure to the deadly coronavirus, and made four more laboratories functional other than NIV-Pune for testing samples.

As the deadly virus continued to spread in various provinces in China, Indian students, hailing from various States, including Gujarat, have expressed their desire to return. “Indian Embassy is in constant touch with the Chinese Government. To evacuate students and other Indians from Wuhan, we are planning to send a plane there. Our efforts are on to bring them back. It will take some days. I urge people to trust the Government on this,” Jaishankar told reporters on his arrival at the Vadodara airport in Gujarat.

“No Indian student has been found to be affected by this virus. Parents need not worry about their children,” he said.

In India, suspected cases have been reported altogether from Delhi, Goa, Patna, Mumbai and Rajasthan, but none yet confirmed.

On Tuesday, a man was hospitalised in Goa as a precautionary measure for possible exposure to the coronavirus during his recent visit to China, a senior official said on Tuesday. The man was admitted in the isolation ward of the Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) with symptoms similar to novel coronavirus, officially called the 2019-nCoV, infection, he added.

“The patient had travelled to China in the recent past and had complained of a sore throat since his return. We admitted him in an isolation ward as a precautionary measure. His samples have been to Pune for further tests,” he said.

This is the first such move in the State since the coronavirus illness broke out in China, the official added.

In Patna, a woman who returned from China last week was admitted to a Patna hospital on Monday with symptoms similar to those of coronavirus. Samples of 12 passengers have been referred to National Institute of Virology, Pune. No positive case has been reported so far, Union Health Ministry said.

Over 100 people have been kept under observation in Kerala and Maharashtra following screening for a possible exposure to the novel coronavirus. One person each from Thrissur, Thiruvananthapuram, Pathanamthitta and Malappuram and three from Ernakulam are in isolation wards of various health centres in the State.

242,29-1-20,Sharjeel held in Jehanabad,"Shaheen Bagh brains handed over to Delhi Police in sedition case

Delhi Police’s Crime Branch, in a joint operation with the Bihar Police, on Tuesday arrested Sharjeel Imam — a JNU scholar and the organiser of the Shaheen Bagh anti-CAA protest — in a sedition case from Jehanabad in Bihar. A local court handed Sharjeel over to the Delhi Police team on a transit remand.

Sharjeel was wanted by police in several States, including Uttar Pradesh, Assam and Delhi for his seditious speech. He was slapped with a sedition case for allegedly making inflammatory speeches in Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University after a video of his purported speech went viral where he is heard speaking about “cutting off” Assam and the northeast from the rest of India.

Police had earlier raided Sharjeel’s ancestral home on Sunday, but he eluded the dragnet. A graduate in computer science from IIT-Bombay had shifted to Delhi for pursuing research at the Centre for Historical Studies at the JNU.

According to Jehanabad Superintendent of Police Manish Kumar, Sharjeel was arrested in the afternoon from a place close to his ancestral house, hours after his younger brother Muzzamil Imam was picked up for questioning and grilled by police. The officer did not disclose further details though unconfirmed reports said that Sharjeel, who had arrived in his native district the previous night, was hiding in a mosque to which he was taken by a close relative. However, Sharjeel claimed that he had surrendered before the police.

“I surrendered to the Delhi Police at 3 pm. I am willing to cooperate with the investigation. I have full faith in due process of law. My safety and security are now in the hand of Delhi Police. Let peace prevail,” he tweeted.

An FIR was registered against Sharjeel by the Delhi Police on January 25 under IPC sections 124 A (sedition) and 153 A (promoting or attempting to promote disharmony or feelings of enmity on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, caste or community or any other ground whatsoever).

“Two videos came to light, one was of December 13 at Jamia Millia Islamia and other was of January 16 at AMU, where it was noticed that Sharjeel had delivered very inflammatory speeches in opposition to the CAA and the NRC,” Deputy Commissioner of Police Rajesh Deo said in Delhi.

During investigation, police said they saw Sharjeel in a video attending an anti-CAA rally in Bihar on January 25.

“The Crime Branch team was sent to Bihar on the same day. They were in touch with Patna and Jehanabad Police and were continuously conducting raids.

The SIT which is investigating three cases related to clashes on December 13 and December 15 in Delhi will analyse if his speeches had played any role in inciting the violence, the police said.

Police had raided several places including Imam’s ancestral home on Sunday but he evaded the dragnet.

Imam’s remarks have been cited by the BJP to target anti-CAA protesters and the parties backing them.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday said Imam’s speech was “more dangerous” than that of former JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar. “See his statement. Have you seen the video of (the speech of) Sharjeel?It is more dangerous than Kanhaiya Kumar’s statement,” he said.

“He (Sharjeel) is talking about cutting off the Chicken’s Neck to sever Assam from India. Even seven generations would not be able to do that,” Shah said at an event in Raipur, Chhattisgarh. The Chicken’s Neck is a narrow stretch of land of about 22 km in West Bengal that connects the northeastern states to the rest of India, with Nepal and Bangladesh lying on either side of the corridor.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said the arrested student activist “ought to have an understanding of the country’s Constitution and the law... If anybody talks about India’s disintegration, who is going to accept this”.

Kumar also stressed that people like Sharjeel were “exceptions” and did not represent “views held by a large section of people”. The Chief Minister said Bihar police, which had been conducting raids at Imam’s house and questioning his family members prior to his arrest on Tuesday, had helped the Delhi Police.

In the video, Imam was heard saying: “If five lakh people are organised, we can cut off the northeast and India permanently. If not, at least for a month or half a month. Throw as much ‘mawad’ (variously described as pus or rubbish) on rail tracks and roads that it takes the Air Force one month to clear it.

“Cutting off Assam (from India) is our responsibility, only then they (the government) will listen to us. We know the condition of Muslims in Assam....They are being put into detention camps.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sharjeel-held-in-jehanabad-2020-01-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sharjeel-held-in-jehanabad.html
243,29-1-20,"Shah, Kejriwal slug it out over Delhi schools","HM posts videos, calls schools’ condition miserable; CM says Shah’s all videos fake

After Union Home Minister Amit Shah posted videos on social media, saying eight BJP MPs visited schools of the Delhi Government on Monday and found them in the “miserable” condition, AAP national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia refuted the claim and termed all the videos as “fake”.

Showing the video of the same schools, Sisodia said the BJP MPs made video of old buildings of schools to mislead people. He showed the video of the gate of the school tweeted by BJP MP Gautam Gambhir on which a public notice was pasted which reads that the school is shifted to another building in October 2019.

“All the children have been shifted to another school. The demolition of old building was halted following the direction of the EC,” he said.

Sisodia said that BJP MP Parvesh Varma tweeted a video of the old building of a school in Matiala, hiding the nearby new building. “Some rooms in the old building are still being used. Varma only filmed the old building.

Sisodia played a video of school building in which high quality desks, fans, green boards, etc, are visible. “There is a municipal school right opposite it which is full of water. Children are forced to study sitting on a carpet without desk. While there is desk for every child in our schools,” he added.

Accusing BJP MP Hansraj Hans of threatening the estate manager of a school at Mangolpuri and forcing him to open the school gate at night to capture on camera a room without desk, Sisodia said the MP may not know that every school has a multi-purpose room where children practise music and arts.

Referring to another school visited by another BJP MP, Sisodia said, “This old building of the school is situated in Prem Nagar and a demolition order issued on October 10, 2019. It was delayed only due to the elections.”

Kejriwal invited Shah to visit Government schools once again with him and witness the transformation of the same. “Shah ji may hate us and the AAP but it does not mean he should insult the 16 lakh children, 32 lakh parents and 65,000 teachers of Delhi by lying,” said Kejriwal.

Kejriwal said the Delhi’s Government schools were in a very bad condition when we took over five years ago, but today the schools are being discussed across the world.

“All the parties had spoiled Delhi’s education system in the last 70 years. The entire nation is proud of revolution in Delhi’s education system. Parents are proud of their children and teachers. I felt very sad when Shah ji questioned and mocked the education system of government schools in Delhi,” he said.

Talking about achievement of its schools, the CM said, “Last year, UP had a 70 per cent result in Class XII while the figure was 96 per cent in schools run by the Delhi Government. “Our children and teachers have worked hard day and night. 450 children have been admitted to IIT JEE”.

“The Delhi Government has 1,024 schools but they (BJP MPs) found problems only in 8 schools. I want to congratulate all the children of Delhi. Congratulations to the parents and teachers that you have passed such a difficult exam,” he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shah--kejriwal-slug-it-out-over-delhi-schools-2020-01-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/shah--kejriwal-slug-it-out-over-delhi-schools.html
244,29-1-20,"They’ll rape, kill women, Parvesh sullies protesters","Shaheen Bagh’s anti-CAA protesters have taken a centre stage in the BJP’s Assembly poll campaign. The latest in the list of leaders to raise the Shaheen Bagh issue is BJP MP Parvesh Verma.

His Tuesday statement that anti-CAA Shaheen Bagh protesters “will enter your homes to rape and kill women” provoked Opposition outrage. The Delhi Chief Electoral Officer submitted a report on Verma’s remarks to the Election Commission.

Verma, who is an MP from the West Delhi, asserted in an election rally on Monday that the Shaheen Bagh protest site will be cleared in an hour on February 11 if his party comes to power. He also raised the spectre of the repeat of ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Pandits in Delhi.

“What happened in Kashmir with Kashmiri Pandits could happen in Delhi also. Lakhs of people gather at Shaheen Bagh, they could enter houses rape and kill your sisters and daughters. The people need to decide now,” Verma told PTI, controversial comments that attracted widespread attention.

He also told media persons that there should be a probe into who is instigating people to protest against the CAA despite repeated clarifications by the Government that no Indian would lose citizenship due to the amended law.

In an election rally on the same day, Union Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur egged on the crowd to raise an incendiary slogan — “shoot the traitors” — after he lashed out at anti-CAA protesters. The EC has issued a show-cause notice to Thakur.

Taking an objection over Verma and Thakur’s remarks, Delhi Congress president Subhash Chopra and his party colleague Ajay Maken filed complaints with the Election Commission and urged it to ban the BJP leaders for making “provocative statements to incite communal violence”.

The Delhi Minorities Commission (DMC) also lodged a complaint with the Delhi CEO against BJP leaders including Union Home minister Amit Shah, Thakur and Verma, alleging them of making “provocative” statements.

Thakur has been asked by the EC to respond to the notice before 12 noon on January 30 (Thursday), “failing which the Commission shall take a decision without any reference to you”.

In it show cause notice, the EC referred to Section 123 of the Representation of the People Act, dealing with attempt to promote enmity or hatred between different classes of the citizens on the grounds of religion, race, caste, community or language.

Controversial remarks by another BJP leader Kapil Mishra on Shaheen Bagh last week had led to the EC banning him from campaigning for 48 hours.

Verma said Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia had supported Shaheen Bagh protesters and it was now time for the people of the national capital to decide who they want to vote for on February 8.

Addressing an election rally in Janakpuri on Monday in the presence of Shah, Verma spoke of vacating the Shaheen Bagh protest site on the night of February 11. He also reiterated that 40 mosques, graveyards and ‘mazars’ illegally constructed on government land in his constituency would be cleared if the BJP wins the elections.

Verma made the same statement at a press conference earlier this month, but put the figure of the illegal constructions at around 50. Following this remarks, the Delhi Chief Electoral Officer sent a report to the Election Commission on Verma’s “provocative statements”.

Sources in the poll panel, the EC, had examined the reports sent by the Delhi CEO Office and are of the view that the show cause notice should also be issued to Verma.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/they---ll-rape--kill-women--parvesh-sullies-protesters-2020-01-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/they---ll-rape--kill-women--parvesh-sullies-protesters.html

The Delhi Police sources later identified the man as Mohammad Luqmaan, a local property dealer. Luqmaan had gone to the protest site and requested agitators to lift road blockade leading to spat.

A video clip of the alleged incident has gone viral in which a man with a pistol can be seen being overpowered by protesters. The man was later handed over to the police. A senior official said they have not received any complaint regarding the incident and the man had a licensed gun.

Posting about the 3 pm incident, Shaheen Bagh protesters tweeted at 6 pm, “Urgent appeal from Shaheen Bagh: Armed anti-social elements have entered the protest area. We fear that more right-wing groups could enter and launch an attack. We appeal to all to join the protest, strengthen our numbers and prevent any violence. Infiltrators have been caught and neutralised.”

One of the protesters Syed Taseer Ahmed said a local, who claimed to have links with a political party, climbed up the stage and threatened people to end the agitation.

Police said they will identify the person and will call him for the interrogation. “We will ask him about the source of the weapon. If needed, appropriate actions will be taken after the interrogation,” a senior police officer said.

The protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act at Shaheen Bagh, primarily led by women, has been going on since December 15, causing hardship to daily commuters, local residents and businessmen.

Several efforts have been made to convince protesters to call off their protest and lift road blockade. Earlier in the day also some locals reached the spot to get the road cleared. Their efforts were met with resistance as protesters shouted “go back” slogans.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/man-with-pistol-enters-shaheen-bagh--handed-over-to-police.html
246,29-1-20,"Hindu girl’s kidnap, conversion in Pak: India seeks action","Against the backdrop of reports of the abduction of a 24-year-old Hindu woman from her wedding venue in Sindh in Pakistan, India on Tuesday summoned a senior official of the Pakistan High Commission here and served a strong demarche. India also asked Pakistan to investigate the matter and take urgent action to provide security to its citizens, including the minority Hindu community.

Giving this stern message, New Delhi asked Islamabad to take immediate measures to expeditiously bring the perpetrators of such despicable and heinous acts to justice.

“India summoned a senior official from the Pakistan High Commission and made a strong demarche against abduction of a girl from Hindu minority from her marriage ceremony on January 25, with the help of local police in Hala city of Sindh province,” an official source said. India also issued a demarche regarding the desecration of Mata Rani Bhatiyani temple in Tharparkar, Sindh, on January 26.

Reports said the woman was abducted midway through her marriage ceremony at Hala city in Sindh province two days ago.

The woman was reportedly abducted by residents with the help of local police personnel on Saturday. According to sources, she had already been married off to a Pakistani man by the time her family members managed to lodge a complaint.

Condemning the incident, the Government asked the Pakistan Government to investigate the matter and “act with urgency” to bring the perpetrators to justice. It also said the Imran Khan Government was duty bound to ensure that the country’s minorities, which includes the Hindu community, are protected and provided for.

The All Pakistan Hindu Council said the woman, Bharti Bai, was abducted from her wedding by a gang of armed men and married off to one Shahruk Gul after being forcibly converted to Islam. However, the latter has posted documents on the social media with the claim that she had changed her faith in December and adopted the name “Bushra”.

Hindus, who comprise approximately two per cent of Pakistan’s population, are mainly concentrated in Sindh province. Earlier this month, a 15-year-old Hindu girl was allegedly abducted from Jacobabad district in Sindh and forcibly converted to Islam before being married off to a Muslim man. Two other abductions were also reported from a village in Sindh province on January 14.

India also lodged a separate protest with the diplomat regarding the desecration of the Mata Rani Bhatiyani temple in Sindh province’s Tharparkar district on Sunday.

According to the police, four suspects entered the temple located in Chachro area early that morning and vandalised the idols and religious texts kept inside. The local station house officer called it a “unique incident”, claiming that Hindus and Muslims in the area have co-existed in harmony for decades.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hindu-girl---s-kidnap--conversion-in-pak--india-seeks-action-2020-01-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/hindu-girl---s-kidnap--conversion-in-pak--india-seeks-action.html
247,29-1-20,‘Phoolan Devi’ of Unnao does a Chhapaak on prurient stalker,"Fed up with being stalked and subjected to lewd advances, an irate girl threw acid on a youth at a shop in Gonamau village of Maurawa police station area of Unnao late on Monday night.

After the incident, additional force was deployed in the area as a precautionary measure as the victim and the stalker belong to different religions. As per police, the 24-year-old suffered 50 per cent burns and was admitted to hospital where his condition was said to be critical with burn injuries on his nape, back, chest and left shoulder.

He was later referred to a Lucknow hospital. The youth and the girl are followers of different religions, which restricted the police from acting against the girl in question.

As per reports, Rohit Kumar Yadav (24) was in his dairy at Bhawaniganj on Monday night when the girl threw acid on him. The youth raised an alarm but the girl had fled the scene by then.

Later, locals said the girl, seen waiting since afternoon and late in the night, entered the dairy and attacked the youth. On being informed by locals, the police rushed to the spot and admitted the victim to a hospital in Unnao.

Later, the police detained the girl and during interrogation, it came to the fore that Rohit was in love with the girl but his feelings were not reciprocated.

“Prima facie, it is a case of one-sided love as the girl was not interested in youth’s overtures but he reportedly stalked her. Till now, no complaint has been lodged in this connection. If a complaint is lodged, the accused girl will be arrested,” Maurawan SHO Rajendra Rajawat said.

As per National Crime Records Bureau’s (NRCB) latest report released in January, UP was witness to 40 cases of acid attacks, mostly on women, and was placed after West Bengal, which recorded the highest number of attacks (50).

Earlier this month, the Lucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court had sought a reply from the Centre and the UP Government on a plea pertaining to compliance of directions issued by the Supreme Court to regulate the sale and distribution of acid.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/---phoolan-devi----of-unnao-does-a-chhapaak-on-prurient-stalker.html

The official said that the USTR along with his team is expected in the second week of February.

They would hold discussions with the officials of the commerce ministry.

This visit of USTR assumes significance as Indian and US officials are engaged in talks to finalise dates for a possible visit by US President Donald Trump to India in the coming months.

The official said that the trade package if finalised could be announced during Trump's visit to India.

The two countries are negotiating a trade package to iron out issues and promote the two-way commerce.

India is demanding exemption from high duties imposed by the US on certain steel and aluminium products, resumption of export benefits to certain domestic products under their Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), greater market access for its products from sectors including agriculture, automobile, auto components and engineering.

On the other hand, the US wants greater market access for its farm and manufacturing products, dairy items and medical devices, and cut on import duties on some ICT products. The US has also raised concerns over high trade deficit with India.

""Amid dynamic political and policy challenges and growing economic focus on India, Amb Sandhu will be an experienced leader for Indian Embassy in US to navigate both the opportunities and challenges in the bilateral relationship,"" said Nisha Desai Biswal, the former Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia. She is currently president of US India Business Council.

""Congratulations to Ambassador Taranjit Sandhu on his appointment as the next Ambassador to the US. We look forward to a long and enduring partnership to take ties to greater heights,"" said US India Strategic and Partnership Forum.

Chicago-based eminent Indian-American Bharat Barai said Sandhu will represent India very well.

""He knows a lot about the community and we will have very good mutually rewarding working relationship,"" he said.

Barai had worked closely with Sandhu and the then Indian Ambassador S Jaishankar in organising the historic Madison Square Garden rally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014.

""As one of the lead organisers of the event, met him several times in DC and NY. We sat down together at his office and home on weekends to plan for what would be the biggest reception for a foreign dignitary on US soil!"" he said recollecting the days of 2014 before the Madison Square Garden.

""A US hand,"" tweeted Tanvi Madan from the Brookings Institute think-tank. In addition to being the Deputy Ambassador here, Sandhu was also served as First Secretary here during the crucial years of 1997-2000.

India has made a wonderful choice: Not only will the Indian embassy in US have a spectacular ambassador for India, he will be one of the stars of the DC diplomatic corps, said author Jonah Blank.

""Congratulations to Ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu on his appointment as Ambassador of India to the United States,"" US India Business Council said, adding that it looks forward to continued collaboration to advance the US-India commercial and strategic partnership.

""Great to see Taranjit Singh Sandhu returning to Washington as the new Indian Ambassador to the United States. Amidst active US-India trade discussions, lots of work to do together to build and improve US-India commercial relations,"" said Ryan Ong, from the National Association of Manufacturers.

Members of the American Sikh community recollected how Sandhu helped them resolve their long pending issues, including playing an important role in their delegation meeting the Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014. ""This meeting started a process of resolving our all pending issues,"" said Sukhpal Singh Dhanoa, a community activist who has been present in all the meetings that the Sikh community has had so far with the prime minister in the US.

Dhanoa said the Indian-American community here was planning a reception in honour of the new ambassador next month.

Sandhu is expected to take up his new assignment shortly. He would replace Harsh Vardhan Shringla who is now India's new Foreign Secretary. ""Looking forward to working with Amb Taranjit Singh Sandhu in taking forward our Strategic Partnership with the United States of America,"" tweeted India's Deputy Ambassador to the US Amit Kumar.

""Congratulations and Welcome our Ambassador of India to the United States of America. Hon.

259,29-1-20,Rajinikanth was not injured during shoot: Bear Grylls,"Tamil Superstar Rajinikanth was not injured during the shooting of Discovery channel's new series 'Into The Wild with Bear Grylls', said the show host in a social media post on Wednesday.

""Please and no he (Rajinikanth) wasn't injured. He was brave, determined and never gave up,"" said Grylls putting the injury speculation to rest.

Late on Tuesday, an IANS report confirmed that Rajinikanth was not injured during the shooting of 'Into The Wild with Bear Grylls' in the Bandipur Tiger Reserve.

T. Balachandra, director of the tiger reserve and conservator of forests dismissed the news of Rajinikanth's injury as fake news.

""It is all false (injury speculation). As per the screenplay, there was a shot in which Rajinikanth had to fall, so while getting down from the rope, he just fell down and everybody rushed. It was all in the screenplay,"" Balachandra told IANS on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, Discovery India spokesperson confirmed to IANS that Rajinikanth was not injured.

""The shoot went on schedule and as per plan. It went fine. There were rumours being spread,"" said Discovery India spokesperson about Rajinikanth injury speculation.

In the new Discovery series, Rajinikanth has appealed for water conservation on a war footing as he marks his TV debut after 43 years of cinema via Discovery channel's 'Into The Wild with Bear Grylls' programme.

""This war (water conserving) has to be led at all levels including government, community as well as on the individual front. I believe this show on Discovery is a perfect platform to take the message of conserving water to every home across the country,"" said the Thalaiva in a statement.

Rajinikanth said every Indian needs to come forward and contribute to water conservation.

On Tuesday, Rajinikant made television acting debut on Discovery channel's new format series 'Into The Wild with Bear Grylls', after 43 years of cinema, Discovery said in a statement on Wednesday.

""I agreed to finally make my debut on TV after more than four decades of cinema,"" said Rajinikanth about shooting for 'Into The Wild with Bear Grylls'.

In August 2019, Grylls had hosted Prime Minister Modi in the Man vs Wild show, which was shot at the Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand in February last year.

Other international icons who featured in the highly popular show include United States President Donald Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, Titanic star Kate Winslet, Tennis virtuoso Roger Federer and Hollywood great Julia Roberts and others.

""Into The Wild is a truly unique show, at one level it offers adrenaline pumping action, while at another, the show lends itself beautifully to driving a specific purpose for the larger good of society,"" said Rajinikanth.

The Southern star said he readily accepted to act in the new series when officials from Discovery channel approached him, finally marking his TV debut.

Kavithalayaa, a production house founded by Rajinikanth's guru K. Balachander also played a significant role in the new series, the actor said without elaborating.

""Bear Grylls has tested the survival skills of multiple celebrity guests, pushing them to their limits; I look forward to the survival challenge in the mesmerizing wilderness of India,"" said Rajinikanth about the popular host who showcases survival strategies in extreme challenging conditions in the most remote locations around the world.

Also focusing on water conservation in the new programme, Megha Tata, managing director, Discovery, South Asia said the channel wanted to add a layer of purpose with each episode of the newly commissioned series 'Into The Wild with Bear Grylls'.

""Last year, the show featuring Modi, generated much desired attention on conservation of wildlife; we are confident that the forthcoming episode featuring Rajinikanth will sensitize each one of us about conservation of water,"" Tata said.

Grylls heaped praise on Rajinikanth, saying that the actor is a phenomenon who has captivated audiences across the world with his work both on screen and off screen.

""Our team is all very excited to work closely with Thalaiva! He has always shown such energy and flair in all he does and he will need that courage and determination again on our journey into the beautiful wilds of India,"" said Grylls, throwing the challenge to the veteran actor.

262,29-1-20,Govt offers States imported onions at 80% discount,"At the peak of onion crisis, the Centre imported 33,500 tonnes onions at around Rs 50 per kg. Now it has decided to offer to the States the same “tasteless” and “watery” onions at Rs 10-15 per kg.

The Ministry of Consumer Affairs on Tuesday directed National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) to sell these onions in the open market across the country to dispose off huge stock imported from Turkey and Egypt.

Presently, 33,500 tonnes unsold imported onions are lying in containers at Mumbai port as there are no takers due to its size, taste and higher costs. Besides, the Government may lift ban on exports on onions by February-end after softening its prices in the domestic market.

Sources in the Ministry said that the Ministry will provide onions at cheaper rate (between Rs 10 and 15 per kg) to States to ease the supply in the domestic market and sell its huge stock of onion imported from Turkey and Egypt.

“The Ministry has conveyed the State Governments that imported onions will be at cheaper rates, much below the landed cost. These are good quality onions, good in taste and bigger in size,” sources added.

According to sources, the Ministry has urged the BJP-ruled States — Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Karnataka — to buy onions at lower prices as soon as possible as the imported onions are susceptible to moisture if kept outside a controlled environment.

According to sources, 250 refrigerated containers with about 7,000 tonnes of imported onions rotting and lying idle for about a month now at Mumbai port and importers are in no hurry to clear their consignments as the landed cost of onions is way above the local market costs.

The Government’s original plan was to sell imported onions at an average of Rs 49-55 per kg on a no-profit-no-loss basis. But there are virtually no takers for the imported onions as they are larger in size, nearly four times the size of onions from Nashik, but significantly less pungent and taste are different. As per the Department of Consumer Affairs data, Maharashtra, Assam, Haryana, Karnataka and Odisha have withdrawn their demand of 10,000 metric tonnes (MT), 3,000 MT, 3,480 MT, 250 MT and 100 MT of imported onion, respectively.

“The Modi Government has also approached Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka to sell these onions at “no profit no loss” basis but they have shown no interest,” said officials of Ministry of Food and Consumer Affairs.

The bulb now sells for Rs 23-30 /kg in the wholesale market while it is around Rs 50-60 per kg depending upon quality and locality from the peak of Rs 160 per kg last month. Fresh onion is available from January to May. The arrival of onions has improved in the past one week and shortfall has reduced from 26 per cent to 20 per cent in the mandis.

Retail onion prices had skyrocketed across the country due to supply disruption from flood-affected growing States like Maharashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh.

In September 2019, the Government banned the export of onions to increase availability of the commodity in the domestic market and contain rising prices. The Government had also imposed stock limits on traders.

Onion production is estimated to have declined by around 25 per cent in the Kharif and late Kharif seasons of 2019-20 crop year compared to the previous year due to late monsoon and then excess rains in the major producing States.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/govt-offers-states-imported-onions-at-80--discount-2020-01-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/govt-offers-states-imported-onions-at-80--discount.html
263,29-1-20,Coronavirus: India among top 30 high risk countries,"Researchers have identified cities and provinces within China, and cities and countries worldwide, which are at high risk from the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The most 'at risk' countries or regions worldwide are Thailand (1), Japan (2) and Hong Kong (3). The US is placed 6th on the list, Australia 10th, the UK 17th and India 23rd, the study said.

A report by the University of Southampton's WorldPop team has found Bangkok is currently the city most at risk from a global spread of the virus -- based on the number of air travellers predicted to arrive there from the worst affected cities in mainland China.

Hong Kong is second on the list, followed by Taipei (Taiwan) and China. Sydney (12), New York (16) and London (19) are among the 30 other major international cities ranked in the research.

""The spread of the new coronavirus is a fast moving situation and we are closely monitoring the epidemic in order to provide further up-to-date analysis on the likely spread, including the effectiveness of the transport lockdown in Chinese cities and transmission by people returning from the Lunar New Year holiday, which has been extended to February 2,"" said lead report author Shengjie Lai of the University of Southampton in the UK.

According to the report published in WorldPop, within China, the cities of Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Chongqing are all identified as high-risk by the researchers, along with the Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Zhejiang, Sichuan and Henan.

The team at WorldPop used anonymised mobile phone and IP address data (2013-15), along with international air travel data (2018) to understand typical patterns of movement of people within China, and worldwide, during the annual 40-day Lunar New Year celebrations (including the seven day public holiday from January 24 - 30).

From this, they identified 18 Chinese cities (including Wuhan) at high-risk from the new coronavirus and established the volume of air passengers likely to be travelling from these cities to global destinations (over a three month period).

The team was then able to rank the top 30 most at-risk countries and cities around the world.

The researchers acknowledge that their analysis is based on 'non-outbreak' travel patterns, but highlight that a high proportion of people travelled with symptoms at an early stage of the outbreak, before restrictions were put in place.

In fact, travel cordons are likely to have only coincided with the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving Wuhan for the holiday period.

According to Wuhan authorities, it is likely more than five million people had already left the city.

As of Wednesday, the toll due to the novel coronavirus increased to 132, with 5,974 confirmed cases.

""By mapping these trends and identifying high-risk areas, we can help inform public health interventions, such as screenings and healthcare preparedness,"" said Andrew Tatem, Director of WorldPop and professor at the University of Southampton.

264,29-1-20,Why women should avoid drinking during pregnancy,"Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can lead to low birth weight and poor cognitive function, according to a new research.

For the findings, published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, researchers from the University of Bristol investigated the impact alcohol consumption during pregnancy can have on a child.

The research team assessed 23 published studies on drinking during pregnancy and found evidence that consuming alcohol could lead to lower birth weight and poorer cognitive functioning.

""The body of evidence for the harm that alcohol can do to children before they are born is growing, and our review is the first to look at the full range of studies on the issue,"" said study lead author Luisa Zuccolo from in the UK.

""Our work confirms the current scientific consensus: that consuming alcohol during pregnancy can affect one's child's cognitive abilities later in life, including their education. It might also lead to lower birth weight,"" Zuccolo added.

To study the effects of drinking alcohol during pregnancy, the researchers funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) combined results from very different study designs for the first time.

Methods included traditional studies such as randomised controlled trials, alongside alternative strategies such as comparing children in the same families whose mothers cut down or increased their alcohol use between pregnancies, and a genetic marker-based approach, 'Mendelian randomisation'.

Previously, research on this topic has been through 'observational' studies, where participants are already exposed to a risk factor and researchers do not try to change who is or isn't exposed.

All the studies, included in the review, tried to compare with like groups of people, who were only different in terms of exposure to alcohol during pregnancy.

This is as close as it gets to what would be achieved in an experiment, the researchers said.

While the review was comprehensive it was limited in its ability to establish how much alcohol leads to these negative outcomes.

However, the researchers concluded that women should continue to be advised to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/why-women-should-avoid-drinking-during-pregnancy-2020-01-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/why-women-should-avoid-drinking-during-pregnancy.html
265,29-1-20,Pompeo takes on growing rift with Brexit Britain,"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visits London on Wednesday to salvage a post-Brexit alliance with an old friend whose defiance on China and Iran underscores Washington's diplomatic isolation.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been touting the prospects of a big new trade deal with the United States that can fill the void of Britain's departure from the European Union on Friday.

But Pompeo's meetings with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Johnson on Wednesday and Thursday threatens to become a damage limitation exercise for the ""special relationship"".

Pompeo had been doing his best to convince Johnson that allowing China's Huawei tech giant to help build Britain's next-generation 5G network introduced a long-term security threat.

Britain approved a limited but still important role for Huawei on Tuesday.

""The United States is disappointed by the UK's decision,"" a senior administration official said in a terse statement.

And Johnson had been pushing Washington to send back the wife of a US diplomat who is using the cover of diplomatic immunity to avoid prosecution over the death of a teenager in a road accident in England last August.

The United States rejected Anne Sacoolas's extradition to Britain last week.

""We feel this amounts to a denial of justice,"" Raab said in response. ""The UK would have acted differently if this had been a UK diplomat serving in the US.""

Disagreements about Iran and a US prosecutor's complaint that Prince Andrew was stonewalling an FBI investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein only add to the layers of tensions.

Johnson might now simply be hoping ""there are no precipitous statements from the US saying that's it, this love affair is at an end"", said Ian Bond of London's Centre for European Reform.

Bond pointed out that US officials had repeatedly warned how Huawei's inclusion in Britain's 5G rollout could force Washington to stop sharing intelligence with London.

""It would probably be safe to say that the British have not taken those (threats) very seriously and now is the moment we will find out whether they should have taken them more seriously or not,"" Bond told AFP.

Johnson may have got a sense of what comes next in a phone call with US President Donald Trump that followed his national security team's final decision on Huawei.

Downing Street said Johnson ""underlined the importance of like-minded countries working together to diversify the market and break the dominance of a small number of companies"".

Britain will cap Huawei's share of the 5G market to about a third in a bid to create space for new companies to step in.

But Johnson's decision still tests the limits of his well-publicised friendship with the mercurial White House chief.

Trump has been a big fan of both Johnson and Brexit. He dangled the promise of a new trade deal with Britain by as early as the end of the year.

Those talks can formally get underway once Brexit takes effect on Friday at 2300 GMT.

Any comprehensive agreement would need ratification in Congress and none is expected when most Americans' attention is focused on the heated presidential election campaign.

But a bare-bones deal that lays the foundation for future talks could work in both Trump and Johnson's political favour.

Some cyber security experts said Johnson's decision to keep Huawei away from the ""core"" elements of the 5G network should appease Washington's technical concerns.

""Essentially what they've done is limit Huawei from large parts of the network,"" said the Royal United Services Institute think-tank's cyber research chief James Sullivan.

""You would hope this would blow over in the next few weeks.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pompeo-takes-on-growing-rift-with-brexit-britain-2020-01-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/pompeo-takes-on-growing-rift-with-brexit-britain.html
266,29-1-20,US House passes bill on sanctions against Chinese officials for meddling in Dalai Lama's succession,"The US House of Representatives has passed a bill that authorises financial and travel sanctions against Chinese officials who interfere in the process of selecting the successor to the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet.

Introduced by Congressman James P McGovern, Chairman of the House Rules Committee and the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, the bill was passed by a overwhelming vote of 392 to 22.

The bill, if passed by the Senate and signed into law by the president, will also prohibit China from opening any new consulate in the US until Beijing allows Washington to open its diplomatic station in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital.

According to the bill, the succession or reincarnation of Tibetan Buddhist leaders, including a future 15th Dalai Lama, is an exclusively religious matter that should be decided solely by the Tibetan Buddhist community.

Under the draft legislation, Washington would freeze any American asset and ban US travel of Chinese officials if they are found to be involved in ""identifying or installing"" a Dalai Lama approved by Beijing.

Addressing the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the bill sends Beijing a clear signal that it will be held accountable for interfering in Tibet's religious and cultural affairs.

The proposed legislation, she said, makes it clear that ""Chinese officials who meddle in the process of recognising a new Dalai Lama will be subject to targeted sanctions, including those in the Global Magnitsky Act"".

The Global Magnitsky Act allows the US to sanction foreign government officials implicated in human rights abuses anywhere in the world.

Pelosi said the bill deploys America's diplomatic weight to encourage a genuine dialogue between Tibetan leaders and Beijing.

""It is unacceptable that the Chinese government still refuses to enter into a dialogue with Tibetan leaders...We are supporting the Tibetan people's right to religious freedom and genuine autonomy by formally establishing as US policy that the Tibetan Buddhist community has the exclusive right to choose its religious leaders, including a future 15th Dalai Lama,"" she said.

Though introduced as a stand-alone piece of legislation, the bill serves as an amendment to the Tibet Policy Act of 2002, which codified the US position of support for the Tibetan people.

""Our bill updates and strengthens the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 to address the challenges facing the Tibetan people. But perhaps as importantly, it reaffirms America's commitment to the idea that human rights matter. That we care about those who are oppressed, and we stand with those who are struggling for freedom,"" Congressman McGovern said on the House floor.

""It should be clear that we support a positive and productive US-China relationship, but it is essential that the human rights of all the people of China are respected by their government,"" he asserted.

Last year, the US Congress passed the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act, demanding that American journalists, diplomats and tourists be given the same freedom to travel to Tibet that Chinese officials have to travel freely in the US.

""The Dalai Lama should be commended for his decision to devolve political authority to elected leaders. The Tibetan exile community is also to be commended for adopting a system of self-governance with democratic institutions to choose their own leaders, including holding multiple 'free and fair' elections to select its Parliament and chief executive,"" McGovern said.

The bill also mandates the US State Department to begin collaborative and multinational efforts to protect the environment and water resources of the Tibetan Plateau.

""We are protecting Tibet's environmental and cultural rights: working with international governments and the business community to ensure the self-sufficiency of the Tibetan people and protect the environment and water resources on the Tibetan Plateau. It is really important to sustainability of our planet,"" Pelosi, a longtime advocate for Tibet, said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-house-passes-bill-on-sanctions-against-chinese-officials-for-meddling-in-dalai-lama-s-succession-2020-01-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/us-house-passes-bill-on-sanctions-against-chinese-officials-for-meddling-in-dalai-lama-s-succession.html
267,29-1-20,Brexit to be sealed with final Brussels vote,"Brexit Day is to be set in stone Wednesday when the European Parliament in Brussels casts a vote ratifying the terms of Britain's divorce deal from the EU.

The historic legislative act -- the last for the 72 remaining British MEPs who will leave afterwards -- will allow Brexit to officially take effect on Friday at 2300 GMT, midnight for most of continental Europe and 11:00 pm in Britain.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists that date will see Brexit ""done"". But the EU underlines that the next, thornier phase of the split -- working out a treaty to define the future relationship between the two sides -- is about to begin.

Those negotiations are to go to late this year. At the end of 2020, a transition period easing Britain out of EU rules and regulations will expire, unless extended by both sides -- something Johnson has ruled out.

The transition period, a standstill provision, means ordinary Britons and EU citizens will see little visible change, and indeed London will continue to contribute to the EU budget.

But from this weekend onward, Britain will be excluded from the EU's institutions and decision-making.

It will officially be what the bloc calls a ""third country"" -- a non-EU state. A close neighbour, and an important trade and security partner, but on the outside of Europe's single-market club, reduced to 27 nations and a combined population of 450 million.

""Brexit is a loss for us all,"" European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said after a regular EU ministers' meeting on Tuesday.

He said it was important for the EU ""to maintain our unity"" as it negotiates the future partnership with the UK.

The British minister for Europe attending the meeting, Christopher Pincher, expressed optimism on what that would yield. ""We're looking forward to a very different world and a very different relationship,"" he said.

The divorce deal, or ""withdrawal agreement"", to be ratified Wednesday, protects the rights of EU and British citizens currently residing in each other's territory, Britain's financial obligations, and a customs regime that will keep the UK territory of Northern Ireland largely under European rules.

Britain's Johnson and Queen Elizabeth II and Brussels' most senior officials signed off on the accord last week. Ratification by the European Parliament is a formality, albeit a necessary one under European law.

Pro-Brexit figures see Britain's departure as a liberation from an overweening Eurocracy.

Brexit Party MEPs, with leader Nigel Farage at the fore, plan to celebrate in Brussels on Wednesday, before heading to London to host Brexit parties on Friday.

But Johnson, conscious of UK divisions entrenched since the 2016 referendum that ushered in Brexit, is steering clear of a public display of triumphalism. He has dismissed a proposal to have London's Big Ben temporarily revived from a costly renovative hiatus to symbolically chime in the moment.

Although bolstered by a big parliamentary majority, he faces resentment from British ""remainers"", a resurgent independence push in anti-Brexit Scotland, and fears among UK businesses about what the loss of frictionless access to the EU's single market will mean for revenues and jobs.

Above all, he has to demonstrate the UK can navigate solo in a world increasingly roiled by geopolitical tussles between the three biggest players -- the US, the EU and China -- that are affecting policies on trade, technology, security guarantees and climate change.

Neither the US nor the EU look to be offering Britain an easy ride. Johnson riled Washington on Tuesday by approving plans to use technology from Chinese telecoms giant Huawei in its 5G networks, despite US warnings that it poses a data security threat.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was expected to hammer home his opposition to that in a visit to London on Wednesday -- a point that could raise obstacles to an offer to strike a US-UK trade deal.

And Brussels has signalled loud and clear that it intends to make demands for EU fishermen to operate in British waters a priority in its negotiations with the UK, linking it to London's hopes of securing financial services access to the EU.

The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, on Monday warned ""it is absolutely clear that there will be negative consequences"" from Brexit.

""Whatever agreement we reach on our future relationship, Brexit will always be a matter of damage limitation,"" he said in a speech in Belfast.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/brexit-to-be-sealed-with-final-brussels-vote-2020-01-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/brexit-to-be-sealed-with-final-brussels-vote.html
268,29-1-20,US troops injured in Iran missile strike rises to 50: Pentagon,"The number of US troops injured by an Iranian missile strike in Iraq this month has risen to 50, according to new figures released by the Pentagon on Tuesday.

The personnel have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (TBI), Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Campbell, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement.

The military had said on Friday that 34 troops were injured in the strike on the Ain al-Asad base in western Iraq on January 8.

President Donald Trump had initially said no Americans were hurt by the missiles, and Democrats later accused him of trying to downplay the injuries.

Iran fired on Iraqi bases housing US troops in retaliation for an American drone attack that killed Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad, raising fears of war.

Campbell said that of the 50, 31 were treated in Iraq and returned to duty while 18 were being evaluated in Germany. Another was transported to Kuwait and has already returned to duty, he said, adding that the numbers could still change.

At the time of the strike most of the 1,500 US soldiers at the base had been in bunkers, after advance warning from superiors.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-troops-injured-in-iran-missile-strike-rises-to-50--pentagon-2020-01-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/us-troops-injured-in-iran-missile-strike-rises-to-50--pentagon.html

Court records show that a Los Angeles judge on Tuesday finalised the divorce that ended the brief marriage of the 27-year-old American pop star and the 30-year-old Australian actor, reports billboard.com

The couple separated and Hemsworth filed for divorce in August, about eight months after he and Cyrus married.

Hemsworth and Cyrus have no children, and neither sought spousal support. Documents cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split.

In a statement announcing their separation, they said they were choosing to focus on themselves and their careers and would remain ""dedicated parents to all of their animals they share.""

Cyrus and Hemsworth spent sporadic stints as a couple for nearly a decade before they married in December 2018.

271,29-1-20,India beat NZ in Super Over to take unassailable 3-0 lead in T20 series,"India defeated New Zealand in the third T20 International via Super Over to take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series here on Wednesday.

India posted a competitive 179 for five at Seddon Park after being sent into bat. Opener Rohit Sharma top scored for India with a 65-run knock while skipper Virat Kohli contributed 38 runs in team's total.

Later, skipper Kane Williamson smashed a 48-ball 95 but New Zealand faltered in the final over to take the match into the Super Over.

Needing nine runs of the last over, New Zealand lost Williamson and Ross Taylor to finish at 179 for six and tie the match.

In the Super Over, New Zealand scored 17, a target which India overwhelmed in the final ball with Rohit smashing Tim Southee for two consecutive sixes.

The fourth T20 International between the two sides will be played on Friday in Wellington.

Brief Scores:

India: 179 for 5 in 20 overs. (R Sharma 65, V Kohli 38, KL Rahul 27; Hamish Bennett 3/54.

272,29-1-20,Rohit says winning run is 'good sign' ahead of T20 World Cup,"Vice-captain Rohit Sharma on Wednesday emphasised on India's recent winning streak in the shortest format, calling it a good sign heading into the T20 World Cup.

India claimed an unassailable 3-0 lead in the ongoing five-match T20I series against hosts New Zealand with victory here.

Rohit has forged two great opening partnerships for India with KL Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan. He said that the team management will decide which one comes to the fore later for the T20 World Cup.

""Whenever anyone's got an opportunity, they have made it count. Shikhar as well, when he played the last series against Sri Lanka, he got a crucial 50 and then KL has been in good form over the last 7-8 T20s, he's got probably 4 or 5 fifties,"" Rohit said.

""So it's a good sign for the team. That's how we look at it. It's important for most of our players to stay in good form and then what happens with the final XI and everything that will be only decided once all the players are available and the captain and management will sit together and identify who are the right guys to play that particular game. That's how I look at it.

""For me, I want everyone to stay in good form, which has happened through the series. It is a great sign for us moving forward in this particular format at least. I wish the next two games too we don't relax. We just want to keep the momentum going. It's a good sign,"" he opined.

India wouldn't have won the third T20 International without his two Super Over sixes but a modest Rohit credited Mohammed Shami for the victory.

Shami took two wickets in the final over to dismiss both Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor.

Rohit hit two sixes off the last two balls in the Super Over as India took an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series. Both teams were tied on 179 runs each after fifties from Rohit and Williamson cancelled each other.

""I think Mohammed Shami's last over was crucial, and actually that got us the victory. Not my two sixes. It was Shami's over where we defended nine runs. It's not easy with the dew,"" Rohit said at the post-match press conference.

The India vice captain added, ""The wicket settling in nicely and two set batsmen out there as well... One batsman was batting on 95 and their most experienced player was at the other end. Hats off to Shami to bowl that over and get us back into the game and into the Super Over.""

Last but not the least, Rohit opined that it was tough not to feel for New Zealand who have been on the wrong end of Super Over results for a while now.

""Kane Williamson played a solid innings. Of course their team will feel disappointed about how they could lose such a game. But we have to look at how we came back into the game.

""The last over that Shami bowled was very important for us and a positive sign because we could play a game like this in the World Cup. Then what do we do.

""We can't lose hope. We will need to stay strong, even if you need defend five runs, you have to show a positive attitude, and we showed that here,"" Rohit signed off.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rohit-says-winning-run-is--good-sign--ahead-of-t20-world-cup-2020-01-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/rohit-says-winning-run-is--good-sign--ahead-of-t20-world-cup.html

The 'Off-Facebook Activity' tool is now available to people on Facebook around the world.

""Other businesses send us information about your activity on their sites and we use that information to show you ads that are relevant to you. Now you can see a summary of that information and clear it from your account if you want to,"" Zuckerberg said in a statement on Tuesday.

""Off-Facebook Activity marks a new level of transparency and control,"" he added.

Over the next few weeks, Facebook will show nearly two billion people a prompt, encouraging them to review their privacy settings.

""The prompt will show up in your News Feed and direct you to the Privacy Checkup tool, which we recently updated,"" said Zuckerberg.

""This makes it even easier to adjust who can see your posts and profile information, strengthen your account security by turning on login alerts, and review the information you share with apps you've logged in with Facebook.""

The social networking giant also introduced alerts for third-party logins.

Facebook Login lets users sign in to other apps and services, like games and streaming platforms, using the Facebook account.

""To help you keep track of your activity, we rolled out Login Notifications earlier this month. These notifications alert you when you use Facebook Login to sign in to third-party apps to help you stay aware of how your account is being used and edit your settings,"" said Zuckerberg, adding that one of his main goals is to build much stronger privacy protections for everyone on Facebook.
