0,11-4-20,A disastrous Act,"The plans that were devised by the Centre under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, did not foresee such a huge calamity and the humanitarian crisis emerging out of it

The complete lockdown of the country within three-four hours of the announcement regarding it in a televised address by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the plight of migrant workers around the country, forced to trudge back to their hometowns, thousands of kilometres away, hungry, thirsty and tired, reflect that India was not prepared for the impending disaster. This is despite the fact that the danger had been looming over us since the outbreak of the Coronavirus in China months ago.

An overconfident Government had not thought it prudent to devise a plan for the efficient management of the pandemic that has brought developed countries, with better healthcare systems than ours, to their knees.

The Government was ill-prepared to handle a disaster, the likes of which this world has not seen after the 1918 Spanish fever which infected nearly 500 million people worldwide and killed an estimated 30-50 million.

Obviously, the plans that were devised by the Centre under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, did not foresee such a huge calamity and the humanitarian crisis emerging out of it. Disaster management concentrates on making arrangements to diminish the impact of a calamity. Failure to make such an arrangement could prompt large-scale human casualties, loss of income to the masses and losses to India Inc, which in turn, prove disastrous for the economy.

Hence, plans relating to disaster management should pursue the nature of disaster vis-a-vis its management. The Government mainly functions based on the enactments made by the legislature. Hence, all the programmes, conceived plans and guidelines would be within the framework of the legislations made in the said regard.

The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) decided to observe the ’90s as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR). It initiated a global campaign towards creating socio-economic strategies for countries during natural disasters. Now, due to the UNGA’s efforts, many countries around the world have disaster related legislations. Pursuant to the same, in 1999 the Indian Government, too, set up a High Powered Committee (HPC) on disaster management.

Thereafter, a series of catastrophic natural disasters such as the Gujarat earthquake in 2001 and the tsunami in 2004, led to the enactment of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. Though it was the first step in the right direction, the entire legislation was drafted with a myopic view. The definition of “disaster” under Section 2(d) of the Act defines disaster as a catastrophic, mishap, calamity or grave occurrence in any area, arising from natural or man-made causes or by accident/negligence which results in substantial loss of life or human suffering or damage to property or degradation of the environment and is of such nature or magnitude that it is beyond the coping capacity of the community of the affected area.

A reading of the aforesaid definition shows that the same has been drafted keeping in mind disasters such as tsunamis, cyclones, earthquakes, industrial or fire accidents and so on, vis-a-vis specified areas. It did not visualise a situation wherein a disaster may be caused because of cross-border viral contaminations spreading throughout the country. The use of the words “any area” in the definition of “disaster” is very confined. It relates to only a particular area within the country wherein such a natural disaster occurs. On the whole, the matter of public health has been unable to find any space in the legislation.

The Act also provides for establishment of a number of statutory bodies such as the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs), advisory committees, executive committees and sub-committees under the Government. The establishment of so many committees and authorities does not seem to have a strong logical foundation. There are such overlapping duties found among various authorities in the Act that they are bound to confuse people. Further, the coordination among these bodies appears to be very cumbersome.

Though Section 3 of the Act contemplates establishment of the NDMA with the Prime Minister as its Chairperson and other members, not exceeding nine, being nominated by him/her, no qualification has been specified for the members. This should have been done because it is an authority at the national level, dealing with an issue of national importance. In the context of the political scenario of our country, the appointments to the national authority can be strongly influenced by political motives, which defeats the whole purpose.

Section 6 of the Act contemplates the powers of the national authority and it is empowered to formulate policies, plans and guidelines in relation to disaster management. However, these would be in consonance with the definition of “disaster” contained in Section 2(d) of the Act, which is quite narrow.

Obviously the entire Act would be implemented in the backdrop of the definition of “disaster” contained in Section 2(d). Therefore, all the plans would be short-sighted, confined only to disasters of a particular nature which relate to particular areas.

Our lack of preparedness to meet a pandemic like the Coronavirus requires an amendment to the definition of “disaster” as contained in the Act, so as to enable the Government to formulate plans and policies in consonance with it.

At present, we are witnessing an exodus of migratory workers from the cities, deprivation of livelihood of daily-wage earners, break in supply chains, hardship in distribution of essential commodity to those who live Below the Poverty Line (BPL), hospital management/facilities and so on.

We have to devise plans in such a manner that they minimise the adverse effects of a disaster as enormous as the Coronavirus outbreak.

Anticipating a disaster is one aspect and post-disaster management is another. In order to anticipate a disaster and to formulate a policy, the definition also should include such disasters which may affect the whole country and not just be confined to the extent of those disasters which are limited to a specific area. If such an amendment is brought in, a suitable plan would be formulated by the competent authorities under the Act.

Section 42 of the Act empowered the Central Government to constitute a National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM), the main function of which is to develop, undertake research and documentation in relation to disaster management.

The NIDM also conducts programmes and formulates comprehensive human resource development plans covering all aspects of disaster management. But as stated earlier, the entire action would be directed against only those aspects which can be termed as a “disaster” in accordance with Section 2(d) of the Act.

Section 35 contemplates measures to be taken by the Government in relation to disaster management. The Central Government shall coordinate with all the Ministries, State Governments, the national and State authorities. Though Section 35 empowers the Central Government to take measures, in the light of the narrow definition of disaster, it would be very difficult to visualise a situation that has arisen right now.

No disaster can be ever dealt with effectively only through administrative set-up, alienating the community as a whole. But unfortunately, the Act entirely ignores this very important aspect. The Act is implemented entirely through the Government system.

Now the Government has to bring in a suitable amendment to the 2005 Act to effectively deal with such situations as presented by the Coronavirus pandemic. More particularly the definition of “disaster” under Section 2(d) has to be amended so as to bring into its fold calamities/disasters like the one which the country is facing now in order for the Government to be able to effectively handle the present calamity.

Unfortunately, the Disaster Management (Amendment) Bill, 2016 moved by Mullappally Ramachandran for the amendment to the Disaster Management Act, 2005 also does not contemplate any amendment to the definition of “disaster.” It only proposes an amendment to Section 11 and Section 35 which relate to preparation of plans and stipulating guidelines. But the same would be futile unless the definition is amended.

1,11-4-20,Still a big ‘Yes’ for the bank,"Between ‘yes’ and ‘no’, there is an untold story. There’s much more to the Yes Bank revival than meets the eye

Incredible but true! For years before it hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons all these weeks and came perilously close to being reduced to No Bank, Yes Bank stood tall and trusted for countless ordinary and not so ordinary account holders across India as a bank unlike any other: Cool, smart, savvy, professional, profitable and cheerfully at customers’ service 24x7. Coming as this high-sounding certificate does from a long-time Yes Bank account holder who actually had every reason to be fretting and fuming for days — yes, that’s me, with a lion’s share of my life’s savings eerily locked away inside its vaults until the moratorium clamped down on it by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on March 5 was lifted two weeks later — isn’t it a bit of an oddity ? Yes and no, as we’ll see. Like me, many customers’ journey with Yes Bank began after years of drudgery and misery that passed for banking in what now seems a medieval era. Opening an account at the Central Bank of India (founded 1911) was a Himalayan feat, accomplished after crossing numerous hurdles. To book a fixed deposit at the State Bank of India (SBI) — born in 1806 as the Bank of Calcutta before its reincarnation in 1955 as the SBI — you had to wait for hours in queues. Cashing a fixed deposit (FD) upon maturity at UCO Bank (circa 1943) was very like a striptease show as the FD receipt moved slowly, agonisingly, from one desk to another before bouncing back to you for want of a revenue stamp…. Arriving dramatically as it did in 2004 against this dismal backdrop, Yes Bank sounded too good to be true with its promise of internet banking, digital accounts, online deposits, balance alerts, round-the-clock helpline and, the cherry on the cake, highest interest rates.

Tempted but not quite trustful of such fancy talk, many chose to wait and watch before shifting their money to this Johnnie-come-lately who seemed straight from another planet. But when they did, they loved what they saw. Each fresh account, opened after multiple rounds of due diligence by officers visiting you to thoroughly verify and vet, came with a personalised chequebook, a global debit card and a warm letter from the CEO promising “a brand new experience in banking.” As customers discovered to their delight soon, a brand new experience it certainly was. In nine cases out of 10, an ordinary savings account got a “Yes First” upgrade with “zero balance” facility waiving the requirement for a minimum mandatory balance, a complimentary balance update by SMS (Short Message Service) first thing every morning, an e-mail alert after every transaction, any number of withdrawals from your account at any bank’s ATM (Automated Teller Machine) without a charge, unlimited electronic money transfers without a fee, instant transfer of FD proceeds to your savings account on maturity…. Yes, much before it became fashionable to gush about the “ease of business”, Yes Bank introduced India to the “ease of banking.”

It was this quantum leap in banking culture — rather than just lure of higher returns through higher interest rates — that drew many to Yes Bank. Other banks were quick to follow suit with different offers but these proved to be half-baked. The SBI, for instance, jacked up interest rates for senior citizens a wee bit but backtracked soon after. ICICI Bank came up with “Privilege Banking” add-ons but with riders: A minimum balance of Rs 10,000, with penalties for violations. Bandhan Bank brandished an international debit card but only for customers with balances above Rs 25,000. For many senior citizens looking to park their retirement corpus of Gratuity and Provident Fund (PF) — running generally into lakhs — the SBI had been the best bet for long with a surety of safe returns. As this captive clientele grew over the years, the SBI, under Arundhati Bhattacharya started lowering interest rates to shore up its profit margins. This drove many customers to ICICI Bank and Yes Bank. Soon ICICI under Chanda Kochhar, too, started reducing interest rates, pushing more and more accounts to Yes Bank. With Yes Bank maintaining its interest rates all along and upgrading services constantly to next levels, these customers stayed on and they were the ones who ironically got trapped in the nightmarish moratorium for two suspenseful weeks.

By all accounts the due diligence that went into the screening of these small fry didn’t extend to big bulls and their borrowings. Whether it was limitless greed for big bucks to bolster the bank’s coffers or no-holds-barred malfeasance for Big Boss’ personal ends that brought the bank to this sorry pass, will hopefully come to light after ongoing investigations into wide-ranging allegations of omission and commission.

Meanwhile, thanks to swift fire-fighting by the Government, the road ahead looks safe and clear for depositors, investors and other stakeholders. After years of poor oversight, the RBI eventually did well to come up with the Yes Bank revival package the way it did to put it back in business. But what now for Yes Bank 2.0? The SBI Chairman, Rajnish Kumar, put it best when asked if Yes Bank’s troubles dating back to founder Rana Kapoor’s days hadn’t damaged the brand. “We must clearly distinguish,” he reasoned, “Yes Bank is an entity; Rana Kapoor is an individual. If an individual has done something wrong, he will pay the price for that. Why should the enterprise suffer?” Yes, why indeed?

2,11-4-20,What ails scientific research in Pakistan?,"Federal Science Minister Fawad Chaudhry asked why Pakistani universities were not producing good research. It is a good question. But is he willing to listen to an answer?

On March 28, the Federal Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry posted a tweet in which he asked why Pakistani universities were silent when elsewhere in the world they were producing research to help governments address the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. A valid query. Even though most of the replies that this tweet received were from the usual trolls who, even in times like these are falling over each other to shout out inarticulate rants, his question received some sane replies too.

For example, a few respondents immediately asked how the Minister could criticise his country’s universities in this context when the Government that he is part of forked out millions of rupees to an already wealthy madrasa in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa? Then there were those who asked how much his Government invests in the research capabilities of the country’s universities.

These, too, are valid queries. But the problem is much deeper. While doing research for my fifth book in 2019, I came across a news item published in the June 1967 issue of the now defunct Pakistani English daily Morning News. The report was about a group of college students from Lahore, who had built a small car from scrap metal pieces. They had also built the engine of the car from scratch. In the very next edition of the same newspaper was an interview of another group of students, this time belonging to Karachi’s NED University of Engineering and Technology. They said they were excited about the manner in which the students from Lahore had built the car because they, too, were in the process of building something similar. It wasn’t a car but an unmanned rocket, which they planned to pitch to Pakistan’s “space programme.”

According to an essay in the February 2019 issue of the Swiss academic journal Environmental Science & Policy, Pakistan was one of the first 10 countries in the world to formulate a space programme. The programme was launched by the Ayub Khan regime in 1961. It was headed by the theoretical physicist Abdus Salam. The programme, however, ran into trouble due to economic and political instability from 1970 onwards.

Till the mid-1970s, the Government and students of science in Pakistan were genuinely driven by the urge to remove the country’s “Third World” tag with the aid of science. At least this is what one of the NED students interviewed by Morning News told the paper. In 1977 when I was just 10 years old, I remember a much older cousin of mine, who was studying biology at Karachi University. He told my parents that he and his team were working closely (through written correspondence) with the American epidemiologist Donald Henderson, to develop vaccines against viruses that were largely found in humid regions such as Pakistan. Henderson, as we later learned, was the man who had initiated a robust plan in 1968 to eradicate the deadly smallpox virus that had haunted the human race for centuries.

Even though an anti-smallpox vaccine had been developed in the UK in the 18th century, its more effective variations were still unavailable to most people. Due to Henderson’s efforts, backed by the World Health Organisation (WHO), by 1974, over 90 per cent of the world’s population had been vaccinated. In 1975, WHO declared that the virus had been completely eradicated. I was also pleasantly surprised to note that newspapers and children’s magazines, both English and Urdu, used to have pages dedicated to science. Some of these pages were, in fact, edited by scientists. PTV used to telecast a weekly show on the sciences hosted by the late educationist Laiq Ahmad. The show lasted from 1965 till 1977. Fast forward to today: On March 27 this year, while Twitter trends in most European countries were about possible vaccines against the elusive Coronavirus, the leading Twitter trend in Pakistan was #Dajjal. So what happened?

Even in the most scientifically-advanced societies, there are groups of people who consider science to be a conspiracy against their theological beliefs. But they hardly ever manage to enter and disrupt the focus of the scientific order in developed countries. But they did in Pakistan. The country’s once promising scientific order was invaded and then littered with pseudoscientific hogwash.

The outspoken Pakistani physicist Professor Pervez Hoodbhoy’s 1991 book Religious Orthodoxy and the Battle for Rationality demonstrates how this happened. He writes that the Government of Pakistan, during the reactionary General Zia dictatorship in the 1980s, pumped in millions of rupees to organise “Islamic science conferences” in which not-very-credible “scientists” from various Muslim countries spent days showcasing how energy could be derived from djinns and how one could “measure the velocity of heaven.” But Pakistan wasn’t the only country that let go of the universalist idea of science to create a nonsensical version of an “indigenous science.” The British-Pakistani author Ziauddin Sardar writes in his 2005 book Desperately Seeking Paradise that, till the late 1970s, Muslim societies were inspired by scientific breakthroughs in the West and also by seminal works in astronomy, chemistry, biology and physics of ancient Muslim scientists.

But from 1976, according to Sardar, the Saudi monarchy began to invest millions of petro-dollars in a different kind of so-called “Islamic science” that had nothing to do with the influential works of past Muslims.

The “Islamic science” that these petro-dollars pushed did not require a scientist to work hard in a lab to invent or discover things. Instead scientists were to spend all their time in “proving” that Muslims already knew everything because everything scientists create or discover was already mentioned in the Muslim sacred texts. But the fact is, this too was not an original idea. Hindu nationalists writers were first to claim that their sacred texts contained “scientific truths.” Mohan Roy’s Vedic Physics: Scientific Origin of Hinduism is one example. This emerged long before some Muslims got into the same meaningless act.

My cousin gave up his research in the early 1980s due to a lack of support from the Government and the university. In 1980, he was once asked by a group of younger students to “not waste time trying to discover something which was already mentioned in the holy book.”

He responded by saying that in the book, the Almighty encourages people to discover the mysteries of His creation and that these could only be discovered through scientific research.

The reaction to his response couldn’t have been good, because the very next year he migrated to Denmark.

3,11-4-20,Theology over pathology?,"An ill-advised section of Muslims is disregarding precautionary measures against Corona, thus imperiling safety. There’s history but no reason why that view should guide their choice

Does it seem like a déjà vu? In December 1849, cholera was detected in Beylik of Tunis (now Tunisia). Ahmad I ibn Mustafa (1805-55), a progressive ruler, left the capital city of Tunis terrified. He moved to a gardened villa of the then Prime Minister Mustapha Khaznadar in Carthage along with a personal retinue and armed guards. From his new camp office, he deployed Italian doctors from nizam jadid (new European-style Army of Tunisia) for treatment in temporary hospitals set up in the barracks. Daily statistics of the infection, deaths and recovery were compiled, which along with instructions of hygiene, were printed in Italian and Arabic language. These were distributed in the mosques and churches for the edification of the people.

Then came the inflection point during the Mawlid al-nabi (the Prophet’s Birthday), which fell on January 27, 1850. Ahmad I ibn Mustafa was in dilemma regarding the celebratory congregations and the advisability of his joining them in view of the outbreak. Ultimately, he sent a communiqué, ordering the celebrations to be held as usual and for oil to be sent to the minarets. The event was held; canons fired; and two verses of the Quran were read to “comfort the people in times of difficulty.”

Within days, the epidemic was raging the Muslim quarters, and before long, the entire city of Tunis was in the grip of cholera. Muhammed Sharif, a notable figure of Tunis, passed away on February 6, which was followed by the death of several of his family members and those who had come in contact with him. This incident has been described by Nancy Elizabeth Gallagher in her insightful book, Medicine and power in Tunisia, 1780-1900 (1983, CUP).

The worst was yet to come. The epidemic polarised public opinion in Tunis. Many blamed the European doctors, by extension, their line of treatment. Several doctors were abused and manhandled. Ahmad I ibn Mustafa, advised by his personal Italian physician, Abraham Lumbroso, put himself in medical isolation. His extreme measures annoyed some of his Ministers. One day, a Group of Ministers politely told him that precaution by means of quarantine was nowhere to be found in Islam and is an invention of Christendom, whose knowledge of diseases and medicine is inferior to Islam.

The debate over the propriety of quarantine took a theological turn. Prime Minister Khaznadar, a critic of European medicine, condemned the quarantine and declared that Muslims, who died of cholera, were martyrs. Bin Dayaf, Ahmad I ibn Mustafa’s personal secretary, opined that self-preservation by quarantine was legal and no religious text disapproved of it. The two reached out to a certain cleric. Tayyib Al-Riyahi, son and expected successor Ibrahim al-Riyahi, Imam of Great Mosque of Tunis, issued a fatwa that victims of cholera were martyrs by citing the Hadith of Muwatta (the Maliki law book) because they died of internal wounds. Then Khazandar and Bin Dayaf went to Mufti Muhammed bin Salama, who ruled that victims of cholera were not martyrs. At this point, Bin Dayaf ended his discussion by observing that whatever be the reality, even “alims (scholars of Islam) die of cholera.”

Combating communicable diseases has often been vitiated by theological considerations and confrontations in the past. It took almost four centuries for the Ottoman Empire to have a quarantine policy. Sultan Mahmud II, advised by his Austrian doctor, Anton Lagos, and impressed by the treatise of Hamdan Bin El-Mehrum Osman Hoca, finally adopted quarantine as a measure to combat plague in 1838 even as the disease had bedevilled the Ottoman Empire at least since the mid-15th century. No doubt, had there been men like Idris-i Bitlisi, an Ottoman statesman, and Isameddin Ahmed bin Mustafa Tasköprüzade, a prominent judge way back in the 16th century who advocated a rational approach, there would be precedence. There were prominent medical doctors like Osman bin Suleyman Penah (d.1817) in the reign of Selim III, too. They advocated that quarantine and precautions against plague and epidemic would signify betrayal of Muslim’s trust in divine fate (tevekkul).

Birsen Bulmus, in his eminently readable, Plague, Quarantines and the Geopolitics of the Ottoman Empire (2012), traces the history of health and medical policies against plague and allied epidemics in the Turkish reign. Bulmus exhibits how it was not only Muslim divines and physicians who doubted quarantines/precautions but in reality, whatever kills a Christian also kills a Muslim. Whatever cures a Hindu, cures a Muslim as well. Physiology is more egalitarian than theology.

The holy city of Mecca was affected by cholera in 1831, which recurred almost annually during the pilgrimage. Its invasion was particularly serious in 1865, when almost a third of the pilgrims reportedly perished. It was the most dominant issue at the International Sanitary Conference at Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1866. A six-member committee, comprising Arabs and Europeans, drew up a report to regulate the maritime traffic for Hajj pilgrimage in 1867.

Thus, if Saudi Arabia has now put Mecca and Medina under lockdown and is contemplating on deferring the annual Hajj scheduled for July 28-August 2 due to the COVID-19 outbreak, it is only because they know their history better. Mosques are likewise closed to congregations in India. The Ulema has appealed the Muslims to tender namaz at home, including on Friday.

However, the irresponsible behaviour of a section of the community in India is putting its collective safety against COVID-19 at great risk. The Tablighi Jamat’s grand event at Nizamuddin Markaz Masjid between March 13 and 15 has led to a huge spike in Coronavirus cases. Though there was no lockdown in India at the time of the conference, the Delhi Government had already prohibited all types of gathering above 200 people by then. They continued to hold back more than 2,000 participants in a six-floor dormitory long after the event had ended. The management refused to buckle even after receiving notice from the Delhi Police. It took 36 hours to evacuate 2,361 people from the premises to put them into hospitals and quarantine centres.

The misinformation campaign over Tik Tok, targetting impressionable young boys from the Muslim community to throw caution to the wind, is sinister. Those paying heed to such evil counsel will jeopardise their own health before they risk someone else’s. If Muslims had really been depending upon the divine will for health instead of modern medicine all these years, the hospitals in Delhi would not have a large percentage of them. Nor would the super speciality hospitals in India receive a large number of “medical tourists” from Afghanistan, Iran and Central Asia, among others. Muslims, like anyone else, wear woollen clothes when it is winter and shed them in springtime. Why pass on all responsibility to Allah in the COVID season?

As Ahmad I ibn Mustafa had said in 1850 cholera season, “If divine decree and fate arrive and I die with the disease, I fear I would say, ‘if only I had observed quarantine, this would not have happened’ because of my belief that everything comes from Allah.”

4,11-4-20,Lockdown grammar,"Aggressive cluster containment and flushout, be it in UP or Delhi, is the only way to tackle COVID-19

Cluster containment, sealing, testing and lockdowns are now no longer administrative decisions. Affected people are beginning to internalise these choices as a necessary evil and are rewiring their lives around them. When you read reports of some women in Jammu, wearing plastic gear, completely sealing their locality from outsiders and maintaining vigil themselves, then you know that nobody wants to make a fatal flaw. Yes, the overnight building of invisible walls and the possibility of prolonged house arrest did distress people in hotspot clusters in Uttar Pradesh (UP), particularly Noida, sending them into war-time paranoia of stocking up more than was needed, but two days on, there is a drill. There is an essential service hotline and an app, a dedicated vendor assigned to each sealed area for fruits, vegetables, rations and medicines, and an SMS alert to pick up rations from a neighbourhood or society gate, according to time slots mentioned over such alerts. This means there is no over-crowding. Other than that, every resident is being confined indoors and not allowed to stray into any common space. Masks are mandatory and neighbourhood watchdogs are themselves handing over violators to the police. The Bhilwara model has pretty much become the drill for cluster containment, particularly in UP. In fact, apartment blocks and condominiums in Noida and Greater Noida had already ensured that their inmates with a travel history went into quarantine much before the national lockdown. The jump in the number of the Coronavirus cases is a cause of concern and the State Government is pretty much firm it won’t ease the lockdown till there is no possibility of prospective spread of the disease. Like Delhi, UP’s spike has been fuelled by Tablighi attendees. Nearly 1,600 Tablighi members have so far been identified in the State, of which over 1,200 have been quarantined. The authorities are in the process of tracking down the remaining Tablighi members for screening and quarantining and have even urged them to voluntarily come forward in the interest of their family’s health. No study is required to understand that there is a subterranean trellis of the disease that has quietly spread to communities that regularly engage with each other and form a part of the economic chain of demand and supply. This is why it is a challenge in UP to even get the agricultural chain going, from harvesting to procurement depots. The flight of migrant labourers has caused an acute shortage of farm hands. But if the lockdown is withdrawn prematurely, then it could defeat the purpose of the 21-day brakes and lead to a runaway situation. Also food rations are available now but without containment at this stage, there could be no economic activity going forward with the disease swamp. That could lead to more shortages, crops wasting in the farms and no supplies, sparking off a second humanitarian crisis that nobody wants. No agricultural belt in India can afford a compound crisis at this point.

However, UP needs to follow up this disciplined confinement with active testing. The State Government is expanding the network of testing facilities to 24 and is upgrading various district hospitals in 14 districts, including Kannauj, Jalaun, Noida, Greater Noida, Ayodhya, Bahraich, Shahjahanpur and Saharanpur, to deal not only with the Coronavirus but any medical emergency of the future. Given its size and population, UP needs aggressive testing in clusters and faster serology tests besides pool tests. Once the trend is clearer district-wise, then it can get the local economy going with agricultural businesses and perhaps industrial production in zero districts. But at this point of time, both UP and Maharashtra, despite having high clusters, have to pretty much just hold fort as the shipments of serological test kits have not arrived in the country yet. Sources say at least five deadlines have been missed. So rapid testing is not possible at the moment and there can only be RT-PCR tests in clusters. Neither can we let precious test kits go waste. Till the data is not clear, only a lockdown at this point can push back a bulge. Wuhan did it for 76 days, in London it has been a month and Odisha has voluntarily shut itself off till April 30. Delhi’s Operation Shield in Dilshad Garden, where every house was screened and isolated, is now virus-free. Without capacity-building, India’s fight against COVID-19 will have to be about choking a silent monster at the earliest than allowing it a crack to slip through.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/lockdown-grammar-2020-04-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/lockdown-grammar.html
5,11-4-20,Biden vs Trump,"The race to win the White House this November has come down to two old, White men. Not a perfect match

So Bernie Sander’s second shot at a political revolution was stillborn yet again. Some may blame the Democratic Party’s establishment for sidelining him, others will point to the fact that Sanders was backed by polarising figures such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, the two rookie members of the US Congress, whose views are considered an anathema to “middle” America, a very important vote-bank which propelled President Donald Trump to power. However, Joe Biden, the winner of the race to stand against Trump, the 45th President of the US, may not be the best candidate. Sure, he will have the backing of former President Barack Obama, the man under whom Biden served as Vice President, and the entire Democratic Party establishment as well as much of the celebrity and media world, who are desperate to see the back of Trump. But say what you will about Trump and the Republican Party, the ground game that “team Trump” has is tremendous as is his ability to focus the media narrative on himself.

The fact is that the longer Trump stays in power, the more focussed his voters become on keeping him there. He is a lightning rod for many media issues and say what you will about his often mindless foreign policy and his verbal gaffes, Trump always has had a point about the duplicitous nature of the Chinese dragon, which is now on full show during the Coronavirus crisis. The fact is also that strangely for a Republican President, he has never had to actually resort to huge acts of American military aggression. Indeed, he has been less trigger happy than his predecessor, the aforementioned Obama. Defeating Trump will take a sharp focus and gritty determination. And Biden, who is actually older than Trump, despite his five decades of public life, might not have what it takes to beat Trump. However, even a day is a long time in politics and the American response to the Coronavirus crisis might help either side much more than they expect.

After Gautam Buddha Nagar (Noida) police started registering cases against those sheltering Jamaatis, Azamgarh police too announced cash rewards to those providing inputs on Jamaatis holed up in the district.

Prior to this, the state government had appealed to Jamaatis to come out for medical help and stop spread of coronavirus but that failed to yield the desired results and the Jamaat members went into hiding, causing chaos and panic amongst the residents.

In Azamgarh, the police announced a reward of Rs 5,000 for people giving inputs on missing Jamaatis. The police have inputs that several Jamaatis are holed up in the district and refuse to come out for test or treatment. So far 35 Jamaatis have been quarantined in the district.

Sources said some districts were also planning to announce cash rewards and take stringent action against those sheltering the Jamaat members, so that the Jamaatis could be scanned, treated and quarantined.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also ordered a probe into the missing Jamaatis who attended the Nizamuddin markaz meet but were now missing.

Around 70 such Jamaat members are reported missing from the state and some of them have even moved to other states.

Meanwhile, addressing media persons on Friday, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi said that of the total 431 positive cases in UP, around 300 were found in hotspots where there are nearly 5.31 lakh people.

“If we strictly contain infection in these hotspots, then the virus will not spread to other places. Hence we have been forced to take the stringent measure of sealing these areas,” he said.

Awasthi said that 41 community kitchens were functioning in these hotspots so that people did not starve and doorstep delivery of essentials was being made to help them.

The additional chief secretary further said that testing facilities and COVID hospitals in the state would be increased. He asked authorities to take up these on a war footing.

16,11-4-20,UP Govt steps up production of sanitisers,"The Uttar Pradesh government stepped up production of sanitisers in its fight against coronavirus, nearly doubling the manufacturing capacity to over 82,000 litres per day.

Currently, 62 industrial units are commercially producing hand sanitisers in the state, of which 26 are dedicated hand sanitiser manufacturing plants. Besides, there are 23 sugar mills, 10 standalone distilleries and three independent entities which have set up similar facilities to cater to the demand of sanitisers after the advisory of Union and state governments.

“These 62 companies together are producing 82,250 litres of hand sanitiser on daily basis. So far, these units have manufactured 0.57 million litres of hand sanitiser, of which nearly 2,90,000 litres, corresponding to almost a million packed units, have already been supplied in the market,” a senior official of UP Sugarcane department said.

Earlier, UP-based private sugar mills had applied for necessary licences to manufacture hand sanitiser at their captive distilleries. These include all major private sugar mills viz. Balrampur Chini, Birla, Dalmia, Dhampur, Uttam etc. units.

Acknowledging the surging demand and consequent short supply of sanitisers in the market, the Yogi Adityanath government simultaneously speeded up the process of granting licences while exempting the movement of industrial input and finished products related to hand sanitiser.

While some sugar mills are presently producing hand sanitiser in bulk for supply to other firms for bottling and marketing, some have firmed up contracts to supply ethanol/ethyl alcohol/extra neutral alcohol (ENA) to other sanitiser units inside and outside the state.

In March, Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) had written to the Centre, assuring that domestic sugar industry would supply adequate quantities of ethanol or extra neutral alcohol (ENA) as per requirement for use in manufacture of hand sanitisers.

While hand sanitisers are generally manufactured with isopropyl alcohol (IPA), they have been found equally effective if made from ethanol/ethyl alcohol/ENA, which are essentially sugar by-products.

Sources in ISMA said that the Central and UP departments, including sugar, excise, drug controllers, have worked in perfect sync which resulted in speedier sanctions of licences for hand sanitiser manufacturing in India.

Against the backdrop of rising cane arrears, additional supply of ethanol and hand sanitiser by private mills have opened up another revenue stream for them even as the nation-wide lockdown to control coronavirus is to April 14.

The need to start production of sanitisers in Uttar Pradesh was necessitated by the fact that most of the sanitiser companies are based in Gujarat from where it is being supplied.

“The government is all out to promote sanitiser industry in the state and extend all help in setting up manufacturing units. After the lockdown is lifted, the government is expecting more companies to apply for licence for manufacturing sanitisers,” said Industrial Development Minister Satish Mahana.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-govt-steps-up-production-of-sanitisers.html

Akhilesh said that five crore people losing employment during two weeks of lockdown was a cause of serious concern and asked the government to step in and resolve the issue before people began starving.

He asked the government to ensure sufficient supply of food and medicine and ensure employment after the lockdown to the affected.

The situation is so severe that unemployment rate has shot up to 23 per cent and is set to spike further. Large number of workers and labourers in various states have been forced to migrate to villages,” he said.

“Otherwise the situation could become catastrophic and many may starve as well. The help of mere one or two thousand rupees per month to the youth is simply not enough,” he said.

The SP chief said that his motive to highlight the problems was to the bring them to the notice of the government.

26,11-4-20,"‘Deploy volunteer police, check community transmission'","Concerned over severity of coronavirus pandemic and ""loose"" execution of lockdown in rural areas, the Bharatiya Bikash Parishad has urged the Chief Minister to recruit and deploy ""special volunteer police (SVP)"" in each village of the State at the earliest.

Mentioning that more than 14 lakh people have been detected positive and about 80, 000 have died in the world and Odisha is no behind reporting 48 positives and one death till date, the Parishad observed in a letter that lockdown and shutdown have been successful in urban areas whereas they have been responded a little in rural areas due lack of sufficient police personnel.

No doubt that the Government has sanctioned Rs 5 lakh for each gram panchayat and Rs 10 lakh for block for installation of isolation halls and supply of foods to destitutes. But these seem not to have been materialised in all villages.

""Most of our rural people are uneducated farmers, labour and poor and many of them believe in superstition. About 90 000 people have returned from other States due to Corona. Almost all of the villagers, including returnees, are taking bath in tanks, ponds, river and nullah. Even they are playing cards, kabadi, volleyball and other games in groups. Due to these activities, social distancing is not being maintained and, thus, there is greater chance of community transmission of corona in near future."" pointed out Parishad chief Surendra Panigrahi.

Noting that adequate police personnel are required to ensure proper exucution in rural areas, Panigrahi proposed that five to 10 youths from among villagers be selected as SVP and deployed in villages without any remuneration for the purpose.

The Government will have to issue certificates to these volunteers which would help them get Home Guard and Constabe on the basis of their qualification.

""SVPs can be very helpful in achieving the very purposes of the lockdown and thereby check community transmission of the coronavirus in villages. Kindly select and employ them as soon as possible,"" wrote Panigrahi.

He too sent the copies of the letter to Home Secretary, DGP, SRC, Ganjam district Collector and DIG and SP, Brahmapur.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---deploy-volunteer-police--check-community-transmission-.html
27,11-4-20,Lockdown spells doom for Kendrapada wagers,"As lockdown has been clamped in the country to contain the spread of coronavirus, in the coastal district of Kendrapada, many people have lost their livelihoods and left to fend for themselves.

The worst affected are labourers, stitching men, ice cream sailors, pheriwalas, milkmen, roadside food vendors, potters and masons and other daily wagers.

Though the State Government has provided financial assistance and also provided food, but it is not enough for them, alleged several victims.

According to Hagura Das, a milkman, “I used to run my family by delivering milk to households in nearby towns. Now I am facing a tough time as my business is stopped.""

Several milkmen are now supply milk to OMFED as they failed to supply milk in households, he added.

Along with farm labourers, masons and daily wage earners, who travelled daily to nearby towns for manual jobs, are also facing a very tough time. Several persons who generally eke out their living by working in building and road constructions have lost jobs.

The women, who have taken small loans, are anxious about how they would repay the loans. There is also a massive cash crunch in such houses. While the Government has announced to provide essentials at fixed rates, these labourers said they couldn't afford even the essential items since they had no cash in hand.

The persons, who earn their bread by tailoring or by stitching clothes, are also struggling as their shops remained closed for nearly two weeks and now they do not have money to collect grocery items.

“I used to run my family by stitching clothes, but my shop remains closed due to COVID-19 lockdown and I have no income. I have to borrow money from the local SHG to run the family expenses,"" said Brahmananda Sahu.

Similar is the fate of pheriwalas, ice cream sellers and snack vendors in the district. According to Rakesh Sharma, who ekes out his living by selling panipuri in the town, ""I used to run my family by selling pani puri (gupchup) in the township area. But as lockdown is going on, my business is stopped and I am left with no income.""",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lockdown-spells-doom-for-kendrapada-wagers.html

32,11-4-20,Ensure lockdowns sans loopholes to curb Covid-19,"As the cases of COVID-19 has shown a disturbingly upward trend across India and while we are all looking at each other with sombre and despair, Union Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba has conveyed a sense of hope in advising the States to look at adopting the ‘Bhilwara model’ of ruthless containment to curb the spread of the contagion.

Bhilwara district in Rajasthan, as per the last census is inhabited by over 24 lakh people and has so far reported 27 positive cases and two deaths. But why are we discussing about it nationally? It is because no new Covid-19 cases have been reported in a week, while 13 patients have recovered so far. Kudos to the district administration for laying out and implementing a plan of containment which is now called, ‘the Bhilwara model’.

As per reports, the strategy adopted by Bhilwara district administration is quite simple, in a nutshell. It is complete isolation of the district, mapping of the hotspots, door-to-door screening, aggressive contact tracing and augmenting and increasing quarantine and isolation wards and putting in place a proper monitoring mechanism for rural and sub-urban areas. Besides, as per media reports the isolation of Bhilwara district has been absolute, without any regard for convenience of people as in normal days, with the only priority being the stopping of further spread of the contagion. The nice part of the whole story is, aggressive door-to-door screening has in fact yielded a good result, as about 22.39 lakh people got screened more than once. It has helped in ruling out the probabilities forever and ensuring positive cases with relative certainty.

To carry out the whole exercise, 1,937 teams were constituted, and more than 4 lakh houses were surveyed between March 22 and April 2. And in the process, nearly 14,000 people with influenza-like symptoms were identified who were put on watch. In addition to that, a thorough follow up was carried out, to check if any of them were exhibiting the symptoms of novel Coronavirus.

Further, the action that took place in Bhilwara district witnessed two phases of activity. It is learnt that, firstly, much before a nation-wide lockdown was imposed, Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was invoked and imposed in the district, which made gatherings of five or more persons unlawful, and under such circumstances only essential services were allowed and district border was sealed. Further, adequate steps were taken to ensure that no gaps remained, and the district administration of all neighbouring districts cooperated in all possible manners to seal their borders with Bhilwara. Secondly, in phase two, even more stringent steps were taken, since all services excepting police and health services were completely shut down. The containment was absolutely ruthless and there was no leniency that was shown, and it was ensured that, there was no loophole in the process of the enforcement.

The process that followed soon after the isolation of the district was medical teams went on for cluster mapping, which was instrumental for identification of positive cases and after that, certain areas were identified and that followed continuous screening of suspected cases. Not only that, in addition to the entire exercise the district administration went on a disinfecting spree, where each and every part of the district, from the containment zones and buffer zones, and hot spots where positive cases have been detected, including Government vehicles were disinfected. In the entire exercise of screening, the basic strategy was to emphasise the epicentres of infection and the migrated groups, with this, a clear assignment was given to each team, which included the areas to be covered by each team, with one supervisor for ten teams. It is also learnt that, dedicated Covid-19 hospitals were set up, and even about 27 hotels were converted into quarantine centres which have 1,541 rooms and another 7,620 people were home quarantined. Apart from all of this about 24×7 control rooms were set up.

But all of these stringent measures were not bereft of ensuring that, humanity was not left in the lurch. After all starvation shouldn’t be killing us before corona does, else the entire exercise shall defeat the purpose of our fight against the pandemic. There was door to door supply of essentials like, groceries, fruits, vegetables and milk. Apart from that, the supply of raw and cooked food was ensured for the poor and the needy, and fodder for cattle was also distributed. What made the achievement possible in Bhilwara is, once the plan was ready for implementation, there was absolute non-interference from the Government or any other side.

The model seems worth adopting, principally because of the fact that, even though we have entered the third week of lockdown but there has been no stoppage in the spiralling of the rate of infection in our country; and as per the latest Indian Council of Medical Research(ICMR) reports, out of the total 5,911 Severe Acute Respiratory Illness patients, 104 tested positive for Covid-19 and of them 40 didn’t have any travel history outside India or any contact history with a known Covid-19 case, which is enough of a hint about community spreading.

It is now clear that, any phase of lockdown, extension of lockdown, re-lockdown shall fail to ensure the effective containment of the Covid-19 situation, until and unless we ensure absolute lockdown; but not without ensuring with diligence that, the essentials of living are provided to the people with ease and proper planning. Lockdown after all is to save life, but doesn’t mean to take away life owing to starvation or absence of proper medical care to the needy.

33,11-4-20,Labourers more prone to Covid,"The unplanned and most unhealthy habitations as well as movement of around two lakh unorganised labourers of industry and mines area of Odisha are prone to community infection.

The labourers working years together at the mines and industries area like Kalinga Nagar, Angul, Talcher, Paradip, Jajpur ,Joda, Barbil, Jharsuguda, Brajrajnagar and Rourkella etc are residing in slums without proper habitation planning. They are residing in the thickly populated slums without basic health and sanitation facilities.

The sudden lockdown, without minimum arrangement of their housing, food, water, health safety and movement has created a panic situation.

The Central Government has declared the steel, coal, power and fertiliser sector as essential service as per ESMA. Considering the fact that mining activities are an integral part of the operation of steel plants, the Government has allowed the operation of various mines, including iron and coal mines. It also allowed the operation of sponge iron, ferroalloys, iron ore pellet plants etc, which supply critical raw materials for steel making. It also allowed un restricted inter- State movements of vehicles carrying the raw materials and finished steel.

However, the Government order remains silent on engagement, movement, habitation and safety of labourers engaged in the mines and industrial activities in the current pandemic period. To make the matter worse, most of the labourers engaged in these sectors are migrant .

Social activist Er Sasmita Behera told that unorganised labourers working in the Industries and mines should not be deprived of their rights to health and public service. In these exceptional times, the rights of migrants must be guaranteed, she demanded.

The concerned industries and mines with their limited functioning could not engage the entire labourers. On the other hand, most of the labourers have lost their jobs and so also livelihood.

INTUC leader Nirmal Samal said, ""There is an urgent need of providing food, safety materials, health service and financial assistance to all the families of industrial workers residing in the slums around industries and mines.""

Presently most of the village committes have restricted their villagers along with those who were working in the industries to go to the workplace. Those workers around the periphery villages of the industries have lost their jobs. They need support, added Samal.

Most labourers those who are engaged directly and indirectly in the industries ,mines and transportation activities for livelihood are not registered and hence are apprehensive of getting any Government assistance and required health service during the current crisis. The administration needs to ask the firms and contractors to take the responsibility of providing support to the labourers and their families, and create awareness among them to check spread of the virus.

The Citizens’ Action Forum, in a letter to the Chief Minister, urged to provide required health securirity and planned habitation to the mines and industrial labourers, without which there is possibility of community infection of COVID-19.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/labourers-more-prone-to-covid.html

37,11-4-20,‘Baleswar street vendors denied Covid sop',"Trade union leader Jayant Das has alleged that the Baleswar municipal authorities, adopting a discriminatory approach, have deprived several street vendors of their financial assistance during the lockdown.

He said there are about 2,800 street vendors, including several in the town, yet only about 45 have got the amount Rs 3,000 for three months. The rest are not considered as street vendors and so did not get any aid, he told.

Municipality Executive Officer Pranay Kumar Jena, however, refuted the allegations and said that after due verification the amount was paid. There are about another 40 who would be collecting their dues later on, he informed.

Jena said in Baleswar municipality so far the exact number of street vendors was not enumerated.

“In 2015, a survey was conducted in Baleswar municipality by an independent agency to ascertain the number of street vendors and further to issue them with identity cards. 1,986 street vendors were identified by the agency then. But it was disputed by some of council members then as a result of which the list couldn’t finalized. As of now there is no official figure available with us about the number of street vendors under Baleswar municipality,"" said Jena.

“Yet through our own mechanism we could ascertain a tentative figure around 90. The compensation is for the vendors who lost their livelihood on account of lockdown . The majority of the street vendors sell vegetables and fruits. Since these outlets are opened and their profession is not affected, they are not entitled to receive the grant. During our survey we have considered the shops and outlets who were dealing with tea , betel , gup chup etc . Even small time barber shops, cycle , bike repair shops were considered . We are accountable for each rupee,” he added.

The district administration informed that the grant in Soro was given to 158 vendors and in Jaleswar 80 vendors were given the money till date.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---baleswar-street-vendors-denied-covid-sop-.html

Citing the court’s order to undertake ‘intensive search operations’ to locate the remaining people linked to the Tablghi Jamaat, as they may be potential carriers of the COVID-19 infection, state BJP chief Vikram Usendi said the Congress government has been highlighting the failure of the Centre, should now seek apology on the issue by taking moral responsibility.

A double bench of the high court after hearing a batch of petitions relating to different issues, passed the order. The court has asked the state government to submit a status reports by April 13.

Seven new coronavirus positive cases, shows a total failure of the state government as it had failed to isolate the people linked to the Jamaat, Usendi said.

42,11-4-20,No restriction on harvesting of crops in Palamu,"There is no restriction from police on harvesting in Palamu. Labourers are free to do agricultural work as per their convenience. SP Ajay Linda, when asked asked if police have restricted harvesting time to just 4 hours as was complained by famers of Kajru, Kulya villages and that this permissible time is in the morning only to which Linda said, “There is nothing like this. There is no word about this kind of things at all. Who the police are to fix this limit of harvesting time? Harvest your crop as you like or choose. ”

Linda further said, “A farmer or labourer is free to work in the fields. Our only sincere advice to them is to maintain social distancing if it is harvesting, binding sheaves of wheat, rahar etc and maintain a distance when eating in the fields too.”

Secretary state disaster management Amitabh Kaushal when asked if there is any embargo on any agricultural activities in this ongoing lock down phase said, “ Absolutely nothing. The MHA has not put any curb. A farmer is at his liberty to engage labourers for harvesting. We only press for adherence to social distancing as we do with others.”

He said, “The complaints of the farmers that police permit 4 hours of harvesting will be discussed with the DC Shantanu Kumar Agrahari but I tell you the MHA has nothing to do with any timeline for agricultural activities.”

“Do your agricultural activities as per your own convenience and so where comes this issue of time restrictions, which is a non existing issue,” reiterated Amitabh.

Asked if police will allow agricultural activities to be done before sunset Linda said, “I repeat farmers and labourers are at liberty to use whatever time of the day forenoon or afternoon or both for their agricultural works. Police have nothing to do with this rather we will be happy if labourers return to fields maintaining social distancing.”

Officer in charge of Chainpur police station Sunit Kumar said “ Agro activities are on in villages like Pathra, Karso, Bouree etc and there is no problem there at all.”

48,11-4-20,‘Decision on lockdown exit to be taken soon’,"Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Friday said a decision to call off the lockdown in the state will be taken after serious consideration and with proper precautions.

Baghel said that the objective behind taking the decision to call off the lockdown will be to strike a balance between daily life and livelihood.

The chief minister was interacting with journalists via video conference in which more than 55 media representatives from Raipur, Bastar, Sarguja, Bilaspur, and Durg divisions participated.

The chief minister said, “We need to replace the words such as social distancing with physical distancing. This change will save the people returning from migration, other states, and people of weaker section of society from the repercussions of social distancing.”

Inspired by the lockdown implemented by the administration, people of rural areas have been practicing in self-motivated discipline to prevent the spread of the disease, for which they deserve appreciation, he said.

In response to a question, the CM said that none of the people linked to the Tablighi Jamaat, who had attended the Nizamuddin Markaz and returned to Chhattisgarh, are missing.

He said, 107 people have returned from there and all of them have been identified.

“They have been kept in quarantine and their samples have been collected. Their travel history and the people with whom they have come in contact with have also been traced.”

Baghel said that the Andhra Pradesh state intelligence bureau has released a list of 159 people on the basis of mobile tower data, which was incorrect.

“This list included names of even those people who had only passed by that location. These people had not attended the Markaz. Later, centre collected information about the people who entered or had attended the religious congregation, and identified 107 people.”

He further said that AIIMS, Raipur and the Medical College Jagdalpur in the state, have corona virus testing facility.

At present, MEKAHARA Hospital in Raipur has the permission to perform tests., Baghel said and added : “We have quarantine facility and enough quantity of ventilators. The state government has processed a tender for testing kits and soon testing kits will be available.”

After diagnosis of new cases in Katghora, 100% lockdown has been implemented in the city and each and every person there is being tested, Baghel said.

Nine out of the 18 corona-affected people in the state have recovered, the CM said.

Baghel further said that the coronavirus infection started spreading from China to rest of the world. If people coming from international flights from that country were tested and quarantined at the right time, this infection wouldn’t have spread in the country.

The borders of the state have been sealed, and only transport of essential services has been allowed. CM said, adding that ration of two months is being distributed to the beneficiaries, mahua and tamarind is being procured in scheduled areas at the minimum support price with the help of forest committees and self-help groups.

Nodal officers have been appointed to help labourers of Chhattisgarh stranded in other states, and a helpline number has also been launched, the CM said.

“All the necessary arrangements have been made for these labourers. The health department has given instructions to conduct test for coronavirus infection randomly as well.

“The decision regarding calling off the lockdown will be taken after the Prime Minister’s video conference on April 11, at cabinet meeting of the state to be held on April 12,” Baghel said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---decision-on-lockdown-exit-to-be-taken-soon---.html

Kulbul Dubey mukhiya of Purabdiha panchayat said, “Come and see yourself. There is music system here. Inmates listen to film songs and devotional songs too. They listen to news also of some news channels.”

Dubey said one Hindi newspaper is bought every day for these inmates. He said these have a very good impact on their mental health. The feeling of boredom, emotional fatigue and sense of loss has gone away from here said Dubey. In the beginning these inmates too cried for home going but we got them stayed here added Dubey.

On Friday SDPO Sadar Sandip Kumar Gupta, officer in charge of Chainpur police station Sunit Kumar and a host of other officials reached this centre only to find these things available there. Gupta said, “I was too amused to find music, song and newspaper here. It is really a very encouraging thing that this mukhiya has done. I wish other mukhiyas should also take a leaf from Kulbul Dubey.” OC Sunit Kumar said, “The cleanliness and quality of food here also speak high here and credit for it goes to the mukhiya Kulbul Dubey.”

Gupta said this innovative idea should be spread out much faster so that other mukhiyas having institutional quarantine centres go for these things.

Sources said there is one centre where the quarantine centre was locked from inside while inmates were inside at Saguna under Paton police station where after police intervention things here looked up but this Purabdiha institutional quarantine centre is a classic example of comfort both mental and physical for the inmates herewhohave come from their work places in Chhatisgarh, Raipur, Macluskeiganj etc.

Mukhiya Dubey said the inmates here are of all communities Muslims, Tribal and Dalit but no where there is any wedge among them.

Gupta said, “I saw them and have this instant feeling that these people here live like a family who are emotionally tied to each other as each one has one aim test negative and remain healthy and after completion of quarantine period join families .”

SP Ajay Linda has asked his SDPOs to make a whirl wind tour of such quarantine centres in their respective areas as he said he himself hops from one centre to another to see how things are going there.

The organisation has roped in its team of doctors from Jharkhand and Meghalaya to start a ‘Hello Doctor’ helpline, which has a team of six MBBS and one BHMS and Ayurveda doctor for addressing outdoor patient cases over phone.

From symptoms of seasonal illness to medical concerns, patients can call up the doctors between 10 am to 12 pm and 3pm to 6pm for medical advice and consultation. The doctors have volunteered to help people with their queries on the helpline numbers shared so that people don’t have to step out of their home for general medical advice.

The helpline, started on April 7, has so far received around 50 calls from different parts of Jharkhand. “The majority of calls that I have received so far are from people who are concerned about symptoms of seasonal diseases like cold and cough. Many inquiries about safety methods for COVID 19 are also been made,” said Dr Amar Jyoti Bihari.

Also, the organisation has been actively working all across the Capital city to promote the practice of social distancing. A team has been working tirelessly since the past two weeks demarcating community kitchens, haat bazaars and food serving stations across the city with permanent distemper markings separated by one meter in distance and one metre in diameter to help people practice social distancing in a more coordinated manner.

“The idea right now is to have social distancing demarcations across the city so that even when people step out for purchase necessities or collect food for the day, crowding doesn’t happen. The district administration identified a couple of locations for us and the local police stations coordinated for the process,” said Ganesh Reddy, secretary, Citizens Foundation.

So far areas including CM community kitchen in Morabadi, Harmu Market, Niwaranpur, RIMS community kitchen, Balpan Children Hospital, Naga Baba Khatal Market, Market Area opposite CMPDI, Bariatu Thana and other parts of the city have been covered under the initiative.

Additionally, over 5000 masks have been distributed by Citizens Foundation in market areas, crowded places, families and individuals across Ranchi for protection against the virus.

UNDER LOCKDOWN, PEOPLE AR EHIGH ON HOPE, FIND PU RESEARCH SURVEY

“A majority of Indians are high on optimism and hope despite a life-altering disruption caused by the nation-wide lockdown to fight the coronavirus pandemic,” revealed an online research survey conducted by Psychology Department of Panjab University.

“An overwhelming majority of respondents i.e. 96 percent have reported a positive emotional and mental health, which is the silver lining to the bleak public mood since the virus outbreak in the country,” said Prof Seema Vinayak, chairperson, Psychology Department of Panjab University.

Psychologist Prof Seema carried out the online research investigation between April 6 and 9. The survey was responded by over 400 people of diverse age groups and social strata, having the internet access, in over dozen states across the nation that has been under an unprecedented lockdown since March 25.

“A new sense of family bonding has acted as a cushion for stress, anxiety and fear arising out of uncertainty, and also upped the happiness quotient of members,” said Prof Seema.

Much of the positive outlook among people, according to the survey, is a prolonged period of togetherness forced upon the families by the curfew-like stay-at-home norms. Interestingly, elderly respondents, who generally experienced loneliness in normal times due to busy lives of younger family members, reported a significant surge in their emotional well-being owing to a greater interpersonal interactions in homes. The lockdown appears to have offset the empty nest syndrome in many cases, she said.

At least two-thirds of respondents reported that enjoying nature , yoga , meditation and physical exercise in the confines of home helped them cope with the stressors of an unabated pandemic and an open-ended lockdown.

Impact on livelihood, uncertainty on academic and professional lives, continued raging of coronavirus and loss of social life emerged as the top-of- the-mind worries among respondents.

Yet, most are high on hope about the post-lockdown future. Trust in the Government’s steps to deal with the virus outbreak, a likely invention of vaccine, greater focus on health care and increased awareness about hygiene were mentioned as bright spots by three-fourths of respondents, she added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/2-19-lakh-ut-residents-screened-for-covid-19.html

56,11-4-20,Punjab Govt authorises DCs to declare new mandis as needed,"To meet the demands of social distance while ensuring smooth procurement of the grain amidst the coronavirus scare, Punjab Cabinet on Friday authorized the Deputy Commissioners to declare new mandis (grain markets) in their respective districts as needed.

These would be in addition to the 3,800 mandis already notified this year for procurement operations, said an official spokesperson after a video conference of the Council of Ministers.

The Cabinet took stock of the preparations for harvesting and procurement of wheat, scheduled to begin on April 15. It was decided that the procurement arrangements should be finalized and notified by April 11, so that that every grain of the farmers is procured, though in a staggered manner.

The state has already decided to extend procurement till June 15 and has sought incentives from the Centre for delayed transportation to the mandis by the farmers in view of COVID-19 crisis. The Centre is yet to respond to the state’s demand.

The Cabinet also noted that the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on procurement of wheat should be widely circulated and publicized so that all protocols, including provision of sanitizers, hand-washing arrangements etc, can be strictly complied with.

The state DGP Dinkar Gupta has already been asked to come out with a comprehensive security plan for the mandis.

The Cabinet was informed that while 73 percent of the state’s requirement for gunny bales had been met already, the remaining shortage of 7.2 lakh bales would be met with PP bags if the West Bengal Government does not open production in time. As of now, West Bengal has only resumed transportation of the 27,000 bales which were ready.

The Additional Chief Secretary (Development) Viswajeet Khanna said that rules had been amended to make payments to farmers through arhtiyas (commission agents) instead of direct bank transfer (DBT) that was to be introduced this year.

The Chief Minister had earlier suggested the change in order to maintain continuity and stability in these difficult times. The Mandi Board has already extended the validity of arhtiyas’ licenses, which were to expire on March 31, till wheat procurement operations in the state are over. The arhtiyas would be paid within 48 hours of procurement and would, in turn, be required to pay the farmers in the next 48 hours.

Khanna informed the Cabinet that 3,718 purchase centres set up in the State included 153 main yards, 283 sub-yards, 1430 purchase centres and rice mills.

Nearly 137 lakh MT of wheat is expected to arrive in the mandis of which 135 lakh MT would be purchased by government agencies while two lakh MT by the private traders. Khanna said that the Centre has fixed (minimum support price) MSP of wheat at Rs 1,925 per quintal for the current Rabi marketing Season against Rs 1,840 MSP fixed last year.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-govt-authorises-dcs-to-declare-new-mandis-as-needed.html

59,11-4-20,CM: Role of people’s representatives crucial,"Chief Minister Hemant Soren today said that in the difficult times, the role of MPs, MLAs and other people's representatives is very important. Holding a video conferencing (VC) with 65 MLAs and three MPs of the State here on Friday the CM said that said that public representatives are directly connected with the villagers, they remain aware of their grievances, difficulties and problems. “At this time we all have to unite and give relief to the people of the State. It is the duty of public representatives that they should play their role in ensuring that the people get the full benefit of the work being done by the government,” he added.

Soren said that a large number of labourers of Jharkhand are stranded due to lockdown in various states of the country. The state government is taking all possible steps to provide relief to these migrant laborers. Soon, the government will provide support money to the trapped workers outside the State through DBT in their bank accounts. He said that departmental officials have been directed in this regard to develop such a mechanism as soon as possible to take all the details of these migrant labourers and provide them the funds.

The CM held detailed discussions with all the MPs and MLAs regarding the progress of relief operations in their areas. He also learned how effectively relief operations are being carried out. All the MPs and MLAs informed the CM about the work being done in their respective areas. Besides, they shared their experiences and how to deal with the Corona infection and also put necessary suggestions before the Chief Minister.

The CM told them in detail about all the schemes related to the relief work being run by the government. He asked all MPs and MLAs to ensure that the general public gets the benefit of all the schemes of the government during the lockdown period. “Ensure that people get the benefits of Chief Minister Dal Bhat Yojana, Chief Minister Didi Kitchen Scheme, food arrangements in police stations. Also ensure that there is no problem in getting ration from PDS shops. Regularly observe ration lifting and ration distribution and inform the government of any irregularities or problems.

People's representatives should monitor all these on their own. In this hour of calamity, if any ration dealer indulges in any irregularity, then legal action should be taken immediately. People's representatives themselves go to ration shops and arrange ration distribution so that people do not face any difficulty. File a complaint for anyone who tries to do black marketing,” he said.

The CM said that the district administration along with the local MPs and MLAs should organize a meeting with all the public representatives to facilitate coordination in bringing the government's plans to the ground. He said that due to lack of coordination at times, things start to get messy. Ensure that there is no communication gap, he said.

Soren said in his address, “We need to be mentally prepared to deal with infection like COVID-19. In this battle of corona infection, it is very important to have the coordination of the people of the State and the people's representatives. Along with the State government, everyone will have to play an important role in this fight.”

60,11-4-20,"Deserted city lake-side promenade, waits for lockdown to be lifted","An eerie silence hangs over the placid waters of the capital city Raipur’s famed Telibandha Lake, except for a handful of impoverished and differently-abled people, lounging under the shade at the bus-shelters that line the picturesque expanse of water.

The lake-side boulevard, known as the “Mini Marine Drive”—which borrows its name from its more renowned moniker in far off Mumbai—is empty.

Popular with city residents and visitors alike, the lake-side promenade is a favourite with joggers, morning-walkers and fitness enthusiasts, and an area that is a hive of activities throughout the day, wears a deserted look.

It has been so for more than a month since the lockout begun on March 15.

Even the crackle and hiss of geese and quakes and the flatter of wings of the snake-birds or the Indian darters—that spear-dive into the water to fish—is missing.

The winged-visitors are at peace, undisturbed by the usual human activities in the vicinity of the lake since the lockdown in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

Also missing is the cacophony of honking of horns as motorists, desperately tried to negotiate their way through the jumble of haphazardly parked vehicles on either side of the six-lane thoroughfare along the mile-long lake-side Mini Marine Drive.

Gone too are the young couples—most of who are college students, skipping classes—who spend endless hours at the lake front.

The lake-front, situated near the city’s Shyam Nagar neighbourhood, also a popular spot for hosting entertainment events, flash-mobs, zumba sessions, fitness seminars and sporting events, that are usually held every Sunday, is empty.

Even politicians like to hold spot meetings on the lake-side promenade as they get a ready audience.

A free WiFi zone and a foodie’s paradise, and a popular hang-out for the millennial, is visited by a few stray dogs.

“We are missing the Marine Drive, and hope to return there when lockdown is eased,” says Shyam Nagar resident Rajesh Kashyap.

The sentiment is echoed by Shreya Sahu, a college student from Shankar Nagar nighbourhood of the city, who says: “It was our chilling out place with friends. We really miss the place.”

With the number of Covid-19 cases increasing in the city, and an extension of the lockdown looming large over the state, the residents of the capital city are keep their fingers crossed.

Their longing to once again visit the city’s most happening spot, will have to wait until April 14 and even longer if the lockdown is extended.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/deserted-city-lake-side-promenade--waits-for-lockdown-to-be-lifted.html

Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar appealed to people to wear masks whenever they venture out.

They can even use a handkerchief as a mask,"" Khattar said in a televised address to the people of the state to update them about the steps being taken to check the spread of coronavirus.

The worst affected districts of the state are Nuh (38) Gurugram (32), Palwal (28) and Faridabad (28). Containment orders have been issued by deputy commissioners for 140 villages in Nuh district.

Health Minister Anil Vij maintained that the spike in cases was due to a number of Tablighi Jamaat members testing positive. He said earlier that 106 of the Jamaat members had tested positive.

Khattar, meanwhile, in his address, also said that everyone will have to put in united efforts in this fight against coronavirus.

With Nuh emerging as a hotspot, Khattar said those Tablighi Jamaat members who attended the Nizamuddin event in Delhi last month and may still be hiding should report to authorities to get themselves tested.

He appealed to Muslim religious leaders in Nuh-Mewat region to appeal all to extend their cooperation in this fight against coronavirus.

Khattar also made a reference to Battle of Khanwa, in which a famous ruler from Mewat, Hasan Khan Mewati, had extended full support to Rajput ruler Rana Sanga in the fight against invading forces of the first Mughal ruler Babur. The Battle of Khanwa was fought near the village of Khanwa in Bharatpur district of Rajasthan on March 16, 1527 between Babur''s forces and Rajput forces led by Rana Sanga of Mewar.

Hasan Khan Mewati, the ruler of Mewat, also joined hands with Rana Sanga in an attempt to build a formidable military alliance against Babur. ""Every Mewati stood with Rana Sanga.

During a video conferen the media, hosted by the AICC from New Delhi, the chief minister quoted a study of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) and said the virus was likely to touch its peak by mid-September and may likely to affect 58 per cent of India''s population and 87 per cent of Punjab''s and other states'' population.

""COVID19 epidemic in India is estimated to reach its peak in mid-September 2020 at a point where 58 per cent of population has been infected,"" he said, quoting the projections made by the Department of Community Medicine in PGIMER.

Quoting another figure from the “projections by the institute”, he said the virus can infect up to 87 per cent of the population of Punjab and other states.

Later, the institute issued a press note and clarified, “The PGI, Chandigarh is not aware that any expert/faculty member from the Department of Community Medicine & School of Public Health of the Institute has carried out any study/estimate that the COVID-19 may peak by mid September and can infect 58% of country''s population.”

64,11-4-20,"Punjab records 151 +ve cases, death toll reaches 11","Punjab’s total tally on Friday reached 151 with fresh cases reported from Mohali, Pathankot, Sangrur and Jalandhar — all contacts of the positive cases — including a six-month-old baby boy. The state also witnessed one more death of corona positive patient, taking the total tally to 11.

Mohali district reported maximum of 11 cases, with 10 from Jawharpur village of Dera Bassi block, taking district’s final count to 48. With this, the village alone has 32 positive cases.

To mitigate the spread of coronavirus, the village has been sealed and curfew has been imposed. As many as 25 policemen, including COVID-19 commandos, have also been deployed in the village so that nobody steps out of their houses.

“The authorities have sealed the Dera Bassi area and are treating it as a coronavirus cluster,” said Mohali Deputy Commissioner Girish Dayalan. He said that all 10 new patients have been isolated and they are the family members of the village panch and sarpanch who had tested already positive.

As the village has become a hotspot, Mohali District Administration has sealed off the Jawharpur village along with some other neighbouring villages as part of its cluster containment strategy.

“Extensive sampling has enabled us to identify more positive cases within the village and timely isolate them, hopefully containing the spread in the village with a population of 2500 plus, as well as beyond,” said Dayalan adding that containing without extensive sampling would not have achieved the desired or same results.

Dayalan said: “My health teams have been receiving flak for large number of samples being taken which is not fair. If they didn't, areas would be infected so quickly.

At least now you can isolate the carriers and try to break the chain.”

He said that the district’s health teams have even regularly sampled over 10 dead bodies — where also a positive case was discovered.

Notably, the test results of a 78-year-old woman who died in Mohali on Tuesday confirmed she had the virus. Mohali Civil Surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said that the Mohali woman suffered from diabetes and hypertension. After her death, her samples were taken and sent to PGIMER in Chandigarh for testing as a precautionary measure.

Dayalan said that the co-morbid patient was brought to the emergency ward of a hospital in Kharar on April 6 and died the next day. “Her body has been cremated as per protocol. All primary contacts of the deceased woman have been traced and their samples sent for testing,” he added.

PATHANKOT EMERGING AS NEW HOTSPOT

Emerging as new hotspot, Pathankot on Friday reported eight new cases, taking the total number of cases in the district to 15.

Seven of the eight new cases are from the family of a 75-year-old woman from Sujanpur who died in Amritsar hospital a few days ago. Already, woman’s six relatives, including husband, had tested positive a day before.

The eighth case, reported on Friday, is of a woman domestic help and is unconnected — sparking fears of the possibility of community spread.

The district administration, from where one COVID-19 death and 11 confirmed cases have been reported, has already sealed its boundaries with neighbouring Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and Chamba and Kangra districts of Himachal Pradesh (HP), barring movement of essential goods.

As the administration is tacking the source of infection, the deceased’s grandson’s marriage was held in Pathankot and the bride’s brother had arrived from Canada and is suspected to be the carrier. Samples of 99 people who came in contact with the family have been taken for corona testing.

ONE CASE EACH FROM JALANDHAR, SANGRUR

A day after 55-year-old man from Gagadpur village was tested positive for coronavirus, another villager, 65-year-old, was tested positive for coronavirus following which the administration has started testing all in contact with the patient.

The government should also consider on extending the lockdown period.

AJSU Party Chief Sudesh Mahato, said that the government should ensure testing of the people coming from other states and abroad. The need of the hour is to identify people suffering from the virus, test them and give priority to their treatment. One small mistake can cost hundreds of life. The government should consider a complete lockdown of the Corona Virus hotspots. Apart from Corona Virus, there should be an alternative system of treatment for people suffering from other diseases. The government should ensure Safety of health workers.

State BJP president Deepak Prakash said that the State Government should provide financial support to migrant labourers of Jharkhand who are stranded in other states. When they come back, the need of the hour will be to check their health and also generate employment for them. The availability of food should be ensured to all the needy.

On a day when the Opposition BJP made an issue and demanded the resignation of State Home Minister Amit Deshmukh over the “safe passage” given by Gupta to Wadhwan family members, Deshmukh announced that the Principal Secretary (Home) on “compulsory leave” pending an inquiry to be initiated against the latter.

“As per discussion with CM (Uddhav Thackeray), Amitabh Gupta, has been sent on compulsory leave with immediate effect, till the pending of enquiry, which will be initiated against him,” Deshmukh tweeted earlier in the day.

Later talking to media persons, Deshmukh said: “Apart from sending Mr Gupta on compulsory leave, we have asked senior IAS officer and Additional chief Secretary (Finance) Additional Chief Secretary Manoj Sonic to conduct an inquiry into the misuse of office allegedly indulged by Mr Gupta. Similarly, we have registered an offence under sections 188, 269, 270, 34 of IPC and section 51 (B)of Disaster Management Act and section 11 of Maharashtra Covid-19 Regulations”.

Twenty three members of Wadhawan were detained by the police at Panchgani on Thursday night while travelling in five cars from Khandala to another hill station of Mahabaleswar in Satara district of western Maharashtra. They were carrying with them a “To whomsoever it may concern” issued to them by Gupta on his personal head, permitting the Wadhawans and others to cross from Khandala in Pune to Mahabaleshwar in Satara.

“This is to just inform you that following are well known to me as they are my family friends and travelling from Khandala to Mahabaleshwar for family emergency… Hence you are here by informed through this letter to co-operate with them to reach their destination,” Gupta’s letter read.

Gupta’s letter listed the registration numbers of all the five vehicles and the names of all the family members, friends, and others who were planning to travel in each of the vehicles for the unspecified ‘family emergency’.

“We must all remember that Somaiya is known for his frivolous statements and was denied a candidature of his party for the same. One must not pay attention to his irresponsible, unsubstantiated talks. IPS and IAS officers come under the ambit of the PMO. If the Central government wishes to take action against Amitabh Gupta, they are free to do so. We will welcome the same, Malik said.

104,11-4-20,Didi hiding facts on corona deaths: Supriyo,"Union Minister Babul Supriyo has accused the Bengal Government of hiding the actual number of corona-related deaths.

Close on the heels of Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh and its national leader Amit Malavya slamming Mamata Banerjee for feeding untrue facts regarding the corona deaths Supriyo said that the Chief Minister had actually created a firewall so that the real reports do not come out of the Government closet.

He said at least six more people — than what was being projected by the Government -— had died in Bengal.

The Minister on Friday said that “a firewall has been created by Mamata Banerjee” to stop the facts from coming out showing how at least 6 more deaths — than actually mentioned by the State Government — had occurred in Bengal.]

The records of Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) point towards the real facts the Union Minister said adding how the six people were cremated at Dhapa cremation ground which is far from the glare of the media.

The same allegations were earlier brought by Ghosh who said that the Government was playing with the lives of the people by not following the actual guidelines provided for disposing of the bodies of corona victims. “As the bodies are not sealed — because they have not been officially earmarked as corona deaths — the people are bringing them as any other normal body putting the whole society at risk,” Ghosh earlier said.

Malavya too wondered as to “What is Mamata Banerjee hiding?” even as he tweeted “Hospital administrations across Bengal are under pressure from Mamata Banerjee, who is also the Health Minister, to underplay Covid related cases by discouraging tests and thwarting doctors from writing Corona as a reason for deaths, despite positive reports, in Death Certificates.”

Bengal Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha however refuted the allegations saying the number of corona victims is actually determined by the designated “audit committee or a committee of experts.”

He said, “the policy is that where there is co-morbidity we are not including it as a corona infected death.” He also said that the KMC has no authority to ascertain the cause of the death. “KMC cannot ascertain the cause of death,” he said insisting “I will reiterate that the number of deaths in Bengal till now continues to be five.”

The row erupted a last week when a committee of experts in a press briefing counted the number of dead patients with corona infections to 7. However two hours later at a subsequent media conference the Chief Secretary issued “some clarifications.” He said that 4 out of the reported 7 deaths were “actually due to Co-morbidity — like kidney and other ailments — reasons” adding “it is not clear whether they died due to the viral attack.”

Meanwhile even as sources in the Government said that the authorities had identified 8-10 hotspots in the State and were actually planning a complete lockdown in those areas all the officials of a nationalised bank were sent to home quarantine after the mother of the manager of that branch was diagnosed with corona positive on Thursday night. “The branch has been sealed for fumigation and the staff have been quarantined,” sources said.

Regarding the notified hotspots a senior official said “no one will be allowed to enter or exit from those areas and the police personnel will be posted. Administration will supply essential commodities in these areas.”

Elsewhere India’s first pharmaceutical company Bengal Chemicals which earlier offered to produce hydroxichloroquine have been given the license to manufacture the much sought after medicine, Health Department sources said adding however that the company has asked for supply of raw materials.

“We have requested the central government to make available the raw materials so that we can start manufacturing the drugs by the next week,” a senior official said adding “we have a capability of producing 2 crore tablets in a month’s time… if need be we can produce even more because we have the expertise to manufacture that drug.”

While the PPE will cost Rs 100 each, the mask will come for just Rs 5. The design and quality have been shown to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and NITRA (Northern India Textile Research Association) and the same have been approved for quarantine centre management professionals and other related staff involved in screening of patients, officials said.

“ITBP is manufacturing preparing PPEs at its SS Battalion Centre, Saboli. With PPE for Rs 100 and 3-layer masks for Rs 5 only, this products are cheapest in comparison with those available in the market without compromising with quality,” said ITBP Spokesperson Vivek Pandey.

The requirement for manufacturing the PPEs was felt as the ITBP was running the Quarantine Centre at Chhawla where evacuees from Wihan, China and those from Italy were being put in quarantine and isolation wards, Pandey said. Further, the doctors in the quarantine centre projected difficulties in getting adequate quantity of PPEs, an official said.

Pandey himself sought a sample from the quarantine centre looked around for sourcing the fabric to manufacture the PPEs. The fabric was sourced from a factory in Bawana in the national capital.

The first design was a separate gown, trousers, shoe covers, head cover and triple layered mask.

Then on the suggestion of medical officials, the ITBP centre at Saboli fabricated the overall gown with integrated head cover, zippered front and separate shoe cover and mask.

While the idea was conceptualised by ITBP Second-in- Command and spokesperson Vivek Pandey, fabrication design was actualised by Inspector Tailor Ravi and Head Constbale Tailor Baru Singh. “We can produce around 200 PPEs and 500 masks in a day. These have been cleared for management authorities, screening and other professionals. However, these will not be used inside the Covid-19 patient wards,” Pandey said.

He also urged the Centre to withdraw the suspension of MPLAD funds and said that this decision would hit the local level activities of the MPs in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.

Yechury convened a virtual press conference taking questions from media through email. “A lockdown will be necessary and it will be necessary in order to use that period to increase testing, equip our health workers and that is what should have been done. We are into third week of lockdown and unfortunately, that is not being done. Mere extending the lockdown will increase the economic misery of people. The spread has to be contained through identifying, isolating and sealing areas. That is why we argue for phased withdrawal,” said Yechury.

He reiterated giving more funds to States to buy Personal Protection Equipments (PPE) to healthcare professionals. “If Government can write off Rs 7.78 lakh crore corporate loan defaults, Centre must give more funds to States and one time loan waiver to farmers.

122,11-4-20,Covid crisis has lighter sides too!,"Each day of this season of Covid-19 disease is filled with anxiety and concern. One can feel even the rationalists and atheists looking towards heaven and praying for divine intervention to finish off the coronavirus once and forever.

Though the news coming out from official sources is that of the ever increasing number of persons tested positive for coronavirus, there are some reports percolating from small towns and villages in both Tamil Nadu and Kerala which have elements of fun as well as humor associated with them.

Police in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry are in the look- out for a Delhi-born youth who managed to give a slip to the hospital authorities in Villupuram. The man had been quarantined following initial results that he tested positive for the pandemic. But he managed to escape from the quarantine ward and got himself merged into the crowd.

The law enforcing agency was caught between the devil and deep sea syndrome. The youth’s details have to be kept secret and his photograph could not be published because of the rules governing the protection of the identity of the “victim”. Though the police seems to have released his picture in the social media, it is yet to reach the population. Meanwhile the district administration has constituted three to four special investigation teams to nab the youth who is believed to have come to Puducherry via Tamil Nadu for attending an interview in a private company. The fact that he travelled with persons who were on their way back from the Tablighi Jamaat congregation has given a twist to the fun packed episode.

The authorities are in search of a person, whose picture and identity is yet to be established, a la the Jackal, professional executioner who is the central character in ‘Day of the Jackal’ authored by Frederick Forsyth. No photographs of the Jackal, hired to execute the then French strong man Charles Degaule, were available to the team entrusted with the responsibility to guard the President. Whether the police forces in TN and Puducherry would be able to catch hold of the Delhi youth is the major question being discussed in this part of the world. One need not be surprised if the Kollywood dream factories come out with an action packed film centering over the hunt for the modern day Corona Jackal.

An equally interesting incident has been reported from Kozhikode in Kerala where lovers who eloped to get married much against the wish of the girl’s parents ending up in police station on charges of violation of the lock-down rules! The Hindu girl and the Muslim boy fell in love and decided to tie the nuptial knots much against the anguish of the girl’s parents. Following a complaint from the parents that their daughter has gone missing the Thamarassery Police took into custody the Laila and Majnu. When they were produced before the first class judicial magistrate court in Thamarassery, the girl told the judge that she has come of her house on her own to live with the man she was in love with. The court ordered the release of the couple as it found that both of them were adults.

But the police re-arrested them under another provision! This time the court has no other go except ruling that the couple had violated the Kerala Epidemic Disease Ordinance Act and had come out during the government-imposed lock down to get married. Elopement is not an emergency and they had violated the lock-down provisions. Both of them have been booked and are in custody!",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/covid-crisis-has-lighter-sides-too-.html

127,11-4-20,India slams Pak for negating efforts on Covid war,"In a sharp dig at Pakistan, which finally announced its contribution of three million dollars to the South Asian Association of Regional Co-operation(SAARC)Emergency Covid-19 Fund but maintained that it should be administered through the SAARC Secretariat, India on Friday said the degree of seriousness of each nation can be gauged their behaviour. New Delhi response came as Pakistan is trying to negate India’s efforts to jointly fight the pandemic in South Asian region.

In fact, Pakistan also did not take part in the SAARC trade video conference on Wednesday and later pledged the contribution of three billion dollars. In response to queries on Pakistan promising to pool in this amount proposed to be used through the SAARC Secretariat in accordance with the SAARC Charter, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said ""It is for each SAARC Member State to decide on the timing, manner and implementation of their SAARC COVID-19 Emergency Response Fund commitments.”

He also said “Where India is concerned, the commitment made by the Prime Minister is today in an advanced stage of implementation. Assistance in material and services has been extended to Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka. These SAARC countries have also made early commitments to the Fund. The degree of seriousness of each nation can be gauged by their behavior.""

The response came in the backdrop of India trying to move at a fast pace to jointly fight the coronavirus pandemic in the South Asian region and Pakistan trying to undermine New Delhi’s efforts in this regard by making effort to bring the coronavirus-related interactions under the formal SAARC umbrella by seeking to involve its secretariat. This attempt is to get free hand to block India's initiatives.

Red flagging this development, government sources had said here on Thursday the activities undertaken by the SSARC countries in the recent days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held video conference with heads of all the states of this association were under extraordinary circumstances to deal with challenge. These endeavours were moving in a result-oriented manner without being bound by any procedural formalities which could prove to be constraints.

Sources said Pakistan's efforts to bring COVID-19 related interactions under the formal SAARC umbrella was an attempt to get free hand to block all initiatives and proposals by India by using the SAARC charter provisions and rules of procedure including application of principle of consensus for the drafting of agenda, outcome document, concurrence of all member states for each and every thing every step of the way.

Sources said keeping control of the activities that emerged from Modi's video conference of March 15 has helped India move much faster and without any hindrances. India had described these activities as being stand-alone and outside the ""SAARC calendar of approved activities"", they said.

""We regard the present activities as events under extraordinary Covid-19 circumstances focussed only to jointly dealing with the challenge in the SAARC region in a result-oriented way, without being bound by any procedural formalities that could prove to be constraints,"" a source said.

The All India Petroleum Dealers Association (AIPDA), which claims to represent the bulk of about 64,000 petrol pump operators in the country, sought a financial relief package from the oil companies to help business run.

In a letter to the marketing heads of three state-owned oil firms, AIPDA president Ajay Bansal said in line with national duty, petrol pump operators have been running outlets right through the nationwide lockdown imposed to check the spread of coronavirus.

But sales have slumped as most vehicles have gone off the road. Per retail outlet sales have fallen from a national average of 170 kilolitres per month to about 15 kl now, he said.

“Our trade is totally dependent on sales as we get margin on per litre basis. This means that less you sell the more you lose,” he wrote adding the dealer margin came to Rs 27,500 per month at 170 kl per month sale basis. Despite operating with fewer staff, petrol pumps have to fixed charges to pay - electric metre charges, staff salary, bank charges, stamping charges, etc which do not reduce in the same proportion as sales reduction, rendering heavy losses to the dealers, he said.

“The dealers have paid March 2020 salary to the staff as per the Government advice and wish to continue doing the same but for how long? We would be suffering heavy losses till sales return to normal,” he said seeking a financial relief package for petrol pump operators. He wanted losses to be compensated by increasing dealers commission immediately. Also, oil companies should provide subsidy on electricity and staff salaries.

In March, that saw travel restrictions being placed in the second half of the month, diesel sales contracted by 24.23 per cent to 5.65 million tonnes. This is the biggest fall in diesel consumption the country has recorded as most trucks went off road and railways stopped plying trains.

Petrol sales dropped 16.37 per cent to 2.15 million tonnes in March as the 21-day nationwide lockdown enforced to prevent the spread of COVID-19 took most cars and two-wheelers off the road.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/petrol-pump-operators-seek-financial-help.html

135,11-4-20,India ready to help its friends in crisis: Modi,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday stressed the need for jointly fighting coronavirus pandemic. This assertion came hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked India for rushing a five-ton cargo of medicines, including anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine. Modi said in response “we have to jointly fight this pandemic.""

The medicines reached Israel, where over 10,000 COVID-19 cases have been reported including 79 deaths, on Tuesday. In a tweet on Thursday, Netanyahu wrote: ""Thank you, my dear friend @narendramodi, Prime Minister of India, for sending Chloroquine to Israel. All the citizens of Israel thank you!""

In his response, Modi wrote: ""We have to jointly fight this pandemic. India is ready to do whatever is possible to help our friends. Praying for the well-being and good health of the people of Israel. @netanyahu.""

The Israeli Prime Minister had requested the supply of hydroxychloroquine during a phone call to Modi on April 3. Moreover, last month, he had urged Modi to approve and allow the export of masks and pharmaceuticals to Israel.

India, one of the world's largest manufacturers of hydroxychloroquine, earlier this week had said it will allow limited exports of the anti-malaria drug to ""nations that have been badly affected"" by the pandemic. The development came after US President Donald Trump cautioned India of “retaliation” if it did not lift the curbs on the export of the drug. The ban was imposed on March 25. More than 30 countries are now looking up to India for this drug which Trump claims will be the “game changer” in battling coronavirus.

Following India’s decision to lift restriction on import, Trump on Wednesday thanked Modi and said India's help during this crisis will not be forgotten. ""Extraordinary times require even closer cooperation between friends. Thank you India and the Indian people for the decision on HCQ. Will not be forgotten! Thank you Prime Minister @NarendraModi for your strong leadership in helping not just India, but humanity, in this fight!"" Trump tweeted.

In his address to the nation on Wednesday, Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro, who attended this year's Republic Day in Delhi as the chief guest, also thanked Modi for ""timely help"". Modi said in response and said in a tweet ""the India-Brazil partnership is stronger than ever in these challenging times. India is committed to contribute to humanity's fight against this pandemic.""",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/india-ready-to-help-its-friends-in-crisis--modi.html
136,11-4-20,High alert on Indo-Nepal border to foil nefarious Covid-push plan,"The Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), the lead intelligence agency along India’s frontiers with Nepal and Bhutan, has alerted the Government and security agencies about suspected coronavirus positive Indian Muslim nationals, working in Islamic countries, being pushed from Nepal to India to spread the pandemic.

Jalim Mukhiya, a hardened criminal, backed by some Pakistani nationals, is trying to facilitate the infiltration of Covid-19 positive suspects, it said in a letter to the Bihar government.

The SSB has alerted all its units along the Nepal border following an intelligence input and also informed its Nepalese counterpart, the Armed Police Force.

As things stand, Bihar is witnessing an alarming surge in the number of corona positive cases. The districts of Siwan, Nawada and Begusarai have already been locked down completely.

In a letter to the District Magistrate and Superintendant of Police of West Champaran district of Bihar on April 3, the SSB said, “Input received from very reliable sources that one person namely Jalim Mukhiya, resident of village Jagannathpur, Post Janki Tola under police station Serwa of district Parsa (Nepal) is planning to spread Corona pandemic in India.”

“He (Mukhiya) is also involved in smuggling of Arms and FICN from Nepal to India. Further, he has taken the responsibility to cross Indian Muslim nationals working in different Muslim countries during lockdown,” reads the SSB alert.

The SSB intelligence further said, “As per source around 200 Indian Muslim nationals (working in Muslim countries) along with 05 to 06 Pakistani nationals have arrived in Nepal via Kathmandu and presently residing in mosque/madrassas at village Chandanbasra and Khairwa in Nepal. As per sources 40 to 50 more suspected Indian Muslim nationals will arrive today and more likely to be arriving in coming days. As per sources, these nationals were consuming Paracetamol tabletsfor lowering temperature on the way and they may be corona positive.”

Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey said a curfew like situation is prevailing in the three districts. People are not allowed to move from one house to another, he said.

The SSB is the designated border guarding force that secures the 2,450 km borders with Nepal and Bhutan.

The SSB has tightened its vigil on the border to check infiltration of such Covid-infected jehadis during the ongoing lockdown. The borders have been sealed in view of the alert, SSB officials added.

Bihar Additional Chief Secretary (Home), Amir Subhani, said the police and Union Home Ministry had been informed. ""SSB did not say people have infiltrated from Nepal, they have only stated that there is a possibility. We have alerted police and Union Home Ministry has been informed. Nobody will be allowed to enter from our borders,"" he told a news agency on Friday.

""All our units all along the 1,751-km-long Nepal border were already on alert since cross-border movement was stopped due to the ongoing lockdown enforced in the country to contain the spread of COVID-19,"" a senior Sashastra Seema Bal official said adding, ""With this new modus operandi being detected and intelligence generated, we have asked all the units to be cautious.""",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/high-alert-on-indo-nepal-border-to-foil-nefarious-covid-push-plan.html
137,11-4-20,Congress president asks State units to help poor,"Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Friday urged the State unit party chiefs and workers to do their best in solving the problems faced by the citizens, particularly the poor and migrants, during the corona pandemic lockdown.

Sonia through video conferencing said that already the economy of the country were in tatters and the current COVID 19 scare will make things worse hence be prepared.

On their part, Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking him to help ferry the stranded migrant labourers back to their respective states, while Party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra wrote to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath seeking an increase in the coronavirus testing in the state.

During this PCC meet, Sonia said that this is a time of great crisis for the country and all of us and in such circumstances such a meeting is being held for the first time.

“The country is fighting to stop the Corona epidemic. In this fight we are fully ready to play our role. You all know that Congress officials in every state , Our workers have been engaged in serving the countrymen for many weeks,"" she stated.

Sonia continued with her point and said, “You must have known that I and former President Rahul Gandhi also gave some suggestions by writing letters to the Prime Minister. Our hope is that the government plans to meet this challenge. Most The poor, farmers and laborers are suffering more and more pain. “

Sonia also talked about the country’s economy. “Our economy is going to have a lot of burden due to the lockdown. Already the economy was in crisis – it seems that now more difficulties will increase. We have to prepare for these situations. In public misery, the public Will have to support and will have to make every effort to remove their problems,"" she mentioned.

During this period, Sonia also asked the state Congress presidents to know the condition of their states.

Chowdhury sought PM's intervention in movement of stranded migrant labourers back to their respective states.

""Sir, may I suggest your good office to arrange ferrying these people to their homes or at least nearest point from where their respective States would assure them safe return to home,"" he wrote in his letter.

Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury also added that he would recommend using special 'COVID protection Trains' for this purpose.

Priyanka demanded that facilities for testing and treatment of COVID-19 and to control the spread of the pandemic be ramped up in the state. She cited the example of South Korea to argue that screening should be increased to contain the virus.

“South Korea has a population of 6 crore. The country screened six persons per 1000 people and successfully prevented the spread of the virus,” she said in her letter citing the example of Congress ruled Rajasthan where in Bhilwara 24 lakh people were screened in just nine days for the virus to identify those infected.

“Uttar Pradesh is home to 23 crore people but only 7,000 people have been screened. This number is very less for a state like Uttar Pradesh,” she said.

The Congress leader said authorities should conduct testing on mild to moderate high risk cases and treat them on a war footing.

Priyanka noted that reports are coming about community transmission of the disease from some parts of the state. She said urban areas are badly affected and reports have emerged that people are hiding their disease.

She said that measures should be taken to instil confidence in the people and encourage them to come up for testing. She also said the government should improve sanitation facilities and distribute free ration to the poor.

“The Government should ensure distribution of masks and hand sanatiser among the people and apprise the public of where they can get masks and sanitiser,” she added.

She further said that the opposition is with the government in this fight against the pandemic. “Coronavirus does not see any religion or caste and affects everyone. In this battle, there is a need to take steps by keeping our political ideologies away and help bring people together and create a fear-free atmosphere,” she said.

138,11-4-20,ICMR OK’s use of TB diagnostic machines for coronavirus tests,"As the country awaits the rapid anti-bodies kits, which the Government said will be made available by April 8, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in its bid to ramp up the testing capacity has approved the use of diagnostic machines used for testing drug-resistant tuberculosis for conducting coronavirus tests.

The ICMR has validated ‘TruenatTM beta CoV test on TruelabTM workstation’ and has recommended it as a screening test, the apex health research body said on Friday.

Issuing a guidance on the use of Truenat beta CoV, the ICMR said throat/nasal swabs will be collected in the viral transport medium (VTM) with virus lysis buffer provided along with the kit.

“Earlier studies have shown that virus lysis buffer neutralizes Nipah and H1N1 viruses. The results of stability of viral RNA after neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by virus lysis buffer are awaited from ICMR-NIV, Pune.”

“Till such time, Truenat beta CoV test should only be performed with all biosafety precautions in BSL-2 or BSL-3 setups at laboratories,” it said.

The revised guidelines will be issued once the results from ICMR-NIV, Pune are available, it said.

A few days back, the Government had allowed rapid antibody testing in India and has also issued guidelines in this regard. The experts believe that it will help the agencies to enhance screening and identifying capabilities.

India has already purchased around 5 lakh testing kits from the United States, China and South Korea. However, sources in the Ministry said, these kits are yet to arrive in the country.

To ensure speedy detection of Coronavirus cases, those residing in COVID-19 hotspots or areas which have reported large numbers of cases, the rapid antibody testing was planned.

Presently, the government uses the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the Coronavirus from samples of throat or nasal swab of people with symptoms or high-risk individuals who might have come in contact with positive patients.

The rapid testing kits are quicker to get early results. They use blood samples of suspected patients and normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result.

Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary in the Union Health Ministry said, at the daily press briefing here, ""There are 146 government labs and 67 private labs now. Earlier, we conducted 5,000-6,000 tests per day, but on Thursday, 16,002 tests were done. We are making 2.5 labs operational per day.”

He also allayed fears of a shortage of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) drug.""We have a domestic requirement of 1 crore hydroxychloroquine tablets while we have 3.28 crore hcq tablets available now,"" he maintained.

Manoj Murhekar, Director, National Institute of Epidemiology, who was also present at the press conference, told the media, ""A total of 144,910 samples were tested till 9 p.m. on Thursday from 103,792 suspected patients, of which 5,075 returned positive. We conducted 16,002 tests in single day.

140,11-4-20,ICAR to conduct test on wildlife for coronavirus,"With a tigress in a US zoo found Coronavirus positive, India has decided to conduct testing on wildlife and pets as preventive steps to fight the deadly virus.

The move has also come a day after the World Health Organisation officials said they’re investigating several cases where pets, and even a tiger, appear to have been infected with the coronavirus by their human caretakers.

Sources said that the Union Environment Ministry in consultation with the Union Health Ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has asked the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) to conduct testing on them.

The sources said that three institutes of the ICAR have been selected for conducting Covid testing on wildlife samples.

These institutes are the Indian Veterinary Research Institute in Izatnagar, the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases in Bhopal and National Research Centre on Equines in Hisar.

After the tigress in Bronx Zoo in New York tested positive for Covid-19 last week, the Government has put on high alert the zoos and tiger reserves across the country.

Last month, a pet cat was also infected with the novel coronavirus in Belgium. The animals are believed to have contracted the virus from the people they live with.

According to the World Organisation for Animal Health, cats and ferrets are the most susceptible species for Covid-19.

However, there is no study as such which can say that pets can transmit the virus to humans.

“We’re aware of two dogs that have been infected in Hong Kong, a cat in Belgium and we’ve heard recently the reports of a tiger at the Bronx Zoo,” Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead on the outbreak, said during a press conference on Wednesday. “There are several groups that are conducting investigations in animals to really understand how pets are infected,” she said.

One study conducted on cats in Wuhan found that the pets could be infected with the coronavirus, Kerkhove said. She added that world officials don’t believe that the animals are playing a role in transmission to humans, although humans can infect animals.

Kerkhove said the WHO is working closely with the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health to look more in-depth at the coronavirus in animals.

It’s “really important we remain respectful and kind” to the animals that are likely to be co-infected with humans, Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s health emergencies program, said on Wednesday.

In the meantime, washing your hands before and after interacting with a pet—same as you would with a fellow human—is the safest thing to do, say the experts.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/icar-to-conduct-test-on-wildlife-for-coronavirus.html
141,11-4-20,States told to ban use and spitting of smokeless products in public places,"Taking cue from the States like Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Assam which have prohibited the use and spitting of smokeless products in public places amid Coronavirus outbreak, the Union Health Ministry on Friday urged all the States to invoke appropriate laws to prevent the infectious disease.

It cited the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) appeal too asking the people not to consume and spit smokeless tobacco in public places.

According to the ICMR, the harmful effects of tobacco use are well established and accepted globally. Also the role of tobacco use/spitting in public place in spreading infectious diseases like Coronavirus. Chewing of smokeless tobacco products (gutkha, zarda, khaini and other chewing tobacco products and paan masala) and areca nut (supari) increases the production of saliva followed by a very strong urge to spit.

Spitting in public places increases the dangers of spread of Coronavirus/Covid-19.

The Ministry said that the State Governments have the necessary authority under the Epidemic Diseases Act,1897, the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and the Indian Penal Code 1860 to deal with Coronavirus/Covid-19.

In fact, several State Governments have already invoked relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code 1860 and other laws to prohibit the sale, use and spitting of chewing tobacco, to check the spread of Coronavirus/Covid-19 and other infectious diseases.

States like Bihar, Jharkhand, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarkhand, Maharashtra, Haryana, Nagaland and Assam have already issued orders on the ban of use of smokeless tobacco products and spitting in public places during the COVID epidemic.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/states-told-to-ban-use-and-spitting-of-smokeless-products-in-public-places.html

Britain’s death toll has passed the daily peaks recorded in Italy and Spain, the two European countries with the highest number of Covid-19 deaths.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 55, spent three nights in the intensive care unit at St. Thomas’ Hospital in London after his COVID-19 symptoms worsened. He was moved back to a regular ward on Thursday evening, and his office said he was in “the early phase of his recovery.”

Italy: Pressure on Italy’s hospitals fighting the coronavirus pandemic continued to ease Friday with 108 fewer intensive care cases and 157 fewer hospital admissions in the last 24 hours.

Ireland: The Irish Government has extended the lockdown in the country by three weeks until May 5 as it tries to keep a lid on the coronavirus pandemic. The current lockdown was due to expire on Sunday, but the country’s premier, Leo Varadkar, said the government was accepting the recommendations of experts that it was necessary to “persevere” with the lockdown. He said the Government is “planning carefully” about how to bring about an end to the country’s lockdown so life can return to normal. The truth, he said, is that “nobody knows for certain” when life will be normal again “or how our lives will be different when it comes.”

Greece: Greece has extended its lockdown on all preschools, schools and universities until May 10 at least. The measure was first imposed March 10. Also Friday, Greek authorities said a total 21 people have tested positive for COVID-19 in a majority-Roma neighborhood of the central city of Larissa. The neighborhood of some 3,500 people was quarantined Thursday, with a ban on anyone entering or leaving it.

145,11-4-20,Moscow stretched ‘to limit’ by virus cases: Official,"Moscow’s hospitals and ambulance service are working at peak capacity after a sharp rise in those hospitalised with serious coronavirus complications, a senior city official said on Friday.

The densely populated capital with more than 12 million residents has the largest outbreak in Russia, with 7,822 confirmed coronavirus casesout of a national total of almost 12,000.

The number in Moscow’s hospitals has doubled since last week and more than 85 per cent of these patients have pneumonia, deputy mayor Anastasia Rakova was quoted as saying on the city virus task force’s Telegram account.

Moscow is not sending people with mild symptoms to hospitals. Those who test positive are monitored through online video consultations.

“Along with the growing numbers of people who are seriously ill, pressure has grown sharply on the capital’s health service. Our inpatient facilities and ambulance service are now working at their limits,” Rakova said. Moscow has been under a lockdown since March 30 with residents only allowed to leave their homes for essential work, to buy food and medicine or to walk dogs within a radius of 100 metres. Driving private cars is permitted, however.

Meanwhile, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin warned that the epidemic was not even close to its peak. “I can tell you for sure: there hasn’t been any peak yet. We are more in the foothills of this peak, not even in the middle,” Sobyanin, who is also the head of a taskforce coordinating regional responses, told the RIA Novosti news agency.

Lord Tariq Ahmad, the Minister of State for South Asia and the Commonwealth in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), said the shipment is symbolic of the cooperative way both countries have been working through this unprecedented global crisis.

“The UK and India continue to work in close partnership to respond to the Covid-19 threat. My sincere

thanks on behalf of the UK Government to India for approving this important shipment,” Ahmad said.

The shipment, set to arrive on a plane by Sunday, will coincide with a series of charter flights laid on by the UK government to ferry thousands of British residents stranded in India’s coronavirus lockdown.

“We have been working very closely with the Indian authorities, here at the Indian High Commission

in London, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), and at state level in India to put in place all the necessary requirements for British nationals wanting to return to the UK,” Ahmad said.

“The sheer logistics of this exercise involves every individual who has registered on to our central database being sent detailed information about booking their seat on the flights as well as local support for them to be able to get to the airports in the particular states, given the lockdown and curfews in place,” he said.

The travellers are set to be flown out from Goa, Mumbai, Delhi, Amritsar, Ahmedabad, Thiruvananthapuram via Kochi, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Chennai via Bengaluru over the coming week.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/uk-expects-first-batch-of-3-mn-paracetamol-packets-from-india-soon----.html

Xi asked officials to strengthen monitoring and law enforcement of production safety even as coronavirus cases began to rise again in China following the return of Chinese nationals from abroad in big numbers. “Authorities should firmly hold the bottom line of workplace safety,” Xi was quoted as saying by the state-run Xinhua news agency on Friday.

Noting that the country had made progress in workplace safety last year with the number of accidents declining, Xi said there remained many risks and much work is yet to be done.

Workplace safety must not be regarded as a trivial matter or treated with formalism or bureaucracy, Xi said.

In view of the main features and outstanding problems in workplace safety, Xi said efforts should be made to improve the responsibility system, ensure strict rectification of problems found, and strengthen risk prevention and control so that hidden dangers could be fundamentally eliminated and major accidents effectively curbed.

150,11-4-20,Pre-monsoon sowing of kharif crops begins,"Amid the nationwide coronavirus lockdown, pre-monsoon sowing of kharif crops has begun across the country with paddy acreage 27 per cent higher at 32.58 lakh hectare so far as compared to last season.

As per the latest data by the Ministry of Agriculture, farmers have sown paddy in 32.58 lakh hectare as on Friday, up 27 per cent, from 23.81 lakh hectare in the corresponding period of last year. Total area planted under all kharif crops has increased to 48.76 lakh hectare so far this season as against 37.12 lakh hectare in same period last year.

The Ministry of Agriculture has asked NAFED to export 50,000 metric tonnes (MT) wheat to Afghanistan and 40,000 MT wheat to Lebanonon their specific demand under G2G arrangement.

The sowing area has been reported mainly from West Bengal (11.25 lakh hectare), Telangana (7.45 lakh hectare), Odisha (3.13 lakh hectare), Assam (2.73 lakh hectare), Karnataka (1.64 lakh hectare) and Chhattisgarh (1.50 lakh hectare). The sowing will pick up with the onset of south-west monsoon (June-September), which delivers about 70 per cent of the country’s annual rainfall. Paddy is the main kharif crop besides pulses and oilseeds. Kharif season starts from June and ends in September.

Some other States are also on the list including Tamil Nadu (1.30 lakh hectare), Bihar (1.22 lakh hectare), Maharashtra (0.65 lakh hectare), Madhya Pradesh (0.59 lakh hectare), Gujarat (0.54lakh hectare) and Kerala (0.46 lakh hectare), the ministry said.

Area sown to pulses has increased to 3.97 lakh hectare from 3.01 lakh hectare in the said period. Of which, greengram has been planted in 2.59 lakh hectare and black gram in 1.23 lakh hectare and other pulses in 0.15 lakh hectare so far. Similarly, area under coarse cereals has increased to 5.54 lakh hectare so far in the current kharif season of this year from 4.33 lakh hectare a year-ago. Of which, maize has been planted in 2.81 lakh hectare and bajra in 2.51 lakh hectare in the said period. In case of oilseeds too, the sowing area has increased to 6.66 lakh hectare from 5.97 lakh hectare in the said period. Of which, groundnut has been sown in 4.08 lakh hectare, while that of sesamum in 2.13 lakh hectare in the said period.

The ministry has circulated the SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) related to crop harvesting and threshing during Kharif 2020 to the States to protect health of farmers and farm workers and to contain the spread of Coronavirus outbreak. According to the ministry, during Rabi season 202,0 NAFED has procured 1,07,814 MT Pulses (Gram: 1,06,170 MT) and Oilseeds on MSP totaling of Rs. 526.84 crore. This has benefitted 75,984 farmers. India had a good crop of wheat, in surplus of its own demand.

151,11-4-20,Global deal to cut oil output in sight after Mexico signs up,"The OPEC oil cartel and nations, including Russia, have agreed to boost oil prices by cutting as much as 10 million barrels a day in production. Even more countries, including the US, were discussing Friday their own cuts in what would be an unprecedented global pact to stabilise the market.

The agreement between OPEC and partner countries aims to cut 10 million barrels per day until July, then an 8 million barrels per day cut through the end of the year, and 6 million a day for 16 months beginning in 2021.

Mexico had initially blocked the deal but its president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, said on Friday he had agreed with US President Donald Trump that the US will compensate what Mexico cannot add to the proposed cuts.

That paves the way for cuts that experts estimate could reach 15 million barrels a day in all — about 15% of world production. Such a move would be unprecedented both in its size and the number of participating countries, many of whom have long been bitter rivals in the energy industry.

The price of crude is down by over 50 per cent since the start of the year and while that helps consumers and energy-hungry businesses, it is below the cost of production for many countries and companies.

That has strained the budgets of oil-producing nations, many of which are developing economies, and it has pushed private companies in the US toward bankruptcy.

Analysts warn even these proposed cuts may not be enough to offset the loss in demand over the longer term, as the coronavirus pandemic has decimated demand for energy around the world.

“COVID-19 is an unseen beast that seems to be impacting everything in its path,” OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo said at the start of the meeting, according to a statement.

“There is a grizzly shadow hanging over all of us. We do not want this shadow to envelope us. It will have a crushing and long-term impact on the entire industry.”

Mexico had balked at cutting its output by the requested 4,00,000 barrels a day.

Obrador said Mexico will instead cut its oil production by 1,00,000 barrels per day from its current level of 1.7 million barrels a day. The US will add a cut of 2,50,000 barrels per day to what it has already agreed.

More nations were expected to add to the effort, with Saudi Arabia chairing a Group of 20 virtual meeting of energy Ministers on Friday to discuss the oversupply in the market.

The meeting is expected to bring onboard a wider number of countries, including the US. Saudi media quoted Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman as saying in his opening remarks that the pandemic means it is more vital than ever that reliable and affordable energy supplies are available.

The oil market was already oversupplied when Russia and OPEC failed to agree on output cuts in early March. Analysts say Russia refused to back even a moderate cut because it would have only served to help US energy companies that were pumping at full capacity. Stalling would hurt American shale-oil producers and protect market share.

Russia’s move enraged Saudi, which not only said it would not cut production on its own but said it would increase output instead and reduce its selling prices in what became effectively a global pricing war.

In the time since, prices have collapsed as the coronavirus and the COVID-19 illness it causes have largely halted global travel. International benchmark Brent crude traded Friday over $31 a barrel while the US benchmark West Texas crude traded under $23.

In Russia relies on oil as the main source of income and the price collapse caused the ruble to crash. That boosted the cost of imports and sped up inflation. In his opening remarks at the start of Thursday’s call, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak emphasized the need for “all oil-producing countries to pool efforts to change the situation of a significant global oversupply”. He said global demand had fallen by 10-15 millions barrels a day.

“We believe it necessary to increase the number of countries that could join efforts to help stabilise the situation,” he said, welcoming Norway, Canada, Indonesia and others that hadn’t been part of the so-called OPEC+ talks.

Analysts, however, warn the proposed 10 million barrel per day cut for May and June will not be enough to offset plummeting demand for oil globally, and runs the risk of coming too late as storage capacity for oil nears its maximum.

Even if North American producers took 5 million barrels a day off the market, there could still be an excess supply of 5-10 million barrels per day.

Research firm Rystad Energy estimates the imbalance for April is 27.4 million barrels per day. The firm says global storage of crude is already close to being filled to the brim, estimating that on average 79 per cent of the world’s oil storage capacity is already full.

Around 7.4 billion barrels of crude and products are in storage, including 1.3 billion currently on board tankers at sea. Chris Midgley, global head of analytics for S&P Global Platts, said the proposed cuts are unlikely to have any significant impact on April supply, and thus run the risk of getting close to exhausting all available storage in May.

However, a cut of 10-15 million barrels per day is enough to prop up oil prices and helps to reduce strain on crude storage facilities, analysts said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/global-deal-to-cut-oil-output-in-sight-after-mexico-signs-up-2020-04-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/global-deal-to-cut-oil-output-in-sight-after-mexico-signs-up.html
152,11-4-20,How to make financial planning easy with an online personal loan calculator,"As a collateral-free and restriction-free financing solution, you can use a personal loan to meet a variety of financial needs, be it a medical emergency or consolidating high-interest debts. Today, availing a personal loan has become easier than ever with many lenders offering an online personal loan to borrowers on meeting simple eligibility criteria.

However, Bajaj Finserv’s Instant Personal Loan combines convenience and speed with pre-approved offers for eligible customers. This instant online personal loan entails zero paperwork, so you don’t need to check eligibility criteria or submit any documents. With a 100% digital process, you can get money in your bank account in just 20 minutes in 2 clicks!

However, even as getting a personal loan has become hassle-free and quick, what you need to do is thoroughly evaluate your repayment capability before you opt for one. This will help you repay the loan on time and even boost your credit score. All you need to do is calculate loan EMI beforehand using the online personal loan calculator. Read on to know how and why.

What is a personal loan EMI calculator and how does it work?

A personal loan EMI calculator is an online tool that you can use to compute your loan EMIs. All you need to do is enter your preferred loan amount, repayment tenor and the lender’s rate of interest to get instant results. The personal Loan EMI Calculator from Bajaj Finserv allows you to enter the details manually or use the slider to adjust the values.

It uses the following formula to calculate your personal loan EMIs:

E = P * r * (1+r) ^n / ((1+r) ^n-1)

E refers to the EMI

P refers to the principal amount or loan amount you borrow

r is the rate of interest applied to your loan, which is calculated monthly

n is the repayment duration or tenor

When you calculate loan EMI, remember that if you wish to repay the loan amount over a longer tenor, then your EMIs will be smaller but the total interest you pay will be higher. This is because the interest is applied over a longer duration. Similarly, a shorter tenor will mean higher EMIs, but a lower rate of interest, which means you can save more. Using the online personal loan calculator, you can adjust and change the figures until you arrive at the ideal EMI that suits your income and budget.

How does the online personal loan calculator help in effective financial planning?

Simple and easy to use

The online personal loan calculator is a simple tool that does not take much of your time or effort while providing you with the results in a split second! It also negates the need for doing manual calculations using the complex formula or using the Excel calculation method, both of which are prone to human errors. Since this tool is available to your 24/7 online, you can use it anytime and anywhere to compute your EMIs and plan repayment easily.

Accurate results with a visual depiction

As opposed to calculating EMIs manually, using an online personal loan calculator helps you generate precise results every time based on the correct formula. This helps you avoid any errors in calculation that have the potential to mess up your financial planning or stress your budget during repayment.

Further, a few EMI calculators like the Bajaj Finserv Personal Loan EMI Calculator offer a pictorial representation in form of a pie chart showing you the percentage of the total interest you pay against the principal you borrow. This helps you understand your interest outgo better. What’s more, this calculator also shows you a glimpse of your EMI repayment schedule with a calendar that you can use. All this helps you understand the cost of the loan as well as what your repayment timetable could look like.

Helps determine your repayment capability

Since an online personal loan calculator helps you get accurate results for various combinations of the principal amount and tenor, you can plan your EMIs better. Based on your income as well as fixed and variable expenses, you can choose the right EMI for yourself by adjusting the tenor or the principal amount. This way, you can choose the right loan amount from the get-go or plan for repayment in a timeline that suits you. This customisation is key to better financial management.

Aids in choosing the most affordable lender

Apart from the principal and the tenor, your EMIs are dependent on the rate of interest offered by lenders. Using an online personal loan calculator, you can easily determine how even a small reduction in interest can help you save thousands. This way, you can also choose the right lender offering the lowest rate of interest. However, do not forget to make note of other loan features and value-added services before choosing a lender.

Now that you know how an online personal loan calculator helps you in making a financially responsible decision, get funds in no time with the instant Personal Loan from Bajaj Finserv. While existing customers of Bajaj Finserv get a pre-filled form to avail funds and may not need to share any additional paperwork, new customers need to submit only a few basic documents. Either way, there is no need to meet any representatives or visit a branch, and you can get the money you need from the comfort of home. Before you initiate this 100% digital process, make sure to calculate loan EMI.

To get the funds you need right away, simply check your pre-approved offer and enjoy an instant and hassle-free experience.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/how-to-make-financial-planning-easy-with-an-online-personal-loan-calculator-2020-04-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/how-to-make-financial-planning-easy-with-an-online-personal-loan-calculator.html
153,11-4-20,G20 ministers struggle to finalise oil output cuts despite US efforts,"Top oil producers struggled to finalise production cuts during a virtual summit held by G20 energy ministers on Friday, despite US President Donald Trump's mediation efforts to end a standoff with Mexico.

The final G20 communique appeared to gloss over simmering divisions over energy policy, making no mention of output cuts and pledging simply to ensure oil ""market stability"" amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Mexico was the lone holdout in a record OPEC-led agreement reached a day earlier that would see output slashed by 10 million barrels per day in May and June followed by a gradual reduction in cuts until April 2022.

The standoff had cast doubt on efforts to bolster oil prices, pushed to near two-decade lows by the demand-sapping pandemic and a Saudi-Russia price war that rattled global markets.

The subsequent G20 meeting -- hosted by Riyadh -- was expected to seal the deal more widely with non-OPEC countries in the group including Mexico, the United States and Canada.

But there was no sign of an agreement in the group's final statement.

""We commit to ensure that the energy sector continues to make a full, effective contribution to overcoming COVID-19 and powering the subsequent global recovery,"" said the statement released early Saturday.

""We commit to take all the necessary and immediate measures to ensure energy market stability."" There was no sign that countries such as Canada -- the world's fourth largest producer -- had committed to specific cuts, with Natural Resources Minister Seamus O'Regan saying the G20 summit ""didn't discuss numbers"".

Under the OPEC deal, Mexico was expected to cut production by 400,000 barrels per day but it resisted the suggestion.

Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he had reached an agreement with Trump to cut production by only 100,000 bpd.

He added that Trump had agreed to cut US production by 250,000 bpd ""as compensation"" for Mexico.

Trump later confirmed the deal, saying the United States will ""make up the difference"" by cutting ""some US production"".

The G20 statement was silent on the Mexico-US deal.

The tentative production cut deal, which hinges on Mexico's consent for it to take effect, marked a possible end of the price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Both oil producers took on the lion's share of the cuts as they agreed to slash output to around 8.5 million bpd, according to Bloomberg News.

""Our global energy systems, from producers to consumers, is in uncharted territory and it is our responsibility to find the path forward,"" Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told the G20 gathering.

""Saudi Arabia urges all G20 members, including Mexico, as well as invited countries to take appropriate and extraordinary measures to stabilise market conditions.""

Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak also urged the G20 ministers to act in a spirit of ""partnership and solidarity"", according to a local television station.

OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo warned the global crude storage capacity would be exhausted before the end of May because of a supply glut and a ""jaw-dropping"" drop in demand.

""There is a ghostly spectre encircling the oil industry,"" Barkindo told the ministers.

""We need to act now, so we can come out of (the) other side of this pandemic with the strength of our industry intact."" The impact of the tentative deal on prices was not immediately clear as the global oil markets were shut on Friday for the Easter weekend.

But Stephen Innes, an analyst at AxiCorp, said the supply cuts were ""less than the market hoped for"" given the hit to demand from coronavirus lockdowns throughout the world.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/g20-ministers-struggle-to-finalise-oil-output-cuts-despite-us-efforts-2020-04-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/g20-ministers-struggle-to-finalise-oil-output-cuts-despite-us-efforts.html

155,11-4-20,Economic devastation looms on Good Friday,"Christians around the world observed a Good Friday like no other, at home watching livestreams instead of at church, as pressure mounted on Governments to restart some industries and fend off further economic devastation from the coronavirus.

Politicians and public health officials warned the public against letting the virus come roaring back by relaxing social distancing over the Easter holiday weekend, and they urged Christians to celebrate the holiday safely at home. Authorities resorted to using roadblocks and other means to discourage travel.

In Italy, officials used helicopters, drones and stepped-up police checks to make sure people don’t slip out of their homes over the holiday. On Thursday alone, police stopped some 3,00,000 people around Italy to ensure they had permission to travel. About 10,000 were given summonses. Some churches held virtual services online, while others arranged prayers at drive-in theatres.

In locked-down Paris, fire-scarred Notre Dame Cathedral came back to life briefly, days before the first anniversary of the April 15 inferno that ravaged it. Good Friday observances led by the archbishop were broadcast live from the nearly empty, closed-to-the-public cathedral.

In addition to the lives lost, the pandemic has slammed economies around the world. The head of the International Monetary Fund warned that the global economy is headed for the worst recession since the Depression.

In Europe, the 19 countries that use the euro currency overcame weeks of bitter divisions to agree on spending $550 billion to cushion the recession caused by the virus.

Mario Centeno, who heads the eurozone finance ministers’ group, called the package “totally unprecedented... Tonight Europe has shown it can deliver when the will is there”. As weeks of lockdowns were extended in nation after nation, Governments were pressed to ease restrictions on key businesses and industries.

After a two-week freeze on all nonessential economic activity, Spain decided to allow factories and construction sites to resume work on Monday, while schools, most shops and offices will remain closed. Spanish authorities said they trust that the move won’t cause a significant surge in infections.

“We wouldn’t be adopting them otherwise,” said Maria Jose Sierra of Spain’s health emergency centre. In Italy, the industrial lobbies in regions representing 45 per cent of the country’s economic output urged the Government to ease its two-week lockdown on all nonessential manufacturing, saying the country “risks definitively shutting down its own motor, and every day that passes the risk grows not to be able to restart it”.

Malaysia’s Prime Minister announced a two-week extension to the country’s lockdown but said selected economic sectors can reopen in phases while following strict hygiene rules.

157,11-4-20,New York buries unclaimed bodies at fast pace to clear space in morgues for victims,"New York is burying unclaimed bodies at a rapid pace to clear space in the city’s morgues, where mortal remains of coronavirus patients are piling up, according to a media report.

A report in The New York Times said every Thursday was burial day on Hart Island, the final resting place off the Bronx for New York City’s unclaimed dead. “But as with many things, coronavirus has changed all that,” it said.

Burials are now being done five days a week at Hart Island, with roughly 25 bodies lowered into trenches each day, according to a city official.

“That is as many burials as would typically be done in a week before the virus hit,” the report said.

Drone footage and images of burial crews in freshly dug muddy trenches burying body after body in bare wooden boxes are circulating in social media. New York is the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US and is seeing record number of deaths due to the virus.

The state recorded the highest single day death toll for the third consecutive day on Thursday as 799 people died due to the deadly viral infection. So far more than 7,000 people have died in the state from Covid-19, several times more than the total number of people killed in the devastating 9/11 terror attacks.

The NYT report quoted a city official as saying that the only people being buried at the island for now are those for whom the city has been unable to contact next of kin for some time. “We understand extenuating circumstances,” the official said, noting that bodies that have not been claimed because their families are under quarantine or on lockdown or for some other reason will not be buried on Hart Island.

The report said the city’s morgues used to have adequate space to hold unclaimed bodies for 30 to 60 days before they were buried on Hart island. But now, with the pace of the coronavirus death toll increasing, the city is moving to bury more of those people to clear space in the morgues.

“Because we didn’t have pressure on the system, we didn’t have to move them quickly,” the official said, adding, “We are now burying people who have been sitting with us for quite some time.”

The official said it is possible that the burial of the unclaimed bodies of Covid-19 victims has already begun, because people have been dying of the virus for weeks.

“We know that if it didn’t happen yesterday, it’s only a matter of days until people are buried because of the time that has passed,” the official said on Friday morning, referring to victims of the disease.

The county championship, comprising four-day matches, was due to start on Sunday but English cricket is shut down until at least May 28, with the expectation of further postponements.

England are meant to play a three-Test series against the West Indies in June, with the opening match at The Oval starting on June 4.

But England team director Giles told reporters in a conference call on Thursday: “The deadline of May 28 still stands but it’s looking less and less likely that we’re going to be out there in June.

“We have to look at alternatives.”

Following the visit of the West Indies, England are meant to play home series against Pakistan, Australia and Ireland as well.

“We are looking at scenarios where we can push those matches back as far as possible without losing any cricket,” said Giles.

“Whether eventually games start falling off the calendar right now we don’t know.

“If we can’t get it all, it’s really important we work in partnership with all the other boards to fulfil those fixtures but with a priority on keeping people safe.”

Squad match idea

Meanwhile the former England spinner said an intra-squad match similar to the one Australia played before last year’s Ashes could serve as a warm-up fixture for his side if the season can get underway.

With Britain currently in lockdown, players cannot go straight from their homes into the international arena.

“From a playing point of view certainly, I think we’ll need to play a couple of warm-up games,” Giles said.

“They could be behind closed doors, they could be among England players — none of us really know until we get there.”

Following last year’s one-day World Cup in England, the Australians played a three-day 12-a-side match at Southampton as their sole warm-up fixture for the Ashes.

Giles, asked about an intra-squad match, replied: “If we had to, I think that would be a decent way around a problem if we weren’t playing cricket more broadly. I think we could do that.” Giles added he was also open to the possibility of England’s Test and one-day teams playing at the same time if that was the best way to fulfil fixtures in a shortened season.

“We have got enough depth where we can split our resources but we haven’t got that far,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/giles-expects-delay-to-windies-series---.html
159,11-4-20,Beckham one of all time great in midfield: R9,"Brazilian football great Ronaldo has said that former England captain and his Real Madrid teammate David Beckham is one of the best players of all time.

Ronaldo and Beckham were both part of the famous Galacticos’ team between 2003 until 2007.

“One of the first people that I ever saw was you,” Beckham said to Ronaldo over Instagram Live. “When you walked into the changing room it made me comfortable to be in the club.”

Ronaldo replied, saying: “Man, you are amazing. For me, you are one of the best of all time in the centre.

“The way you would touch the ball, the way you could get the ball wherever you want, and without looking at me. I should thank you for the many balls you gave to me,” said the ace striker.

160,11-4-20,Virus-affected WTC should be extended: Azhar,"Pakistan Test captain Azhar Ali has backed head coach-cum-chief selector Misbah-ul-Haq’s suggestion that the coronavirus-affected World Test Championship should be extended in the wake of the global pandemic.

He believes cricketing action should return to action in future “even it is behind closed doors” but without compromising on the health of the players.

“If, hopefully, in the near future cricket is possible and the health of people is not compromised, I’m sure every cricketer will say we should get cricket back on, even if it is behind closed doors,” Ali said in a video conference with reporters.

“There is no sport on TV right now that people can watch. They will be happy to get sport back on TV. People’s health is more important, but if we can get sport going without imperilling that, I’d support it.”

Ali is confident that world body ICC will do the needful.

“I’m sure the ICC will look at this. The Test Championship was a long competition anyway, so I don’t think it would be a big deal to extend it if the series cannot be held in time; I’d support extending the Test championship,” he added.

Azhar’s statement came after Misbah called for an extension of the World Test C’ship as and when cricket resumes in order to provide a fair and equal playing field to all teams.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/virus-affected-wtc-should-be-extended--azhar.html
161,11-4-20,"Tendulkar best I ever saw, Kohli best among current lot: Clarke","Former Australian captain Michael Clarke feels Virat Kohli’s fetish for big hundreds is similar to the iconic Sachin Tendulkar, who was the “hardest to get out” with a technique which “didn’t have a weakness”.

Clarke said he can’t recall a batsman as complete as Sachin during his playing days.

“Probably technically the best batsman (Tendulkar) I ever saw. The hardest batsman to get out. I think Sachin, technically, didn’t have a weakness. Part of you hoped that he made a mistake,” Clarke told the Big sports Breakfast radio show.

He then went on heap praise on Kohli, calling him the best batsman across all formats among the current lot.

“I think right now the best batsman across all three formats. His one day and T20 records are phenomenal and he’s also found a way to dominate Test cricket.

162,11-4-20,‘Cristiano obsessed with winning’,"The Polish goalkeeper of Juventus FC Wojciech Szczesny praised his teammate Cristiano Ronaldo as the Portuguese “is obsessed with winning and he thinks just about work, even at trainings”.

On Friday the Pole was asked by the Polish TV Eleven Sports to compare Cristiano Ronaldo to Szczesny’s compatriot Robert Lewandowski from Bayern Munich.

“I think Cristiano is more focused on work. There are jokes before and during the training. He is a machine. Lewandowski is a little more relaxed. I don’t compare who works more, but who is obsessed with this work. It’s definitely Cristiano,” said the Juventus custodian.

“Cristiano has an egoist face on the pitch and I think that face makes him one of the best players in football history. It sometimes makes him look frustrated and thus looks selfish. It’s just an obsession with winning, an obsession with being the best and requiring others to help him. It would be unhealthy if there were six, seven or ten people with such a character in the dressing room, but one that pushes others to be better is positive,” added Szczesny.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---cristiano-obsessed-with-winning---.html

The Under-17 Women’s World Cup, which was scheduled to be held in India in November, was postponed by football’s governing body (FIFA) last week due to the worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic across the globe.

Patel said the Local Organising Committee (LOC) is working in close collaboration with FIFA to finalise the dates in the “earliest possible timeline”.

“I am happy to share that we are working with #FIFA to choose a new and earliest possible timeline to host the U-17 Women’s World Cup. The LOC and FIFA are working in close collaboration to finalise new dates keeping health and safety a priority,” Patel wrote on his Twitter handle.

“We are also in discussions with #FIFA to keep the age criteria of U-17 Women’s World Cup the same as originally planned, so that all the players who have been working very hard to prepare for the tournament, do not miss an opportunity to play due to the postponement,” Patel added.

164,11-4-20,Oly postponement gives more time for preparation: Race walker Irfan,"Race walker K T Irfan has no complaints regrading the postponement of the Olympics to next year due to the COVID-19 pandemic as he says it will give him more time to prepare for the Tokyo Games.

The 30-year-old Irfan qualified for his second Olympics after finishing fourth in the 20 km race walk event in the Asian Race Walking Championship last year.

“It’s good that it (Tokyo Games) got postponed. We can take this as a base to train more and get closer to win a medal. Race Walking is a technical event, so I will get time to focus on it more, this will help us do better next year,” Irfan said.

Asked about his target in the Tokyo Olympics, he said, “My main aim is to win a medal. In Rio Olympics, I had injured myself, in London also I had chance of winning a medal.

Irfan finished 10th in the 2012 London Olympics with a national record time of 1 hour 20 minute 21 seconds. He did not qualify for 2016 Olympics.

“If I work harder there is chance of getting a medal. I have mentally prepared myself and am strong with the aim of winning a medal,” said Irfan.

The country is under a 21-day lockdown and just like any other athlete, Irfan is confined to his hostel at the SAI Centre in Bengaluru as nobody can train outside.

“There was a good place to train outside the campus where I used to train. But we aren’t allowed to go outside the campus because of the lockdown,” said the athlete from Kerala.

“We have been asked to train alone and not in groups. We do skipping etc in the room, and sometimes go out in the campus to practice the walk.

166,11-4-20,Tarred canvas,"Artist Simran KS Lamba in his paintings uses the rare medium, tar, to metaphorically throw light on the complexities of life and articulate its various expressions, says Uma Nair

When a script writer for documentary films decides to step into the world of art and paintings, you can be sure there will be something to savour. Well, Simran KS Lamba, an artist who unveiled a small suite of works at Triveni Art Gallery in March, is one such. His works have been made with mixed media and a rare one called tar. According to Simran, “‘Mixed media art’, as a term, has been exhaustively used to describe a variety of works in the current day and age with the alignment of any two separate media on the same base. Often it is due to the careful examination of the oeuvre of most such practitioners over decades that throws light on the complexities of their vision and articulates their expression.”

Industrial and waste elements

It is the expression of these latent complexities, the multi-faceted use of a singular media plane to bind cogent concepts and the creation of an inherent intangible sense of wonder that separates the highly feted serious practitioners from the chaff.

Simran’s oeuvre, spanning over a decade and a half, with his primary medium, tar, and its lucid execution in this study of form and figures, brings to fore industrial elements and waste material. These are being given a second lease of life to highlight veritable figurative formations hiding behind dense layers of alternative media such as encaustic wax and jute and are highlighted through his chosen mode of expression — tar — in paintings such Autumn Evening.

In its full splendour radiance, this is a painting that is both reflective as well as rivetting for the resonance that it has with the viewer. It speaks of seasons, time and the truth that it is the balance of nature and an inner harmony that we seek to strive that keeps us in the scheme of things. The elements of man and dog in miniature format create an incandescent echo of truth, beauty and love. To look at Autumn Evening is to know that a tree is a sanctuary, and a harbinger of serenity and solace as much as it is about shelter and service to the world through all seasons and times.

Form and fragmentation

In this study of form and fragmentation through tar, in paintings such as Burnt Innards and Thread Bare, Simran highlights the depiction of form as fractured, and in isolation, with either a singular figure or couples emanating from the canvasses in fragments. Each fragment represents the whole figure in terms of placement and structure, and yet is dissonant in its being. Space is allocated around each single piece of burnt digital print paper (encased in encaustic wax and tar) to remind the viewer of its inherent isolation. Eventually, all the pieces come together to create an exposition of multi-layered formations of isolated figures and couples.

In his paintings such as The Reach, Simran creates exaggerated visages of human beings with the simultaneous application of tar residue and heat with fluidic water impressions to form the subject’s primary visages. With impressions of human palms and forearms being cast in tar and copper dust, a complex interweaving of literal and thematic motifs has been done. It signifies the metaphorical ‘reach’ of their inner souls as it wafts towards the top of the dry pastel smeared canvas. It is being deliberately made to emanate from the subjects’ heads reaching skywards.

Coal tar deciphering

Coal tar over a canvas is fascinating. It becomes the source for the completion of the objective because Simran couldn’t have envisioned what that would be like without the ideation of colour tones that could be adjacent to black. He couldn’t have painted from looking at a reflective, shiny screen. He needed to see the scale of his sensibilities. It was as if he had to witness a blocking of already-painted imagery alongside its coal tar — or altered deciphering.

Painting for Simran is a rediscovering experience as it goes beyond the mere act of painting. It’s a process that accumulates and builds up into a momentum that must reach a crescendo of cohesive cadences. Painting then becomes for him more about using such devices and details that are incorporated into a personal aesthetic environment. He could not have envisioned paintings and environments without the materiality of his elements and that is why in practice and in his own sensitivity, he stands alone and apart.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tarred-canvas-2020-04-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/tarred-canvas.html
167,11-4-20,When Broadway went silent,"Theatre actors Samantha Pauly and Brittney Mack, who play two wives of Henry VIII in the musical Six, have turned down their disappointment by singing for the audience on social media amid virus shutdown

The Coronavirus has silenced Broadway. But it could not silence two of its rising stars. Samantha Pauly and Brittney Mack, who play two wives of Henry VIII in the musical Six, have turned their disappointment at having their musical on hold by doing what they do best — singing for an audience, this one on social media.

“It’s partly making sure that I am still vocalising and singing every day and doing something. But it’s also kind of keeping me sane,” Pauly says.

The daily songs are just one way that theatre folk have passed the time since Broadway went dark. Playwrights like Lauren Gunderson and Young Jean Lee are offering online tutorials, performers are doing fundraisers and choreographers are breaking down dances online.

The cast of Come From Away did a video to say thank you to medical personnel. The cast of Beautiful gathered for an online version of You’ve Got a Friend. Andrew Lloyd Webber has serenaded Twitter with tunes on his piano. And the cast of Hamilton reunited — albeit remotely — to perform Alexander Hamilton. Some shows have pivoted to becoming audiobooks.

Broadway theatres abruptly shut on March 12, knocking out all shows on the Great White Way but also 16 that were still scheduled to open, including Diana, Mrs. Doubtfire and Company. The news was especially crushing for the cast and crew of Six since they learned about the shutdown hours before they were officially going to open.

“It’s like you’re at the Olympics and you’re right there at the finish line and you tripped over something you don’t even see,” says Mack.

So each day, Pauly and Mack in their respective apartments — one on Roosevelt Island, the other in Harlem — make Instagram videos of themselves singing favourite songs or ones that have been requested by fans.

Pauly started the push, singing everything from Beautiful by Christina Aguilera to songs from rival musicals like Mean Girls and Beetlejuice. Mack followed, throwing her big voice into the ring, offering gospel songs to tunes from classic shows like State Fair.

Pauly and Mack keep in touch with their fellow actors on WhatsApp and wait for when their voices will once again be requested on Broadway. Both are confident Six, a rollicking, pro-woman show, will be back.

“I think, as artists, we are always very hopeful and we know the power of theatre and music, which is another reason that I’ve just been making these videos,” Pauly says. “I think that’s what kind of kept me from spiraling out of control and crying on my couch.”

Some shows scheduled to open this spring have abandoned plans to open at all, including Hangmen and a revival of Edward Albee’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Others — like revivals of Caroline or Change and Birthday Candles — have been moved to the fall.

There has been help from several quarters — Broadway’s unions and producers have agreed on emergency relief to provide Broadway employees with pay and health insurance for a few weeks. The Actors’ Fund has distributed $2.8 million to thousands of workers and The American Theatre Wing is spearheading a $250,000 fund for workers and giving $1,000 each to over 80 regional theatres.

“There are still a lot of artists that are very scared and worried about money, especially from shows that won’t be coming back,” says Pauly.

Broadway producers — anxious to reopen an industry that grossed $1.8 billion last season — said that theatres will reopen June 7.

Pauly has enough saved for a few months of rent but worries she may have to leave the city if the shutdown drags on past June. She was relieved to hear the new estimated return date — “There’s light at the end of the tunnel.”

If Six was about to officially say hello, another show was about to say goodbye. A Soldier’s Play had just three more performances left in its three-month run when Broadway shut down.

“I’m just glad we had a chance to really almost complete our run,” said one of its stars, Blair Underwood. “I just feel bad for the performers and the productions coming up that are just coming into rehearsal. You know that that future is kind of uncertain right now.”

Mack and Pauly say having their loved ones around took the sting out of the disappointment. But both are more than eager to get back to work. “It’ll be exciting to get back and turn the lights back on Broadway,” said Mack.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/when-broadway-went-silent-2020-04-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/when-broadway-went-silent.html
168,11-4-20,The real connection,"Brie Larson feels as inspired and overawed by Captain Marvel as a lot of her fans. By Team Viva

What would you say about Captain Marvel?

I like the fact that my character was a superhuman before she was a superhero the most. She is known for her real skills, power and confidence and is very capable as a human being before she’s able to shoot stuff out of her hands. I love how she’s flawed and yet what a great risk-taker she is. I adore how the audience sees someone in her who might not always make the right judgement call but yet emerge victorious too. Many a times, I think, action heroes and superheroes are always made to appear like the most perfect beings. And that they always make the right call but I think it’s also important for people to watch people make mistakes and then atone for them. She teaches that with brilliance.

Your character was like a landmark role in the biggest feminist film of MCU...

There was a scene where two male characters were talking about my character and they called me a “woman” and I realised that in the past, if I would have read a script written by a man, it would have been “girl”. And I had to take a step back and go “Oh gosh, I’m 28 years old and I’m used to being referred to as a girl.” Those little things and big things come from this script being passed through the hands of women and being written by them. They’re just small things but I realised it changed the way I viewed myself.

Tell us something about your training and getting into the fighting choreography. Is that something you were familiar with?

No. I was definitely not familiar with anything like that. I was not an athletic in any way, which is why I took nine months to learn how to work and walk and act like an athlete. It was a lot more than I had thought. It was an hour and a half of practice every day that included really hard cardio and weightlifting. Then, three months before filming, the fighting training was added too. Well, that’s when it got really challenging for me because I didn’t know how to punch or kick or be on wires or fly or photon blast or even ask. It just really hit me hard. But I surely did not want to look like a fool in the film. So I’m very grateful to the stunt team that they taught me everything so well.

What would you want the audience to take away from this film?

They don’t have to take away anything. I just feel like it’s up to them to decide. There’s so much in this film. It has a lot of different aspects and I’m really proud of them. So I think if I’m lucky enough to have them in the seat and watch the film, I’m curious to hear what they have to say.

Tell us something about your character and how you felt playing her.

There is a thorough line highlighting the incredible women that we have in the Air Force. But the other thing for me that I love is that she is incredible in breaking barriers and doing amazing things even before she had super powers. That is an important fact to this too. It’s not like these powers were the thing that made her remarkable. They just highlighted what was already in her in a more powerful way.

How did you feel while playing Captain Marvel? Was there any nervousness?

Oh! I never felt nervous. I found the character so inspiring that whenever I was nervous or scared, I felt like I can turn to her and remind myself, “No! I got this.” I could connect to her so well and that feels really great. I feel like I have the same awe over her that a lot of her fans do.

Were you nervous the first day you walked onto the set as Carol Denvers? How did you ease into the character?

I jumped in head-first. The first three days of shooting were on the moving train so it was mostly physical. I had been in pretty heavy training for nine months. These scenes gave me some time to get a feel for the suit before we actually got into dialogue.

Was there an instant connection between you and your co-star Lashana Lynch?

I am an introvert but I’m also super open while working. I don’t hold back at any times and she doesn’t either. So it was really an interesting experience. The two of us did a chemistry read together and it vibed pretty well from the beginning. Lashana is smart and really special so it was easy to connect with her. We were spending so much time together and hanging around that we developed a real bond.

169,11-4-20,Don’t let it go,"Director Aditya Sarpotdar tells Sakshi Sharma that his series, The Raikar Case, explores the dark sides of a family, though in a culture set-up

What if one day you find out that every member of your family is hiding a dark secret of his own? A range of questions will flood your mind — Do I really know my people? Have we really known each other’s reality all this while? Well, for director Aditya Sarpotdar, these complex questions were exciting enough to be shaped into a murder mystery, where one dark event gets connected to a family and each of its members.

A propulsive and engaging series, The Raikar Case, is about family, love, deceit, and the secrets that wrench them apart. It says that the most dangerous people come disguised as family. The thriller grapples with the dilemma of ‘Will you choose truth over family?’ and if trust can ever really be absolute. Secret and lies are exposed when the youngest member of the family commits suicide — leaving behind a trail of unanswered questions and suspects.

How did you conceptualise the series The Raikar Case?

It is a collaborative work. There are a lot of minds behind it. When I came into play, there was a basic draft of two to three pages but there was no screenplay and a lot of characterisation had to be done. We were just brainstorming about how to take things forward and it hit my mind to make it a family drama. In India, we always look at family in the most perfect sense — with respect and moral values. But I wanted the audience to flip the whole idea and imagine their family to be hideous. Which might make one think, ‘Do I really know my people?’ It is exciting to explore that do we know each other’s lives inside out. But what if we don’t? After pondering over all these complex questions, we decided to combine all this into a murder mystery.

In the beginning itself, we see the disheartened youngest member of the family Tarun Naik Raikar (played by Honey Kamboj) jumping off a cliff. We decided the youngest to be the victim because he can gain sympathy and people would really feel for him. Before his death, Tarun was trying to find something and that is what has connected the whole series to the dark side of the family. Then one after the other, there are characters coming into play. This is how the whole show is developed. We made sure to keep the basic relationship and Indian values intact. Even if it’s a revengeful family, living in a cultured set-up is important. The social structure of Indian families is very complex. So we did a lot of research and then finally chose to show the scenes which were able to convey the dynamics of Indian families.

You have done films like Classmates (2015), Mauli (2018), Thodi Thodi Si Manmaniyan (2017) and many more. This is the first time you have done something like this...

Yes. Mauli is an action film. After doing that, I decided not to repeat any genre. So thriller was something I hadn’t tried before and I badly wanted to do it. Moreover, I also wanted to try the web space as I was intrigued by it. I love watching web shows and their format. This series was all that I wanted at that moment — thriller and web in one.

Were there any reference points from real instances?

There wasn’t any such real case that you could connect to. But there are a lot of cases where the families have found themselves into the dark — right from the Arushi murder case (2008) to other extreme cases where the parent or child is a murderer. We referred to such cases but it was pure fiction. Our research was more with the setup. For instance, if the setup is of Goa, the kind of people there, their culture, family setup and how to make it look more realistic and believable.

Was there any specific reason behind choosing Goa as the main location?

We chose Goa because we wanted something controlled, a smaller setup, where a family crime can get a major reaction. In cities like Mumbai and Delhi, such crimes take place often at multiple places and are lost. Nobody asks about them after a day. But in Goa, a murder case of a renowned family is big. Another reason behind choosing Goa was its truly appealing location. It worked very well with the theme.

I have also shot two feature film in Goa — Satrangi Re (2012) and my first film Uladhaal (2008). During those times, I explored Goa a lot. I have also done some ad films there. I am connected to it in more ways than one. So we were very clear about which area we wanted to shoot? And we found some really good locations!

Given that there have been a number of murder mysteries written and filmed in the past, you always need something new that cannot be easily predicted or guessed. How is it that you found an angle in a way that you can bring something completely new to the audience?

Yes. When you talk about murder mysteries, you need to explore things which people can not easily judge or guess because that’s the whole trick about writing them. You need to be one step ahead, in a space where people can’t guess the murderer. If they are able to make out what’s there in the second episode, the whole point of murder mystery is lost. It’s important to write in a smart way so that you always misguide the audience about the murderer. You also need to be cautious about the main murderer as s/he is usually there in front but the focus has to be shifted to someone else. So we wanted to take an approach where the killer doesn’t seem obvious. It’s not a show about finding an assaulter or a rapist, this is about an individual you are living with.

It must have been challenging...

Definitely. When a show gets released, you never know how people are going to accept it. Will they be able to accept a family so dark or will they accept the fact that a family can have such hideous characters? But because you’re writing such a series, you have to understand that not everything works as planned. It goes for a toss. The audience might like it extraordinarily or might not even want to watch the second episode after the first. It’s not easy to convince everyone about a particular series or show because we all have different tastes and preferences. But that is the beauty of web — you can explore things in chunks. Honestly, I don’t think any production house would make a film on this. That is where the web gives us an upper hand.

I wanted to do something purely original. It had to be something that the audience has never seen before. So the risk was higher. If you are adapting something it is completely different because it is safe and might work as it is tried and tested. But I feel it loses its fun and charm. Every series is made at a certain time period, set-up and place. And all of it has its own connect with the audience of that time. First will always remain first.

We can see a surge of realistic films in the Hindi cinema. Do you think murder mysteries are still among the viewers’ favourites?

They have a separate target audience. People who like murder mysteries get personally involved in them. As the story flows, they try to figure out who did it, challenge their thinking and wit, and take it to a certain direction. As far as realistic films are concerned, usually, the Ayushmann (Khurrana) or Rajkummar (Rao) ones, they are family films. Yes, the audience for realistic films is certainly growing now but then there are all kinds of genres which also caters to a particular set of audience.

People are clear that a murder mystery will not show anything that they can relate to or connect themselves personally like they can in films based on real issues. So this genre has become confined to OTT now. People watch it on their phones, tabs or laptops but might not like to watch it in theatres. So here comes another segregation that this genre is great for web and OTT only. People are very selective about what they want to watch in theatres.

In one of your interviews in 2012, you mentioned that you want to bring a considerable change in the Marathi film industry. You said, “It should have improved technical features similar to that of Bollywood films...”

I think we have achieved a lot in the past seven to eight years. We had been able to create many sub-effects, animations, new sets and designs. In 2012, the Marathi film industry was quite small and didn’t have enough budget. Post that, it has grown up to be really huge. The budgets have really turned up and the audience feels a great connect. We have done quite well as an industry overall and have worked hard to reach a good level so that we are seen as an important industry.

The younger generation has a huge role to play here. It is a more talented and an ambitious generation. They are more experimental because its their “first.” So the kind of hard work they put in it is great. They are not at all oblivious about the realities of the industry and remain almost untouched as an artiste. They are not really inclined to becoming a commercial face or hold on to the dynamics of how it all works. Once you make your first film, you get your second and then you get more open to the world. You start understanding things logically and practically. Not to forget, they also make a lot of mistakes initially but that’s how you learn.

170,11-4-20,Mirror mirror,"Actor Issa Rae says that though the pandemic circumstances are terrible but they are helping her take a break to focus on what she loves

The HBO hit Insecure typically airs during the summer, but series creator Issa Rae has been moving like the Energiser Bunny with a schedule so booked and busy, the show’s return had to be delayed. But for good reason.

She filmed two films (The Photograph, The Lovebirds). She executive produced and appeared in HBO’s A Black Lady Sketch Show. The actor who breaks out in raps to cope with life on Insecure launched her own record label. And Rae is writing, producing and starring in a new film called Perfect Strangers and producing another HBO series, Rap (expletive), about a female rap group trying to find a breakthrough.

“I was just relieved to not be doing the show and to be working on other things so much so that I was finally grateful to come back when I was done with those projects,” Rae said. She added: “I love this show. I love the people on it. I love creating it and making it. It just made me more appreciative of what we were doing.”

Insecure finds Rae’s character Issa Dee on a search to find herself — professionally and personally. The show also stars Yvonne Orji (Molly), Jay Ellis (Lawrence), Amanda Seales (Tiffany) and Natasha Rothwell (Kelli), who also writes and produces the show.

In an interview, the 35-year-old Rae spoke about her Emmy-nominated series and the show within the show, which this season is a docu-series about a missing black woman. Rae also discusses her film The Lovebirds, which moved from its theater release to Netflix because of the Coronavirus pandemic.

What can we expect from season four?

This season is really about whether the people in your life are there for a reason or a season. It really is about that transitional period when you go from your twenties and you’re kind of figuring out who you are, to your 30s when you really know who you are. You know what you’re going to tolerate and what you’re not going to tolerate and who you want around you to continue that journey.

It was funny seeing Porsha Williams from Real Housewives of Atlanta and Masika Kalysha from Love and Hip-Hop on the show. Did they have to audition?

Masika auditioned. That was just a surprise of going through the audition tape and being like, “Oh good, she’s good. It’s great.” And just being like, “Okay, cast her.”

For a show within a show, those are always very specific and you have a cast in mind and then we just approach them and they’re down.

It’s nice seeing veteran black actors in that show within a show (it also includes Terri J Vaughn and Carl Anthony Payne).

It’s a way to honour our legends. It’s so fulfilling to be able to work with them. To have them be a part of our own cultural moment.

Even the story line is interesting.

It’s so ridiculous. That even came about from our random obsession with true crime podcasts and true crime docu-series and being like, “There’s never black people.” Nobody would dedicate a whole podcast or docu-series to missing black people. Nobody does a “To Live and Die in LA” if the girl is black. We were just trying to document that.

How have you been able to balance all the projects you’re working on?

I’m not going to lie — I’m toppling plates over here. I have not been great at balancing, but the people that I work with have been amazing. This quarantine, I would have been on a three-week press tour for Insecure and Lovebirds while having to meet a deadline to rewrite a film and write a pilot. I don’t know how I was going to do that. I wasn’t going to do that. I was going to kill myself. Now to be able to have this forced time to be able to dedicate to creating and writing has been so fulfilling. Obviously these circumstances are terrible but it allowed me to put a pause on so much and to focus on what I love to do; the parts that I like to do. I actually don’t like traveling for the press, really. I don’t like the promotional stuff for the most part. It’s stressful. It takes a lot of time. You forget, “Oh this is what I love to do. I’m a writer.”

What is different doing the films compared to your TV series? What did you learn?

The experiences were very different. The Photograph felt like, “Oh I’m making a film with family, it’s familiar territory. It feels like home.” I shot that after I shot The Lovebirds, which was kind of a newer process for me just because it was a different environment, and I think I was still more actively involved in the story of it, the rewriting of it. It was so fun to work with Kumail (Nanjiani). Whereas with The Photograph, it was like executing (director) Stella’s vision and kind of being immersed in her world and her idea for the story. Both of those made me actively miss Insecure.

Were you excited Netflix picked up The Lovebirds since we currently can’t go to the films?

I was super grateful. I was kind of bummed. Given the circumstances, I was like, “Damn, we’re not ... but nobody’s going to go to the films. This is before, obviously, it was announced that it was a pandemic.

But then with the film theaters shutting down I was like, “OK, that’s a good decision” ... The fact that Netflix was interested in our film, it just felt like the best opportunity to showcase it and have maximum people view it during this time.

How have things been going with your record label, Raedio?

It’s been a learning process. It’s been exciting to just meet with new artists and to be passionate. I feel like Suge Knight every single time when I’m just like, “Come to Death Row, I got you, but it’s much less malicious.” We’re going to take care of you over here. We’re going to put you on a platform and we’re going to give you the space to be you and it’s coming from a place of just pure fandom.

Have you been able to reflect on your accomplishments?

I sit and reflect from time to time, but whenever I sit and reflect I just get more anxious. I get worried. I kind of don’t want to think about all that I have going on because then it becomes scary ... It’s like walking on air and then you look below you and then you’re going to fall. That’s how I feel. If I pay attention too much then I’ll realise, “What am I doing? Why do I think I could do all this?” I have a capable team of people that I work with. It really is just about doing it — just doing it while I can.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mirror-mirror-2020-04-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/mirror-mirror.html
171,11-4-20,‘Played less aggressively due to repercussions of sandpapergate’,"Australian cricket team’s low key aggression against India during the 2018-19 Test series was more about winning back fans rather than protect their IPL contracts, said pace spearhead Pat Cummins, rejecting former skipper Michael Clarke’s contentious claims.

The India series was only the second Test series after the ball tampering controversy that led to Steve Smith and David Warner’s suspensions and an overall criticism of their win at all cost mentality.

“I think probably a bigger factor was six months before leading into that Indian series the media and everyone commentating on the Aussie cricket team were pretty clear in their direction in the way they wanted the Aussies team to go and that was playing a little bit less aggressively out on the field,” Cummins told BBC.

However he didn’t rule out that some players might have harboured thoughts about Clarke’s assumption that they “sucked up to” Indian skipper Virat Kohli in fear of losing out on IPL pay-checks.

“I’d say that would have been a bigger factor than trying to win or lose friends out on the cricket field. But you never know, that might have been a factor for some players.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---played-less-aggressively-due-to-repercussions-of-sandpapergate---.html

178,11-4-20,Coronavirus spreads tentacles,"Covid entering new territories, hits over 30 States/UTs; 869 cases in a day raise total to 7,600; 246 dead

Despite 21-day lockdown which entered the 17th day on Friday, the deadly coronavirus is rapidly finding new areas in the country with positive cases crossing 7,600, and taking 246 lives. More than 30 States and Union territories in the country are now hit by coronavirus.

Friday saw India recording more than 800 cases in a day for the second time. According to figures collected from States till 11 pm, the day saw addition of 869 cases.

While Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Rajasthan and Kerala were among the some of the worst-hit region, now the virus is spreading its tentacles far and wide, and that too, rapidly.

There has been sudden spurt in cases in Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, West Bengal and Jharkhand, etc, in the past two days, leaving the State Governments in a jitter. Assam too reported first death on Friday.

Districts like Hyderabad, Kasaragod, Indore (MP), Pune, Chennai and New Delhi have reported more than 40 per cent of the total cases and the rest from other districts, which had so far reported far less numbers.

Gujarat reported 113 new Covid-19 positive cases adding to the number of positive cases to 378, which includes 33 discharge and 19 deaths. Areas like Ahmedabad, Patan and Vadodara have emerged new hotspots with 55, 9 and 37 more cases respectively on Friday.

Tamil Nadu reported 77 new cases taking the total tally in the State to 911, said Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary CS Shanmugam, while Mumbai continue to be worst hit with 218 Covid-19 positive cases and 10 deaths. Total positive cases in the city have risen to 993 with death toll at 64, as per the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).

179,11-4-20,India in 3rd stage? The jury is out,"WHO backtracks, says it’s cluster spread in India

A massive controversy has erupted over whether or not India is in the third stage of coronavirus outbreak, ie community transmission.

While a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) cited instances where COVID-19 patients had no established contact with someone who picked up the disease from abroad, the Centre denied it was a case of community spread.

Community transmission is stage 3 of an outbreak, considered dangerous as positive cases start rising exponentially making tracing of the contacts nearly impossible.

The World Health Organisation (WHO), which had also first said that India was in the third stage of the disease, on Friday almost retracted its statement and said India was at cluster outbreak stage.

The Centre also differed with Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh who on Friday raised the fear of the possibility of community transmission in his State and announced extension of lockdown.

Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Union Health Ministry, said community transmissions of coronavirus have not begun yet in the country, the rate of the infection is still low and that there was no need to panic. He cited results of all samples tested on Thursday which included 2 per cent positive results for Covid-19 out of 16,002 tests.

Speaking at a Press conference here he said, “At least 16,002 samples were tested on Thursday, of which only 320 tested positive for Covid-19. Only 2 per cent cases tested positive. Based on the samples collected, we can say that the infection rate is not high, although it is dynamic.”

Agarwal also suggested that people need to be alert. “Today, the challenge is not local or community transmission, but whether we are following all the precautionary and containment measures. There is no community transmission in the country yet, but we need to remain aware and alert,” he said.

As per the ICMR study based on random sampling tests conducted on patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Illnesses (SARI), there was a spike in the number of coronavirus positive cases among such patients with no travel history.

As many as 39.2 per cent of SARI patients, who later tested positive for the coronavirus,neither had a history of travel nor had contact with a positive patient, the data compiled by ICMR showed. These patients were reported from 36 districts of 15 States.

“These districts need to be prioritised to target COVID-19 containment activities,” ICMR says in the report.

The report showed the outcome of random coronavirus tests on 5,911 people suffering from SARI in 52 districts in 20 States and Union Territories between February 15 to April 2. Out of the total sample size, 104 people (1.8 per cent) were found to have contracted coronavirus. Of the 104, 40 of them did not have any recent international travel history or contact with any positive case of the infection, the study by the nodal medical research body said.

The ICMR study was conducted to examine whether the coronavirus outbreak in the country had reached the community transmission stage. “In all, 39.2 per cent COVID-19 cases did not report any history of contact with a known case or international travel,” the study said.

Two per cent reported contacts with a confirmed case and one per cent had history of international travel, according to it. The study said males accounted for higher number of COVID-19 cases and also patients aged above 50 years.

The ICMR in its study highlighted that COVID-19 containment activities need to be targeted in districts reporting positive cases among SARI patients. It said intensifying surveillance for COVID-19 among SARI patients may be an efficient tool to effectively use resources towards containment and mitigation efforts.

In India, the initial COVID-19 testing strategy included people who had international travel history with symptoms, symptomatic contacts of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients and symptomatic healthcare workers.

In addition, to track the progression of the epidemic in the early phase, stored samples of SARI patients hospitalised since February 15 were also tested for COVID-19 under the Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory Network (VRDLN).

A majority of the SARI patients were tested from Gujarat (792), Tamil Nadu (577), Maharashtra (533) and Kerala (503). These are also the States with the highest prevalence overall of COVID cases.

“Tracking the spread of COVID-19 is critical to inform response activities, including testing, containment and mitigation measures. The current SARI testing strategy will complement and strengthen the routine COVID-19 surveillance activities,” the study added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-in-3rd-stage--the-jury-is-out-2020-04-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/india-in-3rd-stage--the-jury-is-out.html

India were scheduled to host New Zealand for the two-leg tie on May 23 and 24 in Bhubaneswar.

New Zealand, in fact, have also cancelled its trip to China.

“Following the New Zealand government’s travel restrictions and government lockdown which we find ourselves in at present, combined with the medical advice of our team doctors and in the interests of the health, safety and well-being of our players and support staff, the decision has been made by Hockey New Zealand to cancel our tour of India (Men) and China (Women) at this present time,” HNZ chief executive Ian Francis said.

New Zealand made the decision after the International Hockey Federation (FIH) hinted of extending the suspension of Pro League matches till July-August due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The FIH, in fact, had suspended the Pro League twice earlier due to the pandemic.

India made an impressive debut in the second edition of the FIH Pro League, currently placed fourth in the standings after three ties against Netherlands, world champions Belgium and Australia.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe issued an emergency declaration this week to battle the virus, putting the country under restrictions after it seemed it had avoided the spread.

“I don’t think anyone would be able to say if it is going to be possible to get it under control by next July or not,” Tokyo organizing committee CEO Toshiro Muto said, speaking through an interpreter at a news conference conducted remotely.

“We’re certainly are not in a position to give you a clear answer.”

The Olympics were postponed last month with a new opening set for July 23, 2021, followed by the Paralympics on August 24.

Abe has been criticized for being slow to act against the coronavirus. Opposition political leaders have suggested he downplayed the severity of the virus and have said it may have been tied to wanting to hold the Olympics this year.

“We have made the decision to postpone the games by one year,” Muto added.

“So this means that all we can do is work hard to prepare for the games. We sincerely hope that come next year mankind will manage to overcome the coronavirus crisis.” Muto was asked if there are alternative plans to 2021.

“Rather than think about alternatives plans, we should put in all of our effort,” he said.

“Mankind should bring together all of its technology and wisdom to work hard so they can development treatments, medicines and vaccines.”

182,11-4-20,‘No match worth risking a life': Infantino,"FIFA president Gianni Infantino on Friday said that “no match” is worth “risking a single human life” and that world football’s governing body would be able to help financially national federations during the coronavirus pandemic. The majority of top football leagues and international competitions have been suspended due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Infantino insisted that games would not resume until it was safe.

“Our first priority, our principle, the one we will use for our competitions and encourage everyone to follow is that health comes first,” he said in a video message.

“I cannot stress this enough. No match, no competition, no league is worth risking a single human life.”

The German Bundesliga reportedly could restart behind closed doors in May, with players already back in training, while other leagues could also resume in the summer.

“It would be more than irresponsible to force competitions to resume if things are not 100% safe,” added Infantino.

“If we have to wait a little longer we must do so. It’s better to wait a little bit longer than to take any risks.”

Infantino said that national football associations which are struggling financially would receive help from FIFA’s emergency relief fund.

FIFA last week postponed all international matches scheduled for June. “We are today in a very strong financial situation,” Infantino said.

“But our reserves are not FIFA’s money. It is football’s money. So when football is in need, we must think what we can do to help...

183,11-4-20,Cummins up for playing IPL behind closed doors,"Australian pace bowling star Pat Cummins says he is prepared to play in the Indian Premier League behind closed doors as it would restore a degree of “normality” into daily life during the coronavirus pandemic.

The 26-year-old ICC Test player of the year — he took 59 wickets in 12 Tests — told the BBC that it would mean fans could at least watch some live sport at home.

The IPL season was postponed from March 29 until April 15 because of the pandemic, although the expectation is the tournament will be either delayed again or even cancelled should the lockdown in India be extended.

Another problem for Cummins and his compatriots is there are restrictions on Australians travelling overseas.

The two-month tournament — Cummins is contracted to the Kolkata Knight Riders — is a huge revenue earner.

The T20 competition is estimated to generate more than $11 billion for the Indian economy and involves cricket’s top international stars like England's Ben Stokes, Australia’s David Warner and Indian captain Virat Kohli.

“Of course — whatever it takes to try and get cricket up and play those big events safely,” said Cummins in answer to whether he would welcome playing in front of empty stands.

“The first priority is safety but the second one is getting back to normality.

“It’s finding that balance. If that unfortunately means no crowds for a while then that’s that but hopefully people can watch at home on television.”

Cummins’s outstanding 2019 was recognised on Wednesday when he was named one of the five cricketers of the year by Wisden.

“The first I heard about it was a couple of months ago,” he said.

“The award is held in high regard in Australia, I remember my dad and grandad talking about it.

“It caught me off guard to get it but I feel very honoured and privileged to win it. I had to keep it quiet, I hadn’t told anyone.”

He was the pick of the Australian attack as they retained the Ashes taking 29 wickets in the five Test series which ended in a 2-2 draw.

“I have so many favourite moments from the Ashes series,” he said.

“There was a plan years in advance, I was in good form and fitness.

“To have a good series personally is great.

“It’s the one big event you really look forward to, and I’m proud to get through five Tests.”

Cummins, when asked to select his best memories of the series, shied away from personal achievements to the collective one.

“In terms of moments, the two wins — the first win at Edgbaston, starting the first Test match with a win,” he said.

“Then obviously retaining the Ashes at Manchester late in day five would be another moment.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cummins-up-for-playing-ipl-behind-closed-doors-2020-04-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/cummins-up-for-playing-ipl-behind-closed-doors.html
184,11-4-20,Liverpool legend Dalglish tests positive for coronavirus,"Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish has tested positive for coronavirus but is not showing symptoms of the disease, his family said Friday.

The 69-year-old former Scottish international striker, who started his career at Celtic, was admitted to hospital on Wednesday for treatment for an infection which required intravenous antibiotics.

""He was subsequently tested for COVID-19 despite having previously displayed no symptoms of the illness,"" said a family statement.

""Unexpectedly, the test result was positive but he remains asymptomatic.

""Prior to his admission to hospital, he had chosen to voluntarily self isolate for longer than the advised period together with his family.

""He would urge everyone to follow the relevant government and expert guidance in the days and weeks ahead."" Dalglish won the Scottish league title with Celtic as a player on four occasions before signing for Liverpool in 1977.

At Anfield, he captured eight English league titles, three FA Cups and three European Cups during a glittering 13-year stint as a player and in two managerial spells.

In his Liverpool playing career, he scored 172 goals in 515 games.

As well as his role in Liverpool's golden era in the 1970s and 1980s, Dalglish received plaudits for supporting victims' families after 96 fans died in the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster.

He also went on to coach Blackburn Rovers to the Premier League title in 1995.

Dalglish, who also made more than 100 international appearances for Scotland, was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2018.

""Kenny would like to take this opportunity to thank the brilliant NHS staff, whose dedication, bravery and sacrifice should be the focus of the nation's attention at this extraordinary time,"" added the family statement on Friday.

""He would also ask that they are given the space to do their jobs during what is an extremely challenging time for them and that his own family's privacy is respected.

""He looks forward to being home soon. We will provide further updates as and when it is appropriate.""

185,11-4-20,"Don't push Dhoni into retirement, cautions Nasser Hussain","The doubting thomases ""should be careful"" about what they wish for as there is no second coming for a once-in-a-generation player like Mahendra Singh Dhoni if people ""push him into retirement"", former England captain Nasser Hussain said on Saturday.

HUssain, one of the most respected voices in world cricket feels that the soon-to-be 39 year old former India captain still has a lot to offer in Indian cricket.

""Once Dhoni is gone, there is no getting him back. There are some legends of the game, appreciating while around, because they are once-in-a-generation cricketer and dont push him into retirement too early. Only Dhoni knows his mental state and in the end the selectors select and players turn up when asked to,"" 52-year-old Hussain told Star Sports on its new show 'Cricket Connected'.

Dhoni last played for India in the World Cup semi-final against New Zealand in July. Since then he hasn't played any competitive cricket with former legends like Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev making it clear that it's getting increasingly difficult for the Jharkhand dasher to make an international return after such prolonged sabbatical.

But Hussain, who led England from 1999-2003, feels otherwise.

""Is MS Dhoni still good enough to get in the Indian side? It is as simple as that. That should apply for anyone across the board. What I have seen of Dhoni, I still think MS Dhoni has a huge amount to offer for Indian cricket,"" he said.

However one of England's shrewdest captains admitted that Dhoni did err on a couple of occasions during World Cup where he couldn't force the pace of the innings.

While Hussain's comments didn't specify which match he was talking about but it is in all likelihood the games against West Indies and England where he failed to force the pace of the Indian innings.

""Yes, its been one or two occasions where he (MSD) got it wrong in run chases, there was a World Cup game in England where he sort of blocked at the end for some unknown reason, but in general MS Dhoni is still a really good talent and be careful what you wish for,"" elaborated Hussain.

The show will aired at 7 PM on Saturday night.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/don-t-push-dhoni-into-retirement--cautions-nasser-hussain-2020-04-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/don-t-push-dhoni-into-retirement--cautions-nasser-hussain.html

A total of 1,00,661 people have been killed, including 70,245 in Europe, since the virus first emerged in China in December.

188,11-4-20,What is convalescent plasma therapy against COVID-19,"Several studies have already started in different parts of the world to test effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy in treating COVID-19 patients.

The idea behind this therapy is that immunity can be transferred from a healthy person to a sick using convalescent plasma.

Convalescent plasma refers to plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients.

So in this therapy, blood is drawn from a person who has recovered from the disease and the serum is separated and screened for virus-neutralising antibodies.

When attacked by a pathogen, our immune systems produce antibodies and in this therapy these antibodies from recovered patients are used to treat other sick people.

According to Neha Gupta, Infectious Diseases Consultant at Fortis Memorial Research Institute in Gurugram, based on the type of severity of COVID 19 infection, immunity develops.

Immunity develops early in asymptomatic or persons with mild symptoms, while it develops later in severe and critically-ill COVID 19 patients, she explained.

The concept of this therapy dates back more than a century, when similar treatments were used during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, a diphtheria outbreak in the 1920s, a flesh-eating bacteria epidemic in the 1930s, and during other outbreaks of infectious diseases. It was tried most recently for Ebola. Effectiveness of the therapy has varied.

The process for donating plasma is similar to donating blood and takes about an hour, according to Houston Methodist which became the first academic medical centre in the US to transfuse donated plasma from a recovered COVID-19 patient into a critically ill patient.

Plasma donors are hooked up to a small device that removes plasma while simultaneously returning red blood cells to their bodies. Unlike regular blood donation in which donors have to wait for red blood cells to replenish between donations, plasma can be donated more frequently, as often as twice a week, it said.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has given nod to Kerala to conduct plasma therapy.

Kerala is the first state in the country to have been given the nod to try this out, as a task force was already in place.

Earlier, a small study in China found the therapy effective in treating coronavirus patients. Positive results from China encouraged other countries including the US to test the effectiveness of the therapy against COVID-19.

189,11-4-20,"France reports 987 more coronavirus deaths, toll tops 13,000","France on Friday reported 987 more COVID-19 deaths registered in hospitals and nursing homes over the last 24 hours, although the number of patients in intensive care fell for the second day in a row.

The new deaths -- including 554 in hospitals and 433 in nursing homes --- brought the total toll in France to 13,197 since the epidemic began, top health official Jerome Salomon told reporters.

A child aged under 10 infected with COVID-19 died, but Salomon said that the causes of the death were ""multiple"".

In better news, Salomon said there were now 62 fewer people in intensive care for a total of 7,004 patients, continuing a trend first seen on Thursday.

""This is pale ray of sunshine,"" said Salomon. ""But this timid light is very important for all the medical staff.""

He added: ""A plateau seems to be setting in -- a very high plateau with an epidemic that is very dynamic.""

France has been in lockdown since March 17 in a bid to slow the spread of the epidemic, with only essential trips allowed that must be justified with a signed piece of paper.

""We have been starting to see over the last days the first effects of the confinement,"" noted Salomon, noting a ""slight slowing of the epidemic"".

French President Emmanuel Macron is due on Monday to address the nation for a third time during the crisis.

He is expected to announce that the lockdown will be extended beyond its current April 15 expiration date.

Macron will have to steer a careful course amid tentative signs of improvement, telling people they must still stay at home while giving indications about how the confinement may end.

The president on Friday hosted a video conference with business groups and union leaders to help prepare for his address.

Macron had ""two messages. This is not the moment to drop our guard as the confinement is the way to halt the epidemic. But we need to think about ending the lockdown, even if it seems we are not there yet,"" said Yves Veyrier, head of the FO union.

French authorities on Friday transferred 45 more patients by two TGV high-speed trains to the southwest of the country in a bid to relieve pressure on strained hospitals in the Paris region.

Some 200 patients have already been evacuated by road, rail or air from the Paris region since April 1. The southwest of the country is one of the areas least impacted by the virus.

The situation in nursing homes remains one of acute concern.

The top health official for the Ile-de-France region of Paris and its surroundings, Aurelien Rousseau, said on Friday that over 400 of the 700 nursing homes in the region had registered at least one COVID-19 case.

Meanwhile, the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle has registered 50 cases of novel coronavirus among the crew, the armed forces ministry said on Friday.

191,11-4-20,"Brazil registers 1,000th coronavirus death","Brazil, the hardest-hit Latin American country in the coronavirus pandemic, passed the mark of 1,000 deaths on Friday, the health ministry said.

The ministry's latest figures gave a toll of 19,638 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with 1,056 deaths -- one fewer than it had indicated in an initial tally earlier in the day.

With a worldwide death toll of more than 100,000, Brazil's figure is still relatively small compared to the number of deaths in countries such as Italy (more than 18,000), the United States (nearly 17,000) and Spain (nearly 16,000).

But health officials are bracing for things to get worse.

Experts predict the outbreak will only start to peak in Brazil toward late April.

There are fears for what that could mean in the country's poorest areas, especially the favelas -- crowded, impoverished slums in cities such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro that typically lack basic health and sanitation infrastructure.

President Jair Bolsonaro meanwhile faces a firestorm of criticism for downplaying COVID-19, calling it a ""little flu"" and the reaction to it ""hysteria.""

The far-right leader has clashed with local and state authorities over their decisions to close non-essential businesses and tell people to remain home, which he says is needlessly wrecking the economy.

In his latest act of disregard for his own government's recommendations on fighting the spread of the virus, he hit the streets of Brasilia on Friday to greet supporters.

Mingling with no face mask and apparently ignoring social distancing measures, he was particularly criticized for wiping his nose with his right hand at one point, then using it to shake hands with an elderly woman.

But he faces increasing political costs, as governors and local authorities largely ignore him to implement stay-at-home measures.

""Bolsonaro is politically isolated. He's losing support across all social segments and has very few allies left in Congress or the judiciary,"" said political analyst Sylvio Costa.

""Bolsonaro underestimated the pandemic,"" he told AFP.

Disapproval of the president has risen amid the pandemic, according to recent opinion polls. He faces nightly protests by confined residents in Brazil's biggest cities, who bang pots and pans from their windows, shouting ""Get out, Bolsonaro!""

Approval has meanwhile surged for Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta, who has stood by international recommendations on taking aggressive measures to contain the new virus, braving criticism from his boss.

Mandetta's approval rating for his handling of the crisis is at 76 percent, while Bolsonaro's is at 33 percent, according to polling firm Datafolha last Friday.

The death toll in Brazil more than doubled in a week, from 432 on Saturday.

The hardest hit is Sao Paulo state, the country's industrial hub and home to more than 44 million people -- about the population of Spain.

It had 8,216 cases and 540 deaths, the health ministry said.

Rio de Janeiro state was next, with 2,464 cases and 147 deaths.

But experts warn the real number of cases is probably much higher, given limited testing capacity and a large backlog of samples.

Besides the threat to favelas, there are growing fears about what the pandemic will mean for Brazilian indigenous communities.

Indigenous peoples in the Amazon rainforest have historically been hit hard by diseases that are commonplace among other societies as their isolation has shielded them from germs against which much of the world has developed immunity.

But that experience is not necessarily an advantage and, in a worrying sign, a 15-year-old boy from the Yanomami tribe -- a people known for its isolation and vulnerability to disease -- died Thursday after contracting the virus.

""There is a major fear that this disease will arrive, cause an outbreak in (indigenous) communities and lead to mass genocide,"" said Katia Brasil, editor at Amazonia Real news agency, which specializes in issues facing Amazonian peoples.

""This disease is very dangerous for us,"" said Dario Yawarioma, a Yanomami leader.

""And it is getting closer.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/brazil-registers-1-000th-coronavirus-death-2020-04-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/brazil-registers-1-000th-coronavirus-death.html
192,11-4-20,"US marks record over 2,100 coronavirus deaths in one day: Johns Hopkins data","The US has become the world's first country to have registered more than 2,000 COVID-19 deaths in a single day with 2,108 fatalities reported in the past 24 hours, while the number of infections in America has crossed 500,000, the highest in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

China, where the deadly coronavirus disease started in December last year before spreading across Europe and America killing more than 100,000, has so far recorded 81,000 cases of positive infections and 3,339 deaths.

In terms of fatalities, the US might soon overtake Italy where 18,848 COVID-19 deaths have happened so far. By Friday night, the US had 1,8679 recorded deaths, closely behind Italy. More than 16,000 people have died in Spain and over 13,000 in Germany, the university data said.

By Friday night more than 2,108 Americans had died due to the novel coronavirus and 500,399 people had tested positive with the dreaded disease, it said.

The COVID-19 positive cases in the United States are now more than the other top countries taken together: Spain (158,000), Italy (147,000), Germany (122,000) and France (112,000).

New York, which has emerged as the epicenter of COVID-19 deaths, has registered over 1.7 lakh positive cases, which is more than any other country.

More than 7,800 people in New York have died due to coronavirus. New Jersey has has nearly 2,000 deaths and more than 54,000 confirmed cases.

Before the start of the week, members of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus had projected between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths in the US.

While President Donald Trump had said that this was going to be a ""terrible, terrible"" week in terms of death, US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said the week was going to be 9/11 and Pearl Harbour moment for the country.

On Friday, Trump told reporters that as per the new projections the death toll was expected to be below 60,000.

""Hard to believe that if you had 60,000 (deaths), you could never be happy, but that's a lot fewer than we were originally told and thinking. So they said between 100 and 220,000 lives on the minimum side, and then up to 2.2 million lives if we didn't do anything. But it showed a just tremendous resolve by the people,"" he said.

Trump has declared a national emergency, has notified major disaster declaration for almost all of the 50 States and more than 95 per cent of the 330 million population are under stay-at-home order.

The American economy is headed for a recession, experts say.

New York, the epicenter, he said is showing signs of a ""downward curve,"" Trump said.

""A lot of that has to do with the aggressive strategy in saving so many lives. We're saving so many lives compared to what it could have been,"" he said.

""In New York, we're seeing hospital admissions declining very substantially. And nationwide, the number of new cases per day is flattening substantially, suggesting that we are near the peak and our comprehensive strategy is working, Trump said.

Over time, the guidelines to slow the spread are decreasing the rate of new cases very substantially and will result in fewer hospital admissions, he added.

According to Dr Deborah Brix, a member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus, the mortality rate in the United States is significantly less than many other countries.

""That is really solely the work of our frontline healthcare providers,"" she said, but cautioned that the country has still not reached the peak.

""But as encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak. And so, every day, we need to continue to do what we did yesterday and the week before and the week before that, because that's what, in the end, is going to take us up across the peak and down the other side,"" Brix said.

Globally, 102,669 people have died due to coronavirus and over 1.6 million people have been infected, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

By Friday, 989 confirmed cases including four deaths had been reported in Hong Kong, 45 confirmed cases in Macao and 382 in Taiwan including six deaths.

As the numbers of new cases showed sharp increase after China contained COVID-19 in its epicentres Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, President Xi Jinping on Friday called for tighter supervision of safety measures at workplaces.

His orders came as China resumed work and production in a big way after over two months of battle against the coronavirus pandemic.

Xi asked officials to strengthen monitoring and law enforcement of production safety even as coronavirus cases began to rise again in China following the return of Chinese nationals from abroad in big numbers.

The authorities should firmly hold the bottom line of workplace safety, Xi was quoted as saying by the state-run Xinhua news agency on Friday.

Premier Li Keqiang, who headed the leading group of officials to control COVID-19, also said officials must ensue there is not let up on workplace safety at a time when the country is in a critical period of coordinating epidemic control and work resumption.

The instructions were delivered at a national teleconference on workplace safety in Beijing on Friday.

Starting from Sunday, China has also made it mandatory for all hotels in Beijing to admit guests with only negative test results of the coronavirus.

The novel coronavirus which originated from China in December has killed 102,669 people and infected over 1.6 million people globally. The US has the highest number of infections at 500,399, while Italy leads the death toll with 18,849 fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

Earlier on March 27, the Khunjerab pass between Pakistan and China was opened for a day to receive Chinese medical supplies.

Pakistan and China describe their relations as all-weather strategic cooperative partnership and have firmly supported each other on issues concerning each other's core interests.

Authorities in Pakistan have so far conducted 57,836 tests, including 2,457 in the last one day.

The official data showed that 52 per cent patients were those who had travelled abroad while 48 per cent were local transmissions.

So far Lahore with 21 per cent share of total infections is on the top as the most infected city in Pakistan, followed by Karachi with 18 per cent infections.

But a Sindh health official expressed concern on Friday that Karachi was vulnerable due to its dense population and increase in the rare of local transmission.

Sources in the Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) said educational institutions will remain under the “compulsory lockdown” at least till June-end as a precautionary step to stem the Covid spread.

“Tens of thousands of children go to schools every day. We need to take precaution,” he said, adding, a committee has already been formed to discuss how to adjust academic session of higher learning.

Against this background, the HRD Ministry on Friday sought suggestions from educationists as to how to improve upon and make reliable online system of education that can facilitate students to continue with their session indoors during the corona scare.

Ideally the norm is to have 210/220 working days of secondary schools every year. That is being worked out. We are also looking into how to prepare a calendar giving much less gap between test and to March 2021 annual examination. In any case, most of the schools have begun their online platforms and imparting education as per the new academic session,” explained a senior HRD Ministry official.

While the HRD has already held a couple of meeting in this regard, the final decision will be taken after all the stakeholders — CBSE, ICSE, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sanghathan, Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, NCERT and State education boards sit across the board.

“While the HRD Ministry has already constituted a UGC-led committee to discuss on the academic session of higher learning, the academic session of the schools will be decided in due course,” he said.

“Several States are of the opinion that they will not open the schools given the pandemic scare across the country. A report submitted to “concerned authorities” has also advised that in the pyramid structure to open the various sectors post lockdown, schools and educational institutions are at the bottom sphere,” Ministry sources said.

HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ has launched a week long ‘Bharat Padhe Online’ campaign for crowd sourcing of ideas for improving online education ecosystem of India.

The campaign aims to invite all the best brains in India to share suggestions/solutions directly with the HRD Ministry to overcome constraints of online education while promoting the available digital education platforms.

The students and teachers are the main target audience in sharing ideas and the Minister hopes that the stakeholders will participate in this campaign to improve the existing online education methods.

He said that students who are currently studying in schools or higher educational institutions are the ones engaging with the existing digital platforms offering various courses etc on a daily basis.

“They can share what is lacking in the existing online platforms and how we can make them more engaging,” Pokhriyal said.

He further said the educators across the country can also come forward to contribute with their expertise and experience in the field of education.

“A conversation can be initiated with them, asking them that what do they think an ideal online education ecosystem should look like? Or what are the limitations of the current online education scenario of India? What challenges they face in traditional classrooms that can be addressed through online education,” urged the HRD Minister.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-classes-till-june-end--hrd-mulls-e-classroom-2020-04-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/no-classes-till-june-end--hrd-mulls-e-classroom.html
197,11-4-20,Pvt labs seek Govt support to conduct free Covid-19 tests,"With the Supreme Court directing that private labs should conduct coronavirus tests free of cost, many laboratories expect the Government to “come up with modalities” so that they can sustain testing facilities in the wake of burgeoning demand.

Owner of some labs also said the private laboratories “do not have the wherewithal” to do this costly test free of cost.

Dr Arjun Dang, CEO of Dr Dangs Lab, said, “We endorse the Supreme Court’s judgment which aims at increasing accessibility to Covid-19 testing and to make it affordable for the common man”.

However, for private labs there are numerous fixed costs, including for reagents, consumables, skilled manpower. The whole process of testing for coronavirus entails immense infection control measures like personal protective equipment, viral transport media and the need to keep sanitation and employee safety, he said.

“Private labs are barely able to recover costs at the government-mandated cost of Rs 4,500. Keeping this in mind we hope the government comes up with modalities so that testing in private laboratories remains sustainable,” said Dang.

Dang said his lab is currently following the apex court’s order and doing the test free of cost while awaiting further clarity from the government.

Agreeing with Dang, Dr A Velumani, Chairman and Managing Director of Thyrocare Technologies Ltd, is of the opinion that “private labs do not have the wherewithal to do this costly test free of cost”. “It is duty of the Government to reimburse the costs and we do not mind working without profits, he said.

Velumani said, the court in its order, has indicated that “government should find a way and we are awaiting for the directions’. “If the Government doesn’t subsidise, it would be a huge setback in the fight against COVID-19,” he said.

In a big relief to the poor, the Supreme Court on Wednesday directed that private labs should conduct coronavirus tests free of cost, observing they need to be philanthropic in the hour of national crisis.

The government had fixed Rs 4500 for private labs for screening and confirmation tests for Covid-19. The top court in its interim order said the Centre should immediately issue directions for carrying out free COVID-19 tests in NABL accredited labs or any agencies approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO) or the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/pvt-labs-seek-govt-support-to-conduct-free-covid-19-tests.html
198,11-4-20,"Op SHIELD yields results, random tests soon, says Delhi Minister","The Operation SHIELD has been a big success in containing the spread of Covid-19 in Dilshad Garden, which was one of hotspots in the national Capital, the Delhi Government said on Friday. The Government said it would also initiate random testing of residents soon.

Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Kumar Jain said the hard work of the health officials and the successful implementation of the Op SHIELD has made Dilshad Garden a coronavirus-free area. No new cases came from Dilshad Garden in the last 10 days, he said.

Under Operation SHIELD, the Delhi Government has formed 123 medical teams which screened more than 15,000 people living in 4,032 houses and hospitalised corona suspects in Dilshad Garden.

The decision was taken to contain corona spread amidst the possibility of presence of Tabilighi Jamaat people.

After the success in Dilshad Garden, it will be enforced in neighbourhoods with high concentration of COVID-19 cases. Dilshad Garden was the first successful implementation of Operation Shield,” Jain said.

“Seven people were found positive in Dilshad Garden. It was transmitted from a 38-year-old woman and her son (19 years old) who returned to Delhi from Saudi Arabia after meeting her husband on March 10. The woman found COVID-19 positive. Thereafter Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal instructed the officials to implement Operation Shield in Dilshad Garden,” he said.

With the help of CCTVs, mobile tracking, the Delhi Government learnt all details of the corona suspect.

“On March 12 she developed fever and cough, therefore, and visited a local doctor. On March 15 the woman was taken to GTB hospital where the doctors referred her to the RML hospital. On March 17 she tested positive, on March 18 the authorities traced that she had met nearly 81 people after returning from Saudi Arabia. On March 20 her brother and mother also tested positive and on March 21 her two daughters tested positive and on March 22 the local doctor who first saw her tested positive,” a Government official said.

The woman infected eight others, including a mohalla clinic doctor. The Delhi government traced all the people who came in touch with the woman and quarantined them.

“When the woman tested positive for COVID-19, we rushed to her residence to ask her family for names and addresses of people who had visited them since March 10, the date of her return from Dubai. Her son was not very cooperative, so we had to seek help of the local police to get information. We also used footage from the CCTV cameras installed near their home to identify some people who needed to be put under surveillance,” said Dr Nayak.

Out of the 11 points that lead to Sector L of Dilshad Garden, which reported most cases, nine have been completely shut with police barricades and neither vehicles nor pedestrians are allowed, not even essential services ones. Authorities also made announcement to inform the residents about the situation and urged them get in touch with them if they have met the family.

The whole area was sealed along with the Old Seemapuri after a Mohalla clinic doctor was tested positive.

“The Delhi Government is still tracking the people of the area and if there is symptom then they are being quarantined. The Delhi Government will also initiate random testing of the residents soon. By working round the clock in the last 15 days, Operation Shield was successful at Dilshad Garden. There is not a single positive case in the last more than 10 days from the area,” said Dr Nayak.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/op-shield-yields-results--random-tests-soon--says-delhi-minister.html

200,11-4-20,"More than 40 Indian-Americans, Indian nationals die of COVID-19 in US","More than 40 Indian-Americans and citizens of India have reportedly lost their lives due to the deadly coronavirus and the number of those having tested positive for the dreaded disease is likely over 1,500, according to community leaders in the US, now the global COVID-19 hotspot.

The US has become the world's first country to have registered more than 2,000 COVID-19 deaths in a single day with 2,108 fatalities reported in the past 24 hours, while the number of infections in America has crossed 500,000, according to latest Johns Hopkins University data.

New York, which has emerged as the epicenter of the COVID-19 in the US, along with adjoining New Jersey, account for majority of the death cases reported so far. Notably, New York and New Jersey have one of the highest concentrations of Indian-Americans in the country.

Among those who have died in the fight against the coronavirus, at least 17 are from Kerala, 10 from Gujarat, four from Punjab, two from Andhra Pradesh and one from Orissa. Majority of them are more than 60 years of age, except for one who was of 21 years of age.

According to a list of COVID-19 deaths compiled by PTI from various community leaders, more than a dozen Indian-Americans have died in the State of New Jersey, mostly around the Little India areas of Jersey City and Oak Tree Road.

Similarly, at least 15 Indian-Americans have reportedly died in New York.

Reports of the deaths of four Indian-Americans have also come from Pennsylvania and Florida. There has been confirmed deaths of at least one Indian-American in both Texas and California.

Reports indicated that at least 12 Indian nationals have died in the US due to the coronavirus, with a majority of them being from New York-New Jersey area.

""We have not seen a situation like this in the past,"" said Bhavesh Dave, who runs a commercial real estate business on the Oak Tree Road area of New Jersey often called as Little India.

Among those who lost their lives were Hanmantha Rao Marepally, CEO of Sunnova Analytical Inc. He passed away in Edison, New Jersey. He is survived by wife and two daughters.

Chandrakant Amin, a popular face at Indian Square in New Jersey City, and known for distributing flyers for businesses has also died of the novel coronavirus. He was 75.

More than 50 friends and family members of Mahendra Patel, 60, joined his last rites through an online video platform this week, after city officials in New Jersey told them that not more than nine of them could attend the funeral in person. At least one Indian-American died inside his home in New Jersey.

Community leaders said they estimate more than 400 Indian-Americans have tested positive in New Jersey and more than a 1,000 in New York. In New York City several Indian-American taxi drivers have tested positive.

There are reports of several community leaders being tested positive for coronavirus, but most of them requested anonymity.

Meanwhile, community leaders have started online and social media campaigns to find plasma donors so as to help in the treatment of those in serious condition. At least two of them were successfully able to find a plasma donor on Friday.

One Neila Pandya in Jersey City shared a video on social media on Friday, urging community members not to take the virus pandemic lightly.

Speaking in Gujarati, she said that all five of her family members are seriously ill, of which local hospital has admitted only two of them, as there were not enough beds.

Rasik Patel, 60, from Jersey City who was taken off the ventilator a few days ago is reportedly in a serious condition.

While there is sense of panic among Indian Americans, some of the community leaders have come out with a helping hand. For instance, Ajit, Sachin and Sanjay Modi from Rajbhog Sweets have been providing free vegetarian food at Jersey City Medical Center.

Dave from Oak Tree Road in New Jersey has started a fund raiser campaign to donate 1,000 face masks to health care professionals and first responders.

There are reports of several local restaurants in New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Florida, and Pennsylvania distributing foods to their nearest hospitals.

201,11-4-20,Many who died of COVID-19 may have had delayed ventilator support: Study,"Only about one-fifth of patients who died of COVID-19 received invasive mechanical ventilation and further aggressive respiratory support prior to death, according to a study which assessed the clinical characteristics of patients with novel coronavirus infection in China.

The research, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, assessed data obtained from 21 hospitals in Wuhan, China of the demographic, comorbidity, and respiratory support provided to 168 patients who died of COVID-19 between January 21 to 30.

According to the scientists, including those from Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University in China, while all patients received oxygen therapy during their hospital stay, 46 patients only received nasal or face mask oxygen before they died.

About one-third of patients, they said received high-flow nasal oxygen therapy, and 72 patients received noninvasive ventilation.

The study noted that only 34 patients were intubated and received invasive mechanical ventilation.

Based on these findings, the scientists believe that many patients had delayed intubation.

They said several reasons may explain this low proportion.

First, the study said some patients with critically low levels of oxygen in the blood did not have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath or dyspnea.

The lack of enough invasive mechanical ventilators was also an important reason preventing patients from receiving intubation, the researchers said.

Third, they said, a medical team which is not dominated by intensivists may not receive critical care training and may be uncertain on the timing for when a patient requires intubation.

The study also validated earlier findings that hypertension is the most common chronic comorbidity among patients who died.

Based on earlier studies, the scientists said the novel coronavirus infects the lungs through the angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptor.

However, they said further research is needed to find the mechanism of COVID-19, adding that clinical studies are also needed to confirm whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers could be beneficial for patients with COVID-19.

Noting the limitations of the study, the scientists said the data analysed were from patients who died during late January 2019, and they may not be representative of later cases of COVID-19.

205,11-4-20,"Google to show virtual healthcare options in Search, Maps","With COVID-19 lockdown, many people are unable to seek medical advice and keeping this in mind, Google is introducing two new features in Search and Maps ""over the coming week"" that will make it easier for people to connect to virtual healthcare options.

To prevent the spread of COVID-19, many healthcare providers are reducing or stopping in-person visits for a variety of patient needs, from the treatment of chronic conditions to mental health services to evaluating cough and cold symptoms.

Healthcare providers like hospitals, doctors, and mental health professionals in the US can now enter a virtual care offering in their Business Profile, so that people searching for their local provider, for instance, might see a ""get online care"" link on Search and Maps.

""Clicking this link will take people to that provider's virtual care website where they can find more information, and in many cases, schedule a virtual healthcare visit with a provider,"" Google said in a statement on Friday.

Health consultations over the phone or by video conference not only help alleviate strain on doctors' offices and emergency rooms but are also recommended as an important way to protect patients and staff against COVID-19.

To help communicate changes that might affect someone's visit, Google is automatically surfacing a link directly to health providers' COVID-19 information page on Search and Maps.

""We've assembled best practices on how healthcare providers can update their websites and provide COVID-19 information on Google My Business,"" said Julie Black, Director of Product Management, Google Health.

Beginning as a pilot in the US, Google will also begin showing widely-available virtual care platforms directly on Search so people can more easily access virtual visits.

People will be able to see widely-available virtual healthcare platforms directly on Search as well as the out-of-pocket cost for a visit.

Google Cloud is also supporting healthcare providers with technology infrastructure and solutions.

206,11-4-20,Facebook unveils new app review system to spot data misuse,"Alarmed by various data privacy scandals like the Cambridge Analytica one which involved 87 million users, Facebook has instituted a new app review system for developers, setting new limits on data access via their application programming interfaces (APIs) so that such privacy debacles can be identified well in advance.

The social networking giant announced an early testing of 'Data Use Checkup', a new annual process for developers to ensure API access and data use comply with the Facebook Platform Policy.

""Developers enrolled in testing should complete this request for each of their apps within 60 days, or risk losing their API access,"" the company said in a statement this week.

Last year, Facebook announced a new framework for protecting people's privacy and the information they choose to share.

The new 'Data Use Checkup' differs from App Review, a submission process in which developers justify that their intended use of certain API permissions is in compliance with Facebook platform policy and provides the best possible experience for people and clients.

App Review includes a manual review process by a Facebook representative, whereas 'Data Use Checkup' is a self-service tool that can be completed entirely by developers.

""We will enroll a small set of apps into Data Use Checkup, ensuring developers have a positive experience with this new integrity measure. If your app is enrolled, you will receive information via a developer alert and banner on the App Dashboard,"" informed Facebook.

To prepare for a broader rollout of Data Use Checkup, developers should update contact information in Notification Settings to include up-to-date contact details, ensuring they receive timely alerts and notifications.

""Assign an app admin for each app within your organization by going to ""Roles"" in your App Dashboard. Any app admin will be able to complete the Data Use Checkup, so they should be in a position of authority to act on behalf of your organization,"" Facebook told the developers.

Facebook admitted that its partner community is navigating the COVID-19 pandemic and it is committed to introducing 'Data Use Checkup' to the community in a way that doesn't create too much additional burden.

They told me the budget and I said, 'no, this is too less and why are we talking about the budget? Tell me the script. Only if I'm interested and you are interested in roping me, we can discuss about money, dates and all'. So he's like 'we're asking people if they are okay with the budget'. When I said 'no, it's less', he tripled the budget just in his next sentence. He said, 'I can give you this much also, but aapko 'compro' (compromise) karna padega',"" Maanvi said, according to the website report.

The actress said she was hearing the word 'compro' (compromise) after seven or eight years.

""'Hasmukh' is a purely fictional tale. But every fictional story is founded in some wild imagination. As the writer, that's what I have applied here. One can never imagine looking at Amol Palekar on screen and say that he can have a dark side. His on-screen characters are so affable and endearing. Hasmukh is similar,"" Vir said.

""I have tried to tap into the innocence of these legendary actors. Another inspiration for me was Peter Sellers whose comic timing I am big fan of,"" he added.

The series follows the journey of a young man from Saharanpur who wants to be the greatest comedian in the world. While he is a great writer, he lacks comic timing. It is a story of untamed ambition.

""The actor had the ability to switch effortlessly and that's what happens to Hasmukh. It's like he is two different people in the same body. But at the end of the day, there's only that much referencing you can do. The rest is all up to the imagination of the writer and director and that's how Hasmukh came to life.""

But Saqib is absolutely sure that the audiences will like ""83"" when it finally hits the cinema houses.

""I think whatever is happening, is happening for good. Obviously, we were all looking forward to the release of the film but I'm focusing on the brighter side of the picture. Once we are past this deadly virus, I am excited to present '83 to everyone out there,"" the actor told PTI.

Saqib will feature as all-rounder Mohinder Amarnath, who was awarded the man of the match in the final.

The actor said he has fond memories of the time he spent with the veteran cricketer while preparing for the role.

""I always wanted to be a cricketer and was training to be one. My mother was really passionate that I should become a cricketer and had worked really hard on it. When I decided not to pursue it further, she was heartbroken about it. So when we were shooting at Lord's stadium, I called her up and told her the loop that was unfinished, it's complete today.

""I was sitting at Lord's, getting the man of the match at the balcony where no film has ever been shot. Even if I had played for the national team, I don't think this would have been possible. I was going through a series of emotions,"" he added.

Like many of his fellow Bollywood actors, Saqib is also stuck at home due to the 21-day lockdown in the country.

To battle the general anxiety in the air, the actor is trying to not focus on ""negative or false information"" which is being spread on the internet.

""Right now staying at home is the need of the hour and I'm taking all the necessary precautions to stay safe.""

The actor said he's also using the time for introspection and is aware that as a public figure, it's important to send out the ""right message.""
