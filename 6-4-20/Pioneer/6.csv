0,06-4-20,Virus disrupts supply chains,"Organisations will have no choice but to redraw their sales and operations planning and adjust to the new realities

India is in a lockdown till April 14. Whether it will help us stop the exponential spike in Coronavirus cases, only time will tell. Meanwhile there is an economic challenge that is already unfolding. In the beginning of March, the only concern that corporates had was supply disruption, with critical centres in China, Italy and Korea being under lockdown. Now, the bigger concern is the consumer being grounded and the supply pipeline being strangled. While we can afford to lock down the whole population for some time, we still need to keep the consumer goods flowing at all times.

The first impact of the Coronavirus crisis was the explosion in demand for masks, sanitisers and hand-wash liquids. The availability of these items is still poor. People had already been stocking up on essential commodities since mid-March in anticipation of shortages and lockdowns. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of a 21-day shut down sent people in a panic-buying frenzy. Not only did people order in excess online but they also made a run on the nearest grocery stores. Some sense of the panic buying can be gauged by the spike in sales of e-grocers just before the lockdown. Before the shut down, the average “basket value” on the Big Basket platform was around 20 per cent higher than regular days. The number of orders on Grofers was 45 per cent higher, while the average order value increased by 18 per cent.

However, as soon as the lockdown was imposed, the operations of e-grocers came to a grinding halt as all delivery centres and staff were required to get local permissions for offering essential services and the process was very slow. The first week of the shutdown allowed e-commerce firms to complete backlog deliveries. In the second week of the lockdown orders are still being accepted but with delayed delivery schedules.

Items such as food staples, comfort foods such as instant noodles and essential home and personal care products like toothpaste, soap, shampoo, dishwash liquids and so on, will continue to be in demand. There may be a little drop in demand for a while once the hoarders feel content with their precious stock and start consuming as per regular needs. The news is not so good for other categories though. Official data from China indicates that the lockdowns in January-February caused a 20.5 per cent fall in retail sales. Given how “conservative” data from China often is, this figure could be much higher.

Experts believe that consumer sentiment is already taking a hit in India as well. Fear of loss or fall in income and uncertainty over health and well-being is curbing all non-essential and discretionary spending. As the health crisis abates, hopefully in the next three months, we will be in a severe economic slowdown/recession which may last up to two years. Consumer sentiment will thus continue to be low for some time to come, for all non-essential purchases. Major categories affected will be apparel, home decor and furniture, electronics and appliances, sports goods and automobiles.

However, the immediate and most pronounced impact will be on retailing as under lockdown and self-imposed social distancing, we will continue to see an increase in online purchasing. The direct-to-home delivery channels (including online) may actually see some sort of permanent shift in their favour. For essential daily needs, the neighbourhood mom and pop convenience stores will continue to be vital. Open format supermarkets and hypermarkets will be major losers. This means companies will need to re-organise their distribution based on this new reality. As of now, even these channels are struggling because of overwhelming demand and restricted last-mile supply. The sudden nature of the shutdown has also created a lot of confusion on what is “essential” and what is not. The Delhi Government, in a notification dated March 26, listed all the e-commerce companies, diagnostic labs and couriers that would be allowed to make deliveries, after earlier notifications left ambiguity on who could operate essential services. In most States such uncertainties are still being cleared and ironed out.

The possibility of an extended lockdown in the current form has been ruled out by the Government. However, some shut-in measures will remain beyond April 14. Intermittent complete lockdowns in the coming months for two-three weeks cannot be ruled out either. The altered consumer behaviour and present last-mile and retail bottlenecks will also have a direct impact on distribution and transport. Hubs and distribution centres will be stuck with a lot of non-moving inventory and may in some cases also face shortage of space for in-demand items. Till March 29, truck movement was severely restricted till the Centre allowed highway movement of all commodities and not just essentials. Hopefully, this will ease the problems, though delays and bottlenecks may still remain for some time. One thing is for sure, this will completely disrupt the warehouse throughput. Some warehouses will starve for stocks as they do not receive supplies, while others will choke due to the inability to distribute goods. Before the lockdown, there was a small concern among consumer goods factories with raw materials/components coming from China and South Korea. Now as China is opening up, we have gone into a shutdown. As production re-starts, sourcing will be an issue as different nations go into lockdowns. On the demand side, the consumption downturn will pose different challenges. Organisations will have no choice but to redraw their sales and operations planning and adjust to the new realities. An important lesson that managers have learnt is to take supply chain risks more seriously.

1,06-4-20,Farmers start harvesting,"With the help of administration, farmers have started harvesting their crops across the state while maintaining social distancing after the Yogi Adityanath government gave exemptions on the use of combine harvesters used in harvesting of Rabi crops.

“This year was very unpredictable. Rabi crops were damaged due to heavy rains and hailstorm and when the remaining crops were ready for harvest, the government was forced to impose lockdown due to coronavirus, the government spokesman said in a statement.

To ensure that farmers did not face any problem, the Yogi government gave exemptions in the use of combine harvester for harvesting Rabi crops, use of other equipment, workers, and opening of fertilisers and seed shops during lockdown. Now positive results are coming due to this decision. The farmers of the state are harvesting their crops while maintaining social distancing, the spokesman said.

Along with this, the Yogi government has taken many steps for the relief of farmers. The government has announced that the procurement will start on time at the minimum support price (MSP). The purchase of mustard, gram and lentils (masoor) has started from April 2. This will give much relief to the farmers of Bundelkhand and Agra divisions, the spokesman said.

The government will buy 2.64 lakh metric tonnes of mustard, 2.01 lakh metric tonnes of gram and 1.21 lakh metric tonnes of lentil (masoor) from farmers at MSP. The purchases will continue for 90 days.

The spokesman said that where crop had been damaged, the insurance companies had been asked to compensate the farmers for their losses in a time-bound manner. All district magistrates have been directed to issue passes to the employees of the Agriculture and Revenue departments along with those of insurance companies for the survey work.

So far, applications of more than 90,000 farmers have been received by the insurance companies, the official added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/farmers-start-harvesting.html
2,06-4-20,"Two minors raped by kin, one of them killed","In two incestuous sexual assaults in the state, a nine-year-old girl was raped by a kin and left with critical injuries in Firozabad while another eight-year-old girl was raped and murdered by her cousin in Gautam Buddha Nagar (Noida) during the last 24 hours.

In the first incident, Sunil (22) of Ujhani area of Mainpuri, visited his aunt’s house in Sirsaganj area of Firozabad. On Saturday, he took one of his nine-year-old female kin on the pretext of showing her some video clips on mobile phone. But he took her to a secluded place and raped her, causing serious internal injuries.

After the victim screamed for help, other relatives rushed to the spot and took the girl to a community health centre. But owing to her critical condition, she was referred to the district hospital.

A case was registered and the accused was arrested.

In Noida, Jeetu (19) was arrested for raping and murdering an eight-year-old cousin in Salarpur area on Sunday.

The minor was admitted to Child PGI Hospital for treatment but succumbed to her injuries. The victim was accused youth’s cousin.

The accused and victim lived in the same neighbourhood. The accused is a native of Nalanda district of Bihar.

A case of rape and murder was registered by Sector 49 police of Noida. Further investigations were underway.

3,06-4-20,Religious leaders back Yogi govt in fight against virus,"Religious leaders threw their weight behind the chief minister’s efforts to control the spread of coronavirus as Yogi Adityanath assured them that the situation was still under control and the government was making all efforts to harness it.

“This is an infectious disease which has tormented the world. Coronavirus does not distinguish between religions. Thus, it is necessary that we all fight it together,” Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath told the religious leaders of various faiths during video conferencing in Lucknow on Sunday.

The chief minister discussed various aspects and state’s preparedness in preventing the virus form spreading and also sought their suggestions in fighting the pandemic and assured them to implement important suggestions given by the religious leaders.

Yogi said that religious leaders were well respected by society and hence could play an important role in spreading the right information about the coronavirus among the people. He also shared with them details of efforts made by the state, which were successful in preventing the spread of the virus.

“This virus has caused many deaths in countries like America, Italy, Spain and Iran. Because of the quick decision and strong measures taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has been able to control the spread of the virus,” he said.

“Things have suddenly changed due to the Tablighi Jamaat,” Yogi said and added, “However, the situation is still under control and we are trying to identify the infected people.”

Mahant of Sankat Mochan temple in Varanasi, Vishwambhar Nath Mishra, suggested that all religious leaders should ask people to follow and ensure lockdown across the state. “We can ask the people to support the cause,” he said.

Maulana Masood Madni from Saharanpur said that infected quarantined people should not feel that they were under arrest and also suggested that news wrongly attributing the spread of virus to any religion should not be encouraged.

Maulana Khalid Rashid Farangi Mahali from Lucknow said that religious leaders should record an audio clip on coronavirus prevention and mosques could play it several times during the day. He also suggested creating a ‘Corona Warriors Committee’ to spread awareness among the people.

Religious leader of Shia community, Kalbe Jawwad, said that everyone should sincerely follow the suggestions of doctors and the government.

Sardar Yashpal Singh and Mahant of Kali Bari, Gorakhpur, Ravindra Das, too gave their valuable suggestions.

Similarly, Father Noon from Agra said that despite this week being an important week for Christians because of Good Friday, they were conforming to social distancing and had deferred all events.

Head of Hanuman temple at Sangam, Prayagraj, Narendra Giri, also shared his views. Mahant from Nirmohi Akhara and Sikh religious leader Joginder Singh also shared their views. Religious leaders from Ayodhya suggested stetting up of a lab in the city as many foreigners visited the holy city to which the chief minister assured that the government was preparing to open a lab in every district.

Yogi also assured the religious leaders that police would not take any coercive action against people of a particular religion.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/religious-leaders-back-yogi-govt-in-fight-against-virus.html
4,06-4-20,UP govt worried about new +ve cases among Jamaatis,"The death of the third COVID-19 patient in Uttar Pradesh on Saturday left the state government worried over the spurt in the number of positive cases, especially the sudden spike due to infected members of Tablighi Jamaat.

The tally of coronavirus positive cases in the state went up to 276 on Sunday with 50 per cent of them being Tablighi Jamaat members.

The third COVID-19 patient, a 55-year-old man, died at the Banares Hindu University hospital in Varanasi. He was also a patient of diabetes and hypertension, and had been consulting private doctors for the last couple of days. He was rushed to the BHU after his condition worsened.

This was confirmed by Principal Secretary (Health) Amit Mohan Prasad while interacting with the media in Lucknow on Sunday.

Prasad appealed to the people not to ignore petty ailments and contact Health department helpline 18001805145 to get medical advise round-the-clock and to wear mask every time they stepped out of their homes or entered any busy place.

The principal secretary said that the sudden spurt in number of COVID-19 patients in the state and elsewhere was due to detection of 138 new cases who were members of Tablighi Jamaat. The infected Jamaat members include 29 in Agra, 14 in Ghaziabad, 13 each in Meerut and Saharanpur, eight in Shamli, six each in Maharajganj and Kanpur and five in Ghazipur.

“At least six hotspot of coronavirus have been identified across the state where maximum cases were reported. They are 58 in Gautam Buddha Nagar (Noida), 44 in Agra, 33 in Meerut, 23 in Ghaziabad, 17 in Lucknow and six in Saharanpur. There are 3,375 people who have been quarantine in hospitals,” Prasad said.

Meanwhile, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi informed the media that 1,499 members of Tablighi Jamaat were identified in the state and 1,205 of them were quarantined. He said the police also identified 315 foreigner clerics attending the Jamaat markaz in Delhi and 42 FIRs were registered in 20 districts against them and passports of 248 were impounded.

“The large number of Jamaat members testing coronavirus positive is a big concern for the government but a massive contact mapping is being done in several regions in the state due to which in some localities, police have imposed total lockdown due to which people are facing problems,” he stated.

Awasthi said that at present, 5.5 lakh people were in quarantine in Uttar Pradesh, of which four lakh were in rural areas, 34,933 in urban areas and over one lakh in shelter homes. He said over 10 lakh food packets were distributed in the state on Saturday.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-govt-worried-about-new--ve-cases-among-jamaatis.html

6,06-4-20,60% Punjab villages in self-isolation,"Showing the way to tackle the COVID-19 crisis amid the stringent curfew restrictions in place, about 60 percent villages across Punjab have opted for ‘self-isolation’ while, at the same time, ensuring smooth movement of essentials.As many as 7,842 villages out of 13,240 have self-isolated themselves, to check further spread of the deadly pandemic.

The Village Police Officers (VPOs), recently appointed by the Punjab Police as a part of its unique ‘One Cop for One Village’ scheme, are playing a pivotal role in the facilitating the self-isolation.

Villagers have joined hands with the police in this measure of voluntary lockdown, and are also assisting police patrolling parties in restricting movement and preventing the entry of any unauthorized person.

Only those carrying valid passes or essential services are allowed into the villages, which have constituted special isolation teams that helped the police force in the initial stage of curfew to sensitize the rural masses on the need for tight restrictions in the prevailing situation.

Interestingly, drug peddling in these villages has reduced significantly due to the presence of village watchers – an incidental but welcome side-effect of the self-isolation. This is because the villagers recognize one another and can immediately identify any trouble-makers, said the state DGP Dinkar Gupta.

The self-isolation exercise began in the early stages of the lockdown when village panchayats were motivated by DSPs, SDs, and SHOs to enforce the curfew restrictions. They were apprised about the benefit of voluntary village sealing in controlling the spread of COVID-19.

Responding positively to the persuasion, villagers started blocking the entry points and setting up nakas to control movement. Social media campaigns also helped in motivating self-isolation.

The VPOs then took over to become the bridge between the villagers and the supply chain of essential items and urgent medical services, according to the DGP, who had launched the scheme on the directives of Chief Minister Capt Amarinder from Amritsar in February.

Gupta said that the Chief Minister has extended his appreciation for the role played by the VPOs in ensuring self-isolation of these villages, which have formed committees to effectively manage the self-isolation.

The committees include the Sarpanch, Pradhan and Ward Panch of the village, with the VPOs staying in regular contact with the houses through a Whatsapp group that includes village or ward committee members.

These committees are facilitated by the local police in ensuring regular supply of essentials, such as medicine and food, as well as supply of fodder and animal feed into the villages.

Veterinarian are allowed to visit into these self-isolated villages. Lifting of milk from villages by Verka and others is also being facilitated, while helps is provided, on demand, at PS and PP level on urgent basis for critically sick and other medical emergencies.

In some villages, complaints of misbehavior by youth deployed by the villagers at the nakas during evening or night time were received, but these were resolved through liaison between the villagers and police officers, said the DGP.

On the directives of the DGP, war rooms have been set up at the district level, and regular contact is maintained with the villages to assess the ground situation and ascertain any paucity of essential supplies. All directions and advisories of health department and the government are directly announced at the village gurdwara sahibs and temples.

Volunteers are issued I-cards to help in the process of implementing all orders. They work to maintain social distancing and follow up on quarantined persons.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/60--punjab-villages-in-self-isolation.html
7,06-4-20,DCs asked to prepare plans at micro-level to prevent COVID-19,"Haryana Chief Secretary Keshni Anand Arora on Sunday directed all Deputy Commissioners of the state to prepare and implement plans at the micro-level in order to prevent the outbreak of COVID-19 in their respective districts.

Special care should be taken of respiratory patients and if they have any problem, then they should be admitted to the hospital for their treatment, she said while holding a video conferencing of the Crisis Coordination Committee of nodal officers appointed for COVID-19, including District Deputy Commissioners.

She said that apart from two government testing laboratories of the state, five other private testing laboratories of Gurugram have also been authorized to examine the samples of patients.

She said that the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) has authorized these five private laboratories for testing and collection centers have been set up in each district for these laboratories from where the samples can be brought to the laboratories. Supervisory Officer should be deployed to monitor the data in the laboratories where the testing is being done so that accurate data can be collected, Arora said.

The State Government is considering to convert Panchkula's Civil Hospital, Mulana's Hospital and Agroha's 550-bed Hospital into COVID-19 hospitals, she added.

During the video conferencing, the Chief Secretary told the officers that the State Government has placed orders for taking additional thermal scanners and PPE kits and have about 1.5 lakh N-95 masks.

She directed the officers that smart helplines should also be used so that people do not face problems. Arora also directed to implement all measures to prevent COVID-19 in Nuh and said that the suspected COVID-19 people should be quarantined.

She said that the list of rates of goods with the hawkers and shopkeepers should be confirmed.

During the meeting, Additional Chief Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, Rajeev Arora informed that at present, Gurugram is carrying out the maximum laboratory tests of 400 persons per million, which will be increased to 1,000 persons per million in the coming days. Similarly, Nuh and Palwal have the capacity of testing 300 persons per million which will also be increased by the ratio of 500 persons per million.

At the same time, in Faridabad and Panipat, the facility of testing will be provided at the ratio of 1,000 persons per million. At present, COVID-19 testing is being conducted at PGIMS, Rohtak and Bhagat Phool Singh Government Medical College, Khanpur Kalan, and two private testing laboratories of Gurugram have also been added since Saturday, he informed.

He also informed that the State Government is also in talks with a testing laboratory in Mohali and a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) will be signed with it soon so that the testing of COVID-19 patients of the state can be done as much as possible.

He said that if a person tests for COVID-19 in the private laboratories, his information should be updated with the concerned civil surgeon and his data should be collected.

If a person gets his testing done under Ayushman Bharat scheme then the testing charges will be refunded, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/dcs-asked-to-prepare-plans-at-micro-level-to-prevent-covid-19.html
8,06-4-20,Populism the first ideological casualty?,"Regimes headed by populists are now facing a barrage of criticism that they cannot manage to divert or neutralise. As people around them continue to catch the Coronavirus and as economies crumble, social life has come to a halt and the air of fear thickens each passing day

In a series of documentaries for the BBC, between the early 2000s and 2016, prolific documentary filmmaker Adam Curtis demonstrates how, since the late 1970s — when the idea of social democracy began to come under tremendous duress — politicians in Europe and the US began to outsource their responsibilities to financial institutions.

Curtis links the evolution of this tendency to the demise of social democracy and the rise of ideas such as “neo-conservatism”, which eventually mutated to become the strand of populism that swept across many countries from 2014 onwards.

The weakening of the image of a politician who existed to serve the people through reform was allowed to be overshadowed by “technocrats.”

But as the old-fashioned politician faded away, a new kind of politician emerged. He was not only against the old-fashioned politician but also against the technocrat.

He was the new populist — charismatic, audacious, contradictory and almost demagogic in his rhetoric. Yet, he came to power through a democratic system.

He enjoyed a staunch base of support which was unmoved by his contradictory behaviour. His disdain for experts, intellectuals and old style of politics was applauded by many who began to see the old-fashioned politician as crooked and technocrats as cold, calculating exploiters.

This was post-modernist machoism: The muscular internalisation of the self by linking it to indigenous ideas of faith, culture and nationalism and the externalisation of existentialist threats through rhetoric against those deemed as outsiders or working with “hostile” external forces.

But just like most post-modernist ideas that often wobble and fail to hold in the face of various universalist ideas, post-modernist populism, too, found itself feeling entirely disoriented with the rapid global spread of a tiny virus and the consequential disease.

Indeed, almost every regime is struggling to grapple with the spread of the Coronavirus. But one saw the neo-populist governments completely lose their sheen and composure in this crisis. These include Italy, India, the UK, the US, Pakistan, the Philippines, Iran, Brazil and Hungary, and/or countries that had elected populists, even though Iran remains an authoritarian theocracy.

Again, even non-populist regimes are facing criticism but the thing about the neo-populists before the Covid-19 outbreak was that they were successfully riding out all other criticism in a world that seemed to have been okay with the idea of romancing nationalist chauvinism and even various forms of bigotry and irrationality. Science, too, became a victim of this disposition.

Nevertheless, regimes headed by populists are now facing a barrage of criticism that they cannot manage to divert or neutralise. As people around them continue to catch the virus and as economies crumble, social life has come to a halt and the air of fear thickens each passing day.

Thomas Wright and Kurt Campbell write in the March 5 edition of Brookings that the dreaded virus is “exposing the limits of populism”. They point out how certain populist regimes in developed countries exposed their country’s susceptibility to the virus by cutting down health programmes and related funding.

In an interview that he gave to the science newsletter Nautilus (March 12), the well-known virologist Dennis Carol laments that many countries today are governed by inertia. He said such viruses can only be tackled through a global response but populism has fragmented the global networks required to face the challenge.

He gave the example of Trump’s “America first” mantra that expresses the kind of inertia which is disrupting the fight against Covid-19. True to populism’s habit of externalising the source of a problem, Trump seems to be more invested in blaming China for the virus rather than his own regime’s incompetence in handling the pandemic.

On the website of the European Council of Foreign Relations, T Corratella writes that Covid-19 is weakening Italy’s brand of populism. The article adds that restrictive measures required to check the spread of the virus are antithetical to the ideas of neo-populism that mushroomed in many European countries. That’s why authorities are struggling to apply these restrictions in countries such as Italy, France and the UK.

However, Corratella says that the popularity of populist parties is plunging in those areas of Italy most hit by Covid-19. Same is the case in Pakistan, where the populist Government of Prime Minister Imran Khan, though tough in its rhetoric against “corruption”, seemed indecisive, even meek, when pressed to take the Covid-19 challenge head-on.

It is a simple matter of populists failing to recognise an enemy which does not belong in the cannon of threats that their pre-Covid-19 narratives had formed.

They can’t understand it. And the measures required to tackle it are at the opposite end of the post-modernist worldview through which they understand their political, economic and cultural surroundings.

As John Harris writes in The Guardian (March 15), populists all over the world had declared a war against civil servants, experts and scientific communities. But the crises caused by Covid-19 have brought these very communities at the forefront. One can thus assume that populism has become this outbreak’s first ideological casualty.

9,06-4-20,Risking the sacred covenant,"Even if the initial downplaying and non-evacuation of the Coronavirus-ridden USS Theodore Roosevelt was a practical necessity, the US naval leadership did not handle it properly

A cruel irony plays out as the powerful Nimitz-class nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, USS Theodore Roosevelt, succumbs precariously to what the US President had cuttingly called the “Chinese virus” or Coronavirus. The irony gets magnified with the ship’s call sign, “Rough Rider” and its motto, Qui Plantavit Curabit, or, “He, who has planted, will preserve.” With more than 100 sailors infected with the Novel Coronavirus, the mighty battle platform has been rendered ineffective like never before. The gargantuan warship with over 1,17,000 tonne displacement capacity to carry 90 aircraft and 5,000 crew members had been leading a China-centric strike group encompassing an air wing, cruiser and six destroyers before it figuratively ran aground with the first COVID-19 case being reported on any US naval vessel deployed overseas. The sheer apathy and indecisions surrounding the crisis in the US Navy are obvious from the fact that the first reported case came on March 24 and the request to contain the predicament went unheeded till it led to a spiralling of infected cases aboard. An embarrassing SOS followed from the Captain of the battleship.

Captain Brett Crozier wrote a desperate and blunt four-page letter to the naval leadership asking for “decisive action” and warned that the continuing dilly-dallying was “unacceptable.” His moving words, “We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset — our sailors”, hit at the soul of the seafaring nation with a proud naval tradition. The US’s legendary politician, the former Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox, had famously said, “No matter what happens, the US Navy is not going to be caught napping.”

Seemingly, it was caught napping in this incident as the optics were almost similar to the Japanese civilian cruise liner, Diamond Princess. Confusion led to the onboard quarantining of the ship with 712 out of the 3,711 passengers and crew infected with Coronavirus. Inaction on the part of the US Navy in responding to the initial request for containment measures onboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt led to a similar multiplication of infection. The $10 billion platform has now become a breeding ground for Coronavirus.

Living conditions on these platforms are extremely constrained to say the least. Sailors are placed cheek-by-jowl across a labyrinth of decks lined by steep ladder-like stairs and very narrow corridors. Armed to the teeth, the free space available is at a super-premium with up to 60 sailors sharing a sleeping compartment that is in bunk or rack formation, crammed together in stacks of three. All 60 of them could be sharing one bathroom with a very sparse common area. Workplaces are similarly constricted. The space to maintain the prescribed social distancing or to have proper decontamination is not possible without full evacuation.

However, evacuation has been the bone of contention with the Captain suggesting a residual force of 10 per cent or 500 members to stay on board to perform sustenance duties; whereas the Chief of Naval operations has insisted on 1,000 sailors in order to maintain the safety and security of the ship.

At stake is the nuclear power plant, four squadrons of Boeing F-18 fighter aircraft, one squadron of Growler electronic warfare aircraft, two squadrons of Seahawk multi-mission helicopters, one squadron of Grumman E-2 Hawkeye early warning aircraft and another squadron of Greyhound cargo aircraft. Besides, the aircraft carrier’s own munitions, including three Phalanx CIWS, two RIM-7 Sea Sparrow weapons systems and two RIM-116 infrared surface-to-air missiles. Securing the operational worthiness of the ship has inadvertently counter-posited the same vis-à-vis the concern for the safety of the sailors onboard. While the US naval top brass is rejecting allegations of either a lackadaisical attitude or failure to take care of its sailors, this incident has highlighted the overall lack of preparedness and sensitivity towards such exigencies — be it in the civilian or in the military realm.

However, what will haunt the hallowed institution of the US armed forces much after the Coronavirus crisis has settled is not so much the apparent defencelessness from a

medical or an infrastructural perspective, as much as the reaction of its senior leadership towards the soldiers at the forefront.

Captain Brett Crozier alluded to this leadership aspect when he stated that keeping the crew on the ship was “an unnecessary risk and breaks faith with those sailors entrusted to our care.” Equally, the leak of the letter to the Press has also diminished the principle of good order, restraint and discipline that behoves a combat leader, whatever the circumstances.

Even a direct letter to the ostensible Commander-in-Chief, as opposed to the Press, would have been construed to be a lesser dereliction of the institutional traditions. This incident will trigger a debate on the sacred covenant between the soldier and service, which always prides that they “leave no men behind.” Sometimes, the practicality of the situation and the cruel principle of “larger good” lead to an unfortunate compromise as it happened in the US’ decision to drop atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This, knowing it fully well that occupied American prisoners-of-war (POWs) were held up in these locations. Even if the initial downplaying and non-evacuation of the Coronavirus ridden USS Theodore Roosevelt was a practical necessity, it was not handled with the required concern, alacrity and reassurance from the naval leadership.

Naval leaderships are given to the very finest and noblest traditions that always put the honour of the nation and the people under command above the interest of the leaders themselves. The saga of Indian Navy’s captain, MN Mulla, who chose to go down with his ship in the India-Pakistan war, is the sort of DNA that professional navies thrive on.

Therefore, the US Navy will be forced to navel-gaze on its own handling of the USS Theodore Roosevelt issue as the most visible, intimidating and deadly “five acres of mobile US land.” Diplomacy cannot sink to such lows.

10,06-4-20,Jobs drying up,"The Class of 2020 from premier institutes is going to suffer as much as the rest of the graduates

As news begins to filter in that companies are using the “conditional” part of a “conditional offer” they made to graduating students from India’s premier institutes such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) to withdraw job offers, the young and talented Indians might feel outraged and despondent. But unlike the good times, when one rescinded offer meant 10 other good ones fell into one’s lap, this time round, offers made by the elite “Fortune 100” companies are falling by the wayside. Many jobs that involved moving to the UK or the US have been put aside as businesses will try to work out the costs of the slowdown, which will inevitably come with a rise in nationalism as millions of local jobs will be lost. Post-Corona rebuild means each affected country prioritises its own needs and people. In the US, for example, foreign nationals have succumbed to the unfortunate yet unavoidable consequence, which is of unemployment. Thousands of techies and skilled workers, around 67 per cent from India, holding a non-immigrant visa (the H-1B category) are now on a sticky wicket. What’s worrying them more is the fact that they face the prospect of being an illegal immigrant as visas for most professionals have lapsed. All they have is a 60-day grace period to find a new job. Frankly speaking, in these strained times, it is an impossible task. An evacuation flight emergency operation, too, remains off the radar. This is why demand for a minor change in the H-1B rules — to allow a 90-day grace period — has been making headlines. The earlier hiccups of the US Government, where it had imposed curbs on the issuance of H-1B visas notwithstanding, the Trump administration has been a vocal opponent of the demands by technological firms lobbying to extend the programme that would allow more immigration.

Thus, it might be years before India’s top export — that of talent — recovers. While the best graduates from the better schools and colleges will find jobs even in a weak economy, the sudden stopping of the brain drain faucet must be looked on as a positive. Instead of losing its best talent to the Silicon Valley and the global financial sector, India will hold on to some of this talent. Maybe finally a Satya Nadella or Sundar Pichai could make it big in India instead of having to go abroad. That said, the glut of talent and the inevitable lack of jobs across sectors is going to mean that many of the average boys and girls, who graduate, will not find worthy employment. With the service industry, too, in tatters, there will be a lot of stories of young, destitute people. This is why the Government will have to spend, spend and spend not only to get the infrastructure sector going but also the private sector. The job losses that will result from the viral crisis are expected to wipe out even the modest gains made by India in the past decade. Things are going to be tough and it will take exemplary leadership and economic planning to pull the country out of it, at least pull it out of this crisis better than the rest of the world. This cannot be done by the current political and bureaucratic leadership alone. India needs to set up war councils on the economy. Councils that should not just have the country’s top industrialists and corporate leaders but also the finest brains in our country, many of whom teach abroad. We cannot avoid the economic desolation that the virus will leave in its wake but we should now start working towards the rebuilding and the reimagining of India’s economy for the next three to five decades. Only then can those, who find themselves jobless and without opportunity in the aftermath, can have some hope for the future.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/jobs-drying-up-2020-04-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/jobs-drying-up.html
11,06-4-20,The Dharavi project,"If the BMC does contain the virus spread in Asia’s largest slum cluster, then it would be a rescue template like no other

Dharavi, Asia’s largest and clustered slum, has registered three cases of Coronavirus and unfortunately, one death as well, taking India’s battle against the virus to another level altogether. An Armageddon we are not ready to fight just yet but our containment drill now will be to identify, isolate and choke clusters considering the density of population and the less than standard safety and hygiene protocols. Dharavi is home to a whopping one million slum-dwellers crammed in a roughly five-square-kilometre maze of narrow lanes, ramshackle buildings, shanties and open sewers. With families of six-seven people packed like sardines in tiny quarters, social distancing is a privilege none can afford. Such community clusters may just be our Achilles’ heel in the fight against the rapidly-spreading Coronavirus that has ferociously battered the entire human population of the planet. Given the rate of the disease spiral, community transmission is a given, at least in such contiguous settlements.

Urban slums are indispensable to the economy of the country as a vast percentage of daily-wage labourers, industrial workers and domestic help live here, keeping the service economy going. They represent a valuable human resource. Water sources and sanitation facilities are shared by multitudes of people and existence is by the brush of the skin. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has quarantined and stamped all the people who may have come in contact with the victim but tracing people who float in and out is still a humongous challenge. The BMC swung into action quickly, in alliance with the police, fire brigade, doctors and healthcare workers called the Contain Dharavi Operation. This multi-pronged strategy didn’t let up for 24 hours at a stretch. They immediately separated people above 60 who were also suffering from some respiratory diseases and tested them. In fact, if more positive cases show up, they will test all 125 senior citizens in the vicinity. The affected, the senior citizens and those with underlying health conditions will be moved to the district sports complex if need be. This micro pin-pointing is arduous and meticulous but is our only hope to stave off a human disaster. It is through non-pharmaceutical means, lockdowns, testing and isolation through which we can contain and confine the malaise, may be delay its inevitable spread. With even developed countries such as the US, Spain and Italy being overwhelmed by the pandemic and their healthcare facilities facing a crisis, we need intense community vigilance. With rapidly-increasing numbers of positive cases being reported every week, it is estimated that our hospitals will be overwhelmed by the end of May or even sooner considering that the number of hospital beds per 1,000 people in India is only 0.7, compared to 11.5 in South Korea. What’s equally alarming is the fact that some States could reach the point where they don’t have enough hospital beds to treat critical COVID-19 patients much sooner than others, notably Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi and Punjab. This is a time for sharing resources and expertise and while we have to shut out the world, States and the Centre need to pool in and share resources to save our communities.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-dharavi-project-2020-04-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/the-dharavi-project.html
12,06-4-20,"Situation under control: CM Asks MPs, ministers to ensure govt benefits reach poor","Assuring lawmakers that the situation in Uttar Pradesh was under control, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath asked all parliamentarians and ministers to ensure that the benefits of government schemes reached the person on the last rung.

On Sunday, the chief minister held discussions with all MPs from UP and state ministers through video conferencing and appealed to them to ensure that the common man standing on the last rung got benefits of the state government’s schemes.

He asked the MPs and ministers to keep a watch in their respective areas so that the people do not face problems during lockdown.

“I also invite suggestions on keeping the crowd organised and ensuring social distancing when lockdown is lifted in a phased manner,” Yogi said.

The chief minister said that whenever the lockdown was lifted, crowds would be out on the streets and this could affect the measures being taken for prevention and containment of coronavirus. He said suggestions from people’s representatives would help the government in chalking out strategies in this regard.

Yogi said the decision to lift the lockdown would be taken only after getting suggestions on where and how much relaxation should be given in the first phase. He also sought suggestions on which organisations should be given exemption and how much.

“The challenges will remain even after the lockdown is lifted. Thus, we need to be prepared in advance. Making people aware of the need for social distancing and following it in public places should be our first priority,” the chief minister said.

Yogi appealed to all MPs and ministers to contribute Rs 1 crore from MP/MLA Local Area Development Fund and to MLAs to donate one month’s salary to the Uttar Pradesh Covid Care Fund. He pointed out that Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati had also appealed to her legislators to contribute to this fund.

Discussing in detail the amount of money coming in the fund, the chief minister said that this fund would be used to expand the healthcare system of the state.

He also said that this fund would help in expanding the capacity of medical colleges and district level hospitals.

“Money will be spent on the procurement and arrangement of ventilators, PPE (personal protection equipment), isolation wards and testing lab at district level,” he said, adding that there was an effort to collect about Rs 1,500 crore for this fund, so that necessary works could be expedited.

Apart from this, he also appealed to the general population to contribute to this fund.

Yogi appealed to the lawmakers for their cooperation while expressing his views on three main issues. The chief minister said that a decision had been taken to give Rs 1,000 to vendors, labourers, e-rickshaw drivers, rickshaw-pullers and daily wagers across the state. He said this amount would be directly transferred to their accounts.

The chief minister appealed to lawmakers to identify people who did not have ration cards and bank accounts. “Identify such people and get their bank accounts opened so that Rs 1,000 can be transferred in their accounts,” he said.

Yogi said that about 3.50 lakh workers had come to UP from different places and they did not have ration cards or bank accounts. He said such people should also be identified and it should be ensured that they got ration cards and their bank accounts were opened. He said all people’s representatives should cooperate for this in every district.

13,06-4-20,VHP demands ban on Tablighi Jamaat,"Terming Tablighi Jamaat and its Nizamuddin markaz a nursery and nourisher of Islamic radicalism and terror, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) called for a complete ban on the outfit and demanded an inquiry into how clerics who entered the country on tourist visas were allowed to promote jihadi indoctrination and radical Islam.

VHP’s central joint general secretary Dr Surendra Jain said that the financial sources of Tablighi Jamaat, which was endangering the lives of all Indians, should be identified and their bank accounts, offices and activities stopped at once.

Jain said that after the hard work and achievements of 8-day pan-India lockdown, the entire country was taking a sigh of relief and the growth rate of coronavirus victims was just 2.8 per cent.

“But on March 30, a corona explosion took place in Nizamuddin markaz. More than 2,300 Jamaatis were evacuated from there, of which 500 were COVID-19 positive and 1,800 had to be quarantined. More than 9,000 Jamaatis spread the coronavirus across the country,” he said.

“On March 31, the growth rate suddenly jumped to 43.02 per cent, shocking the country. Indigenous and foreign coronavirus-infected clerics hiding in mosques and madrasas began to be taken into custody. Due to them, the possibility of community transmission of the fatal virus increased. On March 14-15, the Jamaatis had planned a similar congregation in Mumbai where 2,000-3,000 Jamaatis were expected to take part. But it was stopped on VHP’s opposition,” Jain said.

The VHP leader further said that instead of being ashamed of the heinous crime, radical Islamists chased and beat up policemen and health workers in several cities. What is more, doctors and nurses who went to save the lives of the coronavirus-infected clerics were attacked, he charged.

“At the quarantine centre at Narela, even Army doctors and soldiers had to be called in. Not only in Nizamuddin, but clerics across the country delivered speeches to inflame the community. A cleric from Bengal, Abbas Siddiqui, instigated the namazis and went to the extent of saying that Allah would send a virus that would eliminate 500 million Hindus,” he said.

Jain also said that more than half of coronavirus infected persons in the country were Jamaatis, maulvis or those infected by them. “The entire country is stunned with by inhuman behaviour of the Jamaatis and it seems that they are using COVID-19 as a weapon to eliminate humanity,” he said.

The VHP leader demanded that Jamaatis and their ijtema (congregation) be completely banned and Nizamuddin markaz building and its bank accounts be seized.

“Besides, their financial sources should be discovered and closed and a list of foreigners participating in ijtema be provided to External Affairs and Home Affairs ministries,” he said.

Questioning the free movement of clerics, who came on tourist visas, to promote jihadi indoctrination and radical Islam, Jain said that departmental proceedings should also be initiated against the guilty officers.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/vhp-demands-ban-on-tablighi-jamaat.html

19,06-4-20,Coexistence with nature is the need of the hour,"There are many conflicts among humans all over the world, be it in families, neighbourhood or beyond the boundaries. Gradually these conflicts escalate to quarrels, fights and then war if not managed properly and brought to a consensual solution.

War has been fought to prove ones supremacy over the so called enemy. Initially humans were fighting with primitive animals and then fought with the other races to increase their influence and to increase their territory of control but recently most of the humans are uniting to fight with nature to have more comfort and security.

On March 24 prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe declared the postponement of the summer Olympics to be held in July-August 2020 in Tokyo. There was a significant emphasis in news that in the past only war had cancelled the Olympics. Is it not war which is going on for last three months in the world? The war which is being fought this time is not war among the human armies as it was in 1916, 1940 and 1944. The war of 2019-20 is like a “Third World War” between mankind and a micro organism named COVID-19 which is thought to have emerged in the wildlife market of Wuhan in China and has spread in almost all countries of the world by the time of this article being written. COVID-19 has infected more than a million people and has killed more than 50,000 of them in a span of nearly three months from its emergence since December 31, 2019. The authors have an apprehension that this number will continue to increase in near future if we analyse the history of novel coronavirus management in Wuhan, Hubei, China.

It is difficult to say at this stage who will win this war, whether the giant army of 7.8 billion humans or the new born micro organism COVID-19. Considering the past experience, it seems this war will also be won by humans but at what cost? It is estimated that financial loss globally will touch nearly $20 trillion, in addition to the human loss. Almost half of the world population is locked down in their houses in efforts to prevent spread of the virus in their community. Anticipating the consequences of COVID-19 pandemic, our Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation and declared the lockdown of the whole country for 21 days from midnight of March 24 to control the further spread of infection in the rest of the population.

Any infection can kill people in mass numbers as it has been seen with outbreaks of plague, small pox and polio in the past. There is no other known disease or weapon which can kill millions of people of different parts of the world in such a short period of time. War and famine could be within the control of humans but not spread of air borne infection by a bacteria or a virus.

Environmental improvement, scientific and technological advancement would have less effect on such infection as it has been seen in COVID-19 infection. The virus emerged in China which claims to be the would be superpower of the world and it has spread the most in a country -- USA which is supposedly the most developed and current superpower of the world.

Renowned anthropologists, Douglas P Fry and Patrik Soderberg reviewed the documented anthropological studies about organised war between humans and nature and they concluded that some of the most primitive people on earth were actually quite peaceful compared to modern civilised people.

It is said that our ancestor chimpanzees are much more peaceful.

We have lived in coexistence with plants, animals and nature for millions of years that’s why our species has survived till date but we think recently we have forgotten the concept of coexistence.

In recent times, the existence of bio diversity is reducing. Survival is a natural instinct of all living organisms including bacteria and viruses. According to United States Centre for Disease Control, humans always try to find out new means and other alternative to survive, so do the viruses and bacteria which undergo mutations to survive new medicines in order to stay virulent.

Isolation in closed space and social distancing in open space are the key factors to prevent the spread of COVID-19, hence isolation of not only humans but those of cities is also needed. But considering the current scenario of overcrowding in homes, over populations in country and poor planning and designing of the houses and cities, it is almost impossible to maintain isolation and social distancing in most of these houses not only in rural areas but even in big cities particularly in the slum areas. Is it not a wakeup call for our leaders and policy makers to accommodate the current population in both closed and open spaces?

We may somehow be able to contain the current COVID-19 infection which is spread by droplets and then physical contact but what will we do if there is an air borne infection in the near future with a high virulence?

After learning from the novel coronavirus pandemic, are our planners going to bring changes in town planning or re-think about a population policy which needs to be strictly in place or think about a national food policy to increase the body resistance to fight with such infection or have a national environmental policy which emphasises on concept of coexistence with nature?

Nowadays on an average millions of people are travelling daily and some of them are reaching from one end of the world to another within a day. This mode of infection is very alarming and world has seen the consequences of this fast travelling where airplanes have become carriers and vectors of infection. If we analyse, it could be true that COVID-19 has emerged from Wuhan, China but who is responsible for its widespread transmission? Is it not the humans? Bat is still said to be the origin of COVID-19, but now human to human transmission is possible and humans have become a host.

Nature can survive if any specie becomes extinct including humans but surely humans cannot survive without nature. Survival of humans depends upon air, water and food which are produced or reproduced by nature. Humans can only transform these natural resources to make them useful or for their trade.

Unfortunately humans cannot make or generate any new resource without involving any of these natural resources. All human inventions are based on transformation of one resource to another, that being their only credit. This haphazard misuse and transformation of natural resources is the root cause of ecological imbalance. If at all transformation is needed or desired then it should be done in harmony with nature.

The way COVID-19 has infected the whole world irrespective of geographical boundaries, it has proved the Indian dictum of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbhakam” -- whole world is one family. If one member of family is infected, the others are prone to get infected. According to the most accurate scientific census nearly 8.7 million species are living on the earth. A total of 1.3 million species have been identified and described and human species is one of them. Imagine if giant dinosaurs can become extinct, then similarly, humans to can be put at the risk of getting endangered, if we do not live in a symbiotic relation with mother earth. Nature is great and we all should love nature but we can start loving nature only when we are in close contact with it. If we try to explore its beauty then we will spontaneously start loving it the same way we love our family, community and nation.

Besides, each Deputy Commissioner has been given Rs.50 lakh to deal with the crisis situation, he added. All the 4562 Panchayat Mukhiyas have also been provided Rs.10,000 each to deal with the effects of the pandemic, the CM’s letter said.

The Government is also distributing free dry ration among families in the State. According to the CM’s letter, around 5000 such packets comprising 2kg flattened rice, half kg Chana and Half KG jaggery (Gur) have been distributed in Ranchi alone, the letter said. The Government has also identified seven lakh people who do not have ration card, and has decided to give 10 Kg rice to each of them free of cost, it added.

The Government is providing food to people kept at Isolation Centres, Quarantine Centres and Relief Camps. It has launched 10

helpline numbers on which at least 40 people can call at a time, the letter said. Soren, through the letter, sought support of all Government representatives and public servants in fighting Coronavirus as a team and protecting the people of the State from the lethal virus.

He has also been seeking the support of commoners in keeping the transmission of the virus in control.

Jharkhand, by now, has reported three positive cases of Coronavirus – one each from Ranchi, Hazaribag and Bokaro. While the Government is collecting at least 50 samples for tests every day, experts say that the testing process needs to be expedited in order to detect the cases and prevent further transmission.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm---s-didi-kitchen-feeds-1-2-lakh-people.html

32,06-4-20,Don’t make corona a pandemic of hysteria!,"The outbreak of coronavirus has sent chills down the spine globally. But is it worth becoming a pandemic of hysteria? And will this hysteria help us anyway to come out of the situation or will it just worsen the story further? Let us analyse few facts to instil a proper sense of understanding on how to tackle the situation.

What concerns us more is not just the rate of mortality, but the speed and rate of infection, because it might overwhelm our medical system, so much so that we cannot afford to properly treat the patients with established treatment protocol.

As of now we have nearly 3,000 active cases and 87 deaths. According to analysts it is linked to the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi’s Nizamuddin which was attended by some 3,400 people in early March from different parts of the country. Even then also, our situation is far better than many other countries in the world, irrespective of the fact that we have a poor rate of testing.

According to the WHO, the rate of mortality is 3.4% globally. In Italy it is 11%, in Germany it is less than 0.8%, in South Korea and Iceland it has so far been less than 1%. The rate of infection and mortality has a lot into it to be understood. Italy has been the worst affected but the grim picture has cogent reasons behind it. The average age of those who died in Italy is 82 years, which is the case in 99 percent of corona-related death cases and roughly below 1% who died were healthy and young. The German and Korean mortality rate being so low is attributed to the fact that the average age of those affected were below 43 years and unlike Italy they went on for random and aggressive testing, as it is now proven that, the more is the quantum of testing for COVID-19, the less is the chance of spreading, since we can effectively quarantine, treat and check the spread of the contagion.

As per reports, Iceland has done remarkably well in Covid-19 testing, as it has tested each of its citizens and there has been just one death due to corona and that too of a lady aged about 75 years.

In Corona positive cases, co-morbidity or presence of other life-threatening ailments in the body is a major determining factor behind deaths. It is essential to understand that there is a distinction between ‘death due to Corona ’ and ‘death with Corona ’. Say for example Italy, in the total deaths so far in Corona cases, only in 12% cases death certificates have been issued where it is mentioned that the death is due to COVID-19 infection and in rest 88 percent cases co-morbidity has played a crucial role, so it is therefore quite difficult to zero on, as to corona infection being the sole reason. Let us not forget that Italy is inhabited by world’s second most old population; so old age and co-morbidity played a major role or an influential critical factor.

In the Indian scenario, there has been no severe COVID-19 infection case so far and the numbers are quite too less in comparison to our global counterparts; and in most of the death cases, the deceased were either aged over 60 with compelling co-morbidity or if they were young, they had serious renal problem or failure and other co-morbidity. Though there is no quantifiable and reliable data, it seems that there is very high genetic diversity in the Indian Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA), which is present in our genes and is elemental in protecting us against the foreign antigens attacking our immune system. This may be due to various reasons, like we are exposed to a lot of viruses and bacteria in our daily life, primarily because of our poor social hygiene, poverty, unplanned and unhygienic inhabitations.

Besides, heat might be a reason of limited spreading and effective containment of the virus, though there is no proper study to suggest this with accuracy; and, therefore, there are two opinions about it. But we have experience from the SARS outbreak in 2003 which got reduced when temperature reached 29 degree Celsius and have not made any effective return since then. Studies have shown 95 percent of the acute infections have been within the narrow latitude band of cold countries where the temperature threshold has been within 17 degree Celsius. So, one cannot reject it with precision that, as the mercury soars up in India, with summer waves the rate of infection would go down.

Given the above data analysis, it is quite clear that, what we need to do is, keep a firm grip over the situation. The measures we have taken nationally, mainly with reference to the lockdown may not be something to adhere in the long run but it is a prudent step in flattening the curve. The excellent management of the Covid-19 situation in Odisha is also quite commendable, especially in enforcing the lockdown with catering to public emotions with a daily Press statement being made by Subrato Bagchi, the State COVID-19 spokesperson, the early devising of the online registration facility for those who have returned from outside the State and abroad, and incentivising such registration with Rs 15,000, the establishment of two dedicated COVID-19 hospitals one at Bhubaneswar and one at Cuttack within a short period of time (which shall be elemental in checking the spreading of the virus to other non-COVID-19 patients), and ensuring supply of essentials and most importantly the meticulous and diligent tracking of each Covid-19 positive case and those who have come in contact with them.

And this is what, which is called proper attitude and good governance at least as regards the present situation at hand is concerned and it cannot be denied that, among the Indian States, Odisha is leading the war against corona.

But the only thing that worries us is the condition of the poorest of the poor. The mass exodus of migrant labourers who assembled in Anand Vihar bus terminus to return to their villages in Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh is an eye opener to many of us. We need to come up with a tangible action plan to effectively redress their livelihood and health concerns, else entire mission shall be nipped in bud and we will see the most savage dance of death, both due to uncontrolled infection and starvation. Apart from that, as we unlock the lockdown, we should go for targeted lockdown of areas where the infection still persists, and go for more tests, because it’s a fact that the virus won’t die anytime soon within this 21 days lockdown. It will definitely cling to someone or the other amongst us and may go back to the older version if let loose.

The above data analysis is quite encouraging, while we cannot afford to be complacent, but the story is not as grim as many of us think. We still have a lot of hope in defeating the virus. So, what we need therefore, is perseverance and patience both among the citizens and the Government; then we can effectively come out of the situation and not let this disease turn into a pandemic of hysteria.

42,06-4-20,Some lesser-known facts about Odisha,"The land that celebrates diversities in true sense; the land that boasts a rich cultural heritage and calendars more festivals than months in a year. That’s the glorious Odisha!

With constant transformation from an ancient province of Mauriyan empire to the modern Odisha, the land has never lost its essence of socio-cultural magnificence.

Earlier a province of Bihar, Odisha separated into an independent State on April 1, 1936. To celebrate the united spirits of Odias, this day has been celebrated as Odisha Foundation Day or Utkal Dibas ever since.

Here are some lesser-known facts about Odisha:

It was initially named Utkal, as it was a land of majestic art and craft where some of the finest artisans settled down.

Around 2000 years ago, the land was home to tribes of civilized, urbanized and cultured people, who resided in Kalahandi, Balangir and Koraput regions with Asurgarh as their capital. This was way before Odisha became the core of Samrat Ashoka’s Kalinga.

The land is mentioned in the Ramayan and the Mahanbharata as Kantara which altogether included Kalahandi, Koraput and Bastara. Records from 4th century point out that Odisha, the then ‘Indravana’ was a vessel of precious stones and gems of the Mauryan empire.

After separation from Bihar, Odisha became the first independent State that was formed on linguistic basis.

Newly-formed Odisha had six districts, Cuttack, Puri, Baleswar, Sambalpur, Koraput and Ganjam. It was established at the Kanika Palace in Cuttack.

John Austin Hubback became the first Governor of the separate province of Odisha. The initial capital of the State was Cuttack. Later, Bhubaneswar was declared as the capital.

58,06-4-20,When COVID defeated by immunity of righteousness,"“I have come to infect you,” said Covid Nineteen.

“Why me,” I asked. “I haven’t done anything in life which deserves punishment,” I said with the confidence of an upright person, though I was trembling within. I knew well what would happen if I get infected by the virus. No one will come near me, either to give food and water or to touch me or to take me to the hospital.

On hearing me sneeze and cough and seeing my running nose, nobody will even touch my forehead to see whether I have fever or not. Some merciful well-wisher, in a hurry to protect themselves, lest the disease should not spread in the neighbourhood, may ring the helpdesk and call a medical team. After this I will be taken to the hospital and be drowned in isolation. If condition worsens, I will be put on ventilator and slowly life will be choked out of me.

These thoughts made me shiver. But I knew that teachers have always been respected in the society so I continued, “You know I am a teacher. I do my duty sincerely. If I die, many students will be bereft of my care and knowledge?” Covid started laughing, “Ha, ha, ha! You say you teach the students. Ha, ha! You impart knowledge to the students? Don’t you know that students can collect much more knowledge from the internet than you can provide? You don’t even have a nano-bite of information with you in comparison to the World Wide Web? And as far as teaching anyone is concerned, don’t you know that nobody can be taught. You can only help a person to learn and that is what you are doing. Stop eulogizing yourself.""

I was dumbfounded. Years of praise from the students, parents and the authorities, which had developed confidence in me and stealthily turned into arrogance and pride, shattered. Was the way, I was carrying myself, inappropriate for a teacher? “But, for the whole life I have worked hard for my students. I have always been approachable to them. There has always been a soft corner within me for the needy. My students have performed well in the examination. Then why shouldn’t confidence develop in me?” I could feel strength gathering within.

“You sermonize among your students that parents are the living Gods on the earth, whereas you had left your parents in the village while you enjoy the lavish life of the city?” Covid spoke accusingly. It pricked my sore heart. Many a time, my conscience had lashed at me when I had bought new dress for myself, dinned in the hotel, strolled in the park or enjoyed the chill of air- conditioned room after returning home on a summer afternoon, to think how my mother and father would be in the village. How at this old age my mother would be cooking, washing and mopping? How my father would be walking in the scorching sun? Did he have an umbrella with him? Was the ‘chappal’ I gave him on my last visit to my village still sheathing his feet? But what else could I have done? They were not ready to leave the village till the time they were upright on their feet. Mother would sometimes agree to come to the city to live with her grand children but father would never agree to depend upon my earnings till he was active. And mother would never leave him.

“Do you accept that you are a hypocrite?” said Covid.

“No,” I said emphatically. “My parents were more happy living together in the village than they would have been in the self-centered city life. Rather I was sad and felt guilty living away from them. And when the evening of their life had dawned, I had brought them to the city and provided them with the best medical facilities, love and care. I had spent many sleepless nights beside their bed. They had left for heavenly abode, with me, their daughter-in-law and their grand children at their bedside. Covid, don’t you think, I can stand as an example in front of my students?"" I said.

“But you don’t mix well with your colleagues and neighbours. They look down upon you as a proudy and quarrelsome person; and so does your authority,” Covid was hell-bent to make me weak within.

“Social distancing Covid, social distancing. Just as people are taking all precautionary measures so as not to get infected by you, so do I keep distance from infectious thoughts of corruption, prejudiced criticism, flattery and groupism. The Indian Constitution and our Code of Conduct gives explicit instruction to refrain from these. I am sure you will agree with me that from the time I enter my work place, till the time I leave it, I work for the students and carry out the orders of my authority,” I replied.

“Yes”, admitted Covid feebly.

“Then, wherein have I let myself down, to buy unworthy comments of a few of those around me? And, yes, those who are not true to their salt, will surely find me hostile,” I retaliated.

“I will not spare you,” said Covid with an air of finality.

“See Covid, I don’t have any regrets. I have never cheated anyone or enchased on their helplessness. I have helped everyone who asked for. If ever, I couldn’t, immediately I have informed them about my constraints, instead of pulling the wool over their eyes. I have done justice to my family. If destiny has planned to culminate my life, I stop all resistance. Fulfill your wish,” I said.

“You have agreed. But the resistance in your body is nullifying all my efforts which I have been making since long. How have you developed such immunity in your fragile body?” Covid asked.

“It’s the immunity of righteousness, my friend,” I said triumphantly.

He was taken away by a medical team and admitted to the Civil Hospital in Ludhiana on Saturday night.

Confirming the development, Ludhiana Civil Surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said that samples of eight people from the man’s family have also been sent for testing. All the family members of the patient, including his mother, father, wife, two children, two sisters and one brother have been brought to Civil Hospital, and have been quarantined and their samples have been sent for testing.

In another case, 42-year old man tests positive in Dera Bassi tehsil of Mohali district’s Jawaharpur village. He runs a small bakery in the village, and reported to be and undergoing treatment in the private hospital in Mubarakpur kasba nearby on March 30. He was shifted to Sector 32 hospital a day before, and tested positive on Sunday.

“Neither he nor the village has any travel history. Two of his Muslim labourers had met some Nizammudin Tablighi Jamat returnees in the last week of March. 25 of his primary contacts have been quarantined,” said the government official.

Ludhiana reported its second coronavirus death on Sunday. A 69-year-old COVID-19 positive woman, with co-morbid conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure, died at a private hospital in Ludhiana.

Ludhiana Civil Surgeon Rajesh Kumar said that the woman had no recent foreign travel history. “She was a heart patient and had high blood pressure and sugar. She had earlier tested positive for novel coronavirus,” he said. The official said that she was admitted to a private hospital in Ludhiana in a serious condition on March 31.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/two-more-die-in-punjab.html

61,06-4-20,"Situation under control, more to do after Jamaat’s event: Banwari Lal","Blaming Tablighi Jamaat for sudden spike in the number of coronavirus positive cases in the State, Haryana Cooperation and welfare of SCs, BCs Minister Banwari Lal said that the state government has taken all necessary steps to face the challenge and threat posed by the growing pandemic of COVID 19. He says that the current situation in the State is under control, but we need to work more after the Tablighi Jamaat’s Delhi event that led to a huge spurt in Covid cases in Haryana and other parts of the Country.

Stating that social distancing is the only way to protect oneself and others from this deadly virus, he said that now government’s topmost priorities are to strengthen the supply chain and the delivery of essential commodities at the doorstep of the people during the lockdown period.

He says farmers do not face any financial problems in this crisis time as the government has postponed the repayment of installment of loans taken by farmers from the State’s Cooperative Banks for three months (till June 30). The Cooperative Minister said timely procurement of wheat and mustard crop yields is being taken care of on top priority and officials asked to complete the necessary preparations without delay.

In an interview with ‘The Pioneer’, the Cooperative Minister talks his initiates taken to facilitate farmers and the people during lockdown. Excerpts from the interview:

After 12 days of the lockdown, what are the areas on which the State government is focusing now?

During the on-going lockdown, things are being monitored at each level of administration. The well-being, safety, and health of the citizens of the State are the top most priority of the Government. Apart from strengthening necessary facilities like PPE kits in hospitals, our government’s topmost priorities are to strengthen the supply chain and the delivery of essential eatable items wheat, pulses, vegetables, milk and cooking gas at the doorstep of the people. Officials have been asked to distribute ration under under PDS among intended beneficiaries in a staggered manner, ensuing social distancing. Special focus is laid on providing eatable items to poor and labourers in the State.

How do you assess the situation in the middle of 21 days of lockdown?

Indian government has rightly announced lockdown on March 24 as it was only a way to fend off the Covid-19 spread. Our government is strictly implementing it. Despite difficulties, people responded well and strictly following social distancing to break the chain of Covid-19 infection. The current situation in the State is under control, but we need to work more in the coming days after the Tablighi Jamaat’s Delhi event that led to a huge spurt in Covid cases in Haryana. At administrative level, a massive exercise is underway in the State to identify and track all possible contacts these delegates may have made after their return from the Nizamuddin event and extending the chain of infections. Order has also been issued to quarantine such people at their home or hospital after being examined.

There is only one question among the people of the State that how long this lockdown will continue? Whether it would continue beyond April 14?

So far, the situation is under control and I would only say that we should hope for the best and be ready for the worst.

Large number of farmers have taken loan from Cooperative Banks. Due to lockdown, they may face difficulties to repay the installment of loan. What initiative has been taken in this direction?

We have decided to postpone the repayment of installment of loans taken by farmers from the Cooperative Banks of the State for three months.

What are the steps taken to ensure smooth procurement of rabi crop yields in the State?

In the recent meeting, instructions were given to the officers concerned to ensure the procurement of Rabi crop yields in the State Mandis on time. They were told to make sure that accommodation, food and other arrangements for all workers engaged in transportation and other works at mandis are done without delay.

Have you made any plan to deploy stranded labourers in the fields to harvest crop yields as farmers are in distress due to shortage of manpower? Is it possible for the State government to implement doorstep procurement of rabi crops?

Harvesting of Mustard and Wheat is on the peak as farmers are now busy in their fields. It is true that following lockdown, farmers are facing difficulties to get labour to cut harvest from their fields and are dependent on local labour. We appeal them to use machines for harvesting and threshing. With the help of local administration, farmers may directly approach labourers to involve them in harvesting with the assurance of providing them food, medicine and other necessary facilities. But they need to harvest crops while following social distancing norm. As Haryana is a small State and mandis are set up in almost every 10 kilometres across the State. So there is no need to implement doorstep procurement of crop yields. As per government order, the procurement of these crops will be done by issuing coupons after collecting the data registered on ""Meri Fasal Mera Byora” portal by the farmers.

In the middle of the lockdown, what will be your message for the people?

All should follow necessary guidelines during lockdown as I also do the same. I work from my home and conduct meeting with the officials from time to time and give them necessary directions over the phone. In spare time, I read books, practice yoga and watch Ramayana, Mahabharata on Television. As all State’s Ministers and MLAs have donated their one month’s salary towards Haryana COVID-19 Relief Fund so I appeal to the people to donate money on relief fund.

Opposition raised their concerns of alleged victimization of people of a particular community after Covid positive cases increased in the aftermath of Tablighi Jamaat’s Delhi event. What do you say of their concerns?

This is baseless allegation. At this movement, all should work for human life. I would like to say that every person in the State who has come in contact with the attendees of the Tablighi Jamaat’s Delhi event should inform the administration so that they could be tested. District authorities have been asked that all those who retured from Tablight Jamaat’s Nizamuddin Markaz since March 1 to be tested for Covid-19. All those who had tested positive have been isolated and put under treatment at various hospitals. Now the situation on the ground is that the areas where these people were found have been declared containment zones and their nearby areas have been declared as buffer zone. Officers have been directed to follow all the protocols regarding the same.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/situation-under-control--more-to-do-after-jamaat---s-event--banwari-lal.html

Mohammad Dilshad committed suicide under a shed at his residence in Una''s Bangarh village, a day after health officials dropped him at his village following his negative report, an official said.

He was taken to a quarantine facility a few days ago where he tested negative for the disease.

Una Sadar SHO Darshan Singh said Dilshad was one of the contacts of a Tablighi Jamaat member who had returned from New Delhi’s Nizamuddin.

Commenting on it, DGP Sita Ram Mardi said, ""Some villagers pointed out that this man was a suspected COVID-19 patient. He was quarantined and tested negative for the infection. When he returned to his village, he was discriminated against and socially boycotted by villagers. At this, he committed suicide.""

However, the SHO told PTI that the matter was being investigated whether he was discriminated against or socially boycotted by villagers.

""I have sent an ASI on the spot. So far, no issue of social boycott or discrimination has come to the fore. I will be able to say anything in detail about this at around 5 pm after the ASI''s return,"" He added.

Meanwhile, the DGP urged people to maintain social distancing (to check the spread of COVID-19), which ""does not mean social discrimination"".

66,06-4-20,SAD asks CM to call all-party meet to resolve problems caused during curfew,"Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Sunday asked Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to call an all-party meeting immediately to evolve solutions for the problems being faced by the people due to the long spell of curfew imposed in the State to combat COVID-19.

SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, in a letter written to the Chief Minister, said that the extended curfew had resulted in a number of problems for the masses, including farmers, health workers, traders and daily wagers.

“We need to find solutions for these problems immediately before they spiral out of control, leaving behind a trail of destruction in every sector and compounding the sufferings of every segment of the society,” he said.

Sukhbir said that even though harvesting and procurement of wheat crop was on the anvil, there was a huge shortage of labour as well as combine harvesters in the State due to lockdown in force across the country.

“Besides, special arrangements need to be made including lifting of the purchased crop as large gatherings of farmers and traders cannot be allowed due to the threat of Coronavirus,” he said while stressing the need to resolve these issues quickly as they had the capacity to create food scarcity in the country.

Regarding “badly affected” supply chain of essential items in the State, SAD president said that the long spell of curfew has left many people without food items including medicines, fruits and vegetables.

“These basic supplies must be restored to every citizen of the state as it will help the state administration in keeping every Punjabi indoors and make this fight against the contagious Coronavirus really effective,” he said adding that the supply of animal feed had also been disrupted and steps should be taken to bring it back on rail.

Apprising the CM about the lack of healthcare facilities in this war against COVID-19, the SAD president said that medical staff, including doctors and nurses, treating Coronavirus patients did not have access to protective medical gear including PPE kits.

“Hospitals are facing acute shortage of ventilators, medicines and other medical equipment. How can our frontline workers fight this battle when they do not have even the protection kits to save themselves from the deadly virus,” he said adding that Government should find ways to make all hospitals and medical staff well equipped in this time of crisis.

He requested the CM to discuss all these issues thread bare at the all-party meeting, so that the people of Punjab could be made to stay indoors and help the state machinery in its fight against the dreaded pandemic.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad-asks-cm-to-call-all-party-meet-to-resolve-problems-caused-during-curfew.html

The number of patients tested positive for coronavirus reached 571 by Sunday, said Beela Rajesh, Secretary, health and family welfare. She also disclosed that 86 patients tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday out of which 85 were Tablighi Jamaat members who returned from the recently held Delhi meeting.

As the number of persons falling victims to the dreaded touched fie and the State recording an unprecedented number of coronavirus cases the first signs of panic could be felt all over the State. Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami has called for an emergency video conferencing of all district collectors, police officials and other top bureaucrats for Monday morning to discuss the situation arising out of the latest developments.

As a first step towards resorting to stringent measures , the Chief Minister ordered the closure of all business establishments by 1 PM everyday. “ Shops selling essential items can function from 6 am to 1 pm. They should down the shutters at 1 pm and we will not allow any business activities after 1 pm in iew of the prevailing situation,” Palaniswamy said in a release.

The health secretary said during her media briefing on Sunday that the top priority of the administration was on full-fledged containment activities to restrict the virus to the stage-2 level itself. As part of the measures to contain the corona virus to manageable level, the Government has incorporated the services of 26 private medical colleges and 138 private hospitals where the COVID-19 patients could get admitted for treatment.

“We have screened 39 lakh persons as well as 9.22 lakh households for corona virus. The operation is an ongoing process and the departments of health and revenue are working round-the –clock to detect, diagnose and care persons afflicted with corona virus,” said Rajesh.

The social impact of the total lock down is being felt in the State in a major way. Three persons died in Puthukottai district in Tamil Nadu late Saturday following the consumption of after-shave lotion . All the three were addicted to liquor. With liquor and alcohol becoming scare in the State, they were told by ‘friends’ that a cocktail of after- shave lotion and soda has the potential to give them the much needed ‘kick’. All the three died within minutes of consuming the potion. The State-Government owned liquor outlets downing their shutters following the national lock down has sent the seasoned liquor consumers in to a state of helplessness. With bootleggers too ithdraing from the scene following strict policing, alcoholics have been left helpless and clueless.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/confirmed-cases-in-tn-rise-to-571--toll-reaches-5.html
97,06-4-20,Controversy over fixing quarantine poster at Union Minister’s house,"There was no let up in political controversies even amid corona crisis with Union Minister Debashree Chaudhuri getting embroiled in a tiff with the State administration after the local panchayat and district administration officials approached her residence for the second time at Sudarshanpur area of Raiganj to fix ‘home quarantine’ posters.

Chaudhuri a Union Minister of State who recently returned from Delhi soon drew flaks for going out in public to distribute masks instead of remaining confined to 14-days mandatory home quarantine.

On Sunday the Minister had a fresh row with the local authorities and panchayat staff after they went to her rented house to affix a quarantine poster.

She had shooed them away earlier too, the panchayat members complained, while Chaudhuri wondered whether such posters were being pasted at the residences of all the Union Ministers and MPs like Trinamool Congress’ Sudip Bandopadhyay and Sougato Roy. Hitting back Bandopadhyay said rules were alike for all the citizens and the administration had taken a specific decision considering certain reports --- of her coming out in the public --- “whereas I have not come out of my house and have remained confined indoors.”

Clashes erupted down on the streets too, this time among the general public after panic-stricken villagers resisted setting up of Corona quarantine centres at various places in Bengal.

Hours after a person was killed at Talibpur village in Birbhum district where people in favour of setting up quarantine centres fought with those opposing it villagers raided a nursing home at Chanchal in Malda district following reports that the administration had acquire the facility as a corona quarantine centre.

The villagers who vandalized the private nursing home and burnt tyres on the road to protest the setting up of the quarantine facility said that the administration had ignored the local people’s concern that the nursing home was situated in a congested market place and that there was fear that other people could also get infected if it was to be made a quarantine centre.

A large posse of police men was rushed to the spot to bring the situation under control, sources said.

In the earlier incident a 40-year-old man was killed when groups opposing the setting up of a corona centre at Talibupr fought with those supporting the cause. The two hurled bombs at each other leading to the death of Saiful Sheikh, police said.

“The people were opposing the district administration’s decision to set up a corona centre in a hostel adjacent to a school,” a local said. A large police force has been deployed in the village. The ruling Trinamool Congress saw BJP hand in the skirmish, which the saffron party denied.

102,06-4-20,ICMR: No proof of Covid-19 being airborne disease,"The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Sunday said that coronavirus is not an airborne infection, as is being reported by some studies, asserting that it was the case then every person in a family would be infected and same would apply for other patients in a hospital.

""We need to understand that in science whoever does experiments, there will be different opinions, but we need to take a balanced, evidence-based approach,” ICMR scientist Raman R Gangakhedkar said at a Press briefing here.

""For example, if it was an air-borne infection, then in a family whoever has a contact they all should come positive because they are living in the same surroundings as the patient and the family is breathing the same air. When someone is admitted in the hospital, other patients would have got exposure (if it was airborne) but that is not the case,” the scientist explained.

Gangakhedkar also informed that the rapid antibody based blood tests kits for Coronavirus will be deployed by Wednesday, implying that the tests will begin from that day only. If put to use, this would be the first time India will use serology for detection of disease. The council had last month issued tenders for the procurement of 5 lakh antibody test kits.

The serological antibody blood test, which deliver results in 15 minutes, work on blood samples instead of nasal swabs and will tell whether a patient has ever been exposed to the novel virus. Similar tests have been widely conducted to check for influenza, human immunodeficiency virus and Zika.

The ICMR has already issued an advisory to start rapid antibody based blood test for coronavirus, enhancing the screening strategy in line with its containment plans in high-risk areas and Covid-19 hotspots.

So far, the Government has identified over 70 hotspots and high risk zones including clusters (containment zone) and large migration gatherings or evacuees’ centres across the country.

“As a matter of abundant precaution, all symptomatic ILI (influenza-like illness) are to be monitored in health facilities. Any surge in cases to be monitored and brought to the notice of surveillance officer/CMO for additional investigation,” the advisory said.

It added all ILI persons should be home- quarantined for 14 days. At facility level, all symptomatic people with influenza-like illness having cough, cold, low-grade fever and sore throat will be tested with rapid antibody tests.

“If a patient tests positive after a rapid antibody test, decision will be taken based on clinical assessment and treatment in hospital will follow. As per protocol, contact tracing will also be done.

“In case of negative results, RT-PCR may be done if warranted. The revision in the strategy came in view of the increasing number of cases in last few days needing an immediate check on migrant workers, who left cities for their homes, for Covid-19,” it added.

The advisory also mentioned that as a matter of abundant precautions, all symptomatic ILI persons should be advised home quarantine for 14 days.

At facility level, symptomatic ILI individuals are to be tested using rapid antibody test.

The guidelines mentioned, “Antibody test negative: if warranted, confirm by real time RT PCR using throat or nasal swab. If RT PCR negative: likely non COVID19 ILI and if RT PCR positive: confirmed COVID 19 case and action as per protocol to be initiated for isolation, treatment and contact tracing.”

To ensure that all such cases are monitored and necessary action is initiated with respect to infectious can disease management, ICMR has sought details of all test results to its portal and update real time data.

Failure to do so, they will be held liable to action under Disaster Management Act, 2005.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/icmr--no-proof-of-covid-19-being-airborne-disease.html
103,06-4-20,Lighting lamps alone won't help win war against virus: Cong,"The Congress on Sunday said lighting lamps alone will not help win the war against coronavirus and demanded answers from the Government on the safety of health workers in the absence of adequate protective gear.

The party also said lifting of lockdown should not be done in an unplanned manner as its implementation .

""Just as lockdown alone cannot fight coronavirus, lighting alone cannot help. Merely lighting a lamp will not help win the war against coronavirus. If the Government of India does not fulfill its duties, it is not possible to fight the war against coronavirus, Congress spokesperson Sushmita Dev said at a Press conference through video conferencing.

""There has to be proper planning and provision of personal protection equipment (PPEs) to those fighting this war. There is also the need for an economic package for the poor and vulnerable,"" she said amidst the reports coming from various places including Bihar about lack of PPEs.

Highlighting the absence of enough protective gear for the medical workers dealing with COVID-19 cases, Dev said at least 50 doctors have been infected by the deadly virus.

She also sought to know when would the Centre provide compensation to those who have died due to coronavirus, as she said state governments were not financially equipped to provide the same.

""Hundred people have died so far, will the central government give compensation to their families? These are some questions which we ask in national interest and not in criticism of the government,"" she said.

Asked if the Congress supported lifting the lockdown, Dev said it is for the government to decide.

""We only hope it is not done in an unplanned manner as the lockdown was imposed the sacrifice of people and the hardship faced by them for the last 21 days should not go waste,"" she noted.

The Congress leader also alleged that against the demand of 62 lakh PPE kits, only 3.34 lakh kits are available for doctors and paramedical staff at present.

""If we cannot protect our doctors, nurses, technicians and other paramedical staff who are in the forefront of fighting this war against coronavirus, then this country is not prepared for this fight, Dev said.

Accusing the government of delaying by five weeks issuing orders for allowing manufacture of PPEs locally in the absence of guidelines till March 24, she said the 50 doctors who contracted the disease could have been averted.

She also asked if the government has approved any agencies to test these PPEs manufactured locally.

Dev also questioned the government on increasing the number of ventilators required in the country, as only 40,000 of them are available, of which 20,000 are not working properly, according to reports.

She also called for large-scale testing to curb the spread of the disease.

104,06-4-20,"States ban production of tobacco, chewing gums to stop Covid-19 spread","Fearing that the habit of spitting after consumption of tobacco and chewing gums can add to the spread of Covid-19, State Governments are taking stringent measures like prohibiting not only their consumption but also production.

While Uttar Pradesh Government has banned manufacture, distribution and sale of pan masala in the State, Himachal Pradesh has prohibited sale of chewing gums for the next three months, hoping that by that time the disease will ebb. A couple of days ago, Haryana had imposed similar prohibition on chewing gums, adding to the prohibition list that includes gutka and Khaini among other tobacco items. More states may join the list, an official from the Union Health Ministry said.

COVID-19 is known to be transmitted through the droplets released when an infected person sneezes or coughs and there is a possibility of transmission by spitting chewing gums or tobacco items like gutka and khaini.

The Himalayan State’s move came the same day when the Indian Council of uthka aMedical Research (ICMR), a research wing of the Union Health Ministry, urged the people not to consume and spit smokeless tobacco in public places.

“Chewing smokeless tobacco products (gutka, pan masala with tobacco, pan and other chewing tobacco products) and areca nut (supari) increases the production of saliva, followed by a very strong urge to spit.

“Spitting in public places could enhance the spread of the COVID19 virus,” the ICMR said in an advisory here.

“In view of the increasing danger of COVID-19 pandemic, it is an appeal to the general public to refrain from consuming the smokeless tobacco products and spitting in public places during the COVID epidemic.”

“The habit of spitting after consumption of paan masala or sharing its pouches may contribute to the spread of the infection. In wake of this, the state has imposed a complete ban on the manufacture, distribution and sale of paan masala with immediate effect,” the Yogi Government order stated.

It also said that those who violate the ban will invite police action and punishment as per relevant provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act and Food Safety Act.

Dispelling fears of community spread, Tripathy also said that the shutdown was primarily imposed to investigate the COVID-19-positive cases in Surya Nagar and Bomikhal areas of the state capital.

""The Surya Nagar case can be traced back to Kolkata, while patients in Bomikhal locality had links with Bhopal. Therefore, as per our investigation, community transmission of COVID-19 can be ruled out to a large extent,"" he said. The chief secretary, however, asserted that all restrictions imposed by the Centre and the state government would continue to remain in force.

Strict action will be taken against those found flouting the social distancing norms, he stated.

""District collectors and police personnel have been asked to enforce social distancing in market places. People should not step out of homes in large numbers and create chaos (once the shutdown is lifted).

""The government will have no option but to implement tougher measures, in such circumstances, he said.

Tripathy further said that local authorities have been empowered to seal COVID-19 hotspots, if and when necessary, and carry out surveillance and trace contacts.

Maintaining that the state government has adopted best practices, in keeping with the guidelines issued by WHO, he said that the 48-hour shutdown, which ends at 8 pm on Sunday, was a complete success, and that similar steps might be taken in the days to come, if people were found violating rules.

Noting that around 80 per cent of COVID 19-positive patients did not exhibit symptoms initially, he said social distancing, if not maintained, could invite trouble.

The chief secretary urged community leaders and opinion makers to raise awareness on coronavirus among people.

He also appealed to Tabligh Jamaat event attendees to come forward and register themselves with authorities, who would then arrange for their medical tests. Three persons, including a religious leader, who had attended the event in Delhi's Nizamuddin have tested positive for COVID-19 in Odisha.

Meanwhile, the administrations in Jajpur and Puri have imposed a shutdown in several pockets of the two districts on Saturday.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/no-crowding-on-streets-after-shutdown-is-lifted--odisha-govt-warns-people.html

117,06-4-20,"SRK gives office space for quarantine facility, BMC praises move","Having been at the receiving end of the Shiv Sena, its late chief Bal Thackeray and the Shiv Sena-led Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for years on end, Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan has come in for wholesome praise from the BMC for his generous gesture of offering his four-storey personal office space for quarantining Covid-19 patients in Mumbai.

Amid massive work undertaken by it in various parts of Mumbai to combat Coronavirus, the BMC put out a tweet on its handle @mybmc: “StrongerTogether We thank @iamsrk & @gaurikhan for offering their 4-storey personal office space to help expand our Quarantine capacity equipped with essentials for quarantined children, women & elderly. Indeed a thoughtful & timely gesture!”.

A pleased SRK responded: “When we say ‘mybmc’ then it’s with a sense of ownership and pride in all the efforts your teams are putting up to fight covid 19. We both are thankful that we could be a part of your attempts to help and care for Mumbaikars. ???? Mumbai ???? BMC”

In response to support extended by the actor for combating Covid-19, Shiv Sena leader Aditya Thackeray had tweeted earlier: “Thank you so much @iamsrk ji for your support” . Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray's office also tweeted: “Thank you @iamsrk ji @gaurikhan ji”.

In response, SRK tweeted: “We don’t ever have to thank each other during times like these. We r a family. Grateful you are working so hard for Maharashtra and whenever you get alone time...do write a poem or two. Love to you”.

In another tweet put out a half Marathi-half English tweet, SRK said that “all of us are together ... with bits and bits of effort can result in an ocean of assistance. Thank you for guidance. We are all a family sir....and we need to be together to keep each other healthy. Thank you”.

The latest developments, which have seen SRK come back into the good books of Thackerays and Shiv Sena, should be seen in the context that several run-ins he had with the Sena and late Thackeray over the past decade and a half.

It may be recalled that In February 2010, Thackerays had come down heavily on SRK during the IPL-3 auctions which coincided with the release of “My Name is Khan”.

Shahrukh had come in the line of fire from late Sena chief for his remarks in favour of the inclusion of Pakistani players in IPL-3. Sr Thackeray, later, in an editorial, also said that he should now make a film – 'My Name is Kasab'.

On November 26, 2010, the Shiv Sena had hit out at Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan for his reported move to attend a celebrity dinner to be hosted by Prime TV, a Pakistani channel, in London on Sunday to “commemorate” the second anniversary of 26/11 attack on Mumbai.

Though the actor himself was not available for comment at that time, his office in Mumbai had denied reports that he would attend the celebrity dinner hosted by Prime TV and said that Shah Rukh was currently away in Berlin shooting for Don 2.

Earlier in September 2007, Shahrukh had found himself in a fresh spot of bother on Thursday, as the Bombay High Court asked him to explain the alleged violation of development control rules in the construction of a multi-storey building adjacent to his bungalow ""Mannat"" at Bandra in north-west Mumbai.

Hearing a PIL, the high court had directed the actor and BMC to reply to the objections raised by the BNS within two weeks.

Acting on a complaint by BJP MP Poonam Mahajan, the BMC issued a notice to actor Shah Rukh Khan in February 2015 asking him to remove the concrete ramp built on the road adjacent to his bungalow.

The actor had been given seven days to demolish the ramp which is built on the northern end of his bungalow Mannat. In case Shahrukh failed to do so, the government agency would do it on their own. The ramp was built in 2007 by Shah Rukh to park his vanity van.

Poonam Mahajan had taken up the matter with the BMC, after receiving complaints from the local residents about the chaos and traffic caused by the ramp illegally constructed by the actor.

However, on one occasion, the BMC stood by Shah Rukh in connection with a complaint made by social activist Varsha Deshpande before a magistrate court seeking action against SRK, his Gauri and five others under the Pre-conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) (PCPNDT) Act.

At a hearing before the Bombay High Court held on September 12, 2013, the BMC gave a clean chit to Shah Rukh and his wife Gauri, deposing that there was no substance in the allegation made against the celebrity couple that they had conducted pre-birth sex determination tests of their surrogate son AbRam.

In an oral submission made before Justice Sadhana Jadhav of the high court, BMC’s senior counsel M P S Rao told the high court that the civic body had conducted an inquiry into the allegations made by activist-lawyer Varsha Deshpande in her complaint against the actor and his wife), and found that there was nothing incriminating on record against the couple.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/srk-gives-office-space-for-quarantine-facility--bmc-praises-move.html

One of the students at the Army wellness centre in Jaisalmer who did not want to be named told IANS over the phone that they want to return home in Kashmir.

She said they have already completed their quarantine period from Iran and there is no reason for them not to be released.

She said there is no segregation of low risk, moderate risk and high risk patients at the facility.

""We want to go to our homes we are here for more than 20 days now and we will be here for another 10 days, which is totally unfair, we know the precautions, but staying here for more than 30 days is not good,"" she said.

""We don't know whether we have been held up because our quarantine period has been extended or this has something to do with the lockdown.""

123,06-4-20,COVID-19: FinMin working on second relief package to revive battered economy,"The Finance Ministry is working on a second relief package for the Indian economy hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak and the 21-day nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the contagion, sources said.

Last month, the government announced a Rs 1.70 lakh crore relief package in the form of foodgrains and cash transfers for the poor and vulnerable section of the society to help them deal with the hardships caused by the lockdown.

Now, the government is working on a stimulus to be given to hard-hit sectors of the economy after the lockdown is lifted, sources said, adding, an announcement is expected in the next few days depending on the severity of the pandemic.

Besides, further relief measures are being worked upon to mitigate the hardships faced by citizens, especially the poor and vulnerable section of the society, sources added.

The finance ministry along with the empowered group constituted by the Prime Minister's office (PMO) is working tirelessly on this aspect, sources said.

Last week, the PMO constituted a seven-member empowered group headed by Economic Affairs Secretary Atanu Chakraborty, who is monitoring the situation on a daily basis.

The empowered group is not only looking at the pain points of the economy but also the distress and misery being faced by a large section of the society who have been rendered jobless due to the outbreak.

Besides Chakraborty, the other members of the panel are Expenditure Secretary T V Somnathan, Labour Secretary Hiralal Samariya, Rural Development Secretary Rajesh Bhushan, Department of Financial Services Additional Secretary Pankaj Jain, Joint Secretary in Prime Minister's Office Arvind Shrivastava and Deputy Secretary in the Cabinet Secretariat Amrapali Kata. The panel is also looking at the rural distress.

Since top officials of three departments of the finance ministry are part of the group, it can be construed as the Finance Ministry itself.

According to sources, the group is looking at the stress in various sectors including MSME, hospitality, civil aviation, agriculture and allied sector and based on the inputs working on the stimulus package.

The comprehensive package once prepared will be vetted by the Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and announcement would be made by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, source added.

The announcement is expected to be made towards the end of lockdown so that the industry can be put on track and the economy can be reinvigorated as soon as possible.

Last month, the Finance Minister announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore stimulus that included free foodgrains and cooking gas to poor for three months, and cash doles to women and poor senior citizens as it looked to ease the economic impact of the nationwide lockdown.

As per the announcement, 80 crore poor ration card holders will each get 5 kg of wheat or rice and one kg of preferred pulses free of cost every month for the next three months, while, 20.4 crore women having Jan Dhan bank accounts would get cash help of Rs 1,500 spread over three months.

Over 8.3 crore poor women, who were handed out free cooking gas connections since 2016, will get free LPG refills for the next three months, while poor senior citizens, widows and disabled will get an ex-gratia cash of Rs 1,000.

Sitharaman had hinted at more announcements if need arises.

Meanwhile, the Union Cabinet on Monday approved a 30 per cent reduction in salary and allowances of Members of Parliament for one year to fight against COVID-19.

President, Vice President and Governors voluntarily decided to take a pay cut as a gesture towards concerted effort to contain the spread of the deadly virus.

124,06-4-20,US ‘wasted’ months before preparing for virus pandemic,"As the first alarms sounded in early January that an outbreak of a novel coronavirus in China might ignite a global pandemic, the Trump administration squandered nearly two months that could have been used to bolster the federal stockpile of critically needed medical supplies and equipment.

A review of federal purchasing contracts by The Associated Press shows federal agencies waited until mid-March to begin placing bulk orders of N95 respirator masks, mechanical ventilators and other equipment needed by front-line health care workers.

By that time, hospitals in several states were treating thousands of infected patients without adequate equipment and were pleading for shipments from the Strategic National Stockpile. That federal cache of supplies was created more than 20 years ago to help bridge gaps in the medical and pharmaceutical supply chains during a national emergency.

Now, three months into the crisis, that stockpile is nearly drained just as the numbers of patients needing critical care is surging. Some state and local officials report receiving broken ventilators and decade-old dry-rotted masks.

“We basically wasted two months,” Kathleen Sebelius, health and human services secretary during the Obama administration, told AP. As early as mid-January, US Officials could see that hospitals in China’s Hubei province were overwhelmed with infected patients, with many left dependent on ventilator machines to breath. Italy soon followed, with hospitals scrambling for doctors, beds and equipment. HHS did not respond to questions about why federal officials waited to order medical supplies until stocks were running critically low. But President Donald Trump has asserted that the federal Government should take a back seat to states when it comes to dealing with the pandemic.

Trump and his appointees have urged state and local governments, and hospitals, to buy their own masks and breathing machines, saying requests to the dwindling national stockpile should be a last resort.

“The notion of the federal stockpile was it’s supposed to be our stockpile,” Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and adviser, said at a White House briefing Thursday. “It’s not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use.”

Experts in emergency preparedness and response have expressed dismay at such statements, saying the federal government must take the lead in ensuring medical supplies are available and distributed where they are needed most.

“States do not have the purchasing power of the federal government. They do not have the ability to run a deficit like the federal government. They do not have the logistical power of the federal government,” said Sebelius, who served as governor of Kansas before running the nation’s health care system.

Because of the fractured federal response to COVID-19, state governors say they’re now bidding against federal agencies and each other for scarce supplies, driving up prices.

“You now literally will have a company call you up and say, ‘Well, California just outbid you,’” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, D-N.Y., said on Tuesday.

“It’s like being on eBay with 50 other states, bidding on a ventilator.”

For nearly a month, Trump rebuffed calls from Cuomo and others to use his authority under the Defense Production Act to order companies to increase production of ventilators and personal protective equipment. He suggested the private sector was acting sufficiently on its own.

More than three months after China revealed the first COVID-19 cases, Trump finally relented last week, saying he will order companies to ramp up production of critical supplies. By then, confirmed cases of COVID-19 within the United States had surged to the highest in the world, with more than 300,000 people infected, and deaths have topped 8,400.

Trump spent January and February playing down the threat from the new virus. He derided warnings of pandemic reaching the U.S. As a hoax perpetrated by Democrats and the media. As the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global public health emergency on January 30, Trump assured the American people that the virus was “very well under control” and he predicted “a very good ending.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us----wasted----months-before-preparing-for-virus-pandemic.html

The 32-year-old conservationist had been self-isolating separately from Johnson with the couple’s dog Dilyn. Her social media post on her own symptoms subsiding came as Johnson, 55, continues to self-isolate at Downing Street after testing positive for coronavirus last week.

“I’ve spent the past week in bed with the main symptoms of coronavirus. I haven’t needed to be tested and, after seven days of rest, I feel stronger and I’m on the mend,” Symonds posted on Twitter.

In an accompanying post, Johnson’s partner, who is around six months pregnant and expecting the couple’s baby in the coming months, added a link to guidance from the UK’s Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists for pregnant women during the pandemic.

“Being pregnant with COVID-19 is obviously worrying. To other pregnant women, please do read and follow the most up to date guidance which I found to be very reassuring,” she said.

In an earlier post on Instagram, Symonds — believed to be at her flat in Camberwell, south London — is seen lying in bed with Dilyn with the caption: “Self-isolating isn’t so bad with this one.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/boris-johnson---s-pregnant-fianc--e-says-she-is----on-the-mend----from-covid-19.html

128,06-4-20,Govt reassures PSBs of capital infusion: Report,"Government has assured State banks it is ready to provide capital support as the coronavirus pandemic may lead to a surge in bad loans when economic growth is slowing, three Government and banking sources told Reuters.

The Government may need to make a provision of at least Rs 20-25,000 crore for capital infusion in state-run banks. However, this number can increase significantly as the situation evolves, the officials said.

“The NPAs (non-performing assets) could remain an issue and the Government may need to make a provision for some capital infusion in the public sector banks,” said a senior Government official with direct knowledge of the issue.

None of the sources wanted to be named as the plan is not yet public. A Finance Ministry spokesman declined to comment.

The Government has already pumped in Rs 3.5 lakh crore in the last five years to rescue the beleaguered banks. In this financial year’s budget announcement in February it had not allocated any funds for capital infusion. Instead, the banks had been encouraged to tap capital markets for funds.

Indian banks are burdened with a bad loan pile of nearly Rs 11 lakh crore and the lion’s share of it rests with the state-owned banks. Meanwhile, loan growth for the banking industry has also plummeted to the low single digits putting a further strain on these lenders.

Moody’s and Fitch group’s India Ratings and Research have assigned a negative outlook for the Indian banking sector due to disruptions arising from the coronavirus outbreak.

Most lenders are likely to require capital in the second or the third quarter of this financial year and that is when they will formally approach the Government if required as they already have the reassurance, bankers said.

“On top of the list right now are the mergers and to ensure how one can tackle the COVID-19 related problems. Currently, most banks are in a position to meet their capital requirement for the first half of this financial year,” said the CEO of a public sector bank who declined to be named as the matter is not public yet.

In August last year, India had announced a series of mergers involving 10 state-owned banks to ensure stronger balance sheets to boost lending and revive economic growth.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-reassures-psbs-of-capital-infusion--report.html
129,06-4-20,"Centre asks States to ensure truck drivers, labourers go for work","To ensure smooth intra and inter-state movement of essential food and groceries during the lockdown period, the Centre has directed state governments to facilitate truck drivers and labourers associated in this sector to reach their workplace.

Consumer Affairs Secretary Pawan Kumar Agarwal, in a letter to all state chief secretaries, has asked State Governments to designate a nodal officer who will coordinate with state police to ensure hassle free movement of supplies.

The designated officer will also issue authorisation letters to companies and organisations having nationwide supply of essential goods, he said.

To ensure that truck drivers do not face problems from police during the lockdown, the secretary said, “Movement of one driver and one additional person from their place of residence to the truck may kindly be facilitated by the local authorities”.

If the truck/vehicle is travelling empty, invoice, way-bill etc for the delivery or pick up of goods may additionally be carried by the drivers, he said.

Stating that several companies have reported difficulties in getting labour for their operations, Agarwal said, “Local administration may be advised to facilitate in ensuring availability of labour in factories, warehouses and transportation and distribution operations of essential food and groceries by appealing to house owners, societies and villages to allow workers to go for work”.

He also mentioned that the Consumer Affairs Ministry has developed an e-pass system solution with the help of E-Gov Foundation.

This system enables the government to monitor the number of passes issued by the authorised companies.

130,06-4-20,FPIs pull out record Rs 1.1 lakh cr in March,"Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have net withdrawn a record Rs 1.1 lakh crore from the Indian markets in March as the coronavirus pandemic dented investor sentiment worldwide.

According to latest depositories data, FPIs pulled out a net Rs 61,973 crore from equities and Rs 56,211 crore from the bond market in March, taking the cumulative net outflow to Rs 1,18,184 crore.

The outflow of funds in March comes after six consecutive months of investment by FPIs since September 2019.

This is also the highest withdrawal ever since the FPI data has been made available by the National Securities Depository Ltd. Besides, in just two trading sessions of April, FPIs have withdrawn a net sum of Rs 6,735 crore from the domestic markets. Out of this, Rs 3,802 crore were pulled out from equities and Rs 2,933 crore from the debt segment.

“The sell-off in March is mostly driven by quant funds, hedge funds, and risk parity funds,” Harsh Jain, co-founder and COO at Groww said.

Terming the fund outflow as “unparalleled”, Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research, Morningstar India, said that with fear over the degree of impact that Covid-19 could leave on the global economy, foreign investors stormed out of the emerging markets, with India among the worst hit.

“The intensity of the situation could be gauged from the fact that even during the financial crisis of 2008, FPIs sold net assets worth USD 9.3 billion in the Indian markets while in March 2020, they have been net sellers to the tune of USD 16.5 billion,” he added.

Regarding the future of FPI flows, Srivastava said these are unprecedented scenarios and with risk-taking going off the table, emerging markets like India may most likely witness a prolonged period of net outflows till the time situation on the coronavirus front stabilizes.

Jain said, “RBI raised the limit FPIs can invest in corporate bonds to 15 per cent on March 30th. While this is encouraging, it is unlikely to drive investments immediately. The government’s plan for easing out the lockdown after April 15 and other boosts like economic aid is crucial at this point in time.”",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/fpis-pull-out-record-rs-1-1-lakh-cr-in-march.html

132,06-4-20,Relaxing trading window closure for ‘insiders’ may go against investors’ interest: Experts,"Economic disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic may have warranted several compliance and financial reporting relaxations, but experts and officials cautioned on Sunday that relaxing the mandatory closure of trading window for ‘insiders’ might go against the interest of investors.

There has been demand from promoters and others classified as insiders with regard to stock market trading that this restriction should also be relaxed as capital markets regulator has eased the timelines for filing of financial results for listed companies.

Under the Sebi’s Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations, “Trading restriction period shall be made applicable from the end of every quarter till 48 hours after the declaration of financial results. The gap between clearance of accounts by audit committee and board meeting should be as narrow as possible and preferably on the same day to avoid leakage of material information.”

Accordingly, the trading window closure for insiders is already in place since April 1, though the timeline for filing of results for the quarter and year ended March 31 has been relaxed till June 30.

These are among the relaxations given by Sebi for listed companies and various market participants in light of the COVID-19 crisis and the ongoing nationwide lockdown.

While promoters and other insiders are demanding that the trading window should be opened for them as results would be announced later, officials and experts flagged such a relaxation would be detrimental to the interest of general investors as promoters and the top management, alongwith their associated entities, would already be in know of broader financial performance for the last quarter even if the actual results would get filed later.

Confirming that there have been requests seeking relaxation from the trading restriction period, a government official said the challenge for regulator Sebi was striking a balance between granting relaxations and ensuring market integrity.

Exchanges have already issued circulars regarding the trading window closure as Sebi did not accede to requests for any relaxation. Globally also, no such relaxation has been given by regulators in major markets. Information relating to financial results, unless made public, is deemed as unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) and insiders who may have access to such UPSI are not allowed to trade.

“It would be incorrect to infer from the above developments that promoters and insiders cannot trade till June 30, 2020, as there is no mandate from Sebi to delay the financial results, instead a listed entity is free to stick to its timelines and open the trading window as per extant provisions of law,” the official said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/relaxing-trading-window-closure-for----insiders----may-go-against-investors----interest--experts.html

The report said while telcos’ capex has been hit globally due to COVID-19 lockdown, growth of telecom infrastructure providers will be hurt by slowdown in Government spending on projects like BharatNet.

“Depreciation in INR/African currencies versus USD may increase cost of imported telecom equipment (including Bharti), pushing up their capex. Stronger USD may also lead to translation losses from USD-denominated debt,” Axis Capital’s telecom sector report said.

Benefit of lower crude oil price would be passed to consumers once lockdown is over, but if crude sustains at these levels for longer, it will hurt earnings of African economies, affecting Airtel Africa’s growth, it added.

139,06-4-20,Side please,"Psychologist Dr Shanu Shrivastava says that the pandemic has made us introverts and will impact everything, from festival celebrations to dining, public gatherings and workplaces in the long run

Social distancing and self-quarantine are the most important terms that we have learnt during this prolonged lockdown because of the Coronavirus pandemic. No matter how socially active we were but COVID-19 has made us home-bound and introverts. The constant fear of contracting the virus if we shake hands, maintaining a certain distance while meeting a person are making us almost allergic to humans. We also need to pay attention to the fact that even after this ends, we will be suspicious about going to crowded places.

In the most literal sense, the Coronavirus is a moral panic. It has started exploiting vulnerabilities in human psychology and as a result our schools, colleges and universities are shut, stock market has crashed, the increased social conflict and xenophobia has reshuffled our migration patterns, and is working to contain us in homogenous spaces. What options are we left with? Even if the lockdown gets lifted, we can come in contact with the virus, especially, if we live in a densely populated area — if not this year, then next or the year after, as it undergoes its seasonal global migration pattern.

Changing colour of India’s celebration

With the number of coronavirus cases going up in our country and the death toll rising worldwide, the ramifications can be felt on Indian festivals as well. Festivals are the pulse of our nation’s social life. Every religion and community celebrates theirs according to their own style. There are variety of festivals depending on the state, religion and community. At the heart of numerous and varied festivals held throughout the year are get-togethers with extended family, friends and neighbours. But this year itself saw major festivals like Holi and Ram Navami being celebrated in a subdued manner. Gauging the adverse effect of the threat of COVID-19 on the fervour of Indian festivities is unfathomable.

Will we dine out, meet friends like before?

Life as we know has been altered significantly and things are happening differently. People in general are kind and helpful especially in our country but the virus has instilled a sense of heightened fear which makes us wary of everything that is outside our house. For instance, while dining out with friends, earlier we were carefree. We ordered anything we wanted. But now either we won’t dine out for a long time after this lockdown ends, or even if we go, we will think 100 times before ordering an exotic Chinese sea-food (because that is supposedly where the virus originated) or meeting a friend with a warm hug. People are wary of shaking hands as the virus usually reveals its symptoms after two or more days which means the person may seem perfectly healthy but may still be a carrier of Coronavirus and transmit it to others through handshakes. Even after April 14 (when the lockdown ends) I don’t think people will instantly go back to their normal routine. It will take time. Moreover, eliminating the virus completely from the country will take time.

Sit apart at workplaces and avoid human touch?

Don’t you think workplaces will also witness a shift in their meeting and sitting patterns? This might not be the collective mindset but I feel it will undergo a change. When one is afraid for one’s own life, it is human nature to avoid things which can endanger it. People might distance their movable cubicles or chair tables and not touch other’s electronics.

All this a result of increasing fear that has pervaded our lives at the moment. However, this should not make us abandon our faith in humanity as and when things go back to normal. We cannot forget the fact that a human being is a social animal. If we try to live isolated, we will unnecessarily be prone to stress, anxiety and depression.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/side-please-2020-04-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/side-please.html
140,06-4-20,Live in the moment,"We are trapped by intrusive memories of the past or fret about what may or may not happen in the future. And because of that, we can’t appreciate the present, says Rajyogi Brahmakumar Nikunj Ji

Most of us might have heard the proverb — you don’t know what you have got ‘til it’s gone — many times in our lives. We realise the fortune’s worth only after we lose it. The stream of life flows on and every second the water in the stream keeps changing. What is present now will move on to the next moment and will become the past. Every moment life is unfolding and something new is being presented. So often we let the present slip away, allowing time to rush unobserved and unseized as we are too lost in the past or caught up in the future. We get caught up in our past because we did not allow ourselves to live them when they were the present.

It’s very common for most of us to fantasize about things like shopping or going for a movie while we are at work. And while we are actually in a movie theatre, we worry about the work piling up on our desks. Isn’t that so ironical? We are trapped by intrusive memories of the past or fret about what may or may not happen in the future. Between the struggles of past and future, we don’t appreciate present much because we identify ourselves with those thoughts, beliefs and emotions. We forget a fact that it is necessary to live in the moment i.e ‘now’. To do that we need to be very still inside but we are constantly distracted by our thoughts linked to the past and future.

Most of us are addicted to the patterns and beliefs we created in the past, which keep driving our thoughts even in the present. Instead of thinking consciously, we are controlled by our thoughts of the past. To change this pattern, we need to first pause and observe what’s going on in our mind. We need to step back, watch and then steer the thoughts towards the present moment and creative goals. We need to just focus on being before thinking, judging, analysing and doing.

Living in the moment is a state of intentional attention on the present. When we become aware of what’s going on in our mind, we realise that we are not our thoughts; we are the observers of our thoughts from moment to moment and then we stop judging them. It is like watching waves rising and falling on the surface of ocean.

Spiritual wisdom makes us aware and realise that we must love our original state of being. As the noise and chatter of the mind slows down, we can experience our true nature and just relax in our state of being. Then we are connected to now and not influenced by the past, future or anything out there. We are in a highly creative state when our pure awareness creates energy of love, joy and peace in every moment. Under such a stage, we are flowing with life without grasping, chasing, wanting, needing or holding on to anything. We are in a truly liberated, powerful and creative state. There is fresh energy in every thought and action.

Living in the present reduces impulsive and reactive behaviour. Those who live in the moment can hear negative feedback without feeling threatened. They are more accepting, accommodating and flexible. As a result, they have easy and satisfying relationships.

It is very important for all of us to realise that we are now in the most important and beneficial age when almighty himself is bestowing his treasures of wisdom and love. Hence, by becoming soul conscious, we can live in the present and make the best out of each second of this valuable period. Liberation and abundance can be experienced by all human souls right now, right here. Being aware of the self as a soul and being connected to supreme, liberates us in a second. Don’t look back because you are not going that way again.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/live-in-the-moment-2020-04-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/live-in-the-moment.html
141,06-4-20,Cultivate your own greens,"There are a number of new, high-tech growing systems that bring the joy of gardening indoors

Traditionally, growing your own herbs and veggies was reserved for those with the luxury of outdoor space and abundant light. Now there are a number of new, high-tech indoor gardening systems that allow apartment dwellers with limited light or those aching to gardening before the season starts, a chance to grow their own greens.

For many households sheltering in place, with limited access to perishable foods, the devices can also provide a source of fresh herbs and vegetables, as well as a chance to enjoy growing something. And novices needn’t worry: These automated growing systems are relatively foolproof, with pre-planted “seed pods,” auto-timed lights, even smartphone apps and Alexa interfaces to help you through the process.

“It’s sort of like the K-cup model for growing,” explains Paul Rabaut, marketing director at AeroGarden, which makes a range of indoor growing systems that use seed pods, which are inserted into the electronic growing machine, not unlike inserting a capsule into a coffee machine. “Our mission is to allow people access to freshly grown herbs and veggies all year round, even without a yard or much light. It’s easy to be successful and there are no messy bags of soil to lug,” explains Rabaut.

Like a number of these systems, AeroGarden uses hydroponics, a method of growing that uses only water and liquid nutrients, not the soil used in traditional gardening. Seeds come embedded in a plug of peat, nestled inside a tidy capsule pre-labeled with the name of the plant, how tall it’s expected to grow and in how many days. All that’s required is to add water and nutrients periodically, and the rest is automated.

Indoor gardeners can expect their first harvest in a matter of weeks. After two or three months, the seed pod needs to be replaced or planted in traditional soil to continue growing and another pod can be inserted in the system. As with coffee capsules, the plastic seed pods are recyclable, Rabaut says, adding that AeroGarden pod trays can be swapped out for a seedling tray that lets people start many more plants at once.

Another popular growing system is Click and Grow. And big names like Samsung, LG and IKEA have also worked on developing automated indoor growing systems. “We have a new competitor coming on the market every week or two somewhere in the world,” says Martin Laidla, public relations manager for the Estonia-based Click and Grow, whose biggest market is North America.

“We call this ‘hyper-local gardening’ since you can do the growing right in your kitchen but some systems are definitely better than others. It’s easy to put together a plastic base and light but it’s the quality of the growing medium and the growing technology, and of course the light, that’s really the trick,” says Laidla.

Marc Hachadourian, director of glass house horticulture at the New York Botanical Garden, says, “Technology has invaded every aspect of our lives, so it was only a matter of time until technology entered into gardening.” “LED light technology was really the game changer, with better quality plant lights available in all different sizes,” he says. “Now you can even buy tiny clip-on plant lights for your African Violet or plant lights that are the size of desk lamps. They used to be enormous things.” But just as coffee capsules aren’t for everyone, neither are these growing systems, which can seem sterile to those used to gardening the old-fashioned way.

“I’ve seen novices grow wonderful plants using these systems,” says Hachadourian. But he adds, “There’s still something for getting your hands in the dirt. If you just plug it in and watch it grow, there’s no interaction there.”

He says that with good-quality modern plant lights, people can also grow plants in soil indoors without a high-tech system, while getting hands-on enjoyment. “It’s like cooking. Sometimes it’s good to get your hands dirty,” he says.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cultivate-your-own-greens-2020-04-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/cultivate-your-own-greens.html
142,06-4-20,Dhoni’s Vizag knock felt like he had tasted blood: Nehra,"Former India fast bowler Ashish Nehra feels that the factor that helped MS Dhoni stand out among his contemporary wicketkeepers in the early part of his career was the fact that he made the most of the opportunities he got.

Dhoni scored his first international exactly 15 years ago in an ODI against Pakistan in Visakhapanam. He hammered 148 off 123 balls and Nehra’s four-wicket haul later in the match helped India win by 58 runs. Nehra said that Dhoni’s knock gave India the confidence that they too could have a good wicketkeeper-batsman at a time when they were looking to relieve Rahul Dravid of wicketkeeping duties.

“That innings got the team to believe that we too could have a prolific wicketkeeper-batsman,” Nehra told the Times of India. “Dhoni didn’t have a great time in his initial matches. But when a confident man like him gets an opportunity and cashes in, then it’s hard to pull him back.

“Unwavering self-confidence is Dhoni’s strength. That innings was like he had tasted blood and he yearned for more. He hardly ever batted at No 3 after that innings but he had made a statement that day. We lost all the remaining four matches in that series but we discovered Dhoni.”

Nehra said that Dhoni was probably behind contemporaries Dinesh Karthik and Parthiv Patel in wicketkeeping skills at the time but he was the best wicketkeeper-batsman among them.

“Dhoni wasn’t the best wicketkeeper around when he first came in. All those who played before him were really good. He was certainly not a Kiran More or a Nayan Mongia. So it’s not that he was miles ahead of his contemporaries as a wicketkeeper, but he made for a better package. His discipline, passion, composure and confidence made him different.

“Dhoni did what DK and Parthiv couldn’t i.e., make the most of his opportunities. Dhoni may not have been the best-looking batsman or a sound wicketkeeper but he certainly was the best wicketkeeper-batsman. He worked hard on his game, knew what work for him and grew as an impeccable wicketkeeper.”

Nehra said that Rishabh Pant is the only player who he sees as capable of coming close to Dhoni, whose current troubles with form reminds the 40-year-old of the former Indian skipper in his early days.

“I don’t see anyone coming close to the impact he has had as a wicketkeeper-batsman except for Rishabh Pant. Pant’s journey — though it is still early days — reminds me a lot of Dhoni,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dhoni---s-vizag-knock-felt-like-he-had-tasted-blood--nehra.html
143,06-4-20,Hunt for medical supplies creates marketplace of desperation,"Shady middlemen, phantom shipments, prices soaring by the hour, goods flown in on a private plane. What sounds like an organized-crime thriller is now the new reality for governors desperately trying to find the medical equipment their states need in the throes of a pandemic.

With the federal stockpile dwindling fast, and the Trump administration limiting access to what’s left, state leaders are going to extraordinary measures on their own to secure faces masks, ventilators, gloves and other equipment essential to fighting the outbreak.

They’ve ventured into a global market-place one governor described as the “wild, wild, West,” only to compete against each other and their own federal Government.

They’ve watched the price of a ventilators double and masks go for 10 times their original price. They’ve turned to rich friends and businesses for help.

Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker enlisted NFL owner Robert Kraft to send the Patriots team plane to China to retrieve over a million masks.

In New York, an epicentre of the outbreak in the US, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has looked closer to home to secure ventilators, issuing an order that forces even private hospitals to redistribute ventilators to the hospitals most in need.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/hunt-for-medical-supplies-creates-marketplace-of-desperation.html
144,06-4-20,"Regular, daily exercise may help boost immunity while social distancing","While being in isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, without access to gyms and sports clubs, may make it difficult for people to work out, researchers say that keeping up regular, daily exercise plays an important role in helping maintain a healthy immune system.

The analysis, published in the international journal Exercise Immunology Review, assessed studies conducted over the last four decades that investigated how exercise affects the immune system.

According to the researchers, including those from the University of Bach in the UK, regular moderate intensity exercise is beneficial for immunity.

They said in the short term, exercise can help the immune system find and deal with pathogens, and in the long term, regular exercise slows down changes that happen to the immune system with ageing, therefore reducing the risk of infections. According to the scientists, these infections are more likely to be linked to inadequate diet, psychological stress, insufficient sleep, travel and importantly, pathogen exposure at social gathering events like marathons — rather than the act of exercising itself.

“Our work has concluded that there is very limited evidence for exercise directly increasing the risk of becoming infected with viruses,” said study co-author James Turner from the University of Bath.

In the context of coronavirus, the scientists said, the most important consideration is reducing exposure from other people who may be carrying the virus. But they said people should not overlook the importance of staying fit, active and healthy during this period. When carried out in isolation, away from others, regular, daily exercise will help better maintain the way the immune system works — not suppress it, the researchers added.

“People should not fear that their immune system will be suppressed by exercise placing them at increased risk of coronavirus,” said study co-author, John Campbell from the University of Bach.

“Provided exercise is carried out according to latest government guidance on social distancing, regular exercise will have a tremendously positive effect on our health and wellbeing, both today and for the future,” Campbell added.

At this current time in particular, the scientists said maintaining good personal hygiene when exercising is extremely important, including thoroughly washing hands following work out sessions.

To give the body its best chance at fighting off infections, they suggested in addition to doing regular exercise, people also pay attention to the amount of sleep they get and maintain a healthy diet.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/regular--daily-exercise-may-help-boost-immunity-while-social-distancing.html
145,06-4-20,After the virus: What world will we live in?,"One day, the battle against the novel coronavirus will be won. But the world that emerges may look very different from the one we lived in before the pandemic began.

Over 60,000 people have lost their lives to COVID-19 and there are a more than a million confirmed cases with the outbreak yet to reach its peak across the developed and emerging world.

But on top of the tragic human toll, the coronavirus also threatens incalculable social, economic and political costs, and to trigger a wave of change that will shape our world for years to come.

The shutdown imposed to slow the spread of the virus could push some economies into full-scale meltdown. Financial markets may never recover to pre-crisis levels.

Restrictions on movement will help some governments tighten autocratic control, and civil liberties could be eroded in the name of gaining information on virus spread.

Many are already questioning the merit of multilateral organisations such as the WHO or the United Nations given the perceived lack of a coordinated, global response to an unprecedented health crisis.

The changes could be immense, say analysts, but also unpredictable. “Is it going to be a headline or is it a trendline?” asked Aaron David Miller, Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

“Are we witnessing an event that is going to reshape international relations and relations among states?” Much will depend on how long national economies manage to withstand the storm, and the performance of governments in tackling the threat.

China, where the virus is believed to have originated, proudly claims to have quelled the outbreak.

US President Donald Trump initially appeared to shrug off the seriousness of the threat and is now faced with a full-scale crisis.

While the official figures from India remain far less grim than in the West, there is anxiety that much worse is to come. “Is this leadership or absence of leadership going to provide opportunities or vulnerabilities to various countries around the world?” asked Miller. The world’s wealthiest powers enjoy a cushion that will allow them to keep the economy ticking over during the crisis, to compensate workers laid off, and to resume economic activity quickly afterwards.

But in poorer countries with no such protections, the resulting deprivation risks driving people onto the street.

“The potential for widespread social unrest in countries that have not provided a social safety net for those losing their jobs during this crisis strikes me as very real, with possible repercussions for governance and more,” said Joshua Geltzer, visiting professor of law at Georgetown University.

Countries like Russia and Turkey, led by the same strongmen for two decades, will be hoping that their measures will be enough to spare them the worst of the virus and any political consequences.

But to battle the outbreak, even the most democratic societies have had to restrict civil liberties on an unprecedented scale and bid farewell to border-free travel for the foreseeable future.

“All the global elite who had lectured for a long time about liberalism and globalisation were the first to close their borders,” pointed out Bakary Sambe, director of the Timbuktu Institute in Dakar.

Pratap Bhanu Mehta, professor of political sciences at India’s Ashoka University, said there risked being conflicts over trading systems. “There is a potential to accelerate deglobalisation in the wake of the crisis.”

The European Union, in a year that it wanted to show solidity after Brexit, has been sorely tested. States adopted policies unilaterally, there have been vast discrepancies in preparedness, and one member, Hungary, adopted policies which critics say border on authoritarianism.

The EU is far from the only international institution to feel the heat.

The G20, chaired this year by Saudi Arabia, has struggled to make itself heard. And the observers say the UN, through its World Health Organisation (WHO), has yet to coordinate a truly global outbreak response.

The WHO “seems more and more sidelined,” said Barthelemy Courmont, researcher at the Institute for International and Strategic Research (IRIS) in Paris.

“What legitimacy will we grant to international institutions if they do not have the authority to manage crises? The global system we live in will emerge somewhat weakened from this crisis.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/after-the-virus--what-world-will-we-live-in-.html
146,06-4-20,"Americans brace for ‘hardest, saddest’ week of their lives","Americans braced for what the nation’s top doctor warned Sunday would be “the hardest and saddest week” of their lives while Britain assumed the unwelcome mantle of deadliest coronavirus hotspot in Europe after a record 24-hour jump in deaths that surpassed even hard-hit Italy.

“This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment,’’ U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams told “Fox News Sunday.”

New York City, the U.S. epicenter of the pandemic, saw a glimmer of hope, with Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying that the number of daily deaths had dropped slightly, along with intensive care admissions and the number of patients who need breathing tubes inserted.

Still, he warned that it was “too early to tell” the significance of those numbers.

As of Sunday, Britain has recorded 4,934 virus deaths overall among 47, 806 cases. Those coming down with the virus in the U.K. include Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the health secretary, England’s chief medical official and Prince Charles, heir to the throne.

There are wide fears that Johnson’s Conservative government did not take the virus seriously enough at first and that spring weather will tempt Britons and others to break social distancing rules.

In an address to the nation to be televised later Sunday, Queen Elizabeth II appealed to Britons to exercise self-discipline in “an increasingly challenging time.” The 93-year-old monarch said the pandemic had caused enormous disruptions, bringing grief, financial difficulties and daunting challenges to everybody.

147,06-4-20,Earth’s crust is shaking less as people stay home!,"The COVID-19 lockdowns globally have not only made air breathable or rivers clean but have also resulted in the way our Earth moves, as researchers now report a drop in seismic noise (the hum of vibrations in the planets crust) because transport networks, real estate and other human activities have been shut down.

According an article in the journal Nature, efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus mean that the planet itself is moving a little less, which could “allow detectors to spot smaller earthquakes and boost efforts to monitor volcanic activity and other seismic events”.

Vibrations caused by moving vehicles and industrial machinery produce background noise, which reduces seismologists’ ability to detect other signals occurring at the same frequency.

“A noise reduction of this magnitude is usually only experienced briefly around Christmas,” said Thomas Lecocq, a seismologist with the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Brussels which has observed the drop in seismic noise. Data from a seismometer at the observatory show that measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 in Brussels caused human-induced seismic noise to fall by about one-third.

In Belgium, scientists report at least a 30 per cent reduction in that amount of ambient human noise since lockdown began there.

The current drop has boosted the sensitivity of the observatory’s equipment, improving its ability to detect waves in the same high frequency range as the noise, said the Nature article.

However, not all seismic monitoring stations will see an effect as pronounced as the one observed in Brussels.

According to Emily Wolin, a geologist at the US Geological Survey in Albuquerque, New Mexico, many stations are purposefully located in remote areas to avoid human noise.

“These should see a smaller decrease, or no change at all, in the level of high-frequency noise they record,” she was quoted as saying.

The fall in noise could also benefit seismologists who use naturally occurring background vibrations, such as those from crashing ocean waves, to probe Earth’s crust.

A fall in human-induced noise could boost the sensitivity of detectors to natural waves at similar frequencies

“There’s a big chance indeed it could lead to better measurements,” said Lecocq.

The reduction in seismic activity, like reduction in air pollution, also show that people are adhering to social distancing guidelines.

“From the seismological point of view, we can motivate people to say, ‘OK look, people. You feel like you’re alone at home, but we can tell you that everyone is home. Everyone is doing the same. Everyone is respecting the rules,’” Lecocq told CNN.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/earth---s-crust-is-shaking-less-as-people-stay-home-.html

149,06-4-20,The stage comes home,"When art galleries, music concerts, literature festivals get cancelled due to the ongoing pandemic, the digital world makes everything accessible to all of us, says Chahak Mittal

These are testing, almost dystopian times. The kind which we had never foreseen or imagined. These are likely to become an object of wonder for the future generations as they will find it difficult to comprehend how people stayed in their homes for weeks and months because a deadly virus had taken over the entire world and forced us to distance ourselves physically from one another even as we began to value and understand the importance of the human connection. Of course, on account of its uniqueness, this time will be remembered for years to come, and well, what better way to recall it than through preserving its memory through arts.

Art galleries, literature festivals, music concerts, and other public displays of art or any other spaces, which see a large number of footfalls, are on the backburner amid the lockdown due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Not surprisingly, one can see many of them cancelling or postponing these events. However, some of them have upped their game and decided to turn it to their advantage by taking to social media and digital platforms. While most of the players have not added a monetary cost to the views and streaming is free but they agree that if this has to be done in the long run, paywalls and online contributions are the way forward.

JLF presents a brave new world

Described as the “greatest literary show on earth,” the Jaipur Literature Festival 2020 stands as the biggest example of this change. The festival, which started on Saturday, is coming as an online literature series in which, this time, the sprawling grounds of Diggi Palace will be replaced by the boundless possibilities of the internet. Its new literature series — ‘JLF presents Brave New World’ aims to keep alive a free-flowing exchange of ideas online in this time of de-globalisation. It comes as a virtual initiative to celebrate books, their power and positivity.

Former politician and author Bruno Maçães will speak about our transformed circumstances and the lessons learnt from America, China and Europe at a session on our past, present and future, and what the rebirth of these nations could mean for the world and global affairs.

Other sessions would see the likes of writer and broadcaster Bee Rowlatt and Baroness Helena Kennedy exploring the need to protect the “forum internum” — our private mental space — from the incursions of digital technology — at a session titled Freedom of Thought. Still another would have co-authors of the recent The New World Disorder and the India Imperative, writer, politician and public intellectual Shashi Tharoor and president of Observer Research Foundation, Samir Saran, sharing their views on the current crisis the world is going through. Their session will build a necessary narrative on the new realities that confront us today.

Walls and Bridges will be a session on dystopian fiction and its increasingly real and uncanny presence in our lives in which Prayaag Akbar, author of Leila (which was adapted into a Netflix series), and Amrita Tripathi, author of The Sibius Knot will share their views.

Namita Gokhale, writer, publisher and co-director of the JLF, said, “Book lovers are never truly alone — not when we have books, and each other. JLF has always affirmed the spirit of community. We believe that these testing times are also the moments in which we need to interrogate and make sense of our world, through books and ideas, debate and dialogue, music and philosophy, science and the arts. The festival, which has always been a platform that celebrates the spirit of human connection, is now ready to go straight into hearts and minds and homes. Our timely new initiative will provide an important new resource for our extended JLF family across the world.”

“I think the most important thing is building a method to win games based on the resources that you have at your disposal and then making sure that the players are under no illusion as to what that method is based on our strengths,” he said.

Sri Lanka will be looking to add another World T20 title to their kitty after winning it in 2014.

Sri Lanka lost to West Indies in two T20Is last month.

Arthur took over the reins in December and his toughest test yet awaited in a two-match home series against England, but that was called off last month due to the coronavirus pandemic.

“It was really disappointing not playing the Test series against England although this will be played at a later date,” said Arthur, who has also coached South Africa, Australia and Pakistan.

“We had just worked out a brand that we knew would be successful against all teams, and I just hope that the momentum that we had built up will not be lost with our Test team when we start up again,” he said.

“We have some very realistic goals with our Test team and believe that we have now the players and gameplans to have success both at home and abroad in the future.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/arthur-using-break-to-build-plans-for-sl-development.html
151,06-4-20,Long breaks pose big challenge for pacers,"A batsman can do with yoga and weight training but for the merchants of speed, former India pacer Ashish Nehra feels the absence of running for more than three months at a stretch could come in their way of fitness.

According to him, the fast bowlers will have to start running sooner or later.

With sporting activities coming to a standstill, the elite athletes are confined to their homes, trying to remain fit while hoping for action to begin once normalcy returns.

“Let’s consider a few situations. Even if the lockdown ends on April 15, it will take a lot of time for social life to become normal.

“If you ask me, I am not expecting any cricketing activity before July. So this is a long break but once action starts fast bowlers have the biggest challenge to remain fit,” Nehra said.

Just like former India team physio John Gloster, Nehra also feels that the paucity of space for most cricketers is a problem and more so for the fast bowlers.

“Lack of running time for fast bowlers is an issue. Now the situation is unavoidable. So whoever at least has a garden with say 15 metres or 20 metres space, they should do shuttle run thrice a week unless they are allowed to train at grounds,” said Nehra.

Shuttle run comprises short strides between 20 to 40 metres where players run between points A and B.

“You can do as much of yoga or free weights, fast bowler’s life is nothing without good running time. There is a lot of difference with batsmen,” said Nehra, who has been a bowling coach with IPL franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore.

Why does one need to run more than say cycling or swimming?

“It’s not just about heart-rate but also about bowling muscles such as hamstring, glutes, groin and calf, they remain activated. Giving a choice between swimming, cycling and running, as a cricketer I would say running. Also a bit of shadow bowling can help in visualization,” said Nehra, who has played 164 internationals for India (17 Tests, 120 ODIs and 27 T20Is).

He had a word of advice for those who have sprawling terraces with soil and grass cover.

“It’s fine if you are doing Surya Namaskar on terrace but if you start running and doing shuttle run, you will end up damaging your knees and ankles because of hard surface.The very reason that professional players should avoid playing tennis on hard courts in five-star hotels. They are cement courts.”

Nehra said that he is confident whether it’s the BCCI or ICC, even if there is a semblance of normalcy by June, they will give at least a month’s time to the players to prepare, as one can’t suddenly start playing.

“And injuries can happen to anyone. The fast bowler who has trained the least might be fitter than fast bowler who has trained the most. Nature of sport is such. But yes, I hope that if lockdown ends, they have access to grounds,” said Nehra.

And he also had a word of caution for fast bowlers and professional players in general.

“Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra, after this prolonged break, can afford to come back with a paunch. Not active players. So break ka matlab ye naahi ki biryani khaani hain (A break from sport doesn’t mean you will have biryani).”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/long-breaks-pose-big-challenge-for-pacers-2020-04-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/long-breaks-pose-big-challenge-for-pacers.html
152,06-4-20,Cummins prioritises T20 World Cup over IPL,"With cricket facing an uncertain future due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Australian pace spearhead Pat Cummins would like to see the T20 World Cup at home being held over the lucrative IPL in which he would enter as the costliest foreign buy.

Cummins became the most expensive foreign buy in the IPL at the auction in December when Kolkata Knight Riders shelled out a whopping Rs 15.50 crore for his services.

""The T20 World Cup is something we've spoken about for the best part of two or three years. The (ODI) World Cup in 2015, that was absolutely a career highlight for me and I wasn't even playing in the final. I'd love to see that go ahead,"" Cummins was quoted as saying by the 'Australian Associated Press'.

""That's probably the big tournament this year for international cricket ... I'd love for that to happen in a perfect world and if I was to be really greedy, I'd love for the IPL to happen as well.""

There is no definitive word on the IPL yet after it was postponed to April 15. With coronavirus cases continuing to rise globally, it is unlikely the cash-rich league will be organised anytime soon.

Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen has suggest that the IPL should kick-start the cricketing season and be held before the T20 World Cup, scheduled in October-November.

During a video conference with journalists on Monday, Waqar said there shouldn't be any cricket at the moment.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused nearly 70,000 deaths so far globally.

""No I don't agree with this suggestion that cricket activities should resume soon even before empty stadiums,"" he said.

Some former cricket stars and officials of cricket boards have said that the game can resume slowly and matches can be held in front of empty stadiums with the proper precautions in place for teams, officials and other ground staff.

""I think maybe in five or six months' time. when things are under control around the world and we get back some normalcy in life, we can think about matches behind closed doors,"" the former fast bowler said.

""At some stage we need to think about these choices but not this month or next month...the situation is not right for any cricket activities,"" he added.

Waqar also made it clear that he was very keen to see the T20 World Cup held this year in Australia even if slightly delayed.

""Whenever I have played for Pakistan as a player or been a coach with the Pakistan team it has always been my desire to see the team win a major ICC title. That is why this World T20 is so important for me and the team,"" he said.

""I would like to be the part of a management where we can win a major title,"" he added.

155,06-4-20,Gambhir offers Rs 50 lakh from MPLAD fund to Delhi govt for medical equipment,"East Delhi BJP MP Gautam Gambhir on Monday offered Rs 50 lakh from his MPLAD fund to the Delhi government for procurement of equipment for medical staff dealing with COVID-19 cases, around two weeks after he pledged the same amount for the purpose.

The Delhi government has yet to respond to his previous offer, said an aide of the cricketer-turned-politician.

""It is stated by Deputy CM Manish Sisodia that funds are needed to meet the growing demand of medical equipment in several Delhi government hospitals. In addition to Rs 50 lakh which I had pledged two weeks ago, I would further like to pledge Rs 50 lakh from my MPLAD to your kind office with the hope that the said amount would be used in procurement of equipment of medical staff as well as treatment of COVID-19 patients,"" Gambhir said in a letter to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday.

Earlier Gambhir had accused the AAP government of ""shedding crocodile tears"" and playing victim card over the issue, saying he had offered Rs 50 lakh for PPE kits and masks to it but did not receive any feedback.

""People would be benefited if the crores spent on advertisements from morning till evening on television were used for PPE kits. I had pledged Rs 50 lakh for PPE kits and masks but there is no feedback so far. Now they are asking the Centre. Shedding crocodile tears and victim card are two weapons of Arvind Kejriwal,"" Gambhir had tweeted.

Kejriwal on Saturday said that his government has asked for PPE kits from the Centre but none were received.

Sisodia on Saturday had demanded a disaster fund from the Centre to fight coronavirus outbreak in Delhi, saying it was third most affected state in the country.

In a letter to the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, he had said that the Centre released over Rs 17000 crore to the states from the Disaster fund but not a single rupee was given to Delhi.

""I have demanded disaster fund for Delhi also in a letter to the Central government. The Centre released Rs 17000 crore to the states to fight corona from the disaster fund but Delhi was not given a single rupee from it. The country should fight as one at this hour. This discrimination is unfortunate,"" Sisodia had said in a tweet.

Coronavirus cases in Delhi have crossed 500 and seven deaths have been reported due to the virus so far.

“You’re (Pakistan) the talent factory. We in Australia always used to say that Pakistan have so much talent, it’s just the matter of how you harness it,” Jones said in an interaction with Wasim.

“Raw talent, it’s like Brazil of cricket,” Wasim said in reply.

Jones noted the innovations that Pakistan players, particularly bowlers, have brought into cricket over the years.

“Pakistanis bring different techniques to international cricket, different attitudes fast bowlers like yourself (Wasim) and Waqar (Younis), Shoaib (Akhtar), and of course Abdul (Qadir) and Mushi (Mushtaq Ahmed) and all these great bowlers that are coming through even now,” he said.

Jones noted that while cricket was always big in the country but the team’s dominance in the 1980’s and their victory in the 1992 World Cup were important catalysts.

“Cricket is in the DNA, it’s been great for a long time but really started to turn big time in the late 80s when Imran took over, when you rip England apart in front of a 100 thousand people at MCG (in 1992) was amazing,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/pak-is-brazil-of-cricket--akram.html

161,06-4-20,India submit bid to host AFC Asian Cup,"India has submitted its bid documents for hosting the AFC Asian Cup in 2027, a top official of the national federation confirmed on Sunday.

If India wins the bid, it will be the first time the country will host the continental showpiece event.

“We have already submitted our expression of interest to the AFC (Asian Football Confederation). That is what’s required as of now,” All India Football Federation General Secretary Kushal Das said.

Recently, the AFC had extended the deadline to lodge expression of interest by three months from March 31 to June 30 in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The AFC had hoped to announce the tournament hosts as soon as possible to give them more time to prepare for the quadrennial continental championship, which was expanded to 24 teams for the 2019 edition in the United Arab Emirates,” the AFC said.

The AFC is expected to announce the host country early next year.

Other than India, Saudi Arabia, which has won the continental title three times but never hosted the tournament, is only nation to have publicly announced their intention to launch a bid for 2027 Asian Cup.

India had joined the race for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, alongside Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, but pulled out early in October 2018.

Later, Thailand and South Korea also pulled out leaving China the sole country to host the 2023 tournament.

South Korea, which is hosting the 2023 Women’s World Cup, is also likely to join India in the bid for the men’s 2027 AFC Asian Cup. China will host the 2023 showpiece tournament in 10 cities.

Since successfully staging the men’s U-17 World Cup in 2017, India was to host the U-17 women’s World Cup this November but has been postponed to a later date due to the worsening COVID-19 pandemic.

India has also been awarded hosting rights for the 2022 Women’s AFC Asian Cup in 2022.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-submit-bid-to-host-afc-asian-cup.html
162,06-4-20,Trump hopes virus-hit sports will be back ‘sooner than later’,"President Donald Trump on Saturday said he believes US sports leagues hit by the coronavirus pandemic would resume “sooner rather than later” but declined to set a timetable for their return.

On a conference call with the commissioners of the major professional sports leagues, Trump told National Football League commissioner Roger Goodell he believed the season would kick off as scheduled in September.

US sports have been upended by the coronavirus, with the NBA, Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer and National Hockey League all halting or suspending their respective seasons last month as the pandemic erupted.

“I want fans back in the arenas...whenever we’re ready,” Trump told reporters at a White House briefing on Saturday.

“As soon as we can obviously. I can’t tell you a date but I think it’s going to be sooner rather than later.”

Major League Baseball and NBA officials are reportedly studying plans to play games without spectators at neutral venues to minimise the risks of infection associated with crowded arenas.

Trump, however, spoke optimistically of fans eventually being let back into stadiums.

“We’re not going to have separation for the rest of our times on the planet,” Trump said.

“We need it for this period of time. But eventually people are going to be able to occupy those seats next to each other. I’m not committing to it. It would be great if we could.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/trump-hopes-virus-hit-sports-will-be-back----sooner-than-later---.html
163,06-4-20,2020 F1 c‘ship should be cancelled: Ecclestone,"Bernie Ecclestone says this season’s Formula One championship should be cancelled because it appears unlikely that enough races can be completed for it to be valid due to the coronavirus crisis.

The opening eight rounds of the 2020 season have been either cancelled or postponed, with doubts over a number of the other 14 races as the pandemic continues to overshadow the sporting calendar.

A minimum of eight races are required for the championship to be valid, but former F1 chief executive Ecclestone believes that will not be possible.

“We should stop the championship this year and start again next year, hopefully, because I can’t see it’s going to be possible to get the right amount of races in that count for a championship,” the 89-year-old told BBC Radio.

“There’s got to be eight from memory, and I can’t see them getting that in. It’s a difficult situation.”

Lewis Hamilton was this year aiming to match Michael Schumacher’s record of seven drivers’ titles, though there have been suggestions a truncated season would diminish the achievement.

But Ecclestone, set to become a father for the fourth time, said: “I don’t think it will make a lot of difference to Lewis. He would win whatever the race number, whether it be eight, 16 or 20.

“If it’s a world championship and he wins, it would go on his record and say he has won a world championship. The terrible thing is he would win all eight races. It wouldn’t be a super championship.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/2020-f1-c---ship-should-be-cancelled--ecclestone.html

Limpele was appointed till the Tokyo Olympics. But, last month, he stepped down as India’s doubles coach, citing family reasons, becoming the fourth such foreign coach to have resigned without completing the tenure.

Chirag said the Olympics postponement will now give them more time to deal with the departure of Limpele, who was specifically hired to prepare them for Tokyo Games.

“We will definitely get more time to prepare now. Since it is more than a year, so I believe we will get a new foreign coach. If Olympics would have happened this year, then we wouldn’t have got since for 3-4 months it wouldn’t make sense. But now, BAI might get one to help us,” Chirag said.

Satwik said the departure of Limpele in the Olympic year was a big worry.

“It is a worry for us because he (Limpele) left us before the Olympics. He is an experienced coach, he used to give us inputs in every match and we trusted him a lot. Since he left we didn’t know what to do, what program to follow.

“But now we have a year, so hopefully we will get a new coach and again we will have to adjust to the new regime. So in a way, we got lucky with this postponement.”

Badminton Association of India general secretary Ajay Singhania said they will try to rope in a new foreign coach once things return to normal.

“With the Olympic postponement, we are keen to get a doubles coach in order to strengthen the coaching staff. However, we have to wait for the lockdown to get over first so that we can discuss the issue with SAI and Sports Ministry,” he said.

Chirag and Satwik, the Commonwealth Games Silver medallists, were the first Indian men’s doubles pair to win a Super 500 in Thailand and also reached the finals of Super 750 event at French Open last year. It also helped them to break into the top 10.

“If an experienced coach like comes on board, it will make a big difference,” said Chirag.

“Now we are almost there, it is a matter of 2-3 points, say we are 90 percent there and a really good coach like for example Rexy Mainaky, who is the head coach of Thailand would give us that extra 10 percent. A high-calibre coach can help us get into world’s top 3.”

Mainaky, a 1996 Olympic Gold medallist is one of the famous pair with other being Ricky Subagja.

Satwik said: “We have coaches like Dwi Kristiawan and Namrih Suroto, who can make a program for us. Namrih used to handle us when Flandy was not available and we have been training with Dwi too, so they are also well-equipped to help us.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/chirag--satwik-hoping-to-get-new-foreign-coach.html

He said the Tablighi Jamaat members have been ""exposed"" and even people belonging to the muslim community are ""opposing"" them.

The health ministry had on Sunday said the rate of doubling of COVID-19 cases in India was 4.1 days, but if the cases linked to the Tablighi Jamaat event would not have happened, it would have been 7.4 days.

Citing the RSS' decision to call off the annual meeting of its highest decision-making body -- Partinidhi Sabha -- Vaidya said that Tablighi Jamaat could have also called off their congregation.

Lauding the decision taken by the country's leadership to tackle the coronavirus outbreak, he said India handled the COVID-19 situation comparatively better than developed nations.

""To tackle COVID-19 outbreak, India's leadership took some decisive steps which got public support,"" he said.

The RSS leader said that workers of his organisation helped 25.5 lakh people during the lockdown, imposed to curb the spread of the virus, fed the poor and daily wagers and started a helpline.

About the economic impact of the 21-day lockdown, said the first priority should be to tackle the novel coronavirus and then the focus should shift towards the economy.

166,06-4-20,Tablighis doubled case rate to 4.1 days: Govt,"Had Delhi event not occurred, the doubling would’ve been in 7.4 days

The Government on Sunday blamed the Tablighi Jamaat event, a religious congregation held mid-March in Delhi, for explosion of Covid-19 cases in the country which resulted into the current rate of doubling of the cases in just 4.1 days on an average against 7.4 days earlier.

“The rate of doubling of COVID-19 cases in India is 4.1 days presently but if the cases linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation would not have happened, it would have been 7.4 days,” Union Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said at a routine presser here.

Massive efforts by various authorities have led to nearly 22,000 people linked to the religious grouping and their primary contacts getting quarantined. More are being traced.

There had been 472 new COVID-19 cases and 11 deaths in the last 24 hours, on the eleventh day of the three-week nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of the respiratory disease.

According to the Health Ministry, the total coronavirus cases stand at 3,374 and the death toll at 79, said the official adding that 267 people have recovered. He said at least 274 districts have Covid cases in India. However, a tally of figures reported by States directly showed at least 119 deaths, while the number of confirmed cases had crossed 4,200 mark. Of the total, 321 have been cured and discharged.

The number of Covid-19 cases continues to rise across the States. In Andhra Pradesh the total number of cases now stands at 226 while 690 cases have emerged from Maharashtra, of which 406 cases have been reported from Mumbai alone.

The Government also admitted that there is a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPEs) and N95 masks as the country was not locally manufacturing them till now.

However, now domestic manufacturers have started production and the Government has started procuring them from other countries too.

“We’ve discussed this with all health secretaries, chief secretaries and DMs as this is one of the major issues. We’ve explained to them that PPEs available with us have been already immediately dispatched to the States based on case-load basis,” said Agarwal amid reports and complaints from health workers including doctors and nurses about the shortage/absence of mandatory medical protective items.

“We need to understand we make allotments based on the number of cases reported in States. We are also making an effort to see that how should its procurement be increased.

169,06-4-20,Crackdown on 28 Tablighi foreigners for visa violation,"Authorities unleashed a crackdown on Sunday against 28 foreign nationals linked to Tablighi Jamaat for visa violations.

Eight Malaysian citizens, who were about to board a special flight to Malaysia, were caught at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport. They were part of the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddin.

Ten Filipino nationals were booked in Vashi area of Navi Mumbai under Foreigners Act 1946 and Maharashtra COVID-19 Regulations for allegedly spreading novel corona virus.

The Ghaziabad police filed a criminal case against 10 Indonesians, including five women, for violating tourist visa norms in Sahibabad area of the district. The Indonesian group had also attended the Tablighi Jamaat event in the national Capital last month which has led to a spiral in the number of Covid positive cases across the country.

All the booked Indonesians have been sent to a quarantine facility. The Ghaziabad police have also booked a local guide and four others who provided them accommodation.

The eight Malaysian citizens, who attended a Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddin here, were caught by immigration authorities at the IGI Airport while trying to flee the country through a special flight arranged for the stranded travellers of that nation, officials said.

The eight Malaysian Tablighi radicals were hiding in Delhi-NCR and they tried to take advantage of a special flight arranged by the Malaysian High Commission for their citizens stranded in India due to the lockdown to prevent Covid-19. However they were caught by the immigration authorities.

The eight Malaysians were debarred from boarding the flight as the Central Government has directed all State police forces to take action against those foreigners who had come to India on tourist visa and participated the Tablighi Jamaat congregation.

The Government has already blacklisted 960 foreigners and cancelled their visa for violating visa conditions.

The eight Malaysians have been handed over to the Crime Branch of the Delhi Police by the immigration authorities.

All eight will be put in quarantine, officials said.

Action against the foreign Tablighi Jamaat members were taken after over 2,300 activists, including 250 foreigners, were found to be living at its headquarters located at Delhi’s Nizamuddin last week despite the 21-day lockdown imposed to check the spread of coronavirus.

At least 9,000 people had participated at the congregation at the Nizamuddin Markaz last month after which many have travelled to various parts of the country for missionary works.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/crackdown-on-28-tablighi-foreigners-for-visa-violation-2020-04-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/crackdown-on-28-tablighi-foreigners-for-visa-violation.html
170,06-4-20,Your hand grip can reveal if you are at diabetes risk,"Muscular weakness is known to be associated with Type 2 diabetes and researchers now report that hand grip can help doctors perform time-efficient screening tool for diabetes.

Healthcare practitioners can use assessment of normalised grip strength to routinely screen for Type 2 diabetes in apparently healthy adults, according to a new study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

The current study was able to identify consistent grip strength cut points relative to body weight, gender, and age group in a large nationally representative sample of participants pre-screened for conditions such as hypertension.

""Diagnosing this disease in its early stages is becoming increasingly more important for preventing complications caused by blood vessel damage associated with diabetes,"" said lead researcher Elise C Brown from Department of Public and Environmental Wellness, Oakland University, Rochester, Maryland.

The study identifies the levels of handgrip strength/weakness that correlate with Type 2 Diabetes in otherwise healthy men and women, according to their body weights and ages.

""Healthcare providers now have a reliable test to detect it early before such complications set in,"" Brown added.

Type 2 diabetes is asymptomatic in its initial stages, and a prompt diagnosis can prevent or delay vascular complications such as neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy.

For the study, researchers analysed data to establish normalized grip strength (grip strength relative to body weight) cut points for diabetes risk.

For example, the cut point for women aged 50-80 years is 0.49.

This means that if a 60-year old woman's combined grip strength from left and right hands was 43 kg, and her body weight was 90 kg, her normalized grip strength would be 0.478.

Since this value is less than 0.49, this indicates that she is at increased risk for diabetes and further screening is warranted.

""Given the low cost, minimal training requirement and quickness of the assessment, the use of the normalized grip strength cut points in this paper could be used in routine health screenings to identify at-risk patients and improve diagnosis and outcomes,"" explained Dr Brown.

172,06-4-20,New COVID-19 cases rose to 39 in China; Beijing to be under long-term epidemic control,"China has reported 39 new coronavirus cases, including 38 imported ones, as the number of asymptomatic cases also surged, raising concern of a second wave of the COVID-19 infections mainly from Chinese returning home despite drastic containment efforts, health officials said on Monday.

A health official of Beijing has warned that the Chinese capital will probably remain under long-term coronavirus epidemic control saying that there is no chance to call off the city's prevention and control work in a short time.

China's National Health Commission (NHC) said on Monday that one new domestic COVID-19 case and 38 imported cases were reported from across the country on Sunday.

The one new domestic case was reported from the Guangdong Province, which is a major industrial belt. On Saturday, five new locally cases were reported raising concerns of the cases resurfacing though in smaller numbers as China resumed production full steam after over two months of layoff due to COVID-19.

Imported cases were on the rise as China is currently airlifting a large number of stranded Chinese nationals from different countries through chartered flights.

Also, on Sunday 78 new asymptomatic COVID-19 cases were reported on the mainland, including 40 imported ones, the NHC said, adding that 1,047 asymptomatic cases were still under medical observation.

Asymptomatic coronavirus cases are those who test positive for the virus but do not show any symptoms and have the potential to cause sporadic clusters of infections.

Also on Sunday, one death was reported from the coronavirus virus epicentre Hubei Province taking the death toll in the country to 3,331 people.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland have reached 81,708 by Sunday, including 1,299 patients still being treated, 77,078 patients discharged after recovery, and 3,331 people died of the disease, the NHC said.

By Sunday, 890 confirmed cases, including four deaths have been reported in Hong Kong, 44 confirmed cases in the Macao, and 363 in Taiwan including five deaths, it said.

Meanwhile, a health official here has warned that coronavirus epidemic prevention and control in Beijing will probably become a long-term normal.

The capital, a centre for international exchanges, still bears the brunt of the risks as the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating, Xu Hejian, spokesperson for the municipal government said noting that there is no chance to call off the city's prevention and control work in a short time.

The overall strategy of guarding against the imported cases and a rebound in indigenous cases will remain unchanged, with scientific analysis of the epidemic situation and accurate control methods taken, Xu said.

He also highlighted the importance of seizing the critical window to resume work and production, and bring people's lives back to normal as transmission of the epidemic has been basically interrupted in Beijing and nationwide, although there were still imported and sporadic cases, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

According to Johns Hopkins University, there are more than 1.2 million coronavirus cases across the world and 69,479 people have died.

177,06-4-20,India between Stage 2 and 3 of COVID-19 pandemic: Health Ministry,"India is between Stage 2 and 3 of coronavirus pandemic with large number of cases being found in particular areas, the Union Health Ministry said on Monday concurring with the AIIMS Director's remarks that localised community transmission is being observed in some pockets of the country.

AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria, who is also a member of a Task Force on COVID-19, on Monday reportedly said that ""localised community transmission"" has been seen in some pockets and that India is between Stage 2 (local transmission) and Stage 3.

He had clarified that the most of India is currently at Stage 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Asked about Guleria's remarks, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Health Lav Agarwal said, ""What the AIIMS Director has said is not in variance with what we have been explaining to you.""

Explaining further, Agarwal said that they go for a cluster containment strategy when limited cases are reported from a particular area while the government's action and intervention gets intensified when larger number of cases are reported.

""We tell you every time that if there will be a community transmission we will be the first one to tell you so that everyone gets alert. If we go by the wordings (of AIIMS Director), he said localised community transmission, which implies larger number of cases are being found in a particular area,"" the official said.

""We are in between Stage 2 and 3 and that implies that our efforts and actions should be focused on ensuring we do not shift to stage 3,"" the joint secretary said, adding there are clear defined strategies for containment in areas reporting larger number of cases and the government was working according to that.

In Stage 2, disease transmission is limited to those with travel history to affected countries or those in contact with the infected persons.

Community transmission or Stage 3 means a patient was infected though he had no known contact with another confirmed case of COVID-19 or travelled from a country affected by the pandemic.

Agarwal said there had been 693 new COVID-19 cases and 30 deaths since Sunday. The total number of cases stand at 4,067 with the death toll at 109.

178,06-4-20,People consign ‘Coronasur’ to flames,"Spectacular show across India as people light lamps on Modi’s urge to express their solidarity in fight against Covid-19

India celebrated a nine-minute of Diwali on Sunday night as millions of diyas and candles lit up the country’s nook and corner, skyscrapers and shanties to express their solidarity in the fight against coronavirus.

From political bigwigs to celebrities and middle class to low-end wage earners, they all came out to contribute their bit to drive out the coronavirus which has ravaged the nation’s health and economy and kept people confined in their homes.

President Ramnath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Home Minister Amit Shah as well other senior Ministers switched off the lights of their residences and lighted candles and diya to mark the occasion.

Even before the scheduled time of 9 pm, people around the country switched off their electric lights and came out in the balconies and verandas of their house holding candles, lanterns and diya (following a call from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to “challenge the darkness spread by the coronavirus crisis”.

The sky also reverberated with the sound of firecrackers, blowing of conches, ringing of temple bells. People also chanted “go corona...go…” to express their resolve to throw out the deadly contagion.

The event passed off without creating any problem for the power grids due to such abrupt fluctuation in demand. “The nine-minute lights-out event went smoothly; no impact on electricity grid functioning,” said Power Minister RK Singh.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s nonagenarian mother responded to the lights-out call given by her son, by holding a diya in her hand at her house in Gujarat on Sunday night. In a video that went viral in a short span of time, the PM’s mother, Hiraba, is seen sitting on a chair holding a metal diya in hand for nine minutes after the lights were switched off.

On Friday last, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked people to empower themselves as also the country by lighting earthen lamps, candles and mobile torch at 9 pm for nine minutes on April 5, and send out a message that none of the citizens are alone in the coronavirus battle.

“This Sunday on April 5, we have to challenge coronavirus. I need your nine minutes at 9 pm. Switch off the lights of your house. Light up a candle, lamp or use the mobile torch. This light will show that we are together in this battle,” had said the Prime Minister in a nation-wide address.

The Opposition was not amused by the PM’s call. Several Opposition leaders slammed the Prime Minister for exhorting people to light candles, saying they had expected him to announce a second financial package to alleviate the pain and anxieties of the people.

In the second successful operation in less than 24 hours, alert troops of the Indian Army on Sunday eliminated five heavily armed terrorists in North Kashmir’s Keran sector of Kupwara district. Three Indian soldiers also sacrificed their lives in the line of duty while neutralising heavily armed group of Pakistan trained terrorists.

According to Col Rajesh Kalia, Srinagar-based spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, “over the last 24 hours, Indian security forces have eliminated nine terrorists in J&K. Four terrorists who were involved in killing of innocent civilians were eliminated at Batpura on April 4.”

He added, “In an another ongoing anti-infiltration operation in Keran sector of North Kashmir, alert troops braving inclement weather and hostile terrain have so far eliminated five terrorists attempting to infiltrate across the LoC taking advantage of bad weather”.

In the ongoing operation, three Indian soldiers also attained martyrdom. Out of these three, two of them succumbed to their fatal injuries after they were evacuated braving adverse weather conditions. Other injured soldiers are undergoing treatment while operation was still in progress along the LoC.

188,06-4-20,"France reports lowest daily virus toll in a week, total now 8,078","France on Sunday reported 357 coronavirus deaths in hospital in 24 hours, the lowest daily increase in a week, bringing the country's toll to 8,078.

The tally included 5,889 patients who died in hospital and 2,189 people in old age homes and other medical facilities, a government statement said.

It said there were now 28,891 people with coronavirus in hospital in France -- up 748 from the day before -- with 6,978 in intensive care -- a daily increase of 140 which was also the lowest number in days.

France has been in lockdown since March 17 in a bid to slow the spread of the epidemic, with only essential trips allowed that must be justified with a signed piece of paper.

There have been 70,478 confirmed coronavirus cases in France, but this is not the total as testing for the virus is not universal.

As the country basked in warm sunshine on Sunday and the Easter holiday period started, officials urged people to continue heeding the lockdown rules.

Police checks continued as people around the country were observed flouting restrictions to jog in groups, gather in green spaces and allow children to play together as rural areas received holidaymakers contrary to the government's confinement orders.

""The end of confinement is not yet on the cards, a deadline has not been set,"" interior ministry number two Laurent Nunez stressed.

""I remind you of the rule... one goes out only when it is strictly necessary."" ""It's the holidays, the weather is nice, don't give in to the temptation,"" urged Valerie Pecresse, president of the larger Paris Ile-de-France region, which is hardest hit by the pandemic.

Forty-one severely ill patients were evacuated Sunday from Ile-de-France's overflowing hospitals and brought to Brittany in the north in two specially-equipped high-speed trains. (AFP)

189,06-4-20,"Queen delivers special COVID-19 address, says 'we will succeed... and we will meet again'","Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, in a rare televised address to the nation, invoked a war-time spirit of self-discipline and resolve to fight the coronavirus pandemic which has killed nearly 5,000 in the country and about 70,000 people globally, assuring Britons that ""better days will return"".

The 93-year-old British monarch and Head of the 54-member Commonwealth of nations which includes India, acknowledged the grief, pain and financial difficulties being faced the world over during this ""time of disruption"" and expressed the hope that the whole world was uniting in a ""common endeavour"".

""I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge,"" she said on Sunday, in a four-minute speech recorded earlier this week at Windsor Castle.

""And those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any. That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humoured resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterise this country,"" she said.

The Queen, who has been based at Windsor Castle with her 98-year-old husband Prince Philip since last month, called on the British public to draw on their inherent traits as she exhorted them to carry on following the official government guidance to stay at home to protect the vulnerable and curb the rapid spread of the deadly virus.

""I am speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time. A time of disruption in the life of our country: a disruption that has brought grief to some, financial difficulties to many, and enormous changes to the daily lives of us all,"" the monarch said, as she went on to thank key workers, including carers and those on the frontline of the COVID-19 fightback at the National Health Service (NHS) and acknowledged the pain felt by many families who have lost their loved ones in the pandemic.

The message was recorded in the White Drawing Room at her sprawling castle in Berkshire, south-east England by a single BBC cameraperson dressed in a full-body protective suit as other technicians remained at a considerable distance in a separate room to comply with medical advice.

""We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again,"" she said.

The Queen concluded her address by again calling for unity saying, ""we will succeed"".

Her ""deeply personal"" words were said to be chosen to echo those of her father, King George VI, during World War II, aimed at bringing the country together in a time of crisis. Apart from her annual Christmas message, it is rare for the British monarch to make a special address.

The previous times she addressed the nation in a similar way was at the time of the Gulf war in 1991, on the eve of the funeral of Princess Diana in 1997, on the death of the Queen Mother in 2002, and on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012.

Downing Street said Sunday's message was intended as a means to ""lift the nation's spirits"" amidst the strict lockdown rules designed to slow the spread of coronavirus and prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who remains in self-isolation as he recovers from mild symptoms of COVID-19, has been conducting his weekly audiences with the Queen over the telephone.

""The Prime Minister and Her Majesty the Queen have been speaking regularly and No. 10 and Buckingham Palace have been speaking throughout about Her Majesty the Queen's address,"" a Downing Street official said.

""The Queen is the best judge of when to talk to the country and we absolutely agree that now is the right time. We have asked the country to make huge sacrifices and life is very difficult at the moment for a great number of people. Hearing from Her Majesty at this time is an important way of helping to lift the nation's spirits,"" the official said.

The Queen's address came days after her son and heir, Prince Charles, who came out of self-isolation a week ago having tested positive for COVID-19, offered his own tributes to the NHS as he inaugurated a new makeshift hospital in London via video conference from his home at Birkhall in Scotland.

On Sunday, as many as 621 people in the UK died of coronavirus, taking the death toll to 4,934, the Department of Health said after England recorded 555 more deaths.

More than 1.2 million cases including over 69,000 deaths have been reported in 190 countries and territories around the world since the coronavirus first emerged in China in December last year.

199,06-4-20,Singer Kanika Kapoor discharged from hospital,"Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor has finally been discharged from the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) after her second report for Coronavirus also tested negative.

SGPGIMS PRO Kusum Yadav said that Kanika has been allowed to go home.

Kanika was admitted on March 20 when her tests revealed that she was Coronavirus positive.

Her five consecutive reports showed her as Coronavirus positive. The reports on Saturday and Sunday however were Corona negative.

Kanika is the first Bollywood celebrity to test positive for the deadly virus in the country.

In a statement on Instagram, which she later deleted, Kanika narrated how she developed signs of flu on her return from London. She claimed that she was unaware of the Coronavirus infection till she tested positive.

The singer who had come from London on March 9 was slammed by the media for interacting with hundreds of people at parties and other events in Lucknow even though she had symptoms of Corona.

She was admitted on March 20 when her tests revealed that she was Corona positive.

Kanika's troubles, however, are likely to increase now since three FIRs have been filed against her on charges of negligence for attending various social events in the city despite being infected with coronavirus and having been instructed by the authorities to isolate herself at her home.

She has been booked under Sections 188, 269, and 270 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Sarojini Nagar police station in the city.

“It will take time,” Additional Chief Secretary (Home and Information) Awanish Awasthi said on the possibility of the restrictions ending that day in Uttar Pradesh.

His remarks come a day after Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the lockdown, which was imposed nationwide to contain coronavirus, will be lifted on April 15. The CM had called for a mechanism to ensure crowding doesn't take place when this happen, else all efforts so far will go to waste.

But Awasthi indicated that lifting the lockdown on April 14 is unlikely.

“Since the number of coronavirus cases has gone up markedly in the past couple of days with a large number of those linked to the Jamaat testing positive, it would be impossible to say that the lockdown will be lifted or not after April 14,” he said.

“Even If one case remains, lifting it would not be right as the entire work done so far to control the virus would go in vain,"" Awasthi added.

""At this preliminary stage it is impossible to say if it will be lifted after April 14. It will take time,"" he said.

Awasthi said the number of coronavirus infections in the state climbed to 305 on Monday, an increase of 27 over the previous day.

He said 159 of these cases are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi's Nizamuddin, which has emerged as a major coronavirus hotspot.

Twenty-one of the 27 fresh cases are linked to the Jamaat, he said, adding that eight members of the organisation tested positive in Sitapur, five each in Lucknow and Shamli, and one each in Bijnor, Kanpur and Allahabad.

Agra district tops the overall Tablighi Jamaat list so far with 29 people testing positive, according to Awasthi.

This is followed by Ghaziabad (14), Saharanpur, Shamli and Meerut (13 each), Lucknow (12) Sitapur (8), Kanpur (7), Maharajganj (6), Ghazipur (5), Firozabad, Hathras and Varanasi (4 each) among others.

So far, the state authorities have identified 1,600 people associated with the Jamaat. Of them, 1,200 were quarantined.

Thousands of people had participated in a congregation at the Jamaat's headquarters in Delhi's last month and then travelled to various parts of the country, with many of them carrying the virus.

""Our priority is to first take up the treatment of patients who have tested positive and then those who come in contact with them, besides tracing the chain of other contacts,"" Awasthi said.

Uttar Pradesh has so far reported three coronavirus deaths, one each from Basti, Meerut and Varanasi. At least 21 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospitals.

206,06-4-20,"NY schools log out of Zoom, adopt Microsoft Teams","In yet another setback for popular video meeting app Zoom, New York City has banned its use for remote learning purposes in schools until further review and update due to security concerns.

The city's Department of Education is transitioning schools to Microsoft Teams, which is believed to have the ""same capabilities with appropriate security measures in place,"" TechCrunch reported on Sunday.

""Providing a safe and secure remote learning experience for our students is essential, and upon further review of security concerns, schools should move away from using Zoom as soon as possible,"" Danielle Filson, a spokesperson for the New York City Department of Education, was quoted as saying.

""There are many new components to remote learning, and we are making real-time decisions in the best interest of our staff and students,"" Filson said.

After schools in the city closed on March 16, Zoom's popularity as a tool enabling remote learning skyrocketed.

But the platform also started facing criticism as reports of ""Zoombombing"" and other privacy issues started surfacing from different parts of the country.

""Zoomraiding"" or ""Zoombombing"" refers to a type of online harassment in which hate speech, pornography or other inappropriate content is suddenly flashed by disrupting a video call on Zoom.

Several schools in the US earlier reported that unidentified persons accessed classes conducted through Zoom.

A Massachusetts-based high school reported that while a teacher was conducting an online class using the teleconferencing software Zoom, an unidentified individual(s) dialed into the classroom.

The popular video meeting app courted another controversy when security researchers from Citizen Lab at University of Toronto found that that some Zoom calls were routed through servers in China, along with conference encryption and decryption keys used to secure those calls.

Zooms Founder and CEO Eric Yuan has already apologized for the privacy and security issues being reported in his app that has seen a surge in usage globally as people work from home during lockdowns.

The New York City Department of Education ""continues to review and monitor developments with Zoom,"" said the spokesperson, adding that it will update schools with any changes.

208,06-4-20,Telangana deploys COVID-19 monitoring system app,"The Telangana government has deployed India's first automated 'COVID-19 Monitoring System App' to identify, undertake live surveillance, track, monitor, and provide real-time analytics.



The app, devised by Vera Smart Healthcare, is helping officials and even the Chief Ministers Office to keep track of the situation on a real time basis.



COVID-19 Monitoring System App, developed in a record time to deal with the pandemic, enables live surveillance, monitoring, tracking, reporting, and major bulletins.



The analytics by the app also facilitate assurance to the stakeholders by providing the facts and figures at their fingertips.



The system empowers each health-caller to handle over 1500 calls, and simple chatbot interaction every day with a patient, to ensure that the symptomatic or confirmed 'positive', quarantined and is under treatment, helping to strengthen the Covid-19 contacts outreach significantly.



The callers will also persuade and remind the patient to self-administer the prescribed treatment, to maintain social distancing, as well as give a reminder to stay home and stay safe.



This user-friendly app is developed by the US and Hyderabad based, early stage start-up Vera Smart Healthcare, which had earlier helped Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu, to create detailed health profiles for more than 50,000 people across these states.



Vera has introduced the first-ever mobile hospital in India to help increase healthcare accessibility in rural areas covering most of the Indian villages. The company focuses on building smart hospitals in India along with its technology partner Fellow.



""The system has helped us first, track and monitor the foreign returnees; community spread and already hospitalised for severe acute respiratory infection (SARS) very early to control spread of Covid,"" said G. Srinivas Rao, Director of Public Health, Government of Telangana.



He commended Vera Smart Healthcare expertise for handling the COVID-19 surveillance complexities, understanding the protocol, and developing the technology platform in a record three days.

209,06-4-20,"Researchers use AI to predict battery health, safety","Researchers have designed an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based system that can predict battery health with 10 times higher accuracy than current industry standard.



The findings, detailed in the journal Nature Communications, could aid in the development of safer and more reliable batteries for electric vehicles and consumer electronics as predicting the state of health and the remaining useful lifespan of lithium-ion batteries is one of the big problems limiting widespread adoption of electric vehicles.



It is also a familiar annoyance to mobile phone users.



""Safety and reliability are the most important design criteria as we develop batteries that can pack a lot of energy in a small space,"" said Alpha Lee from University of Cambridge who co-led the research.



The researchers designed a new way to monitor batteries by sending electrical pulses into them and measuring the response.



The measurements were then processed by a machine learning algorithm to predict the battery's health and useful lifespan.



The researchers performed over 20,000 experimental measurements to train the model.



Their method is non-invasive and is a simple add-on to any existing battery system.



The researchers also showed that the machine learning model can be interpreted to give hints about the physical mechanism of degradation.



The model can inform which electrical signals are most correlated with ageing, which in turn allows them to design specific experiments to probe why and how batteries degrade.



""By improving the software that monitors charging and discharging, and using data-driven software to control the charging process, I believe we can power a big improvement in battery performance,"" Lee said.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/researchers-use-ai-to-predict-battery-health--safety-2020-04-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/researchers-use-ai-to-predict-battery-health--safety.html
