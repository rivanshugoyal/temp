0,11-1-20,Caught in the crossfire,"The US and allied Sheikhdoms are crying wolf as their own record in creating or facilitating the ongoing mess in the Middle-East and the terror industry far outstrips that of Iran

Diplomatic sabre-rattling on the part of Washington and Tehran following the unwarranted killing of Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani has led to a strange referencing of “Delhi” in the leadership statements of both nations to posit counter-narratives. US President Donald Trump has fronted his manufactured outrage against Iran and Soleimani in particular to justify his actions. He declared that Soleimani was the “world’s number one terrorist leader.” Trump tweeted, “Soleimani made the death of innocent people his sick passion, contributing to terrorist plots as far away as Delhi and London.”

Meanwhile, the erudite Iranian Foreign Minister, Javad Zarif, postulated a counter to slam the bullying tactics of the Trump administration by asking, “How do they feel about people chanting in the streets of Iraq, in the streets of Moscow, in the streets of New Delhi and everywhere else that they should leave, how do they feel about that? That’s the price for arrogance, for ignorance, for lack of respect.” In both these statements, “Delhi” was mentioned when actually, the official statement on the brewing situation in the Persian Gulf remained mired in diplomatic caution and ropewalk.

The last visit of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to India in February 2018 had led to the issuance of an official joint statement titled, “Towards prosperity with greater connectivity.” It noted among other strategic imperatives, “They (Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Rouhani) called on the international community to end selective or partial approaches to combat terrorism. In this regard, it stressed on the need to make every effort to reach an agreement and conclude a comprehensive convention on international terrorism at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).”

Importantly, India “reaffirmed its support for full and effective implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which has been endorsed by the UN Security Council and is a crucial contribution to the non-proliferation framework and international peace, stability and security.” This was something that was unilaterally torn apart by Trump. Singularly, he imagined ghosts in the Iran nuclear deal and in the adherence of Iranian commitments. This was very much in contrast to the views of other signatories to the deal and multilateral agencies responsible for overlooking the pact.

Clearly “Delhi”, too, wasn’t aligned to Trump’s view on Iran but India’s own national and strategic interests forced it to not express its opinion. Indian discomfiture in abiding by earlier US sanctions against buying oil from Iran had led to delicate discussions, which managed temporary waivers. Ultimately, India complied, not fully convinced about the US narrative on Iran but because larger stakes were involved.

The Iranian “terror” in Delhi, as mentioned by Trump, could only refer to the 2012 car bomb attack on the then Israeli Defence Attaché’s wife in Delhi. Back then, a few suspects were arrested and interrogated by the Indian police and the judicial system but no one was convicted.

Two questions persisted about this incident. First, if compelling evidence was there to nail Iranian complicity, then surely the US-Israeli combine would have had enough heft and stakes in India to see through the conviction? Second, back then, India had just replaced China as the biggest market for Iranian oil. Why would an economically struggling Iran risk offending India with terror attacks? Yet, the taint survived and resurfaced in Trump’s questionable attempts to slam Soleimani as a “terrorist”, who conducted operations from “London to Delhi.”

To understand the situation, context is of prime importance. General Soleimani was the commander of the Quds Force, which had been at the forefront of advancing Iran’s strategic sectarian interests in an interventionist manner. His forces, along with a host of supporting militias, played an invaluable role in routing the Islamic State (IS). In the bargain, the reclaimed territories passed in favour of his co-sectarian and anti-US ally, Bashar-al-Assad’s Syrian Government. This resulted in the parallel defeat of America, Arab Sheikhdom-sponsored militias and forces both in Iraqi-Syrian lands and Yemen.

However, almost all terror attacks across the world since 9/11 can be traced to the pernicious support extended by the ideological fount of the US allies in Arab sheikhdoms and not to Tehran. Even beyond the Middle-East, terror set-ups like the Boko Haram in Nigeria, Al-Shabab in Somalia and the Taliban in Afghanistan among others are all irreconcilably opposed to Shiite Iran. They find financial and ideological succour from the Arab Sheikhdoms.

Now, Soleimani’s Quds Force is believed to have eight directorates, including one cluster that conjoins the Pakistan-Afghanistan-India theatre. However, the realistic focus of Soleimani’s concerns may have been directed towards the Middle Eastern theatre. Even in this specific directorate, the Shia interest is most vulnerable in Pakistan and Afghanistan and not in India.

The Israeli tact of covert global actions is an established practice with officially sanctified “hits” to neutralise its stated enemies. Murmurs were rife about the Delhi attack being a reciprocal Iranian revenge for Israeli covert operations to “take out” Iranian scientists. Even if true and unacceptable on Indian soil, it does not qualify linearly as bringing terror infrastructure into India but as an incidental part of the ongoing cloak-and-dagger between Iran and Israel as it plays out globally.

If anything, Iranian and Indian interests converge strategically in the sensitive realm of Afghanistan (much to the consternation of Pakistan) as also in the development of a counterpoise to the Chinese built facility at Gwadar in Pakistan and in the joint development of the Chabahar Port in Iran as an alternative artery to Central Asia and Afghanistan.

Besides, India has had several decades of experience in understanding and documenting the terror industry and its nurseries, benefactors and routes. In such a long time, it has never recorded or even expressed concern about any possible Iran angle on terror as yet. Certainly, the truth is somewhere in between as neither can an interventionist force like the Quds Force be expected to abide by international rules, nor were there any mega protests of mourning, as has been claimed. But the US and its allied Sheikhdoms are crying wolf as their own record in creating or facilitating the ongoing mess in the Middle-East and in fuelling the terror industry in general far outstrips that of Iran.

1,11-1-20,SC’s conscience call,"In a relief to Kashmiris, apex court asks Govt to review restrictive orders and internet bans in a week

The Supreme Court has not just relieved besieged Kashmiris from their ordeal by asking the Government to review internet shutdowns and restrictive orders on their free movement. It has re-established the moral trajectory of what a democracy should be at a time when a nation’s choices and opinions are swelling with majoritarian emotion rather than corrective reason. When the brute force of arrogance is intolerant of any kind of logical dissent and wants subservience without contrarianism as the only political culture. In that sense, the ruling is significant as it applies to every oppressive measure in force and cautions the regime against overreaching itself. The top court categorically asserted that internet use was as much about the freedom of speech and expression under Article 19 (1) (A) of the Constitution, that “suspension of free movement, internet and basic freedoms cannot be an arbitrary exercise of power” and that “mere expression of dissent or disagreement against a Government decision cannot be reason for internet suspension.” The court further criticised the repeated use of Section 144, a colonial-era rule to ban large gatherings in the erstwhile State that was downgraded into a Union Territory after Article 370 was scrapped. “It can’t be used as a tool to oppress difference of opinion,” the bench said. And lest the Government slacken on relaxations or use the argumentative logic of clampdowns being a protective shield against threats from Pakistan-exported militancy, the court has asked that all restrictive orders of the last five months be made public so that they can be challenged legally. This is significant, considering the severe detention orders against politicians, businessmen, notables and civil society, particularly three former Chief Ministers, who have forever been considered “friendlies” of New Delhi, sworn by the idea of India and been the buffer against extremist hawks in the Valley. This means that they can now seek legal redress, the court implying some concern over the Government’s assumption that their continued demand for an autonomous arrangement vis-a-vis the Valley was seditious and in conflict with the new arrangement. And nothing could reset the balance with a counterpoint than Justice NV Ramanna’s quoting Charles Dickens’ A Tale of Two Cities to describe the prevalent situation: “It was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness.” It is the grimmest reminder of how the Government wants to bequeath a legacy in the Valley, as a punisher in a conflict zone or as a healer of history.

The internet shutdown in Kashmir has crippled more than common life, it has paralysed its economy, pushing away even the most moderate civilians instead of coopting them. The Kashmir Chamber of Commerce has estimated a loss of around Rs 10,000 crore following the stoppage of online business transactions. This comes to around seven per cent of the State’s GDP for 2017-18. According to a 2018 report by Delhi think-tank Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), internet curbs between 2012 and 2017 cost the State economy Rs 4,000 crore. The tourism industry has been the worst hit in a State that depends on it. According to the 2017 economic survey by the then Government, the tourism sector makes for around 6.98 per cent of the State’s GDP. The absence of internet has affected hotel bookings and even allied sectors like handicrafts, handlooms and transport, which were hoping to draw sustenance from online sales, considering there were very few visitors in the Valley. App-based aggregator services and online businesses have all but wound up. The students, who can actually be used to re-contour politics, are at the worst receiving end. Without the internet, they have been taking trains to neighbouring areas to register for competitive exams, complete theses and continue online study courses. Telemedicine, a life-saver in a terrain that’s not conducive for rushing patients to speciality centres during major health emergencies, has collapsed. Doctors had established online volunteer networks to share reports and guide colleagues on-site to treat serious cases and save lives. Draconian lockdowns anywhere have only ended up breeding distrust and strengthened the anti-establishment resolve. If the Government indeed wants to champion the cause of development, a reason it cited for redefining the status of Kashmir, then it has got to engage with the situation on the ground as is and not craft its new normal. Only an evolution of dialogue and not imposition can work in Kashmir.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc---s-conscience-call-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/sc---s-conscience-call.html
2,11-1-20,Don’t stop information flow,"The mounting pace of internet shutdown makes us ponder about the seriousness of the Government's objective envisioned for Digital India

In today’s world, the internet is the lifeblood of society and communication. It not only enables individuals to connect and communicate with each other while eroding physical boundaries, it also provides a corridor to generate, broadcast and disseminate information within seconds to any distant place. Consequently, it has dramatically transformed the contours of our personal, social, political and economic life.

The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in a report on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 2011, in chapter V notes, “The Internet, as a medium by which the right to freedom of expression can be exercised, can only serve its purpose if States assume their commitment to developing effective policies to attain universal access to the Internet.”

In countries like Estonia, France and Costa Rica, access to the internet has been declared as a fundamental right. In the Shirin RK vs State of Kerala case in 2019, the Kerala High Court maintained that the right to access the internet is a fundamental right. The court further mentioned that access to the internet is an inalienable part of the right to privacy and right to education under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.

Unremitting and equal opportunity for participation in the digital territory must be pronounced as a prime and pressing necessity in the digital age. Digital media such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube with minimal constraints emerged as alternative spaces for people to voice the actual concerns of citizens.

Further, reliance on such channels diminishes the authority of the mediocre in the mainstream media, that masquerades as a champion of citizen’s rights. On its website, the Digital India initiative notes that to digitally empower its citizens the need for digital infrastructure as a utility to every citizen must be fulfilled. Under the nine pillars of Digital India, the Universal Access to Mobile Connectivity, Internet Access Programme and Information for All, are majorly highlighted.

The mounting pace of internet shutdown nevertheless makes us ponder about the seriousness of the objective envisioned for Digital India. The Government had launched it to advance a pan-digital character of India, however, ironically, the Government itself deprives the digital citizenry of accessing the internet. When a large part of the country was made to gear up for a Digital and online India, Kashmir was deliberately pushed to remain under continuous digital darkness for 152 days.

Having discussed that, the question then arises why is the Government blacking out internet across the country? The simple answer is that in the name of maintaining “law and order” it is an intentional move to neutralise all kinds of demonstrations and protests, to not let civil society and university students criticize, plan and assemble for peaceful protests/gatherings/demonstrations.

Internet shutdown is defined by Access Now (AN) — a non-profit that works for digital rights around the world — as when someone, usually a government, intentionally disrupts the internet or mobile apps to control what people say or do. Shutdowns are also sometimes called “blackouts” or “kill switches.”

According to a report published by AN, the number of internet shutdowns by the country from January to July, 2019, India tops the list with total 80 blackouts.

The report distinctly indicates that every year there is a continuous alarming rise in internet shutdowns in India as well as across the world, mainly in Asian and African regions. However, the legal services organisation SFLC.in, records that between 2013-2015 accesses to the internet was blocked only nine times across four Indian States.

Financial aspects of internet shutdown cannot be spurned. The Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), New Delhi, conducted a study, prepared and released a report about the impact of internet shutdown upon the Indian economy on April 25, 2018. The report maintains that during 2012 and 2017, the economy suffered a loss of approximately $3.04 billion. The figure might exceed $11 to 12 billion if we add internet shutdown in 2018 and 2019.

Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill 2019, considers the necessity of the collective culture that helps to foster a free and fair digital economy. Considering the scale of data on internet shutdown in India, the digital economy and the objective of Digital India will merely result in another chimaera for Indians.

Right after the anti-CAA protests flared up in Assam and other north-eastern States, internet was completely shut. In Assam, the internet was shut down for more than a week. However, due to the timely intervention of the Guwahati High Court services were restored.

Internet services were shut down seven times due to the anti-CAA protests in dozens of districts of Uttar Pradesh (UP), including Lucknow, Ghaziabad, Prayagraj and Kanpur. In Delhi-NCR, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh internet was suspended in limited parts for less than a day on various days in December. This is paving the way for digital poverty, discrimination and divide. Surprisingly there seems to be no abrupt definite move from the Government to bridge this widening chasm to justify the aims of Digital India.

According to Internet Right (2011) — an initiative of the Digital Empowerment Foundation — development deficits and divide cannot be bridged if information access and services are denied. Hence, restricting somebody from accessing the internet is a gross violation of human rights and undermines one's right to information/access to information. It is undemocratic and unconstitutional in nature.

Significantly, the Supreme Court on Friday attested the reasonable necessity to access the internet and termed the internet shutdown in Kashmir as totally illegal. The court further reminded the Government that it was violating the Indian telecom rules and directed the authorities concerned to review unethical and unjust curbs on internet and communication systems in Kashmir region within a week.

The Bench, led by Justice NV Ramana ruled, “Freedom of internet access is a fundamental right.” The Bench also added that freedom to free speech and expression is proportionately curtained due to internet shutdown, granted under Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution. Reasonable restrictions to curb free speech and expression are also part of the same law. But no practising democracy shall allow the restrictions to access internet for this long. Restrictions could be imposed for a temporary period to prevent foreseen extreme violence and misfortune of any kind. However, extended internet blackouts not only restrict society from exercising the constitutional right to free speech and expression but also the right to access information actualised through the internet in the Digital Age. Lack of access to the internet might result in massive corruption and lack of transparency. This severely undermines democratic values and fundamental rights rooted in the Constitution. Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency and Public Safety) Rules, 2017 and Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, does not permit for the complete shutdown as witnessed in the case of Kashmir, but just for a limited and short period to avoid violence in society. These rules and law have grossly been violated by Government.

Unfortunately, India does not even have any new Act to respond to various ethical issues arising at the governance and policy level in the Age of the Internet.

The Government must seriously deliberate and declare the internet as a fundamental right to strengthen its tangible spirit and standing in the world.

4,11-1-20,Haryana to have more women cops: CM,"The percentage of women in the Haryana Police will be increased by 15 percent in the next five years Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said on Friday.

Speaking on the second day of the conference on the topic of Safety of Women and Children in Panchkula, Khattar said that it is commendable to see how the recruitment percentage of women in the State Police force has increased from 6 percent to 10 percent, in the last five years and this percentage will now be further increased to 15 percent. ""Ensuring the safety of women and children is the topmost priority of the State Government and several important steps have been taken in this direction,"" he said.

The chief minister said 34 women police stations have been opened in Haryana pointing out that earlier due to the lack of dedicated women police stations, the victims did not have the courage to report the crime against them but now with these police stations, the victims are coming forward to report every crime.

He said police officers have also been directed to register the complaint of every crime reported to them and ensure that justices is given to every victim.

He suggested that a survey regarding how many people are satisfied with the registration by the police should also be done by the National Crime Bureau. Speaking on the sexual violence against women, the Chief Minister said that efforts should be made by the families, NGOs, and other organizations for imparting the moral value of respecting women among the youth.

On the gender ratio issue, since the implementation of the ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ initiative, State had gone up by leaps and bounds viz-a-viz the sex ratio.

He said that in this direction strict action against the female foeticide along with the several awareness programs were launched in all the districts, which has shown positive results as now the families in Haryana celebrate the birth of a girl child similar to son.

Sharing the details about the list of the State Government’s initiatives taken for ensuring women safety and empowerment, the Chief Minister said that 31 new colleges have been opened, special buses are being run of more than 150 routes for women studying in colleges and Universities. Apart from this, special skill development and training programs are being run to provide ample employment opportunities for women and for this an MoU has also been signed with UNO.

To make Haryana a safe and secure place for women, Durga Shakti App, Woman helpline, Women Help Desk at Police Stations have become operational, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/haryana-to-have-more-women-cops--cm.html
5,11-1-20,Haryana Cong slams Govt over increasing crimes against women,"Haryana Congress President Kumari Selja on Friday slammed the State Government over the State’s third rank in crime against women across the country.""Due to Government’s failure, the law & order situation in the State has gone out of control. It is of great concern,"" she said in a statement here.

Selja said that since the formation of BJP government in the State, crimes against women have increased manifold, adding that the NCRB data shows that year by year, crimes against women in Haryana are increasing rapidly.Citing NCRB data, Selja said that according to 2015 NCRB data, 9511 cases of crime against women were registered. This means about 26 cases of crimes were committed daily.This increased to 9839 in the year 2016 while 11,370 in 2017.

However, the recently released figures of the year 2018 by NCRB reveal that in the year 2018, crimes against women have increased by 26 percent as compared to the year 2017.

In 2018, there were 14,326 crimes against women which is an average of 39 crimes against women were committed each day.Selja said that if we talk about rape cases, according to the NCRB data, 1099 rape cases were reported in the year 2017. The rape cases increased to 1296 in 2018.

She said that the figures show the deteriorating law and order situation in Haryana and the pathetic condition of women’s safety in the State. ""Despite this, the state government is not taking any concrete steps towards women's safety,"" she said.The Congress chief alleged that the Haryana government has neither a policy for women’s safety nor any intention to control crimes against women.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/haryana-cong-slams-govt-over-increasing-crimes-against-women.html

7,11-1-20,Complete consolidation work on war footing: CM,"Asking officials of Consolidation (chakbandi) department to dispose of pending cases within six months, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that the process of consolidation in the state be taken forward on a war footing.

“Dispose of pending cases at war footing as people are suffering. You have six months to do so. Besides, form teams to get pending cases in High Court resolved at the earliest,” Yogi told officers at a review meeting of the Consolidation department at Lok Bhawan in Lucknow on Friday.

In the meeting, the chief minister reviewed the consolidation work district-wise and sought information from consolidation officers about their respective districts.

As per state government records, 1,12,907 consolidation cases are pending with Consolidation department and 165 cases are pending in High Court.

Yogi expressed annoyance at consolidation cases pending in many villages for the last 25 years. “Keeping cases pending for so long means ruining an entire generation. The patience of the people of the villages should not be tested. Nobody will object if the land of poor and rich is distributed in a more transparent way,” he said .

The chief minister said that the time limit of five years for consolidation should end and directed officials to motivate people for voluntary consolidation in one year.

“Work in mission mode putting in an extra hour and if required get extra workforce. In Gopalpur of Hathras and Chilbilwa village of Gorakhpur, the way people volunteered for consolidation, should be adopted in other districts too,” Yogi said.

The chief minister said that during consolidation process, space should be left for meadows, barns, sports grounds and for public programmes in villages.

“Set the target of six months and try to change the image of your department. Consolidation officers should either sit in courts, otherwise they should remain in their offices. Along with this, officers should also go to the field and make people aware of the benefits of consolidation process,” he said.

Yogi asked officers to speed up computerisation of 28 courts of consolidation and 235 courts of consolidation officers.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/complete-consolidation--work-on-war-footing--cm.html
8,11-1-20,"UP Govt considering police commissionerate system for Lko, Noida: DGP","The Uttar Pradesh government is seriously contemplating the introduction of police commissionerate system in a phased manner to make effective control on crime and make police officers directly accountable for law and order.

Initially, the system is likely to be introduced in Lucknow and Gautam Buddha Nagar (Noida), where no district police chiefs have been posted by the government. While the SSP of Lucknow was transferred, the SSP of Noida was suspended by the government on Thursday.

“The government is discussing the commissionerate system for Lucknow and Noida,” Director General of Police OP Singh said on Friday morning.

The system gives more teeth, including magisterial powers, to IPS officers of inspector general of police (IG) rank and above, posted as commissioners. The system is in place in 71 cities across 15 states in the country.

As of now, magisterial powers are with district magistrates and his deputies who are IAS and PCS officers. If the commissionerate system is implemented, district magistrates will be left with revenue related work and decisions regarding law and order, including giving permission for programmes and issuing various licences would rest with the police commissioners.

The move was initiated earlier also but could not be implemented as IAS and IPS officers were at loggerheads over the issue.

In December 2018, former Governor Ram Naik had suggested the state government to seriously consider introducing the system in the state for improving law and order.

He had given the suggestion in the presence of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath while addressing a function at Reserve Police Lines in Lucknow.

Naik had suggested that the system be introduced on a trial basis in Lucknow, Kanpur and Ghaziabad where the populations exceeded the 20-lakh mark.

Sources confirmed in Lucknow on Friday that the DGP met Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday and submitted a plan for introduction of police commissionerate system in Lucknow and Noida. Now it is up to Yogi Adityanath to make a call.

Speculation over introduction of police commissionerate system in Lucknow and Noida gained steam as the state government did not post SSPs in both districts.

On Thursday, Noida SSP Vaibhav Krishna was suspended while Lucknow SSP Kalanidhi Naithani was shifted as SSP of Ghaziabad.

Reports further said that IG (Meerut) Alok Singh and IG (Lucknow) SK Bhagat had been asked to take charge of the districts.

Earlier, the previous Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party governments had tried to introduce the police commissionerate system but the IAS lobby did not allow it, offering several reasons.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-govt-considering-police--commissionerate-system--for-lko--noida--dgp.html

Priyanka, who met students and social workers arrested during anti-CAA protests at Guleria Kothi (Ramghat) here on Friday, accused the Narendra Modi government of acting against the Constitution.

They were holding a peaceful agitation yet they were arrested, she said.

Priyanka said the NRC was also against the spirit of the Constitution.

She also met activist couple Ekta Shekar Singh and her husband Ravi Shekhar, who were arrested.

“Ekataji’s little daughter (Champak) was waiting for her. They told me everything. Injustice was meted out to them. They were thrown in jail, kept there for 15 days and serious charges were levelled against them.

“I am proud that they struggled and raised their voice for their country. Whatever the government is doing is anti-constitutional,” Priyanka told reporters.

She said the Congress would stand by those arrested for opposing the CAA if her party came to power, all the cases would be withdrawn. She added that the party would help the arrested persons in their legal fight.

10,11-1-20,People’s prince,"Britain’s heart may lie with the ‘hurt’ Queen as Harry & Meghan exit but they are being pragmatic

When Britain’s Prince Harry married American actor Meghan Markle, he had already made the transition from tradition to modernity, casting off his regal aura to be a clutter-breaking, young influencer as a commoner. He made sure that his new wife sported his mother, Princess Diana’s jewels, a tribute to her unassailable appeal as the palace insider who conformed and rebelled in parts and one who is still betted upon by global marketers to keep the House of Tudor relevant ceremonially. And it was this populist aura and her brand ambassadorship that Britain could not and still cannot ignore, using it to sell the royals as part of an exportable culture, attracting tourists, brands and the subsidiary economy of memorabilia and lifestyle markers. By deciding to step back as “senior members of the royal family,” refusing some part of the royal purse that comes from the British public and choosing to run an independent global foundation, Harry and Meghan are pretty much following her footsteps. They are not only reinventing their relevance in a fluid world of images, where icons are being created and destroyed daily, but challenging the stiff upper lip of convention. In that sense, their desire to “carve their own path” with the “aim of becoming financially independent” ought to be lauded. And if they choose a profession to reclaim their destiny on their terms, there is nothing wrong with it. Except they would have to make a clean break then as progressives and not be part-time as they propose now, looking to have the cake and eat it too.

The decision should not have come as a shock to anyone because the young couple has right from the beginning of their relationship been straining at the royal leash. Prince Harry was always a wild child and a non-challenger to the throne. And Meghan was not one to let Harry’s title or Queen Elizabeth II intimidate her. Unlike Kate Middleton, who, too, is not of royal blood but has adhered to the Queen’s strict rules and etiquette, she has broken almost every tradition. Right from public displays of affection to moving out of the Kensington Palace and living in a small cottage, to holding a baby shower and announcing the birth of their son Archie on Instagram, the couple has done it all. The monarchy has long been a financial burden as it costs over £250 million a year to maintain, a figure which is bound to pinch in times of an economic slowdown and spending cuts. This will bite even more once Brexit becomes a reality.

11,11-1-20,Time for a social stock exchange?,"If SSEs could operate in India, they would ensure efficacious sustainable unity of the people, the planet and profits

Since the beginning of the financial year, investments aiming at higher returns along with a socially-desirable environmental impact are being stressed upon. This is why the concept of social entrepreneurship becomes even more relevant, especially in the wake of the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement at the UNFCCC 2015. The precedence varies from the UK, Canada, Mexico, Mauritius, Singapore and Brazil to the USA. The Indian economy, too, has realised the need to shape up entrepreneurship set-ups under Socially Responsible Investments (SRIs). Social enterprises in the country undoubtedly have a tendency to flourish, owing to the fact that India holds one of the highly-developed “social impact” networks among emerging nations. However, there are certain difficulties that such social enterprises deal with, the predominant one being the lack of funding.

In this backdrop, the concept of a Social Stock Exchange (SSE) is quite ground-breaking but definitely not novel. SSEs already function in some arrangements in the UK, Canada, Kenya and Singapore. However, the models may be different. SSEs are understood to be the platform that offers prospective investors opportunities to invest in social enterprises (SEs) so as to facilitate the realisation of welfare objectives in the larger landscape of financial inclusion and clean energy. SSEs are proposed as a key step in achieving the objective of attracting efficient, effective, transparent and scalable capital and investors with the combined elements of crowdfunding, donation, peer-to-peer lending and so on, so as to equip SEs and voluntary organisations with the wherewithal to meet their capital structure requirements. The fundamental question that needs looking into is whether SSEs would work like conventional stock exchanges or be governed by social and green businesses. Globally, it is often debated that the idea behind “impact investing” is that those putting in money can pursue financial returns while also intentionally addressing social and environmental challenges. It is believed that UN SDGs could be an answer to instrumentalise the universal Theory of Change. For the uninitiated, theory of change is a methodology for planning, participation and evaluation that is used in companies, philanthropy, not-for-profit and government sectors to promote social change.

Undoubtedly, SSEs could be considered the response from unconventional actors, namely private fund advisers who foresee real value in the form of a more holistic investment market by entailing viable Social Return on Investments. International markets have already supported bond issuance for social purposes. For instance, green bonds are debt instruments intended to raise funds for projects that have a tangible environmental benefit. Unlike successful precedents internationally, the Indian economy needs to strive even more prudently to accord compliance under environmental, social, governance investment standards. These could be a tailor-made solution to social woes where markets and governments fail. Broadly, such an exchange enables private capital to be mobilised for the public good. Indeed, this requires greater capacity-building on the demand side and education on the supply side of the market, especially in the context of the Indian economy. Additionally, sanctions from all stakeholders including investors, social businesses and the intermediaries become a prerequisite. Moreover, the concept of “impact investing” needs to grow exponentially so as to lure mainstream investors along with incremental incentives for them that could eventually reflect via reduced information and transaction costs. Indubitably, SSEs possess the potential of combining corporate social responsibility, financial prerogatives, venture philanthropy and sustainable development. Despite such a bearing, any sort of global framework that could prove to be the best class benchmarking approach to drive SSEs remains largely absent. The revisited philosophy should travel from responsible investments to sustainable ones to thematic ones to impact first investments. Only then can it realise competitive (social good) returns on the world stage with simultaneous independence from foreign aid. To get this right, enabling conditions and contextual factors should be vigilantly determined in advance towards the successful scaling of ecosystem synergies.

Of course, the regulatory, legal and policy implications of “impact investing” and SSEs should be the key policy agenda. It is vital that the SEBI, while launching the SSE, also comes out with the guiding principles of recruiting capable impact assessors. Worldwide, the SSEs founded so far are building progressively. Yet incremental change can be transformative in providing one mechanism to mobilise more capital for organisations that seek to address many of the current social and environmental problems. Likewise, rules must be put in place to coordinate trading, settlement and clearance to make SSEs a path-breaking move. If SSEs could operate in India, this would ensure efficacious sustainable unity of the people, the planet and profits.

12,11-1-20,Obstacles to outer space taxation,"International cooperation should be encouraged to come up with a global mechanism for space exploitation and all countries must share in management and benefits derived from this

There are various advantages of space exploration as it gives us more information about our solar system, the galaxy and the universe. It gives us access to new raw materials and better understanding of the natural world and so on.

Given the global race to explore and exploit outer space, people are already talking about capturing the rights of taxation on the moon. However, only four countries have attempted to reach it so far, with just three of them being successful.

Taxation on Mars may be decades away but giving it some thought now could give us the early mover advantage as we are heading to the red planet soon. Taxes are going to play a big role in getting to Mars and upon arrival there.

“Space law” was largely formulated in the mid-1960s, when exploration began in earnest. In 1967, the basic treaty governing space law, the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, otherwise known as the “Outer Space Treaty” was concluded.

This treaty, ratified by over 100 countries, including the major space-faring nations, lays down a series of basic rules. However, the Outer Space Treaty does not descend into great detail about space use. For example, while it does have some valuable statements about states being liable for damage caused by objects they launch into space, a principle elaborated upon in a subsequent 1971 treaty, it is largely silent on the commercial use of space.

Commercial exploitation of space has become commonplace and plans for activity beyond our planet are becoming more ambitious by the day. Space is becoming a big business and commercial interests are putting new pressures on the law governing outer space. For instance, billionaires like Elon Musk of SpaceX, Jeff Bezos of Blue Origin, Richard Branson of Virgin Galactic and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, are racing to launch commercial rockets that could take tourists to space. While the exact point at which the territory of states ends and outer space starts is unsettled, there is a significant amount of commercial activity already undertaken and more planned beyond territorial boundaries.

Certain areas are still open to controversies. Such as, in cases where the Moon Agreement (a multilateral treaty that turns jurisdiction of all celestial bodies over to the 11 participating countries) doesn’t apply in the absence of international law, could states adopt unilateral approaches or whether commercial exploitation is possible without an international regime.

Some years ago, Indian courts and tribunals concluded in a series of cases, that a satellite in geostationary orbit does not give rise to a business presence or permanent establishment in India and that payments for the use of transponder capacity do not constitute royalties within Article 12(2) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Treaty.

In the leading case, Asia Satellite Communications Co. Ltd. vs DIT two Hong Kong-owned satellites were in geostationary orbit that was not within Indian orbital slots allocated by the International Telecommunications Union and were not positioned over Indian airspace.

The satellites’ transmission footprints extended over several countries including India. The satellite operator agreed to provide the transponder capacity on the satellites to television broadcasters to relay their programmes to customers in India.

This case sets before us the difficulties of taxation in space, the first issue being the uncertainty over the boundary between space and Earth. While the Outer Space Treaty purports to regulate the use of outer space, it does not define where space begins.

Also, typical tours of duty on the International Space Station are around six months and Valeri Polyakov, a Russian cosmonaut, holds the record, having stayed aboard the Mir space station for more than 14 months. This indicates that it is already realistic for individuals to cease to be residents of any state when they go to work in space. Technological advances will likely extend this ability even further.

If individuals can be so non-resident, then it becomes plausible for companies whose management and control is exercised in space similarly to be residents outside planet Earth.

A concrete example is a situation where you have a satellite owned by one country in orbit over another country providing service to a third country. This clearly raises a number of issues regarding taxation.

Also, advances in technology will facilitate longer periods of extra-terrestrial travel and residence, allowing for the possibility of legal entities to be controlled from space.

As residence in space is an interesting concept and we are trying to extend the theory of “source vs residence” to the moon, satellites and so on, do we have to consider the concept of the source or residence in space?

Where is Martian employment exercised? That is generally the place where you physically undertake the tasks; so if those activities are undertaken outside the territory of any state, what does this mean for taxation?

Another concept that becomes apparent is the issue of permanent establishment. The only reason that a satellite in geostationary orbit is not a permanent establishment is because it is outside the territory of all states. However, if a permanent establishment is not in any state, then it has no relevance for the international tax system. So, no possibility of Permanent Establishments in Geostationary Orbit should be revised.

There is still some uncertainty over how activities in outer space will be treated by taxing authorities.

When we are talking of taxation on the moon and rights of taxation of source of income from the moon, we need to have some authority that will register entities there. Also, the tax authorities don’t have a way to audit you in space. Another question for space-based taxpayers might be, “What’s the appropriate tax year?”

In conclusion, space law does not provide clear answers to many of the basic questions that a tax professional would need to ask in order to evaluate whether outer space activities can be taxed.

International cooperation should be encouraged to come up with a global mechanism for space exploitation and all countries must share in management and benefits derived from this.

There are two possible approaches to it. “Equitable sharing of benefits” that requires a system of international taxation and one where no international norm exists. Whether countries could apply source taxation to business carried out on the moon, whether an entity can transfer its residency to the moon and will OECD adopt the same approach to the moon as it has adopted for the geostationary orbit.

A case of cheating and forgery was registered against the three in Rampur on charges that documents relating to date of birth of Abdullah Khan were forged by them. A notice under Section 82 of the Criminal Procedure Code was issued against the trio last month. The Rampur police have so far registered over 80 cases against Azam Khan, his wife and son.

Also, a local court issued notice to Khan under Section 82 of the CrPC (attachment of property) in two more cases registered last year.

Khan has been asked to appear before the court, failing which an order for attachment of property will be issued against him. Earlier, a non-bailable warrant was issued by the court against Azam Khan, but he could not be arrested.

“In this case, it has been alleged that Abdullah got two separate documents prepared in connection with his date of birth. Today, we made announcement, asking the trio to appear before the court after a notice under Section 82 of the CrPC was issued around 12 days ago. A chargesheet has been filed in the case,” said SHO of Ganj police station, Ramveer Singh.

Official sources said that Khan has been issued notices in two cases as he was not responding to court summons.

The first case was registered against Khan by his neighbour Arif Raza Khan under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.

The second case pertains to violation of model code of conduct during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in which Khan had taken his vehicle inside a polling booth.

Action under Section 82 of the CrPC was initiated against Khan after police submitted to the court that he was not appearing and was not responding to summons.

In another case of violation of model code of conduct, a non-bailable warrant was issued against Khan. In a speech during the poll campaign, Khan had said that no one needs to fear any police or administrative official and had used objectionable language.

18,11-1-20,Action plan sought to save marine ecosystem,"As climate change has become a major challenge in Odisha in general and coastal area in particular, the Citizens Action Forum urged for an urgent sustainable action plan by the Government to address the environmental and economic crisis.

Addressing a conference on ""Industrilasation - Conservation and protection of the Odisha coastal resources "" here, organised by the forum, EB Das, a coastal environmentalist, emphasized on sustainable development in the eco sensitive area of the Odisha coast.

He told that many steel companies were setting up their manufacturing units in the State and want to develop their own captive port to facilitate their import and export activities. But ports are a potential threat to the marine ecology.

Das urged the Government to ensure the safety of the highly endangered Olive Ridley sea turtles, while allowing industrial projects in the Odisha coast.

CR Sahu of the forum, while presiding over the meeting said dredging required to create and maintain the shipping channels at necessary depth in ports too posed a serious threat.

""Development of the port will also lead to an industrialization spree in the area, with the attendant hazards posed by an increased population, lighting, pollution etc. While the port sites itself may not be a nesting ground, the coastal waters are turtle habitat. Along with it there is also a risk of oil spill and water pollution from the oil exploration activities and increased shipping traffic in the region.Though we will be getting a lot in terms of monetary gains and improved lifestyle of the residents of that area but the environmental hazard is also present there, he told urging for a detail action plan on it,"" Sahu told.

He also laid focus on livelihoods of thousands of fishermen in the region, as the construction of the port and dredging in particular could result in the destruction and pollution of breeding and spawning grounds of fish, besides leading to a situation where the fisher folk cannot fish in their own local areas.

""In spite of all these industries will bring the long awaited investment in this area which has been neglected for years. Ones these industries start working they will provide direct and indirect employment to thousands of people from neighbouring areas. The state and central Government will be benefited as well from the revenue theses industries will generate.In view of this, the Government most come forward for a sustainable action plan to protect the ecosystem,"" he told.

Odisha’s coast is subject to extreme tidal variations. Sea levels have been known to rise by about 4 meters in certain stretches, inundating up to 3 km of coastal land. Frequent cyclones cause heavy losses to agriculture and fisheries, while dislocating life for a large number of poor farmers and fishermen. The coast is also subject to a strong littoral drift, causing an estimated 1.5 million tons of sand to move from the southwest to the northeast in a year.Along the 480-km coastline, most of the coastal areas, including tourist resorts, hotels, fishing villages, and towns, are already threatened by recurring storms, flood and severe coastal erosion. In view of this CAF urged for immediate sustainable action plan keeping in few the upcoming industrialisation and infrastructure projects in the coastal area of the State.

19,11-1-20,JNU: Campus politics in ugliest manifestations,"The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) witnessed one of the most unfortunate campus clashes last Sunday, where the Left organisations and the right-wing ABVP, have blamed each other for the violence. But in an interview to journalist Rahul Kanwal, the Vice Chancellor of JNU said, ""All my students are same; I don't distribute them into these camps.""

Then who determines and recognises such distinction between student groups and who sanctions such clashes? What has happened is unfortunate; never was it anticipated to give such a colour to campus politics. Ideological differences ought to be manifested as differences in opinion in intellectual debates, discourses, writings and deliberations but not ugly conflicts as such.

The history of student politics relates to the pre-independence era, when the participation of students was a significant part of the Indian independence movement, right from the Non-Cooperation Movement of the 1920s to the Civil Disobedience Movement in the 1930s. The students were united to oust the British empire in India. Another account of student activism was evident in the 1990s, during the uprising against the Mandal Commission, when Rajeev Goswami, a student from Delhi University, set himself ablaze and sustained critical injuries on September 19, 1990. This incident ignited a nationwide unrest against the Mandal Commission.

In the late 1960s the walls of the factories and streets of France were covered with slogans like, “All power to imagination”, which were raised against capitalism and consumerism, such an unrest was rooted to campus activism. During the same time around 1968 there were widespread protests across the globe against authoritarianism and imperialism, mainly in Germany, Poland, Spain and surprisingly such powerful protests were mainly fuelled by student organisations.

But never had the nature of student politics stooped down to this level of mutual conflict among students themselves, born out of interference by political parties to control power within the premises of educational institutions across the nation. The supposed congeniality of the academic societies thriving within the academic institutions and universities irrespective of the ideological differences, is fast eroding along with academic freedom, freedom of thought and expression, respectful dissent and harmonious convergence of the differences.

The intent of democratic representation of the students in student councils or unions was not intended to instil a parochial political culture, but to groom the students to do meaningful representation of their constituents for bolstering academic activities, addressing student concerns, contributing to enhancing quality of academic research and education and first and foremost to promote generation-next leaders who are responsible, sensitive and have values of constitutionalism and democratic principles.

It was never to promote an era of blood thirsty vandals, who are morally, intellectually and socially bankrupt. Such disturbing it was, when students protested against appointment of Dr Feroze Khan, as Assistant Professor of Sanskrit Vidya Dharam Vigyan department of BHU, because of a fallacious idea of how can a Muslim teach Sanskrit language, which led to his resignation from the post. This is an example of a pathetic attempt to relate knowledge and expertise in a language to a religion. Such intolerance and unreasonable, morally and intellectually hollow demand of the students have besmirched the image of entire Indian student community. These are not isolated incidents but an unfortunate extension of a range of such issues occurring nationwide.

It was for such disturbing trend that Karnataka banned student unions in 1989-90 based on court orders, which held student unions responsible for caste-based violence on campuses and which has not been revoked by any Government since then.

Ideally student bodies shouldn’t be allowed to raise issues which don’t concern the student societies at large from within the campuses, while liberty may be given to participate and raise such issues from other forums. The intent is never to obstruct the exercise of fundamental and primordial human right of freedom of expression but not to allow the possible dissent to transform into an inferno of intolerance that engulfs the campus and deteriorate the academic culture. The sacrosanct objective of academic institutions and universities is to impart quality education and promote meaningful research, to help build robust character, that optimises the net intellectual ability of those receiving education and augments their net contribution to society at large as responsible citizens.

Dissent doesn’t mean intolerance. The protest of Jadavpur University students against Union Minister and singer Babul Supriyo last September and blocking his way into the university was such a disgrace. Universities need to work on instilling in the students the art of listening to dissent and have respectful differences with those who have differing opinions. One doesn’t subscribe to a particular ideology doesn’t mean he or she should stop listening to those who ideologically differ from him or her. Patient hearing of different voices is something which is the hallmark of democracy but what we see these days is an attempt to muzzle the voices of dissent and difference within the university campuses, which is fatal for the future of democracy and speaks volume about the kind of future leaders we are grooming.

It is indispensable for the universities to not to allow any kind of tangible ideological classification among the student community which breeds antagonism and negates fraternity and which is irrational and spoils the spirit of education and research. In any given academic setup, intolerance is a virulent disease, opposing arguments and beliefs shouldn’t be in an ‘anti-body-antigen relationship’, but should be like ‘while I accept your differences with me, you accept mine with you’, else far from producing ‘statesmen’, it shall produce ‘demagogues’. The spirit of enquiry and education shall definitely introduce us to doctrines and beliefs which we may not essentially agree to, but that doesn’t mean we shall behead the one who carries such different view, belief or opinion. On the other hand, knowledge of such different theories of human understanding shall definitely enrich our wisdom. While saying such things, it is not intended to dissect what the Lyngdoh Commission has recommended or courts have observed, but it is more based on what a generation of us has experienced while undergoing years of education and training.

It seems time has come when we say a strict no to campus politics but certainly we may allow value based student activism and democratic representation of students through academic councils and unions.

25,11-1-20,Conspiracy to defame Modi govt: Naqvi,"Union Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that canards being spread over Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) were part of a big political conspiracy to defame the Narendra Modi government.

“The youth are being misled in the name of CAA and NRC. The Congress and Left parties are using university campuses to fulfil their political agenda,” Naqvi told reporters in Lucknow on Friday.

The Union minister said that the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was brought after many amendments. “If this government wanted, it could have got the bill passed in January itself, but we sent it to a Select Committee which cleared it the after that it was passed by Lok Sabha the following day,” he said.

Naqvi said that the development clearly showed that the bill was passed after parliamentary debate and therefore those leaders who were saying that the bill was passed without any discussion were misleading people.

“Those who are opposing it (CAA) do not know that no Indian will be affected by the citizenship law. It has nothing to do with religion, if that person if Indian. Some politicians have given the issue a Hindu-Muslim colour,” Naqvi said.

Replying to a question, the Union minister said that Indian Muslims live here with a commitment, not under compulsion.

“Previously too, some forces had tried to mislead Muslims but they failed to drive a wedge between Hindus and Muslims,” Naqvi said.

The Union minister said that no government wanted violence and therefore, it would not take any step which could lead to unrest in the country.

“The opposition is using this opportunity to defame the government,” he said.

When asked about the controversy over Deepika Padukone starrer ‘Chhapaak’, Naqvi said: “I will also go to watch the movie.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/conspiracy-to-defame--modi-govt--naqvi.html

There are at least six graveyards inside Khariar town and the total land earmarked as Smashan in Government record is about 16 acres. But due to lack of protection and boundary, major parts of the land have been encroached and there is loss of vegetation.

The graveyard located near Tirbandh tank has above nine acres of land, but more than half of it remains under encroachment.

""Hardly one and a half acres of land is now available; the rest has been converted to farm land by people having land adjacent to the Smashan,"" says a resident of that locality, who demands a demarcation and planting of trees in smasan.

""Construction of a boundary is necessary to restrict encroachment,"" he further adds.

The graveyard near Gudel bandh tank has about 90 decimals of land but due to encroachment, the area has shrunk.

Another graveyard with 1.46 acres of land located on the side of the Boden RD road is in a shambles too. People of Gadramunda village and three Wards of Khariar town use the for cremation.

The road side entrance of the graveyard is blocked by illegal constructions. Disposal of waste water and garbage by a liquor distillation unit has turned the smasan waterlogged.

The district authority had allotted Rs 2.5 lakh under Gram Panchayat Development Programme for construction of a shed and sinking of a tube well here in 2016. The work was never taken up as the file went missing.

The graveyards which belong to particular castes or religion have been protected like smasan of the Sahu Samaj or the Kabristan. But the general ones are gradually shrinking.

45,11-1-20,Curtains down on Dhanu Yatra as Kansa killed,"The world famous Dhanu Yatra here ended on Friday night with an open stage pandal playing death of King Kansa at the hands of Lords Krishna and Balaram.

The mighty king finally collapsed on the resplendent pandal of his Ranga Shabha marking the end of the 11-day-long Dhanu Yatra, the biggest open air theatre of the world.

Kansa, after hearing a voice from the heaven about his death and the killer, had taken all precautions to save his life from child Krishna. He killed all the eight children of his sister Devaki. But his death was pre-ordained.

On the invitation of Kansa, two brothers, Krishna and Balaram, had come to Mathura Nagari(Bargarh) for the Dhanu Yatra. Kansa was sure that he would kill the duo as he was unaware of their divine power, and relied more on his muscle power. He fought with them, and was killed. Lord Krishna's incarnation was meant to destroy all the evil forces with the killing of Kansa. Citizens of Mathura heaved a sigh of relief after the demon king’s death. King Ugresan reoccupied the throne.

“Even if the Yatra shows the same event every year, yet we feel it to be totally anew. The experience of the yatra is different and Krishna Bhakti is totally unique,” said some audience. Some State Ministers and Secretaries of various departments paid their visit during the Yatra.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/curtains-down-on-dhanu-yatra-as-kansa-killed.html

55,11-1-20,"MNAC takes steps, asks Jusco to clean, maintain road median","Concern over waste materials dumped on Dimna Road, the gateway to Jamshedpur from NH-33, in Mango the local civic body has started taking steps for cleanliness ahead of the Swachchh Survekshan 2020.

With assessors expected to carry out surprise verification under Union Urban Development Ministry as part of Swachh Survekshan 2020, the Mango Notified Area Committee (MNAC) has written a letter to Jusco senior GM (Jamshedpur Town Operation) Dhananjay Mishra for cleaning and maintenance of the road median.

“We are taking every step to ensure cleanliness in view of the survey. We are taking steps for smooth movement of vehicles on the Dimna Road. During a meeting we came to know that that the nearly 3.5 km long central verge of the Dimna Road has virtually turned dumping yard. The road is maintained by Jusco and today we asked to undertake regular cleaning and maintenance as is being done in other roads in Jamshedpur city under Jusco command area,’ said MNAC special officer Deepak Sahay.

The four-lane Dimna Road, which stretches for 3.5km, is the entry point to the steel city from NH-33 and witnesses a steady flow of heavy vehicles.

The road hosts several business establishments and apartments.

Nearly 50,000 vehicles cross the stretch daily and peak-hour snarls, especially near Mango roundabout where illegal parking is rampant, are a nightmare.

The four-lane New Purulia Road, which links Mango with densely populated areas such as Azadnagar and Jawaharnagar, and hosts popular addresses like Payal Talkies, the State forest guesthouse and Mango police station, witnesses unauthorised parking every day. Congestion woes are similar on Old Purulia Road, which links Mango to Kapali in neighbouring Seraikela-Kharsawan district.

“Moreover the vegetable vendors’ dumps their vegetables while nearby shopkeepers dump their waste inside the central verge.

We have asked Jusco to clean the waste and undertake yellow and black paints on the walls of the central verge as has been done on central verges of roads maintained by Jusco under their command areas,’ said Deepak Sahay.

It may be mentioned that Mango was placed 95 in the Swachh Survekshan 2019 and though serious efforts have been initiated in door-to-door cleaning of waste and other parameters but the Dimna Road littered with waste due to vegetable vendors and residents is yet to be taken care of .The Mango Notified Area Committee (MNAC), offers urban amenities to a population of nearly 3 lakh.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mnac-takes-steps--asks-jusco-to-clean--maintain-road-median.html

58,11-1-20,Cashless health card scheme on anvil for employees,"The Uttarakhand government has decided to restore the benefit of cashless medical care facility for its employees. A proposal in this regard is likely to be brought before the state cabinet soon.

The measure would bring much needed relief for almost three lakhs serving and retired employees of the state government. After the launch of the Atal Ayushman Uttarakhand Yojana (AAUY), the state government had suspended the cash less card scheme, the U health card scheme.

The secretary (in-charge) of medical health and family welfare department, Pankaj Kumar Pandey told The Pioneer that after discussion with the employee organisations and the experts the department has prepared a draft of the cash less scheme.

The issue of the cash less health facility for the government employees was raised by the Congress members during the recent one day special session of Uttarakhand assembly. The employee organisations however are keeping their fingers crossed about the new provisions of the government.

The officiating general secretary of the Rajya Karmchari Sanyukt Parishad (RKSP), Arun Pandey told The Pioneer that the employees want that the benefits similar to the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) should be provided to the employees. He said that the compulsion of the referral from a government hospital to the private hospital should be removed for the employees. Pandey said that treatment in the Out Patient Department (OPD) should also be included in the scheme.

The employees want that the renowned multi-specialty hospitals in private sector should be brought into the panel of the scheme and the practice of referral from the government hospitals should be done away for them.

It is expected that the an annual premium of Rs 4800 would be charged from the employee having grade pay in excess of Rs 6600 while those getting a grade pay of Rs 4200 to Rs 5400, a sum of Rs 3600 per annum is expected to be levied.

60,11-1-20,AAP protests over power tariff hike in Punjab,"Police used water canons on Friday to stop the Aam Aadmi Party workers protesting against the hike in power tariff in Punjab from moving towards chief minister Amarinder Singh's residence here.

The main opposition party also sought scrapping of power purchase agreements signed during previous SAD-BJP regime with private plants.

The protest was led by Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann. Several party MLAs including Harpal Singh Cheema, Kultar Singh Sandhwan and Baljinder Kaur participated in the massive protest.

AAP leaders claimed that party workers sustained injuries because of the water cannon and several party workers were taken into custody by the police.

Power rates in Punjab were increased by 36 paise a unit with effect from January 1 for domestic consumers.

The party leaders alleged that power consumers were being forced to pay between Rs 9 and Rs 12 a unit which was ""much higher"" as compared to electricity rates in other states.

Mann said on the one hand, Punjab which produces own electricity, was selling electricity to consumers at higher rates and on the other hand, the Kejriwal-led government in Delhi, which produces not even a single unit of power, was providing “cheapest” electricity to the people there.The AAP said the Congress before coming to power had promised to review the power purchase agreements but failed to do so despite being in power for more than two and a half years now.AAP leaders also claimed that there had been recurring hike in electricity rates allegedly because of the pressure of the private power companies.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aap-protests-over-power-tariff-hike-in-punjab.html

82,11-1-20,‘Dogs’ birth control drive in city a failure’,"The Animal Birth Control (ABC) Dogs programme, which has been undertaken in the BMC area for the last 15 years jointly by the BMC and the Sahid Nagar Veterinary clinic, looks to be an unsuccessful drive.

This is evident from the fact that many dogs are dying in accidents in the city every day. The stray dog population has risen alarmingly.

“We are getting daily calls from public about the death of puppies, dogs due to accident in different manner. Due to over population, the man-animal conflict is mounting. People are also killing dogs and puppies by beating, kicking, overriding with an idea that they are dangerous for them. This is happening only due to failure of the programme,” said People for Animal secretary Jiban Ballav Das.

He said the ABC(Dogs) programme is violating laws in many ways. Though the BMC Commissioner and Secretaries of the Urban Development and Fisheries and Animal Resources Department have been appraised many times, nobody has taken the issue seriously.

“The dogs taken for sterilisation are not being given proper post operation care and food for which many dogs are also dying,” he said.

Claiming that the concerned officer came under a departmental inquiry for serious lapses, Das said there are many factors for the failure of the programme.

He demanded that the ABC (Dogs) programme be brought under the 5T initiative for its successful implementation and transparency.

“I have written to 5T Secretary VK Pandian requesting him to bring the ABC (Dogs) programme under the 5T initiative,” Das said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---dogs----birth-control-drive-in-city-a-failure---.html
83,11-1-20,NHRC asks State Govt for report in 4 weeks,"The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has sought an action-taken report (ATR) from the Chief Secretary on sexual exploitation of minor girls, especially those belonging to SC and ST communities, in Odisha.

Acting on a petition filed by rights activist and lawyer Radhakanta Tripathy, the NHRC has sought the report within four weeks. In his petition Tripathy cited incidents in which many minor school students who got pregnant in the SC and ST Schools in 2018 and 2019.

On March 2015, basic human rights of 17 sexually harassed girls were violated as the then SC & ST Development Minister Lal Bihari Himirika had disclosed their names and addresses in the State Assembly.

The State runs more than 1,000 ashram or sevashram schools and they together teach more than three lakh students. Most of these students stay in these hostels free of cost.

Tripathy alleged that the failure of the SC and ST Development, School and Mass Education and Women and Child Development Departments and the State police in acting on the issue and checking crimes against minor girls, especially the schoolchildren, amounts to serious violation of human rights. No health checkup of the students is another serious issue, Tripathy alleged.

Tripathy also requested the NHRC to monitor preventive and punitive actions taken by the State authorities, including health officials, and to take legal action against the errant officials, elected representatives, culprits. He urged the commission to ask the Government to pay a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to each victim under the Nirbhaya Scheme or under the Victim Compensation Scheme, POCSO Act, and rehabilitate all the victims.

84,11-1-20,Masked hoodlums ransack shops in city,"Panic gripped the Market Building area in the city on Friday evening when a group of hooligans wearing masks went on a rampage ransacking many shops and attacking vendors.

According to reports, 20 to 25 armed miscreants arrived at the marketplace at around 6.30 pm and started vandalising makeshift food and stationary item stalls. They also thrashed several vendors before fleeing the spot.

Some injured shopkeepers were admitted to the Capital Hospital.

Though the reason behind the attack was yet to be ascertained, it was suspected that the incident might have been a fallout of a dispute between a vendor and a buyer which had taken place on Thursday.

“A heated exchange of words took place between me and a customer yesterday when he was buying some items from my shop. Though the matter was settled at the Capital police station, I suspect involvement of the customer and his associates in the attack,” the vendor said.

Police were deployed at the spot to avert any further untoward incident while efforts were on by cops to identify and nab the assailants.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/masked-hoodlums-ransack-shops-in-city.html
85,11-1-20,‘Plaint unlikely to affect Dhullu’s membership’,"The demand for cancelling the membership of Baghmara legislator Dhullu Mahto from Assembly has gained momentum after former Bokaro Industrial Area Development Authority (BIADA) chairman and social activist Bijay Kumar Jha submitted an application to Jharkhand Assembly Speaker Ravindra Nath Mahto to take action in this connection. Jha citing the decision of the Constitution Bench of five judges of the Supreme Court canceling the election of a Kerala legislator has stated that the same can be done with Mahto too.

Jha, in his application, has stated that Mahto in different cases has been sentenced to jail term upto 72 months. As per Jha’s application since the Supreme Court has cancelled an MLA's election in a Kerala case, Dhullu Mahato's membership should end on the same basis. He has said that if any person is sentenced to more than two years in any case, then he is not eligible to contest elections. Jha has also attached a copy of the Supreme Court's decision against Kerala MLA P Jayarajan in the year 2005.

Jha has also drawn the attention of Speaker to the provision of section 8 (3) of the Representation of People Act, 1951, which states that while fixing the 'minimum two years' sentence, the entire sentence given to the person will be seen to be added. In this way, Dhullu Mahto may not have been sentenced to more than two years in one case, but the punishment awarded to him in different cases is 72 months i.e. 6 years which means that he is not eligible to contest elections or the membership should be canceled.

However, legal experts claim that it is not easy for Assembly to terminate the membership of Mahto as he is no serving jail term of three or more than three years in a single case. Ranchi High Court senior advocate, PPN Roy said, “If a person (lawmaker) is sentenced to imprisonment for a period less than three years in a single case than in no case his membership will be terminated. Also the entire sentence given to the person in different cases will not be added in deciding the membership of the person.”

Mahto is facing serious charges of extorting money from labourers and hard coke factory owners, is three term MLA representing Baghmara Assembly seat.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---plaint-unlikely-to-affect-dhullu---s-membership---.html

Therefore, the responsibility of the Bharatiya Janata Party workers increases. Opposition party leaders are misleading people about the Citizenship Amendment Act due to vote bank politics. People of Muslim community are being misled,” former Chief Minister Raghuvar Das said at Bihar Sharif addressing BJP workers as part of Bharatiya Janata Party's Jan Jagran Abhiyan on Citizenship Amendment Act.

He said that people of any caste and religion living in India will not be affected by this law. “The Citizenship Amendment Act will give Indian citizenship to the oppressed people of Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Persian, Buddhist, Jainism living in neighbouring countries Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh. This law has been brought in these Islamic countries to give asylum to India due to persecution of minority on the basis of religion,” he added.

Das said that this was also mentioned in the BJP's resolution letter. The BJP knows to fulfill its resolve. But, the people of the Opposition party are working to spread hatred in the country due to cheap politics. Keeping this in mind, the BJP leadership has launched a mass awareness campaign across the country. With the help of campaign, people are helping to clear the confusion. People are getting very good support, said the former CM.

Earlier, Das launched a public awareness campaign in the area. Under this, people went door to door and gave information related to the Citizen Amendment Act.

88,11-1-20,Congress seeks ‘Chhapaak’ to be tax free in Jharkhand,"Taking cue from other Congress ruled States, Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee (JPCC) on Friday demanded that Dipika Padukone starrer ‘Chhapaak’ should be made tax free in the State. The Meghna Guljar directed movie facing controversy had a nationwide release on Friday.

All three Congress ruled states - Chief Minister Kamal Nath led Madhya Pradesh Government, Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel led Chhattisgarh Government and Ashok Gehlot led Rajasthan Government - announced the movie to be tax free in their respective states before the release of the movie.

JPCC Working president, Rajesh Thakur said that the movie is about victims of acid attacks and such kinds of movies should be watched by more and more audiences because such kinds of movies have social impact. “This is not matter of controversy that Padukone visited Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), where she stood in solidarity with the students injured in last week’s vicious mob attacks that left around 35 students injured,” he added.

“Such kind of film gives social impacts on various social menaces like acid attacks and violence against women. Governments should promote such kinds of film across the country to eradicate such kinds of activity from society. Only supporting the injured students should not be issue to discourage movie like ‘Chhapaak’. Activist of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthy Parisad (ABVP) are opposing the movie is not appropriate. By doing this they are encouraging incident like Acid Attacks,” said Thakur.

Department of Women and Child Development, Government of Punjab also made arrangement for special screening of movie ‘Chhapaak’ in Zirkapur for victim of acid attack. Samajwadi Party (SP) National president and former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh (UP), Akhilesh Yadav also made arrangement for the party workers to watch the movie on its screening on Friday. He himself will watch the movie on its screening along with the party workers.

“Now a day people don’t have issues to talk on like debilitating economy and eradicating jobs, they only talks on, such kinds of controversies raised to divert people’s attention from basic issues like education, health and others,” said Thakur.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/congress-seeks----chhapaak----to-be-tax-free-in-jharkhand.html
89,11-1-20,JPA wants Govt intervention in violence against cops,"The Jharkhand Police Association (JPA) has sought Government’s intervention in addressing the recent spurt in incidents of mob attacks on police forces. An official communiqué from JPA – in the wake of a recent attack on a police team in Pakur – on Friday urged the Government to take notice of the incident and keep any form of direct or indirect political influence from affecting police investigation.

“We request the Government to take decisive measures in addressing the disturbing trend of mob attacks on police teams and take stringent actions against the people involved in instigating innocent villagers to take up arms against the police,” said the communiqué from JPA. “Any political party involved in such practices, too, should not be allowed to influence police investigation either directly or indirectly,” the communiqué added.

On Tuesday, a police team was thrashed by an infuriated mob under Littipara Police Station in Pakur during the course of an arresting. The team had visited a place near Littipara More to arrest one Babudhan Marandi on charges of looting, when he cried for help and fellow villagers subsequently attacked the police team. The mob also torched a police vehicle and caused severe injuries to an Assistant Sub Inspector, Ramesh Kumar Singh.

Mob violence has emerged as one of the major concerns of the Government in Jharkhand lately. According to figures with the State police, as many as 39 cases of mob lynching have been reported in Jharkhand so far. And at least 51 people have been convicted in four cases of mob lynching reported in Jharkhand, say police records. In the recent past, police too have fallen prey to the wrath of mobs in Jharkhand. Several cops were held captive and allegedly thrashed during the Pathalgadi movement in Khunti. Besides, on many instances, villagers had turned hostile during arresting, police said.

“We condemn all forms of violence against policemen. Such attacks have to stop. How will we undertake our responsibilities and do our duties when such attacks are not dealt with sternly?” said Yogendra Singh, Secretary, JPA.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jpa-wants-govt-intervention-in-violence-against-cops.html

Paying tribute to Justice Shahdeo, Ranchi Mayor Asha Lakra said that when

Justice Shahdeo was arrested in the course of separate Jharkhand movement, it had happened in the first time in the history of the Country that a former High Court judge was arrested during any movement.

A strong supporter for the formation of a separate State of Jharkhand, Late Justice LPN Shahdeo was also the first former High Court Judge to be arrested in 1998-99 for leading the agitation for a separate State.

It was then that BJP, JMM, AJSU, Congress- a total of 16 political parties came together to start the movement and formed the ‘All Party Separate State Formation Committee’. Coming from a non political background, Justice Shahdeo was elected as the convener of the committee.

Justice Shahdeo was always a strong supporter of a separate State and upon retiring from the High Court in 1992 he continued to support the movement through his writings in local newspapers and public forums.

Justice Shahdeo was born on January 3, 1930 in Kaamta village of Latehar district. He did his primary education in a Government school and completed his matriculation from Balkrishna High School, Ranchi.

91,11-1-20,Various plans announced in MCD board meet,"Dehradun mayor Sunil Uniyal 'Gama' made some major announcements during the board meeting of the Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD). He announced that the newly created wards in suburban and rural areas will have a budget of Rs 15 lakh whereas the city wards will get Rs 10 lakh for development works.

He also announced that widows will be given relaxation in house tax while leprosy patients will not have to pay house tax at all. Further, the board also passed proposals to allocate land to the state government for building of Sanya Dham and setting up a Rs five crore fixed deposit to facilitate payment of wages of the sanitation workers.

Talking about increasing the MCD’s source of income, he stated that the corporation will build some hotels, petrol pump and gas agencies after finalising land for these projects. Such endeavours will help to make the corporation financially more secure.

For public welfare, a 100-bed hospital and open gyms will be built in all the wards besides the opening of Skill Development Centre where youth can learn new skills and can get new opportunities. The plan for the construction of a sports academy will be executed too to promote sports among the youngsters of Doon.

As councillors said that information boards on construction sites are not that noticeable, it was decided that from now on the boards will comprise of red letters on a yellow background. Councillors of almost every ward put their issues before the house.

The most common issues of the councillors were ill-managed and open garbage bins, wandering stray cattle, monkey menace in the suburban and rural areas, lack of public toilets and insufficient number of sanitation workers.

Many proposals were also kept on hold in the meeting like the relaxation on property tax on the properties of Shri Guru Ram Rai Education Mission.

However the proposal of changing the names of Saharanpur Chowk to Teerthankar Bhagwan Mahavir Chowk, Darshini Gate to Shri Guru Ram Rai Darshini Gate and Laalpul Chowk to Shri Mahant Indiresh Chowk were passed by the board.

Another important issue raised by the board members was the large sums of money demanded by eunuchs from citizens on special occasions. The councillors demanded that a sum be fixed for this purpose but this was rejected.

The councillors demanded that fixed amounts be set for eunuchs so that they don’t demand more money forcing people to pay more than they can actually afford.

However, the mayor said that a committee will be formed to take a decision on this. The eunuchs will also be consulted before a decision is taken in this matter so that they do not feel as if they have been treated unfairly. During deliberation on the level of sanitation and lack of sanitation workers, the board decided to set up an annual FD of Rs five crore.

The annul interest from this will be used to pay the wages of sanitation workers. Additionally, approval was also granted for increasing the number of sanitation workers allocated for the new wards in suburban and rural areas.The board also passed the proposal for transferring municipal land near Canal Road to the state government for building Sanya Dham to honour the martyrs of Uttarakhand. In addition, Shaheed Dwaar will also be constructed to commemorate the valour of martyrs.

In another decision expected to help in improving the level of sanitation in the city, the board passed the proposal for penalising people who throw trash in public places.

The mayor said that this will make people more aware of cleanliness and a special authority will help to do the task efficiently.

However, the municipal corporation will make sure that no misuse of power is indulged in by the organisation to which the task of penalising is handed over.

He also suggested that the councillors should take out a mini-rally every fifteen days with the school students to spread awareness regarding cleanliness and hygiene.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/various-plans-announced-in-mcd-board-meet.html
92,11-1-20,"Two drones recovered, 3 Pak handlers held","Punjab Police on Friday seized two highly sophisticated Chinese-made drones used for smuggling drugs from Pakistan. The seizures, from Modhe village in Amritsar and another from Karnal in Haryana, were made after the Police arrested three Pak handlers, including a serving Army soldier and two drug smugglers belonging to a narco-terror module.

Announcing this, the state DGP Dinkar Gupta said that the module is involved in smuggling of weapons and narcotics across the border, and the seizures were the result of targeted and intelligence-led search operations.

Along with the two drones, the police has also recovered 12 drone batteries, custom-made drone containers, two walkie-talkie sets, Rs 6.22 lakh in cash, one i20 car, believed to be proceeds of drugs, and the magazine of an INSAS rifle.

The three arrested were identified as Dharminder Singh from Dhanoa Khurd village in Amritsar, Rahul Chauhan of Ambala Cantt in Haryana, and Balkar Singh of Kalas village in Amritsar (Rural).

While Dharminder Singh was arrested from Hardo Rattan village, about 3 km from the India-Pakistan border, Balkar Singh had been lodged in Amritsar Jail in a NDPS case and was brought on production warrant.

Haryana’s Chauhan, an army man, was reportedly involved in procuring and supplying drones and training to cross-border smugglers.

DGP said that the two members of the narco-terror module were still absconding and efforts were on to nab them. Further investigations were underway to ascertain details about the accused ties with terrorist outfits, radicals, drug smugglers and other anti-national elements, he added.

Gupta said that the drones, capable of travelling two to three kms on either side of the border, were reportedly being launched from the Indian side to fly into Pakistan to pick up payloads of narcotics. They had apparently already conducted four to five sorties, he added.

“This is the first documented case where drones have been used to smuggle narcotics,” said the DGP while addressing the media along with ADGP (Internal Security) RN Dhoke, IG Border Range SPS Parmar, and Tarn Taran SSP Dhruv Dhaiya.

“Since August, there are in all three documented cases of drones bringing supply. Earlier, the drones carried the weapons, but this is the first documented case of drone carrying narcotics,” said the DGP adding that no drugs had yet been recovered.

According to the DGP, the module members had revealed that they were involved in cross-border smuggling of drugs and weapons over drones over the past few months. Certain Pakistan-based drug smugglers, who were sending the drugs and weapons from across the border in Pakistan, had also come to notice, he added.

Preliminary investigations had confirmed that Rahul Chauhan was directly involved in operating drone sorties across the border for picking up heroin as well as weapons from Pakistan, along with his associates in India and Pakistan.

“He and his accomplices were in direct contact with Pakistani smugglers on encrypted OTT platforms,” said the DGP, adding that the plan was to send one of the walkie-talkie sets across the border to Pakistan to facilitate two-way communication.

“The first drone, a Chinese made DJI INSPIRE 2 drone (Quadcopter) was recovered from an abandoned government Dispensary building in Modhe village in Amritsar (Rural), where it had been hidden by Dharminder Singh and his associate drug smugglers.

The second drone, a Chinese made DJI MATRICE 600 PRO (Hexacopter), was recovered from a house in Karnal (Haryana) on the disclosures of Rahul Chauhan.

Gupta said that the Punjab Police had launched a covert operation to ensure close monitoring and checking of the border areas in view of the recent influx of weapons and drugs across the border through drones as well as other means.

“Special nakas had been set up in the border areas as part of these special operations to focus on suspicious activities on the border as well as the possible collusion among drug and weapon smugglers, cross-border gun-runners, radicals etc,” he said.

It was during this special operation that the police gathered inputs that one Balkar Singh, who was lodged in Amritsar Jail in a NDPS case, was smuggling drugs and weapons using drones, along with his associates.

Following such inputs, a case was registered at Police Station Gharinda of Amritsar (Rural) and special teams were formed of officers of the Amritsar (Rural) Police district to operationalise the intelligence leads, said the DGP.

The state police chief pointed that the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had already expressed concern over the recent drone activity along the border, which first came to light in August 2019 post abolition of Article 370, and had raised the issue with the central government, seeking close monitoring by central agencies and forces.

The Central Government has already issued SOPs for use of drones, which, with their ability to fly low without lights and their minimal engine noise, can also be used to target VIPs.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/two-drones-recovered--3-pak-handlers-held.html

""What kind of a political party is (BJP) if it is easily intimidated by and fears certain films that trigger a sense of social responsibilities among people and other important issues such as education,"" he said.

The senior AAP leader also hit out at the BJP for criticism over induction of five-time MLA Shoaib Iqbal into the party fold, saying if there are any criminals in the AAP, then put them behind bars. ""The Delhi Police has been under the Centre for the past six years and if Iqbal has committed any crime then he should be arrested and put in jail,"" he said.

""If any AAP leader or anyone joining the party is a murder accused, then the BJP should be ashamed that he is free and outside jail. For six years, Delhi Police has been under you (BJP). Arrest him and put him in jail. If you can't run Delhi Police, then leave it. We will run it and show,"" he said, adding that and if there is any murderer in our party or your party, we will put him behind bars,""

Alleging that the civic body-run schools in Delhi are made to operate with only 57 per cent of the sanctioned teachers strength, the Union Housing and Urban Affairs minister took a swipe at the AAP Government's education model, saying, ""They call this a success.""

""It (AAP Government) has failed to reimburse Rs 3,941 cr to North MCD, Rs 569 cr to East MCD & Rs 223 cr to South MCD. As a result, the MCDs have been unable to pay salaries, seventh central pay commission arrears and other benefits to the teachers. The schools operate with only 57 per cent of teachers... They call this a success,"" Puri tweeted.

In a series of tweets, Puri said ""it is appalling how Delhi govt claims success in the education system where none exists"". ""They have craftily built a fake narrative to divert attention from their failures. Pass percentages of students have steadily declined. They are imperilling the future of the children,"" Puri tweeted.

""Students are not able to realise their full potential because only 1/3rd of these schools offer science streams. What is even more alarming is that State Govt policies have forced several pvt schools to close down, leaving students without choice of science stream. Amongst secondary school students alone, it has come down from 99.4 per cent in 2014 to 68.9 per cent in 2018. Is this something they are proud of? Learning outcomes of classes 3,5 & 8 are nearly 10 percentage points lower than the national average & they call this a success story,"" he tweeted.

102,11-1-20,"Haryana CM counters his HM, says past CMs also held CID charge","Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday said the CID remained under the CM’s charge during the terms of Bansi Lal and Devi Lal, an assertion that appears to counter the Home Minister’s claim over the department.

Khattar, however, sought to play down the row over who is in charge of the important Criminal Investigation Department (CID), the State Government’s intelligence gathering agency.

“It is not a big issue. It is a technical issue. We will find some way out in that technical issue and we have discussed this matter,” Khattar told reporters in Panchkula.

“It is not that this has happened for the first time. During the Chaudhary Devi Lal regime, the Home Ministry was given to Sampat Singh. At that time also, the CID and vigilance departments were held by the CM,” he said.

“Similarly, when Mani Ram Godara was made the home minister, Bansi Lal did the same thing,” he said, adding there were examples from some other States as well.

“There is a technical lacuna and this problem will be solved by removing that technical lacuna,” the Chief Minister said.

Earlier this week, Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij had taken exception to two State Government websites that showed that the CID was held by Khattar.

""Governments are not run by websites. They are run by the rule of law,"" Vij had said on Wednesday.

Vij had asserted that according to the Business of Haryana Government (Allocation) Rules, 1974, the CID was part of the home department.He said this allocation can be changed, but cited procedure which he claimed must be

followed.

“The CM is supreme and, if he wishes, he can also change it. But for that, it has to be passed by the Cabinet and then later in Vidhan Sabha,” Vij had said.Later, the State Government removed the content showing the CID among the CM's portfolios from the websites.

The Haryana Chief Minister holds 17 different portfolios at present.

The home portfolio, along with other ministries like health and urban local bodies, was allotted to Anil Vij after the Bharatiya Janata Party-Jannayak Janta Party came to power last year.

Earlier, Vij had pulled up the CID for allegedly not sharing information sought by him on the Assembly polls and also marked a dissent note to the Chief Minister over the transfer of nine IPS officers without taking him into confidence.

Vij had also formed a three-member committee to suggest improvements in the CID’s functioning.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/haryana-cm-counters-his-hm--says-past-cms-also-held-cid-charge.html

At least 18 incidents of sedition were reported in Jharkhand in 2018 – the highest in the country, the NCRB report said.

On the other hand, J& K – a State, now a Union Territory, infamous for presence of separatist forces – reported only 12 cases of sedition, the report added.

Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which deals with sedition, States, ‘Whoever, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards,

the Government established by law in India shall be punished with imprisonment for life, to which fine may be added,’ According to the NCRB report, as many as 20 incidents of offences against the State were reported in Jharkhand in year 2018, and 22 cases were reported in J&K in the same year.

While Jharkhand and J&K hardly share any topographical similarity or cultural proximity, the two places have had their share of insurgency. The cries of ‘Azadi (freedom)’ have reverberated in the valley since years now giving rise to rebellions. On the other hand, the former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led Governments in Jharkhand have been battling Left Wing Extremism (LWE) with an iron fist.

The Pathalgadi movement in Jharkhand, which has its epicenter in Khunti, advocated the idea of having liberated lands in the interiors where the administration’s interventions were prohibited.

In 2017, villagers in parts of Khunti district held Pathalgadi –a practice of demarcating the borders of a village and declaring it as liberated land through writings on stone plaques – and allegedly prohibited entry of the administration in their villages. Soon after coming to power in the end of 2019, Chief Minister Hemant Soren announced that cases against Pathalgadi supporters will be scrapped.

As per the NCRB report, as many as 69 incidents of sedition were reported in India in 2018, and 47 of them were reported from Jharkhand, Jammu & Kashmir and Assam together. A total of 17 cases were reported in Assam – another State battling insurgency, illegal immigrants and lack of development. Assam also had the highest number of individuals accused of offences against the state.

The total number of sedition cases in India has increased by almost 50 per cent from 2017 to 2018, the NCRB report said. In 2017, as many as 51 cases of sedition were reported in the country. The number of sedition cases has witnessed a steep increase. In 2015, a total of 30 sedition cases were filed in India and the number increased to 35 in 2016.

Jharkhand witnessed only one case of sedition in 2017, which means that the number of cases has increased 18 times in a year.

120,11-1-20,The way forward,"Growth and success of the State depends upon several factors. Increase in productive capacity, adaptive utilization of technology, enhancement in employment and income, improvement in health and medical facilities, innovation in all spheres of socio-economic life, creating a disciplined society under the umbrella of law & order and above all, achieving a harmony between economic and social environment of the people denotes higher satisfaction and all-round development of the State. Jharkhand has had a clear mandate for social harmony and ushering in a new era of trust, bonhomie and growth with equity and social justice, not to forget the socio-cultural rights and expectations of the local inhabitants.

As far as pure economic growth is concerned, there cannot be two opinions about the fact that increase in production andproductivity to provide goods and services to the population is an absolute must forthe satisfaction of basic human wants and needs. This presupposes creation of basic infrastructure and setting up of new industries to fill up the glaring gaps in the economy. Enhancement of productive capacity through investment in key areas, hence, is a basic need of growing economies. Many economies that do not build their own economic base and focus on getting doles and grants from abroad have to pay a heavy price when these supplies are cut. The logic behind self-sufficiency is hence a sound one and shields the economy from collapse in times of emergency.

Use of innovation and technology to solve human problem is virtually the saga ofhow the human race has overcome challenges and vexatious problems that stared itin its face. Technology gave us the lever to unlock and master the problems that confronted us. A century and half ago, all the current facilities would seem like a dream. But humans dreamt it, planned for solving the problem and made it happen.

Nonetheless, all growth is meaningless if the poor people remain deprived of the basic necessities of life and if the fruits of technology development and economic growth do not reach them. The concept of sustainable development and selection of 17 sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the UN clearly points out that economic progress per se is futile if the basic development of human-folk around the globe is neglected.

“Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth... these are one and the same fight. We must connect the dots between climate change, water scarcity, energy shortages, global health, food security and women's empowerment. Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all.” - Ban Ki-Moon, Former UN Secretary General.

The complainant took a postpaid connection of the company from the said outlet in November 2015. The said connection was closed in the first week of December. When contacted, the local representative said that the amount paid online had not been accepted so the same should be paid again.

The representative assured the mobile phone would be operational by evening. But the complainant returned the SIM to the local representative when the service did not resume.

The local representative had told that he would get the security amount and the amount of the deposit bill back after three months.

But the complainant did not receive the amount within the stipulated period. After this, the complainant went to the local representative on not getting the fixed amount. The official reportedly deferred saying that he would meet the network company.

It was alleged that neither the security amount nor the deposit bill amount was returned to him by the company manager and his local representative.

Disappointed, the complainant approached the consumer forum.

After hearing the complaint of the victim, the forum ordered both of them to refund the security and bill amount, finding them guilty of lack of consumer service and negligence.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/consumer-forum-finds-telecom-company-negligent.html

123,11-1-20,‘Actress chose to stand with those who wanted destruction of India’,"Wading into the controversy of Bollywood star Deepika Padukone’s visit to Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Union Minister Smriti Irani on Friday said the actress had made her political affiliations known way back in 2011 and that she has a right to do.

Having said so, Irani then lashed out at the actor saying she chose to stand next to people who wanted the “destruction of India”.

Padukone on Tuesday made a surprise visit to the JNU to express solidarity with students who were attacked by a masked mob inside the campus on January 5. She did not address the public meeting but stood silently with the student leaders. Earlier this week, she was in Delhi also to promote her latest release “Chhapaak”, based on the life of acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal.

Bollywood, which hardsells itself, was split on the issue of student unrest and violence in university campuses as also CAA and NRC with one side opposing the Modi Government and the other backing it.

According to Irani, Padukone had made her political affiliations known in 2011 itself when she praised Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and called him a suitable candidate for the post of the Prime Minister.

“I think I would rather know what her political affiliation is than not know. I think that anybody who has read the news knew where you are going to stand... (They) knew that you are going to stand with people who wanted the destruction of India, knew that you are standing with people who celebrate every time a CRPF jawan is killed,” Irani said at an event hosted by The New Indian Express in Chennai on Thursday evening.

The video of the minister’s remarks was posted on the publication’s Twitter handle.

“... They hit some girls on their private parts with ‘lathis’. So she stood next to them. That is her right. I can’t deny her that right. She will stand next to people who will beat up other girls, who don’t see eye-to-eye ideologically, in private parts. That’s her freedom. She made her political affiliation known in 2011 that she supports the Congress party,” the minister said.

The Textiles minister added that people who admired the Bollywood star’s work are in shock over her decision to visit the JNU campus.

“I think the problem that has happened is that a lot of people are in shock. They didn’t know. There were a lot of people who were admirers and possibly watched many of her films and for them it was a shock,” she said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---actress-chose-to-stand-with-those-who-wanted-destruction-of-india---.html

126,11-1-20,"Didi-Modi meet likely on Govt fete sidelines, Opp frowns","There may be two meetings between Prime Minister Narendra and Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee when the former arrives in Kolkata on a two-day official visit in State Capital on Saturday, Nabanna (State secretariat) sources said on Friday.

Mamata who has been leading the movement against the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act taking out multiple rallies in Bengal besides launching a fierce diatribe against the BJP Government following attack on JNU students, on Friday accepted the invite extended to her by Union Minister of State for Shipping Mansukh Laxmanbhai Mandaviya.

Moments before visiting the Chief Minister, the Union Minister said, “Prime minister, Narendra Modi, Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will be inaugurating the 150-years’ celebration of KoPT.”

Dhankhar who has no love lost between him and the Chief Minister often taking potshots at her Government will also be on the dais alongside the Modi and Mamata.

The Prime Minister is coming to Kolkata to inaugurate 150-year celebrations of the Kolkata Port Trust which will take place on Sunday. But before they meet on Sunday the two leaders may have a one-on-one parley sometime on Saturday evening at the Raj Bhavan where the Prime Minister will put up, sources said.

While there was no disclosure on the agenda of talks, sources said the Chief Minister may raise certain crucial issues regarding the State. The meeting between the two leaders assumes significance against the backdrop of the anti-CAA movement as also the Chief Minister’s public stand against recent the attack on Left wing students inside the Jawaharlal Nehru University campus in Delhi.

With both the TMC and BJP sources remaining tight-lipped about the upcoming meeting in the current circumstances, the Opposition Left and the Congress lapped up the opportunity questioning the timing of the talks between the two leaders.

“The time of the meeting is significant,” said former CPI(M) MP Samik Lahiri. “Does it not look extraordinary for the two leaders to meet at a juncture when they and their respective parties are publicly at loggerheads? Does it also not look suspicious when the Chief Minister who is launching huge public rallies against the CAA and who is sending TMC delegation to JNU to protest against attack on students also meets the Prime Minister in the sidelines of a government programme?” he asked.

Pradesh Congress president Somen Mitra too questioned the timing of her meeting the Prime Minister, “particularly after Mamata Banerjee dropped out of the all-party-anti-BJP meeting called by our party president Sonia Gandhi in Delhi.” CPI(M) politburo member Md Salim asked whether “Didi’s skipping the meeting in Delhi and meeting Modi in Kolkata are related… the people have already started questioning her suspicious meetings with the Prime Minister and Home Minister Amit Shah.”

Reminding how the CBI went soft on former Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar — who is being probed for his dubious role in the multi-crore Sharada chit fund scam — and allowed him to get bail — giving a hot chase for sometime in last November, soon after an unscheduled meeting between Didi and Modi and then Didi and Shah, the CPI(M) leader said “this time public eye will be on Mamata Banerjee. She will be scrutinised for each of her acts.”

Meanwhile, following intelligence reports that the Opposition Left and the Congress might show black flags to the Prime Minister in Kolkata and in an apparent bid to avoid public face off the security agencies have reportedly decided to take the Prime Minister not via road but via river route, sources said.

The Intelligence Branch had submitted a report to the State stating that as many as three organisations are planning large-scale gatherings at the airport and on the roads and show black flags to the Prime Minister.

According to a senior official of the State Government, the authorities have planned to “sanitise” the route slated to be taken by the Prime Minister's convoy to take to reach the city from the airport keeping in mind the possibility of protesters against CAA and NRC showing black flags and putting up blockades. The official said the roadmap was planned considering that the prime minister is scheduled to arrive at a time when light will not be favourable to fly him to the city in a helicopter.

“We have planned foolproof arrangements for the scheduled visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

129,11-1-20,‘BJP using nationalism as weapon to divide people’,"Accusing the Narendra Modi Government of using nationalism as a “weapon” to divide people, patron of Loktantrik Janata Dal, Sharad Yadav, on Friday said it believes in “we the BJP people” to be part of the Constitution and not “we the people of India”.

Addressing the national executive of the Loktantrik Janata Dal, Yadav alleged that the BJP has deployed the plank of nationalism to paint those who attacked students in JNU as patriots while the victims have been criticised, and has been using it to divide society on religious lines.

He said the Constitution was never under so much danger as it is now as the ruling BJP after retaining power has launched a strong attack on its core values.

“The BJP does not believe in ‘we the people of India’ but in ‘we the BJP people of India’ as part of our Constitution. It is using the issue of nationalism as a weapon. It wants to divide people on Hindu and Muslim lines. But student protests have showed that its efforts have failed,” Yadav said.

The preamble of the Constitution begins with the assertion, “We, the people of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic...”

Referring to protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and other citizenship measures, Yadav asserted that the amended citizenship law, National Population Register and the planned National Register of Citizens are linked while claiming that India was never so restless in a long time as it is now.

He asked the party’s workers to fight for the Constitution, saying the poor got a say in the affairs of the country only after 1947 due to the values encapsulated by the Constitution, which was adopted in 1950.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---bjp-using-nationalism-as-weapon-to-divide-people---.html

132,11-1-20,"ISIS kills Tamil Nadu cop, escapes to Kerala","The murder of special sub inspector of police Wilson (56) on late Wednesday night at the Kaliyikkavala check post in the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border has sent shockwaves across the law enforcement agency. Wilson, who was on official duty was checking the credentials of the travellers, who were on their way to Nagercoil in a sports utility vehicle when he was shot at by the occupants of the car.

Though he was rushed to the nearest Government hospital, doctors declared him brought dead. The vehicle sped away leaving the other cops on duty bewildered and shocked. A massive hunt is on to identify the killers of Wilson.

The Government Of Tamil Nadu has entrusted the investigation of the crime to the Q branch of State Police which has zeroed in on a team of self styled Islamic State (IS) activists believed to be the perpetrators of the crime. Tamil Nadu Police is in touch with their counterparts to elicit more information about the persons who shot at Wilson.

Visuals collected from CCTV cameras installed in the area near the check post has helped the police to identify Abdul Sameem (29) and Thaoufeeq ( 27), the passengers in the car. Sources in Tamil Nadu Police, on condition of anonymity, had said that they had enough reasons to believe that the team of extremists included Syed Ali Nawas (25) and Abdul Samad who were held in New Delhi on Thursday. Sameem and Thaoufgeeq are believed to have escaped to Kerala and have taken shelter in the border region between the two States.

The investigation is on to track the SUV bearing registration number TN 57 AW 1559 in which the killers were travelling. Sameem is an accused in the 2014 murder of Hindu Front leader in Kanyakumari. Both Sameem and Thaufeeq are believed to be members of the banned Al-Ummah organisation.

The checking of vehicles at Kaliyikkavila was part of the investigation into the warning sounded by intelligence agencies that six trained terrorists with IS connection have entered South India for possible attacks on various installations and individuals in the region. The Q Brach of Tamil Nadu Police have circulated pictures of these six persons to all police stations in the State. Wilson and his colleagues were entrusted with the task of identifying the persons about which the Q Branch had supplied information.

Narayanan Tiruppathi, official spokesman of Tamil Nadu BJP condemned the murder of Wilson by the terrorists. “The Government of Tamil Nadu is complacent in its actions against Islamic terrorists for whom the State is a safe heaven. More than 100 Hindu leaders have been killed by the Islamic terrorists over the last four years. But the State is yet to crack down on these forces,” charged Narayanan.

Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami expressed shock at the death of Wilson, who was shot at in the forehead from point blank resulting in instant death.

134,11-1-20,"BSF erecting new steel fence along Pak, B’desh border","The Border Security Force (BSF) is erecting new uncut steel fence to plug vulnerable and infiltration-prone patches along the frontier with Pakistan and Bangladesh and the Government has expedited the proposed plans to install a smart fence along these borders within the next five years. The smart fence or laser fence entails deployment of surveillance gadgets and anti-infiltration alarms.

The uncut single-row fence, with loops of concertina wires on top, is being erected at a 60-km border stretch near Amritsar in Punjab. A ‘pilot project’ of this new fence is also being tested at a 7-km stretch at Silchar in Assam along Indo-Bangladesh border and is being analysed by the BSF for a full rollout. While this fence costs over Rs 2 crore per kilometre, the cost is expected to come down if implemented on a large scale, officials said.

Once the Force receives a positive feedback and operational viability of these projects, new fence will be erected at more places where either the old one has worn out or there was no fence owing to geographical challenges, a senior official said.

The BSF is scouring for tech solutions to counter rogue drones which have been sighted in large number along the Western border in Punjab after the nullification of Article 370 that granted special status to the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir.

The Union Home Ministry has also compressed the timeline for implementation from 10 to five years for implementing the Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS) that proposes creation of laser or virtual walls. The pilot project of CIBMS has already been completed in the Jammu region and the feedback has been positive. The Border Management Division under the Home Ministry is seeking to expeditiously implement CIBMS which will facilitate surveillance of difficult terrains like riverine patches and mountaneous terrains which otherwise cannot be fenced through traditional mechanisms, officials said.

Officials said security agencies have detected the presence of ‘Afghan fighters’ along the Indo-Pakistan border leading to extra vigil and expeditious implementation of technology-based solutions to counter any emerging challenge posed by infiltration.

These terror operatives have travelled across borders from Afghanistan resulting in an enhanced vigil by the security forces to thwart infiltration and terror bids along the sensitive frontier in Jammu-Kashmir.

Infiltration bases and terror launch pads along the International Border (IB) in Jammu and Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir are still intact but the latest concern of the security agencies is the presence of well-trained terrorists from Afghanistan who are expected to be used by Pakistan to foment trouble in the newly created Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, sources said.

The BSF has also recently completed an exercise to fully “map and identify” vulnerable spots all along these two borders as part of the move to secure the borders along Pakistan and Bangladesh, they said,

Latest measures to bolster border defences include mapping of infiltration prone areas along the two borders, and erection of new steel fence along vulnerable patches, they said.

The security agencies are also keeping a close tab on the activities of cross-border terror modules and terrorists as the security agencies here anticipate attacks on security forces and their installations in Jammu and Kashmir.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bsf-erecting-new-steel-fence-along-pak--b---desh-border.html
135,11-1-20,"Days after induction, Wadettiwar takes charge as Maha Min","After sulking for five days after being a portfolio earmarked for his party in the MVA coalition Government, senior Congress and former leader of the Opposition, Vijay Wadettiwar on Friday finally took charge as the Minister after Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray restored the Relief and Rehabilitation (R&R) portfolio to him.

Wadettiwar had among other things been given OBCs, Khar land development and Earthquake Rehabilitation, when Uddhav made the portfolio allocations in his Cabinet on January 5.

Before long, Wadettiwar realised that he had been taken for a ride by the ruling Shiv Sena which had given him insignificant Earthquake rehabilitation instead relatively crucial Relief and Rehabilitation (R & R) portfolio which it gave it to its minister Sanjay Rathod.

Following the development, Wadettiwar had refused to take charge as the minister in the absence of R & R portfolio. He had made no bones about his dissatisfaction over the denial of R & R

portfolio, a portfolio that was originally given to the power sharing agreement reached among the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress — the three constituents of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Government. He also complained to the Congress high command on the injustice done to him.

The ruling Shiv Sena initially tried to downplay the issue by saying that it was a “typo” that led to the allocation of Earthquake Rehabilitation to him instead of Relief and Rehabilitation.

While Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar of the NCP made his displeasure known about the injustice done to Wadettiwar, Maharashtra Congress President Balasaheb Thorat also took up the matter with the chief minister.

With the stalemate over the delay in Wadettiwar taking charge of his Ministry continuing, the Chief Minister intervened in the situation on Friday morning and called up Wadettiwar and formally assured the latter that he would take away the R & R portfolio from Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Rathod and restore it to the Congress leader. Talking to media persons after taking charge as the minister in the Uddhav Thackeray Cabinet, Wadettiwar said: “Yes. I was unhappy about what had happened. The R & R portfolio was originally my portfolio since it had been given to the Congress in the sharing of portfolios among the MVA constituents. It is an important portfolio from the point of view of the poor people. If I do not have such an important portfolio what justice I can do to the poor people”

“What was the use in my being a minister if I do not get as important portfolio as R & R. I spoke to the Congress high command. Our party leaders also spoke to me over phone. The Chief Minister himself called me and admitted that a mistake had happened. He told me that the R & R portfolio comes in the Congress’ quota. I will restore the portfolio to you,” Wadettiwar said.

It may be recalled that Wadettiwar had created a sensation in the state political circles in August last year, by claiming that he had received 25 telephonic calls from Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray’s residence asking him to join the Sena in the run-up to the October 2019 Maharashtra Assembly polls.

A day after a host of NCP and Congress leaders, including four sitting MLAs, joined the BJP in Mumbai in the presence of Fadnavis, Wadettiwar had dropped a bombshell by claiming: “In order to lure me into joining the Shiv Sena, I had received 25 telephonic calls from Uddhav Thackeray’s residence Rs Matoshri’ . Similarly I have received two telephonic calls from Chief Minister Fadnavis’ official residence Rs Varsha’ in an effort to woo me into the BJP”.

Speaking at a function in his home district of Chandrapur in eastern Maharashtra, Wadettiwar had said: “In its bid to woo me into its fold, the Shiv Sena has been calling me repeatedly. Since the earlier leader of the Opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil joined the BJP, the Sena has been trying to rope me into its fold. I have so far received 25 telephonic calls from Rs Matoshri’ . But, I have not taken any of the calls”.

On June 24, 2019, Wadettiwar had been appointed as the new Leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly. Fifty-seven-year-old Wadettiwar replaced erstwhile Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil, who resigned from his position as the leader of the Opposition and his primary membership of the Congress and was inducted into the Maharashtra Cabinet on June 16. 2019.

An MLA from Brahmapuri constituency of Chandrapur district in eastern Maharashtra, Wadettiwar was rewarded with the LoP’s post for saving the Congress from a total wipe-out in the May 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The high court, however, asked the party to take a different route from what it had sought. The order, passed after 2 pm, allowed the BJP to hold the protest march between 3 pm and 4.30 pm.

The rally, which commenced from Nandan area — the city's cultural hub — was led by West Bengal BJP Mahila Morcha president and MP Locket Chatterjee and the party's general secretary Raju Banerjee.

With posters and placards in hand, the activists shouted slogans against the State Government. They took a round of the Birla Planetarium, before returning to Nandan, traversing a kilometre.

“A 17-year old girl was raped, brutally murdered and her body set on fire in South Dinajpur. We wanted to hold a rally to protest the gruesome incident and the worsening law and order situation in the state, but the police initially refused permission,” Chatterjee said. The actor-turned-MP questioned the “silence of city's eminent personalities” over the incident.

Referring to a similar incident in Hyderabad, which had sparked outrage across the country, she said, “The chief minister (Mamata Banerjee) sends her party representatives when such cases are reported in other states. Why is she silent now, this time it is her own state...” the MP said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/west-bengal-bjp-takes-out-rally-against----worsening-law---order-.html

144,11-1-20,Trai tariff order to stifle content creation: Broadcasters,"In an unprecedented move, top honchos from fiercely competitive TV broadcast industry on Friday came together against regulator Trai’s new tariff order on Friday, saying pricing caps on channels will stifle content creation, impact jobs and pull down growth.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai) move aimed at reducing charges for subscribers is micro-regulation and puts the industry’s future in “jeopardy”, the lobby grouping Indian Broadcasting Federation (IBF) said.

In the second major change in a year, Trai had capped individual channel subscription at Rs 12 per month, down from the earlier Rs 19, and capped channel bundle discount to 33 per cent, among other moves. The moves are effective from January 1 and analysts had opined this will reduce cable TV subscription charges by 14 per cent.

“We want a stable and consistent regulatory regime for us to strategise better,” NP Singh, the IBF president and the head of Sony Pictures Networks India, told reporters. He added that such a move will stifle content creation, impact jobs and also economic growth.

He said Trai has come out with 36 tariff orders in the 15 years of its existence, and termed a few of the recent decisions as “arbitrary” taken without any data or consumer insights.

The new set of guidelines are biased against bouquet offerings and the regulations should be non-discriminatory, he said.

Singh said the industry had fully supported last year’s pricing move by Trai, incurred an expenditure of Rs 1,000 crore in stakeholder education efforts and also lost over 12 million subscribers. Expressing surprise at a change in regulation, he said Trai had itself in the past promised for a two-year moratorium on prices.

The industry executives, however, declined to quantify the financial impact of the new Trai order.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/trai-tariff-order-to-stifle-content-creation--broadcasters.html

146,11-1-20,Centre mulls mobile test labs at 21 ports,"The Ministry of Agriculture is considering introducing mobile testing labs at 21 ports across the country to ensure imported fertilisers reach farmers on time after a quality check.

As per the Ministry of Agriculture data, India imported 188.43 lakh tonne of fertilisers during 2018-29. Of this, urea comprised 74.81 lakh tonne, Di-Ammonium Phosphate 66.02 lakh tonne, Muriate of Potash (MoP) 42.14 lakh tonne and nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) (NPK) at 5.46 lakh tonne.

Currently, imported fertilisers are tested by Faridabad-based Central Fertiliser Control and Quality Institute (CFCQI) as well as three regional centres that come under the agriculture ministry. As per the Fertiliser (Movement Control) Order, imported fertilisers are permitted for distribution only after testing the commodity.

“However, due to delay in testing on part of CFCQI, consignments get stuck at ports. There were instances in the past, when some consignments were released without waiting for the test reports on pressure to meet farmers’ demand in a particular season,” source said.

When the tested samples were found to be of inferior quality after releasing the consignments from ports, their distribution was later stopped at different levels, the source said, adding this was one of the cases.

But now the issue is being addressed seriously as the government is committed towards supplying quality fertilisers to the farming community, the source added.

To keep a check, another source said, the fertiliser ministry has recently issued an advisory asking importing companies to stop distribution of fertilisers if they see any issue about the quality and the same should be informed to the ministry immediately.

The other plan that the ministry is working on is to set up mobile testing labs at 21 ports to ensure the tests are done quickly on a real-time basis and consignments are released for distribution without any delay, the source added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/centre-mulls-mobile-test-labs-at-21-ports.html

The Central Ministry has taken exception to various reports that the striped cats were victim of the State Government’s failure to act on the repeated complaints by the locals about tigers’ killing their livestock in the region.

Rajendra Garawad of the NTCA and Mumbai-based Deputy Director of the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) are likely to submit their report by January 14, 2020.

“The State Government should have taken adequate steps to protect the tigers and prevent backlash by the locals who might have killed the big cats in anger. However, only after we get the report from our team we will know about what led to their deaths,” said a senior Ministry official.

While the Goa forest officials said that three people have already been arrested in this regard, the central team is inquiring if there was any possible negligent of the part of the State Government and other agencies responsible for safety of the tiger.

According to a memo issued by Deputy Inspector General (NTCA) Nishant Verma, the team has been tasked with “inquiry into the cause of tiger death”, “response taken by concerned state forest authorities”, compliance of standard operating procedures with regards to tiger death and “submission of report within seven day”.

On January 8, the carcass of the fourth tiger was found near Golvali village in Sattari sub district in North Goa. According to a complaint filed by the Forest department officials, three person have been accused of poisoning the carcass of a buffalo, which had been previously ambushed by one of the tigers last month.

When the group of tigers returned to the site of their kill to feed last month, they consumed the poison and died subsequently. While the first carcass, of a young adult male was discovered on January 5, three other carcasses, which included one adult female and two cubs were discovered three days later.

All the carcasses were in various stages of decomposition, even as the officials suspect that the tigers may have eventually died between seven to ten days ago, after surviving the poisoned meat for several days.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/central-team-starts-probe-into-big-cat-deaths-in-goa.html

150,11-1-20,"Guj Assembly passes resolution congratulating PM, Shah on CAA","The Gujarat Assembly on Friday passed a resolution congratulating Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah for amending the Citizenship Act.

The resolution, which was opposed by Congress MLAs, claimed that persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan were not offered Indian citizenship in the past because of “policy of appeasement”.

Last month the Legislative Assembly of Kerala, where a CPI(M)-led LDF Government is in power, passed a resolution demanding scrapping of the controversial Act, becoming the first state in the country to do so.

On Friday, during a heated discussion on the resolution in the Gujarat Assembly, Congress MLA Imran Khedawala displayed a poster against CAA and the National Register of Citizens written in his own blood.

The House was also adjourned for fifteen minutes following a ruckus. The resolution, moved by Minister of State for Home Pradeepsinh Jadeja, said, “Prime Minister Narendra

Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah have shown far-sightedness by taking a bold and historic decision to amend the Citizenship Act by which Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians and Parsis of three neighbouring countries will be able to get Indian citizenship.

“Policy of appeasement of earlier Governments had kept such people devoid of citizenship and other rights,” it added.

The “nationalist Government of the BJP” brought in the new law to help these persecuted minorities, it said.

Some “anti-nationals” and political parties opposing it were silent on the persecution of religious minorities in Pakistan, and spreading rumours that the CAA will take away the citizenship of the members of the minority community in India, the resolution said.

While tabling the resolution, minister Jadeja said the CAA was only about granting citizenship to the religious minorities of three countries.

“I want to assure that no Indian will lose citizenship. This Act is not at all unconstitutional. It will alleviate the pain of persecuted minorities,” he said.

“Ten people sitting on a protest in Delhi is not a protest. People are being misled. Even the Congress has joined hands with the Rs Tukde Tukde Gang'. The Congress was concerned about Rohingya Muslims. But why you never thought of wiping the tears of migrant Hindus all these years,” he asked.

Leader of Opposition Paresh Dhanani linked the CAA with National Register of Citizens and National Population Register.

“CAA will destroy the secular spirit of our Constitution. CAA is linked with NRC and NPR. People are afraid that they may lose their citizenship,” said Dhanani.

“For granting citizenship to a few foreigners, you want to strip crores of our own people of citizenship,” the Congress leader said. After the discussion continued for around two hours, the resolution was passed by amajority vote.

The United States on Friday rejected a request by Iraq's caretaker Prime Minister to send a delegation to start preparations to pull out its 5,200 troops in the country.

""At this time, any delegation sent to Iraq would be dedicated to discussing how to best recommit to our strategic partnership -- not to discuss troop withdrawal, but our right, appropriate force posture in the Middle East,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said.

The request came in a telephone call on Thursday night between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi, a statement from his office said. He also told Pompeo that recent U.S. Strikes in Iraq were an unacceptable breach of Iraqi sovereignty and a violation of the two countries’ security agreements.

He asked Pompeo to “send delegates to Iraq to prepare a mechanism to carry out the parliament’s resolution regarding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq”, according to the statement.

“The Prime Minister said American forces had entered Iraq and drones are flying in its airspace without permission from Iraqi authorities, and this was a violation of the bilateral agreements,” the statement added.

Iraqi lawmakers passed a resolution Sunday to oust US troops, following the January 3 US drone strike that killed top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and senior Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis at Baghdad’s airport.

The non-binding vote put the responsibility on the government to formally request a withdrawal. Abdul-Mahdi, addressing lawmakers at the time, called for “urgent measures” to ensure the removal of the troops.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/plan-road-map-for-troops-pullout--iraq-govt-to-us.html
156,11-1-20,Iran denies missile downed Ukrainian plane,"Iran’s civil aviation chief denied on Friday that a missile downed a Ukrainian airliner which crashed killing all 176 on board, dismissing claims of a catastrophic mistake by Tehran’s air defences.

The declaration came as Tehran faced mounting international pressure to allow a “credible” investigation into the crash, which Britain and Canada suggested was caused by an accidental missile strike.

“One thing is for certain, this airplane was not hit by a missile,” Iran’s civil aviation chief Ali Abedzadeh said.

The Boeing 737 crashed on Wednesday shortly after Tehran launched missiles at US forces in Iraq in response to the killing of a top Iranian general in a US drone strike in Baghdad.

It is Iran’s worst civil aviation disaster since 1988 when the US military said it shot down an Iran Air plane over the Gulf by mistake, killing all 290 people on board.

The majority of the passengers on Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 were dual national Iranian-Canadians but they also included Ukrainians, Afghans, Britons and Swedes.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday that multiple intelligence sources indicated that an Iranian surface-to-air missile downed the plane after it took off from Tehran.

“We know this may have been unintentional. Canadians have questions, and they deserve answers,” Trudeau told reporters.

But Abedzadeh rejected the allegation, saying that “any remarks made before the data is extracted (from the plane’s black box flight recorders)...Is not an expert opinion.”

Trudeau’s comments came as video footage emerged that appeared to show the moment the airliner was hit.

The footage, which The New York Times said it had verified, shows a fast-moving object rising at an angle into the sky before a bright flash is seen, which dims and then continues moving forward. Several seconds later an explosion is heard.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said US officials have handed Kiev “important data” following the crash.

Tehran’s foreign ministry said that a Canadian delegation was en route to Iran to “handle the affairs of the Canadian victims”, a rarity since the two countries cut diplomatic relations in 2012.

Iran’s civil aviation chief said Tehran had invited “Americans, Canadians, the French, Ukrainians and the Swedish” to be present during the investigations, showing that “we are honest in our procedure”. The US National Transportation Safety Board said late Thursday it had received formal notification of the crash from Iran and would send a representative to join the investigation.

Iran’s foreign ministry earlier invited US plane maker Boeing to “participate” in the probe.

France is the co-manufacturer of the plane’s engines, and has offered its expertise because it is one of the few countries able to comprehensively decipher black box data.

Trudeau was backed by other Western leaders, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson who said mounting evidence supported a missile strike, which “may well have been unintentional”.

The European Union demanded an “independent and credible” probe into the crash.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/iran-denies-missile-downed-ukrainian-plane.html
157,11-1-20,US announces new sanctions on Iran after missile strikes,"The Trump administration on Friday announced a new wave of sanctions on Iran following this week's missile strikes by the Islamic Republic on U.S. Bases in Iraq.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the new sanctions will target eight senior Iranian officials involved in ""destabilising"" activities in the Middle East as well as Tuesday's missile strike, which came in retaliation for the US killing of a senior Iranian general in a drone strike.

Mnuchin said President Donald Trump will issue an executive order imposing sanctions on anyone involved in the Iranian textile, construction, manufacturing or mining sectors. They will also impose separate sanctions against the steel and iron sectors.

""As a result of these actions we will cut off billions of dollars of support to the Iranian regime,"" the treasury secretary said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us-announces-new-sanctions-on-iran-after-missile-strikes.html
158,11-1-20,Pelosi to send impeachment articles for Senate trial ‘soon’,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she will “soon’’ transmit the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, signaling a potential thaw in the standoff with Senate Republicans as she warned against rushing to an acquittal without a fair trial.

Pelosi, D-Calif., faces mounting pressure from Republicans and some Democrats to quit delaying the president’s trial in the Senate, three weeks after the House Democrats impeached Trump on charges of abuse and obstruction.

Republicans say Democrats are embarrassed by their vote. But Pelosi countered that Democrats are ‘’proud’’ of upholding the Constitution and said she doubted that Senate Republicans will do the same.

Many on Capitol Hill expect the Senate impeachment trial to begin next week.

“I’ll send them over when I’m ready. That will probably be soon,” Pelosi told reporters at the Capitol Thursday, noting she is not postponing it “indefinitely.’’

The House impeached Trump in December on the charge that he abused the power of his office by pressuring Ukraine’s new leader to investigate Democrats, using as leverage USD 400 million in military assistance for the US ally as it counters Russia at its border.

Trump insists he did nothing wrong, but his defiance of the House Democrats’ investigation led to an additional charge of obstruction of Congress.

Pelosi’s delay in sending the articles of impeachment over for a Senate trial has led to a standoff with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., over what would be the third impeachment trial in the nation’s history.

McConnell said that if Pelosi and House Democrats are “too embarrassed’’ to send the articles of impeachment, the Senate will simply move on next week to other business.

“They do not get to trap our entire country into an unending groundhog day of impeachment without resolution,” McConnell said.

McConnell told GOP senators at a lunchtime meeting to expect the trial next week, according to two people familiar with his remarks.

The people requested anonymity to discuss the private meeting.

At the same time, McConnell signed on to a resolution from Senator Josh Hawley, R-Mo., to allow for the dismissal of articles of impeachment if the House doesn’t transmit them in 25 days.

That change to Senate rules appears unlikely to happen before Pelosi transmits the articles.

In the weeks since Trump was impeached, Democrats have focused on new evidence about Trump’s effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals and they pushed the Senate to consider new testimony, including from former White House national security adviser John Bolton. Republicans are just as focused on a speedy trial with acquittal.

Republicans have the leverage, with a slim 53-47 Senate majority, as McConnell rebuffs the Democratic demands for testimony and documents. But Democrats are using the delay to sow public doubt about the fairness of the process as they try to peel off wavering GOP senators for the upcoming votes. It takes just 51 senators to set the rules.

“When we say fair trial, we mean facts, we mean witnesses, we mean documents,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., promising votes ahead.

On a July telephone call with Ukraine’s new president, Trump asked his counterpart to open an investigation into the Bidens while holding up military aid for Ukraine.

A Ukrainian gas company had hired Hunter Biden when his father was vice president and the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden.

Trump suggested that his administration would continue to block Bolton or others from the administration from appearing before senators.

Many of those officials have defied congressional subpoenas for their testimony.

“When we start allowing national security advisers to just go up and say whatever they want to say, we can’t do that,” Trump said during an event with building contractors.

“So we have to protect presidential privilege for me, but for future presidents. That’s very important.”

Bolton, one of four witnesses that Democrats have requested, said this week that he would testify if subpoenaed.

McConnell has said from the start he is looking to model Trump’s trial on the last time the Senate convened as the court of impeachment, for President Bill Clinton in 1999.

McConnell has said there will be “no haggling” with House Democrats over Senate procedures.

“There will be no unfair, new rule rule-book written solely for President Trump,” McConnell said Thursday.

McConnell, who met with Trump late Wednesday at the White House, suggested last month it would be “fine with me” if the House never sent the articles.

More recently, he has drawn on the Constitution’s intent for the Senate to have the ultimate say on matters of impeachment.

He scoffed that Pelosi has ‘’managed to do the impossible” by uniting Democrats and Republicans who want the trial to begin.

Some Democrats have been showing increased anxiety over the delay as Americans remain divided over Trump’s impeachment.

The delay on impeachment has also upended the political calendar, with the weekslong trial now expected to bump into presidential nominating contests, which begin in early February. Several Democratic senators are running for the party’s nomination.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/pelosi-to-send-impeachment-articles-for-senate-trial----soon---.html

163,11-1-20,Yes Bank independent director Agarwal quits,"Uttam Prakash Agarwal, an independent director of Yes Bank Ltd, on Friday resigned from the board and stepped down as head of its audit committee citing major corporate governance concerns, but the lender said he was facing a ‘fit and proper’ status review as directed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

The capital-starved bank also reported setbacks in its USD 2-billion fundraising plans. The lender also said its board has also approved a fresh round of capital raising of Rs 10,000 crore, for which shareholders’ nod will be sought soon, the troubled private sector lender told stock exchanges on Friday. Canadian investor Erwin Singh Braich’s USD 1.2 billion offer will not be pursued further, it said and hinted that a USD 500-million offer from Citax Holdings and Citax Investment Group, which was being favourably considered, is also facing headwinds.

The bank, which was waiting for regulatory nods as Citax’s offer entailed over 10 per cent ownership, has not yet been able to get a clearance on the “conditions precedent”. Without specifying timelines, it said the Citax offer will be taken up “during the next round”.

The troubled bank has been forced to shrink its book due to capital paucity and was hoping to close the fundraising by December. Need for capital has been necessitated as under new Chief Executive Officer Ravneet Gill, the lender has had to provide for sour loan bets taken under his predecessor Rana Kapoor whose term was cut short by the RBI last year over concerns on corporate governance. The central bank has also appointed former deputy governor R Gandhi to the board.

Meanwhile, Uttam Agarwal, a chartered accountant who had joined the board amid an upheaval in November, has quit citing “deteriorating standards of the corporate governance” under Gill. The bank retorted saying Agarwal resigned ahead of a discussion at the board to review if he qualifies under the RBI’s ‘fit and proper’ criteria.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/yes-bank-independent-director-agarwal-quits.html

The IIP growth in November 2018 was 0.2 per cent. According to the National Statistical Office (NSO) data, the growth in the manufacturing sector was 2.7 per cent as against a contraction of 0.7 per cent in the same month last year.

Electricity generation turned negative (-) 5 per cent as against a growth of 5.1 per cent in November 2018. Mining sector output decelerated to 1.7 per cent from 2.7 per cent in the year ago month. The IIP growth during April-November period of the current fiscal came in at 0.6 per cent, down from 5 per cent in the same period of 2018-19.

The data for the November month further revealed that production of capital goods, a barometer of investment, contracted by 8.6 per cent. This compares with a contraction of 4.1 per cent in November 2018.

Also, there was a contraction of 3.5 per cent in the infrastructure and construction goods segment.

165,11-1-20,"Auto sales 20-year-low, decline by over 13%","The automobile industry recorded its worst-ever sales decline in two decades in 2019, with an unprecedented slowdown hampering vehicle offtake across segments, according to industry body SIAM.

As per data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) on Friday, all vehicle segments reported de-growth last year as low consumer sentiments, weak rural demand and economic slowdown took toll on demand.

Overall wholesale of vehicles during the year across categories, including passenger vehicles, two-wheelers and commercial vehicles, saw a decline of 13.77 per cent in 2019 at 2,30,73,438 units as against 2,67,58,787 units in 2018.

This is the worst fall in sales since the industry body started recording monthly and yearly sales data in 1997. The previous lowest was recorded in 2007 when overall sales had declined by 1.44 per cent.

Similarly, total passenger vehicle sales during 2019 declined by 12.75 per cent to 29,62,052 units as compared with 33,94,790 units a year ago. This is the worst performance in the segment since 2013 when sales witnessed a dip of 7.49 per cent.

Two-wheeler sales also saw a dip of 14.19 per cent last year to 1,85,68,280 units as compared with 2,16,40,033 units in 2018. Likewise, total commercial vehicles saw a dip of 14.99 per cent to 8,54,759 units as against 10,05,502 units in 2018.

“Challenges remain for the auto industry despite the government bringing in several growth enablers. GDP growth rate remains an area of worry as commercial vehicle segment is clearly linked to it. Besides, low demand from rural areas continues to be a matter of concern,” SIAM President Rajan Wadhera told reporters here.

In passenger vehicles, utility vehicles are driving sales as other segments are not performing that well, he added. When asked about the 2020 outlook, Wadhera said the situation is going to remain tough due to impending changeover to the BS-VI emission regime.

“We expect prices of commercial vehicles to go up by 8-10 per cent due to BS-VI norms and it is going to impact demand. But, if economic growth is there, this factor would not be such a sore point,” Wadhera said.

Similarly, passenger vehicles would see cost increase in range of 3-7 per cent, which would also act as an dampener for sales growth, he said. “So, growth in the segment is expected to remain flat. In two-wheelers, low demand from rural areas continues and challenges are expected to remain going ahead as well,” Wadhera said.

He added if the economy grows at around 6-7 per cent, the auto sector could see a return to growth rates witnessed four quarters ago. When asked if job losses witnessed in various industrial sectors, such as auto and telecom, have had an impact on demand slump, Wadhera said, “Yes.”

The auto industry body also said the positive sentiment that was witnessed during the festive season has not sustained with retail sales in December coming back to negative. Commenting on the industry’s Budget expectations, he reminded of the long-standing demand of reducing GST rate to 18 per cent and introduction of scrappage policy to spur demand.

In December, domestic passenger vehicle sales declined 1.24 per cent to 2,35,786 units in December from 2,38,753 units in the year-ago period. Domestic car sales were down 8.4 per cent to 1,42,126 units as against 1,55,159 units in December 2018, according to SIAM.

Market leader Maruti Suzuki India posted a growth of 2.49 per cent in its passenger vehicle sales in December at 1,22,784 units. Hyundai Motor India saw a decline of 9.84 per cent at 37,953 units, while Mahindra & Mahindra posted a growth of 3.94 per cent at 15,686 units.

Motorcycle sales last month declined 12.01 per cent to 6,97,819 units as against 7,93,042 units a year earlier. Total two-wheeler sales in December declined 16.6 per cent to 10,50,038 units compared to 12,59,007 units in the year-ago month.

In two-wheeler segment, Hero MotoCorp posted a decline of 5.63 per cent at 4,12,009 units in December. Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) saw its sales drop by 2.26 per cent at 2,30,197 units, while TVS Motor Co witnessed a decline of 25.09 per cent at 1,57,244 units.

Sales of commercial vehicles were down 12.32 per cent to 66,622 units in December, SIAM data showed. Vehicle sales across categories registered a decline of 13.08 per cent to 14,05,776 units from 16,17,398 units in December 2018, it added.

166,11-1-20,Former Boeing CEO gets $62.2 million but loses some benefits,"The Boeing CEO who was ousted last month for the company's botched response to two crashes and the grounding of its best-selling plane will walk away with $62.2 million, the company disclosed Friday.

Boeing said, however, that Dennis Muilenburg will not get additional severance or a 2019 bonus, and will forfeit stock awards worth $14.6 million.

Muilenburg, who spent more than 30 years at Boeing, also has unexercised stock options that he has held since 2013 and that are worth more than $18.5 million at Friday's closing price.

Muilenburg was fired in late December after failing to get the company's 737 Max jetliner back in the air.

Boeing board Chairman David Calhoun will take over as CEO on Monday. He is a former General Electric and Nielsen executive with a reputation as a turnaround specialist.

Calhoun, 62, will get a base salary of $1.4 million but potentially several million more in bonuses and stock awards, including $7 million if he gets the Max back in service.

The Max was grounded last March after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people. It has taken far longer than Boeing expected to fix the plane. This month, Boeing will halt production until it is clear when changes to the plane will be approved by regulators.

Muilenberg was named CEO in 2015 and presided over a rapid rise in the Chicago-based company's stock price. The shares have dropped 26% in the last 10 months, however, as the Max's recovery stalled.

Months before Muilenburg's ouster, some lawmakers and relatives of passengers who died in the Max crashes had asked him to resign or take a cut in pay.

At a congressional hearing in October, Muilenburg parried questions about his compensation by saying it was set by Boeing's board. A few days later, he announced he would not take a bonus for 2019 — that he would walk away from “tens of millions” of dollars as a signal that he was taking responsibility for correcting problems with the Max.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/former-boeing-ceo-gets--62-2-million-but-loses-some-benefits-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/former-boeing-ceo-gets--62-2-million-but-loses-some-benefits.html
167,11-1-20,Huge rival rallies on final day before Taiwan votes,"Taiwan’s presidential rivals held massive rallies Friday night in a final push to convince voters on the eve of a closely watched election that looks set to infuriate China and send ripples far beyond its borders.

Some 19 million people are eligible to vote on Saturday to choose between two leaders with very different visions for Taiwan’s future -- in particular how close the self-ruled island should tack to its giant neighbour.

Beijing views Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to one day retake the island, by force if necessary.

But China is also Taiwan’s largest trade partner, leaving it in a precariously dependent relationship.

President Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking a second term and is the frontrunner, has pitched herself as a defender of Taiwan’s liberal values against the increasingly authoritarian shadow cast by Beijing under President Xi Jinping.

Her main competitor Han Kuo-yu, 62, favours much warmer ties with China -- saying it would boost the island’s fortunes -- and accuses the current administration of needlessly antagonising Beijing.

Huge crowds hundreds of thousands strong and a dazzling sea of flags -- green for Tsai, red and blue for Han -- greeted both candidates during their raucous last rallies.

“This election will determine if Taiwanese people can bravely choose democracy and freedom despite pressure from China,” Tsai told supporters. But Han told his crowd it was time to mend ties with Beijing.

“Interactions between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have become frosty and are at their lowest ebb,” he said.

Taiwan bans publishing polls within 10 days of elections but Tsai has led comfortably throughout the campaign.

Her party currently has a parliamentary majority, which analysts expect it to retain.

Beijing has made no secret of its desire to see Tsai ousted.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/huge-rival-rallies-on-final-day-before-taiwan-votes.html

Osaka’s form slipped after the first set but the world number four eventually saw off sixth seed Kiki Bertens 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 at the Pat Rafter Arena.

Bertens was on the attack in the second set but lost control in the decider when she began to struggle with her first serve.

It was a more straightforward affair for fifth seed Kvitova, who downed American qualifier Jennifer Brady 6-4, 6-2. Kvitova, a two-time Wimbledon champion who won her first WTA title in Brisbane in 2011, was in superb touch against Brady, who beat Maria Sharapova and Ashleigh Barty in the first two rounds but was never in the hunt.

Osaka, who burst to stardom by winning consecutive Grand Slam crowns at the 2018 US Open and 2019 Australia Open, will next play defending champion Karolina Pliskova.

Pliskova reached the semi-finals with a tough 7-6 (8/6), 6-3 over unseeded American Alison Riske.

171,11-1-20,Klopp wary of ‘world-class’ Mourinho,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp believes Jose Mourinho remains a world class coach and a threat to his side’s unbeaten Premier League record when the European champions travel to Tottenham today.

A massive 28-point gap separates the sides that contested the Champions League final just seven months ago with Liverpool running away with the title, while sixth-placed Spurs’ ambition is just to make it back into the top four.

Mourinho’s honeymoon period in north London is over after a run of just two wins in Tottenham’s last seven games, but he has consistently been a thorn in Liverpool’s side with Chelsea and Manchester United in the past.

“Jose Mourinho is a world-class manager with a specific mindset. I would say he wants to win with all he has. I respect that a lot,” said Klopp.

“That means each situation his team is in, he tries to use for his team.”

Klopp picked up his fourth Premier League manager of the month prize of the season on Friday as reward for navigating a gruelling December schedule across four different competitions without dropping a point.

Liverpool are 13 points clear with a game in hand over closest challengers Leicester and Manchester City as they seem destined to end a 30-year wait to win the league.

However, Trent Alexander-Arnold, who picked up the player of the month award, insists they cannot afford to get over-excited.

“We know we can’t get too excited and we know that nothing has been won yet. If we want to be a successful team then we have to keep going until the end,” said the England international.

“Obviously we are in a good position, which is something that we can’t ignore. We’re playing well, we’re on a good run of form but we can’t take that for granted because there are shock results week in, week out in the Premier League.

“If we get our mentality and the game-plan right then we know that with the quality that we’ve got then we’re confident going into games. But we can’t be overly-confident and arrogant. We need to know our quality and make sure we produce it.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/klopp-wary-of----world-class----mourinho.html
172,11-1-20,San Siro set for goal fest,"Antonio Conte will be counting on Inter Milan strike duo Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez in today’s Serie A clash against free-scoring Atalanta to keep ahead of champions Juventus who travel to Roma.

Both eight-time holders Juventus and Inter Milan are top of the Italian league table on 45 points after 18 games, with Conte’s side ahead on goal difference.

“I’ve always said Romelu was a rough diamond that needed polishing. Lautaro Martinez is the same,” said Conte.

Inter and fifth-placed Atalanta have had the most potent attacks so far this season in Serie A, setting the scene for a potential goal-fest in the San Siro.

Gian Piero Gasperini’s Atalanta are 11 points off the leaders but coming off back-to-back league wins with ten goals scored — a 5-0 scoreline against both AC Milan and Parma.

Gasperini coached Inter for five winless games before being sacked in 2011. But he has transformed the Bergamo side who finished third last season.

They have scored 48 goals so far this season and another today would see them become the most prolific team in Serie A in the past 60 years.

They will be keen to impress at the San Siro where they host Valencia in their Champions League last 16 first leg tie on February 19.

Conte believes that Lukaku and Martinez, who both scored in last weekend’s 3-1 win over Napoli, are only beginning to hit their stride. The pair have accounted for 23 of Inter’s 39 Serie A goals, and 30 in all competitions.

Lukaku is the second highest scorer in Serie A, behind Lazio’s Ciro Immobile. His double against Napoli took his tally for the season to 14, overtaking the 12 he scored in his final season with Man United.

“It will be big expectations ahead of the game. Both teams have great strikers,” said Atalanta wing-back Robin Gosens.

“Lukaku is very difficult to mark, Martinez moves a lot. They are doing extraordinary stuff, it will make it a tough challenge. But we played at San Siro in the Champions League so we are used to that pitch.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/san-siro-set-for-goal-fest.html

175,11-1-20,"Protest-hit HK sees surge in depression, PTSD: Study","Nearly one in three adults in Hong Kong reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder during months of often violent social unrest in the city, according to a study published in The Lancet medical journal Friday.

And around one in 10 had symptoms of probable depression, figures comparable to those seen in areas of armed conflict or following terrorist attacks, the decade-long study led by researchers from the University of Hong Kong found.

Prevalence of PTSD symptoms was six times higher than after the last major pro-democracy “Occupy” protests in 2014, rising from about five percent in March 2015 to almost 32 percent in September-November 2019.

The increase corresponds to an additional 1.9 million adults with PTSD symptoms in the city of 7.4 million.

Up to 11 percent of adults reported symptoms of depression, from around two percent before the Occupy protests, and 6.5 percent in 2017, the study estimated.

“One in five adults now reports probable depression or suspected PTSD, which is comparable to those experiencing armed conflicts, large-scale disasters, or terrorist attacks,” the study said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/protest-hit-hk-sees-surge-in-depression--ptsd--study.html
176,11-1-20,Effervescent Elizabeth,"Elizabeth Gilbert hit big time with her quest Eat Pray Love, which continues to inspire women all over the world 14 years after it hit the stands. The author, who is attending the Jaipur Literature Festival this year, tells Saimi Sattar what makes the book resonate even now

Eat Pray Love is a one of a kind book. How difficult was laying your life bare in front of people that you didn’t even know? Or maybe, more so, those who supposedly knew you?

I’m not a particularly private person (I suppose that’s obvious by now) so it actually wasn’t difficult for me. As I get older, I feel that I am even less concerned with privacy, for this reason: Whenever I reveal something painful or difficult about my own life, I hear echoes back from thousands upon thousands of women saying, “Me, too! Thank you for saying that out loud.” I’m not concerned about sharing my hopes and fears anymore because they seem to be identical to the hopes and fears of everyone else. And I think anything we can do to share our struggles helps everyone. As for Eat Pray Love, my only concern was protecting the privacy of other people in the book who might not be as open with their lives as I am. I was achingly careful not to expose anyone in a way that they would not be comfortable with. I’m always much more careful and respectful of other people’s private lives than I am of my own.

Would you say writing the book was therapeutic?

Absolutely. I would go even further and say that writing it saved my life.

The book spent a record 199 weeks on “New York Times Best Seller list”. Did you anticipate its success?

Not for a minute. In fact, I thought I was taking a huge creative risk by writing Eat Pray Love and that perhaps I was even committing career suicide. Up until that point in my life, I was known as a writer who wrote for herself, and about men. I was a journalist at GQ magazine, and my first books had been about very masculine worlds. To quit my excellent and very macho journalism job and go on a spiritual journey to write about a woman’s interior life...well, that just felt like it would cost me my entire career. (Happily I was wrong about that.)

While writing, who did you think would be your readers?

My best female friends, who all seemed to be struggling with the same questions that I was facing at the age 30: Should we be married or not? Should we have children or not? Is there a larger purpose to our life? Is it more important to be free or to be secure? Essentially, I took the conversations we’d had for years over many bottles of wine and brought those questions to the page.

Some critics said that Eat Pray Love peddled Eastern exotica? And others said it was pre-lit.

I’ve never heard the word “pre-lit” before, but without even understanding the term, I suppose we have to consider the possibility that both criticisms are valid and quite possibly absolutely true and that many more criticisms of the book are valid, besides these. Certainly in the last decade and a half since Eat Pray Love was written, conversations about cultural appropriation have changed, deepened and intensified. My own values have changed along with the culture. I was not nearly as aware of the dangers of “peddling Eastern exotica” as I would be if I were writing the book today. To be honest, I’m quite certain that I would not write the same book today or at least not with the same blithe self-confidence about being a spiritual tourist in other people’s cultures. That said, I’m moved by the sheer number of women from disparate cultures all over the world, who claim that they were inspired by Eat Pray Love to change their lives. I still get messages from women every day, from every corner of the planet, who say that they were encouraged to leave destructive relationships, take risks and set out alone in the world because they read that book — imperfect as it is. For that, I’m grateful and humbled. The bottom line is this: The book exists as it is and as a snapshot of a particular moment in time, written from a particular worldview. I welcome the criticism, as part of an ongoing cultural conversation about privilege and about who is allowed to tell what stories, and when, and how. This is a conversation which we all deeply need to keep having and it’s important for writers like me to listen to that criticism without defensiveness, fragility or reactivity. In the end, we can only leave it to readers to decide for themselves how they feel about my story. It will be interesting to see how their own feelings might change over time.

How closely were you associated with the film? And what did you think of it?

I love the film, but I wasn’t closely involved with its production. I’d had some experience with Hollywood in the past, and I had learned this lesson: The best place for a writer to be during the adaptation of her book is very far away. I felt it was important to give Ryan Murphy (the director) and actor Julia Roberts all the space in the world in which to create their own vision for the film, without my interference. This was a gesture of respect on my part. It’s hard enough making a film without an anxious writer peering over your shoulder saying, “I would never have worn that dress.” The other benefit to my hands-off approach was that I could watch the film with fresh eyes, and that was an absolute delight.

It was during the writing of City of Girls that you lost your partner, Elias. How difficult was completing it?

After my partner Rayya Elias died, I threw myself into writing City of Girls. I needed the escape and I was so grateful that I had a huge project to do, to take my mind off my loss. Creativity has always been the place where I go to heal and so writing the novel was incredibly nourishing for me. It was especially important for me to write something that had nothing to do with Rayya or with cancer or with tragic death. I wanted to write something fun, light and life-affirming to help bring myself back into the light.

The novel is set in 1940s. What kind of research went into it?

I spent four years researching everything I could discover about the New York City theatre world in the 1940s. Fortunately, this was not a sacrifice. It was a fascinating time in history and I loved vanishing into that long-lost, glamorous moment. The best part was getting to interview women in their 90s (or even their hundreds) who had been actors, dancers, songwriters, costume-directors during that time. I feel so blessed that I got to meet so many of these amazing women at the tail end of their lives and to incorporate their stories into mine. And the best part of meeting them was hearing their stories about their sexual and romantic escapades — some of which were quite shockingly wild. Every generation thinks they invented sex and that the past was a more innocent time, but talking to these free-spirited nonagenarians proved otherwise...

How did your growing up years influence your writing?

I was raised in a family without a lot of luxuries — puritan, almost, in the starkness. I grew up on a farm where only one room was heated in the winter, where we didn’t have a television, where we raised our own animals and grew our own food. There were no other children nearby and so my sister and I, both, had to rely on our imagination in order to create games and worlds that we escaped to together. It is no accident that we both became novelists. Creativity was our religion and salvation.

Which authors have influenced you?

Charles Dickens was basically my nursemaid, I learned so much from him.

Any Indian authors that you like to read?

Arundhati Roy, Salman Rushdie, Anita Desai and Amit Chaudhuri come to mind.

What does the future of the written word look like since we are swamped by digital entertainment?

I’m more worried about the future of the planet at this point than I am about the future of the written world. Worrying about where literature is headed seems almost a luxury at this point, as the temperature of the oceans rises and rises...

What is the relevance of literature festivals like the JLF?

I see them as family reunions, bright lights in the midst of the darkness and a pure delight to be invited to.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/effervescent-elizabeth-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/effervescent-elizabeth.html
177,11-1-20,"‘Not cinematic liberty, but responsibility'","Filmmaker Om Raut tells Chahak Mittal that he had to dig deep to shoot his first period drama, Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior in order to get the details right

Om Raut grew up around historical stories, coming from books, his grandparents as well as his travels. Somewhere along the way he saw himself as part of this bigger picture and imagined himself a time traveller. “I grew up listening to a lot of stories of rulers like Chhatrapati Shivaji and his great warriors, his soldiers, figures like Maharana Pratap, Chanakya, Tipu Sultan and Haider Ali. I romance history. I like to live in the dream world of that bygone era. There’s some kind of power that I draw from it. It gives a sense of where one came from, a sense of belonging and great sacrifices. Today, there are smartphones which keep us connected, anytime, anywhere. But the sense of history keeps you grounded amid all the luxuries that we can afford today,” he says.

Living in the US for major part of his life and having moved to India only a few years ago, Om happened to watch a film on a Greek warrior with a friend in 2007. “Two weeks before the film released, he was constantly talking about the what-abouts of the war. What would have happened if this war would not have happened? What is the importance of this in the Greek as well as the European history? The film made me raise such questions. And I was completely blown away with its idea,” he says. That’s when he had his epiphany. “I was there standing outside the theatre at the New York’s Times Square. It was around 6 pm but not very dark. I thought that there are so many beautiful stories that I need to tell from my motherland too. I felt the rush to tell the tales about the warriors from my country,” he adds. Well, Tanhaji Malusare was the first person to cross his mind for the idea since as a child, his story had “a huge impact” on his life.

The period drama, starring Ajay Devgn, Kajol and Saif Ali Khan, revolves around the life of Tanhaji, a 17th century Maharashtrian Marathi military leader, who is known for his role in the battle of Sinhagad in 1670 against Mughal army leader Uday Bhan. He says, “I am amazed by the very fact that the Maharashtrian warrior, whose soldier count was just 56, fought against 2,000 people and pulled off an impossible task, emerged victorious! He did astonishing feats like climbing from the back of the fort, which is 4,000 ft high up in the mountains. He actually pulled off what is fondly known as a surgical strike today. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj started the concept of a surgical strike or a war on the military target, which is called Ganimi Kava in Marathi. It looked like the Spanish guerrilla warfare. In this battle, they scaled up and won the fort. And I really wanted to tell that story of courage.”

One has to be “foolish and crazy” while making cinema, feels Om, who spent four years researching the subject. “The research was done at several levels. Right from sketching the story to meeting people and historians, reading books because very little information is available, stitching different data into one narrative and reading between the lines… there were so many things to look at to ensure that the story’s accuracy isn’t questioned. When you have so much of scattered information, you have to build a skeleton or a flowchart around it to join the dots. Finally, you get the story and you start to weave the script. Having said that, I would like to also point out that reading and researching is just the first level. To set up the script, the actual locations need to be visited and experienced live. You understand the scope of it and visualise what it was like,” he says.

The next level, he points out, was taking photographs of the architecture of the fort, which helped him work on special effects and sets. The special visual effects and technology have been used for the first time in any Indian period drama. He says, “We came up with something which was really huge and gigantic in nature — the fort. It was some really ultra-modern technology, which has been used for the first time in Indian cinema. While executing all the plans, I realised that there are three levels of making a film — what to create, where to create, and how to create.”

But aren’t historicals a safe bet for Indian filmmakers? Raut defends it by saying he is only a disseminator of information to a digitally-hooked generation. “Cinema is one of the biggest conversation platforms in a country. It has a strong influence and talks to the youth who are averse to reading. Even if they read, they don’t complete the task. Most of them are half-read. So, personally, as a filmmaker, it’s a very responsible position that I enjoy in order to tell something which is important for people to know. Then why not begin from our rich history and heritage?” he asks.

Well, the makers of period dramas have a pressure of balancing the facts and fiction so as to not make the film boring for the audience. “Yes, that’s very true. But not just this, as a filmmaker, I also have to be very cautious of the censorship and of what I bring to the audience. I have to keep the dramatic element intact, make the character more appealing and at the same time not deviate much from the point of history,” he says. Highlighting his responsibility as a chronicler, he adds, “Cinematic liberty is highly misinterpreted and abused in the film industry today. It is known to be fake. But it actually means the enhancement of the existing situation. You take the genesis and transpose it on to a larger format and tell it in an impactful way for the viewers to enjoy it.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---not-cinematic-liberty--but-responsibility--2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/---not-cinematic-liberty--but-responsibility-.html
178,11-1-20,Learn through the seasons,"TV host and DJ Nikhil Chinapa says that the 17th edition of Roadies, Roadies Revolution, intends to bring about a social change by encouraging people to think about the planet we live in and the choices we make. By Team Viva

It is said that the 17th season of the show promises to catalyse social change. What do you intend to achieve through this?

The answer is in the question itself — social change. We intend to bring that about by encouraging people to think about the planet we live in, the choices we make and how they intend to make this planet a sustainable habitable place for future generations to come. It’s a big thing to say that we are going to reclaim society, reclaim our nation. We can always make baby steps as long as we can reclaim our whatsapp groups, our family whatsapp groups, that’s a great place to start.

Do you think the charm of the show is still intact as it was in the first? What do you think are the reasons for it?

I think it was around seventh or the eighth season when the internet first started to break through and became popular in India. That was the time when I actually thought about how much more popular this show could become because at that point it was absolute rage. And now, 10 years later, it’s even bigger and better than what it was a decade ago, it has constantly evolved and brought new concepts to the fore. This makes it fresh and exciting for new contestants and viewers alike.

What would you attribute the success and popularity of the show to?

It’s extremely sincere. The show is not fake, everybody knows that. Some people think it’s scripted but that’s not the case. The fact that all the tasks are so well planned, there is no partiality and to get ahead in the show you have to have all the qualities that a Roadie needs to succeed says it all.

Since you have primarily done youth-oriented shows. Do you have a pressure of putting the right content forward?

Personally, I am against preaching the younger generation or preaching anybody but at the same time I am not afraid to put my views forward and express them openly. I have been brought up in a belief system by my parents, I have my own beliefs which I have cultivated and nurtured through the years and I am not ashamed to express them. Yes, I believe that there is some sort of social responsibility but at the same time one must remember that we are an entertainment show which is not meant to be driven by moral science.

Since you are often credited with popularising EDM music, what would you say works for its appeal in India?

EDM is an integral part of everyone’s life, especially, the younger generation. For a few reasons, EDM does not discriminate, it is not about flashy cars, big jewellery and a particular sense of fashion. It is not about rebelling against the establishment or showing your anger, rage and angst, it is about embracing people and loving them. I think that’s the quality that people find very endearing, especially, those who feel that they don’t have a place in the society and they don’t belong there. They feel that this genre of music embraces them, that sort of openness of the music form is what has led to it’s popularity. The other factor that makes it popular is the fact that very often it doesn’t have words and it’s language is agnostic, which means that anybody can love it whether they are Spanish speaking, German speaking, English speaking, Marathi speaking or any other language. It has got a great future in India, it’s been growing leaps and bounds, of course, it will keep changing and evolving. What’s popular in dance today may not be popular three or four years down the line but music that people can dance to, will always be in fashion.

Since you have hosted a digital show, TGTR. Do you think digital streaming portals encourage fresh talent?

The internet has opened so many different avenues for artist and fans alike. It’s the love of an artist to put up their music without the burden of being a part of the record label. Earlier it was very difficult to break the music if you were a part of the label but the internet has sort of negated that and made music more democratic. Similarly, it allowed people from all across the world to discover artist and music from other parts of the world and that explosion in broadband connectivity, the use of internet and smartphones has also fuelled the popularity of different genres of music and not just dance music. The internet is going to be a tremendous platform for discovery going forward for the next generation.

179,11-1-20,Film world made fun of my English: Kangana,"Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut says that the film world has always made fun of her English, despite which she has always kept Hindi as her priority.

Kangana’s sister Rangoli Chandel took to Twitter on the occasion of Hindi Diwas, sharing a clip of the actor. In the video, Kangana is seen urging everyone to give importance to Hindi. She said in Hindi: “Today on Hindi Diwas, lets take “Panga” with English but with love. Hindi is our national language but the nation worries speaking it. “A,B,C” comes out with confidence but “ka, kha, ga” doesn’t come out with that much confidence. Parents also say with full pride that their children speak amazing English.” Kangana is heard saying all this in the video.

“If you are weak in English, then you feel ashamed but if your Hindi is weak then there is not even a line of worry on the forehead. Bhasha becomes the password of social circle and sometimes the certificate of our talent. The film world has always made fun of my English...and critcised it. But still I’ve kept it as my priority for which I could expand my reach and achieve major success,” she said.

The 32-year-old actor, who currently awaits the release of her next film Panga urged all mothers to teach their children Hindi. “I urge all mothers the way they treat their children with desi ghee laddu with love... the same way they should teach them Hindi because the taste you get in desi ghee paranthas is not what you in pizzas and burgers. And the love is in the word “ma”, it’s not the same in the word “mom,” she said.

Directed by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, Panga revolves around a mother (Kangana) who is also a Kabbadi player.

The film is scheduled to release on January 24. It also features Richa Chadha, Jassie Gill and Neena Gupta.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/film-world-made-fun-of-my-english--kangana-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/film-world-made-fun-of-my-english--kangana.html
180,11-1-20,All's Well That Ends Well,"Djokovic survives scare while Nadal makes amends for singles defeat in decisive doubles tie to help Spain reach ATP Cup semis

Rafael Nadal suffered an upset singles loss but made amends in the doubles to keep Spain alive at the ATP Cup Friday, with Novak Djokovic also surviving a scare before rallying to guide Serbia into a semi-final against Russia.

After Roberto Bautista Agut swept past Kimmer Coppejans 6-1, 6-4 in the first singles match, Nadal had the chance to wrap up a last four berth against David Goffin.

But the 19-time Grand Slam winner struggled in the heat and humidity of Sydney, crashing 6-4, 7-6 (7/3) to the 11th-ranked Belgium. It was a rare defeat while playing for his country, who he helped to victory in the Davis Cup in November.

It sent the tie to a decisive doubles match, with Nadal returning to partner Pablo Carreno Busta against Sander Gille and Joran Vliegen in a gritty 6-7 (7/9), 7-5, 10-7 win.

“It was tough, because for us it was a big change from Perth to here, not much time to adapt and the conditions were heavy, the humidity and playing against big players,” said Nadal.

“But as a team we are super happy to be in the semi-finals.”

Spain’s group games during the round-robin phase of the inaugural team event were played in Perth, where the air was much drier.

Spain will face Australia in the last four.

Great battle

Like Nadal, world number two Djokovic was also tested, dropping his first set of the tournament in a titanic struggle with Canada’s Denis Shapovalov.

The Serbian superstar was made to work by the 14th-ranked young gun before prevailing 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7/4) to help his team to a 3-0 win.

“It was so close it could have gone a different way easily,” said Djokovic.

“It was a great battle, and it does serve me very well to have this kind of match prior to tomorrow and Australian Open, for my confidence, for kind of a competitive match play. This is exactly what you want to have against one of the best players in the world.”

182,11-1-20,Maguire could play against Norwich,"Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is hopeful Harry Maguire will be fit to face Norwich City today, allaying fears that the world’s most expensive defender was set for a spell on the sidelines.

Maguire was badly missed as United crumbled to Manchester City in a 3-1 League Cup semi-final, first leg defeat, but his hip injury is not as bad as first feared.

“Harry has a chance for tomorrow,” Solskjaer said at his pre-match press conference on Friday. “It is only a minor thing. He will go through training and see how he reacts.”

Maguire has played every minute of United’s league campaign so far and has even worn the armband on multiple occasions with club captain Ashley Young reduced to a peripheral role since the arrival of right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka.

“It’s not a surprise because he’s a warrior and he wants to play,” added Solskjaer.

“He was close to playing against City, just not quite good enough, but he has a chance now.”

Maguire could soon succeed Young as club captain with the 34-year-old reportedly close to agreeing a deal with Inter Milan.

Young is out of contract this summer and free to negotiate with the Italian giants, who could even bring a move forward to this month if a deal with United can be agreed.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/maguire-could-play-against-norwich.html

188,11-1-20,Creation of CDS a 'very big step' towards integration of forces: Army chief,"Army Chief Gen M M Naravane on Saturday asserted that the conduct of the 1.3 million-strong Army will be guided by its ""allegiance"" to the Constitution and its core values of justice, liberty, equality and fraternity, comments which came in the backdrop of criticism that the military was politicised under his predecessor.

Gen Naravane, addressing a press conference on the eve of the Army Day, also said that a ""rebalancing"" of the overall preparedness along the border with China has been initiated and a raft of measures are being taken including moving advanced weapon systems.

Talking about his overall focus as chief of the Army, Gen Naravane said it will be 'ABC' -- ""allegiance, belief and consolidation"", noting that protecting the core values of the Constitution will remain the driving force of his personnel.

""We swear allegiance to the Constitution of India. Be it officers or jawans, we have taken oath to protect the Constitution and that is what should guide us in all time and all our actions,"" the Army Chief said.

""What it translates into is also the core values which are enshrined in the Preamble to the Constitution which are justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. That is what we are fighting for,"" he said.

""We are deployed on the border safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity, it is to secure for our people these core values. And, I think, that is what we and I would like to say that we need to keep in mind,"" he added.

Gen Naravane took charge as Army Chief on December 31, succeeding Gen Bipin Rawat.

In his three-year tenure as Army Chief, Gen Rawat faced allegations of not remaining politically neutral and allowing politicisation of the Army.

Last month, he triggered a huge row after he publicly criticised people leading protests over the new citizenship law, saying leadership is not about guiding masses to carry out arson and violence across the country.

He was slammed by opposition parties as well as former military officers who stressed that the armed forces must follow the decades-old principle of serving the country and not any political force.

Gen Naravane also said that his other focus areas would be 'ITPQ' -- which he explained as Integration, Training Personnel and Quality.

He said integration of purposes within the Army and with the two other forces would be a key area for him.

""The formation of the Chief of Defence Staff and the creation of a department of military affairs is a very big step towards integration. We on our part will make sure that this is a success,"" the Army chief said.

""Integration will also be within the Army and the integrated battle group is just one example of that. But I also want to assure everyone that in this process of integration, we will take everyone along. Nobody will be left behind,"" he said

The Army Chief said the focus of training will be on preparing the Army for future wars which he said will be network-centric and complex.

He said the personnel were the ""greatest strength"" in the Army, adding ""quality and not quantity will be the mantra, be it the selection of personnel or equipment.""

""We are in a transformative stage and all the transformation that we are doing, we will have to consolidate upon them. We will have to carry forward the initiatives and policies set by my predecessor and make sure that all of them reach a logical conclusion,"" the Army Chief said.

""Of course somewhere along the way, there will be mid-course correction,"" he said.

On Siachen, Gen Naravane said Indian forces should not lose sight as there could be collusion between China and Pakistan. ""We need to hold on to it. This can take place at any level, but Siachen and Sakshgam Valley are the places where the territory of these two countries meets.""

Asked whether the Army was ready to free PoK from Pakistan's control, the Army Chief referred to a parliamentary resolution of 1994, and said his force was ready to follow orders.

""As far as Pakistan-occupied Kashmir is concerned, many years ago there was a parliamentary resolution on it that entire J and K is part of India. If Parliament wants that area should also belong to us, if we get orders to that effect, then definitely we will take action on it,"" Gen Naravane said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/creation-of-cds-a--very-big-step--towards-integration-of-forces--army-chief-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/creation-of-cds-a--very-big-step--towards-integration-of-forces--army-chief.html

190,11-1-20,"Atletico, VAR hurt Barca","Lionel Messi said Barcelona were guilty of playing like children on Thursday after Atletico Madrid staged a thrilling comeback to beat them 3-2 and set up a Spanish Super Cup final against Real Madrid.

Barca looked on course for tomorrow showdown against Real when they led 2-1 with nine minutes left but instead it will be a Madrid derby in Saudi Arabia to decide who lifts the trophy.

“It’s a shame because we switched off for a few moments and made children’s mistakes,” Messi said. “We should have closed out the match.

“It’s a blow for us, especially as we were the better team. Our mistakes cost us dearly.”

All five goals were scored during a wild second half in Jeddah that began with Koke putting Atletico in front, just 21 seconds after coming on as a substitute at the interval.

Goals from Messi and Antoine Griezmann turned the game on its head, only for Atletico to hit back with a late double, Alvaro Morata converting a penalty in the 81st minute before Angel Correa found a winner in the 86th.

In between, Barcelona also had two goals ruled out after VAR spotted tight offsides while Atleti were denied what looked a clear penalty at 2-2, after the ball clipped the hand of Gerard Pique.

191,11-1-20,‘It’s important not to overplay Bumrah factor’,"Australian captain Aaron Finch on Friday said it is important for his team to not “overplay” the Jasprit Bumrah factor as the ambitious visitors gear up to face India in a three-match ODI series.

While according India’s lead pacer the respect he deserves, Finch said it’s important for his team to focus on its own strengths.

“I think, the more the guys face him, the more exposure you get, the more you start to understand how he bowls. So, it is important that we don’t overplay that too much,” Finch said during a media interaction.

Opening the innings with the dashing David Warner, Finch will be facing Bumrah first up.

“He is obviously a fantastic bowler and someone who, when you are not playing against him, you love watching him bowl. He is fast and aggressive and his execution is pretty spot on.”

The visitors are wary of the threat Bumrah could pose in the series starting in Mumbai on January 14. “It is more about focusing on what we are as a batting unit against that and each player has different strengths and weaknesses. So (we are doing) what we have to do for mentally being prepared for that challenge,” Finch said.

The in-form Marnus Labuschagne is set to make his ODI debut after earning a maiden call-up on the back of his stellar form in Tests and the skipper is confident about Labuschagne translating his Test form into the 50-over format.

“If you look at his domestic ODI record, it is very good, he has batted in the top four for Queensland and the way our ODI competition is being structured for the last few years, there can be similar wickets in sub-continents.

“... For him to be averaging 40 in domestic cricket is brilliant, and hopefully, he can bring that from the Test series.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---it---s-important-not-to-overplay-bumrah-factor---.html

What also helped Finch evolve as a skipper is the continuity in team selection.

“He (Finch) has a familiar group around in terms of continuity of team. From the World Cup, there has been a couple of changes.

193,11-1-20,"Gabbar, Thakur batter Lanka","Dhawan finds form with 36-ball 52 as Shardul’s all-round show help India beat SL by 78 runs, win series 2-0

Shikhar Dhawan silenced his critics, KL Rahul sizzled as usual and the trio of fast bowlers were intimidating in India’s lopsided 78-run victory over Sri Lanka in the third T20 International on Friday, sealing the series 2-0.

India were sent into bat by Sri Lanka captain Lasith Malinga but on a flat track, the hosts managed an above-par 201 for 6, largely due to Dhawan (52 off 36 balls) and Rahul’s (54 off 36 balls) opening stand of 97 in little less than 11 overs.

Shardul Thakur (21 not out off 8 balls) used his long handle to a good effect and Manish Pandey (31 off 18 balls) hardly showed any rustiness adding 37 runs in final 2.2 overs to take the score past 200-run mark.

In reply, Sri Lanka managed only 123 runs in 15.5 overs as there was simply no resistance from the islanders with the gulf in class being so evident. Eight Sri Lankan batsmen failed to reach double figures with Dhananjaya De Silva (51) and Angelo Mathews (31) adding 68 for the fifth wicket.

They lost four wickets in the Powerplay overs and there was no coming back from that position. It was primarily due to the pace and bounce generated by Jasprit Bumrah (1/5 in 2 overs), Shardul Thakur (2/19 in 3 overs) and the ever-improving Navdeep Saini (3/28 in 3.5 overs), who again bowled an unplayable yorker to get Kusal Perera out.

In fact, skipper Virat Kohli could be lauded for promoting Sanju Samson (6) and Pandey, who have been benched for the longest time. While Samson fluffed his lines, Pandey did his case no harm with a useful knock towards the end.

Put into bat, Dhawan, who has been under pressure for some time smashed seven boundaries and a six in his 97-run opening stand with the in-form Rahul who also hit an over boundary along with five fours.

However, the hosts suffered a middle-order collapse with Sri Lankan wrist spinners Wanidu Hasaranga (1-27) and chinaman Lakshan Sandakan (3-35) spun their web around the batsmen on a flat track.

But Pandey, playing his first game of the tournament and Thakur once again revelling in his role as a lower-order pinch-hitter (22 not out off 8 balls; 1x4, 2x6) ensured that the hosts crossed 200-run mark.

Rahul set the tone playing a cut shot off rival skipper Lasith Malinga for his first boundary. Dhawan got an early 'life', when Dasun Shanaka dropped one at deep square leg. Rahul, then hit two consecutive boundaries, both drives, off Angelo Mathews as India raced to 22/0.

The visitors introduced off-spinner Dhananjaya De Silva in the fourth over, but Dhawan welcomed him with a four over long-on. Rahul then dispatched a Silva full-toss over long leg for a maximum as India amassed 13 runs in it.

Dhawan changed his gears as he hammered two boundaries in fifth over as India reached team total of 50.

Making optimum use of the life, Dhawan smashed back-to-back fours, slashing one over backward point and another through extra cover off pacer Lahiru Kumara. The duo was coasting along well as India after 9 overs were 82/0.

After two quiet overs, Dhawan smashed Hasaranga over deep mid-wicket for a six.

Soon after completing his 10th T20I fifty, Dhawan perished after giving a sitter to Dhanushka Gunathilika off Sandakan at deep mid-wicket. However his innings certainly will make Virat Kohli’s choice of Rohit Sharma’s partner difficult for the upcoming Australia series.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/gabbar--thakur-batter-lanka-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/gabbar--thakur-batter-lanka.html

195,11-1-20,"NZ Tour: Hardik to be back for white ball leg, Gill or Rahul for 3rd opener in Tests","All-rounder Hardik Pandya could be the only notable inclusion in India's limited overs squads -- which are unlikely to be significantly tinkered with -- for the upcoming six-week tour of New Zealand.

Starting January 24, India will be playing five T20 Internationals, three ODIs and two Test matches, and squads for the tour will be picked on Sunday.

India will be playing eight white ball games in New Zealand, and it will be interesting to see if the selectors pick a 16 or 17-member squad, instead of 15.

With the India A team's shadow tour coinciding with the seniors' visit, it gives the selectors an option to draft players on SOS basis if the need arises.

The selectors will primarily focus on zeroing in on the core for white ball cricket considering that this is a T20 World Cup year.

While the T20 squad that played against Sri Lanka in the just-concluded series all but picks itself, Pandya, who is already in New Zealand with the A team, is expected to be included once he proves his fitness in the first couple of List A games against New Zealand, apart from two warm-up one dayers.

With India A's three List A games only ending on January 26, Hardik, returning from a back surgery, might be included by the time the January 29 third T20 International comes calling.

""About Hardik, it's only about checking out if he is fully fit for international cricket or not. He is very integral to India's World T20 plans,"" a senior BCCI official, privy to selection matters, told PTI on the condition of anonymity.

It will be interesting to note if the ODI team is an extension of the T20 squad.

The weakest link in the ODI team is Kedar Jadhav, who has managed to hold onto his 50 over slot amid pressure to replace him.

In New Zealand, Jadhav's technical frailties could be exposed and his lack of overs in recent times makes him a case for exclusion.

In case the Indian team looks for technical solidity, Ajinkya Rahane could make a comeback, but if the team management is thinking in terms of treating 50 over games as an extension of T20 series, Mumbai player Suryakumar Yadav's explosive power hitting at No. 5 or 6 could be an option.

Both Surya and Sanju Samson are in the A squad.

The Test squad wears a very settled look with the only contention being the third opener's slot.

Picked as a reserve for the home series, the young Shubman Gill deserves to be the third opener, but K L Rahul's current form and experience in Test cricket could also be considered.

The selectors will also deliberate on if a third spinner (Kuldeep Yadav) is needed for the two-match Test series instead of a fifth pacer (Navdeep Saini) to accompany Jasprit Bumrah, Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Shami and Ishant Sharma.

The rest automatically pick themselves in case there are no fitness issues.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nz-tour--hardik-to-be-back-for-white-ball-leg--gill-or-rahul-for-3rd-opener-in-tests-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/nz-tour--hardik-to-be-back-for-white-ball-leg--gill-or-rahul-for-3rd-opener-in-tests.html

The court said that freedom of speech and conducting business on the internet are protected under the Constitution as fundamental rights.

The court directed the authorities in the Union Territory to immediately review all orders suspending internet services and said that orders not in accordance with the law must be revoked.

The SC order will have implications on the growing tendency of the authorities in several States to suspend internet services at the drop of a hat and keep Section 144 permanently in place even during the peace time.

The judgment came on pleas filed by Anuradha Bhasin, Executive Editor of Kashmir Times and Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad which challenged the curbs imposed on Jammu & Kashmir after the Centre’s abrogation of provisions of Article 370 on August 5 last year. These pleas were different from another set of petitions which have challenged the constitutional validity of abrogation of Article 370, being heard by a separate 5-judge Constitution Bench, which will resume its hearing on January 21.

This is considered to be the longest internet ban anywhere in the world. The internet shutdown was imposed on August 4 last year, a day before the Centre abrogated the erstwhile State’s special status and bifurcated it into two Union Territories.

The court said its limited scope is to strike a balance between the liberty and security concerns so that the right to life is secured and enjoyed in the best possible manner.

Ruling that internet services cannot be suspended “indefinitely”, the court directed the J&K authorities to “consider forthwith” allowing Government websites, localised/limited e-banking as also hospitals and other essential services in areas where the services are not likely to be restored immediately.

“We declare that the freedom of speech and expression and the freedom to practice any profession to carry on any trade, business or occupation over the medium of internet enjoys constitutional protection under Article 19(1)(a) and Article 19(1)(g),” a 3-judge Bench, headed by Justice NV Ramana, said in its 130-page verdict. “The restriction upon such fundamental rights should be in consonance with the mandate under Article 19 (2) and (6) of the Constitution, inclusive of the test of proportionality,” it said.

The court cited provision of the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Service) Rules, 2017 to underline the fact that such suspension can be utilised only for temporary duration.

“Any order suspending internet issued under the Suspension Rules, must adhere to the principle of proportionality and must not extend beyond necessary duration,” it said.

Existing Suspension Rules neither provide for a periodic review nor a time limitation for an order issued under the Suspension Rules, it added.

“Till this gap is filled, we direct that the Review Committee constituted under Rule 2(5) of Suspension Rules must conduct a periodic review within seven working days of the previous review, in terms of the requirements under Rule 2(6),” the apex court said.

The top court said that achievement of peace and tranquility within the erstwhile State of Jammu & Kashmir requires a multi-faceted approach without excessively burdening the freedom of speech.

“In this regard the Government is required to consider various options under Article 19(2) of the Constitution, so that the brunt of exigencies is decimated in a manner which burdens freedom of speech in a minimalist manner,” the Bench said.

It further said that complete suspension of telecom services, be it the Internet or otherwise, being a drastic measure, must be considered by the State only if “necessary” and “unavoidable”.

“In any case, the State/concerned authorities are directed to consider forthwith allowing Government websites, localised/limited e­banking facilities, hospitals services and other essential services, in those regions, wherein the internet services are not likely to be restored immediately,” the Bench also comprising Justices BR Gavai and R Subhash Reddy, said.

The apex court further said that power under Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code (prohibitory orders) is exercisable not only where there exists present danger, but also when there is an apprehension of danger and repetitive orders under this provision would be an abuse of power.

It directed the authorities to immediately review the need for continuance of any existing orders passed under Section 144. “However, the danger contemplated should be in the nature of an “emergency” and for the purpose of preventing obstruction and annoyance or injury to any person lawfully employed. The power under Section 144, CrPC cannot be used to suppress legitimate expression of opinion or grievance or exercise of any democratic rights.

“An order passed under Section 144, CrPC should state the material facts to enable judicial review of the same. The power should be exercised in a bona fide and reasonable manner, and the same should be passed by relying on the material facts, indicative of application of mind. This will enable judicial scrutiny of the aforesaid order,” the Bench said.

It said that while imposing Section 144, the Magistrate cannot apply a straitjacket formula without assessing the gravity of the prevailing circumstances and the restrictions must be proportionate to the situation concerned.

“In a situation where fundamental rights of the citizens are being curtailed, the same cannot be done through an arbitrary exercise of power; rather it should be based on objective facts,” the Bench said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/net-access-fundamental-right--sc-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/net-access-fundamental-right--sc.html
200,11-1-20,"Opp latches onto SC order, refutes claim of normalcy in J&K","The Supreme Court order on the restoration of internet and removal of curbs under Section 144 in J&K has prompted the Opposition to question the Centre’s claim of normalcy in the UT. They hailed the judgment as a “rebuff to the unconstitutional and arrogant” regime.

While the Congress said the SC has given a big jolt to the Modi Government’s “illegal activities” by ruling that access to the internet is a fundamental right and that dissent cannot be oppressed by imposition of prohibitory orders, Left parties said the judgment belie the claims of normalcy that the Central Government has been peddling in the country and the world.

The National Conference too expressed hope that the restoration of mobile internet services will help ease the situation in the Union Territory.

“The SC order is a rebuff to the unconstitutional and arrogant stance of the Central Government and the J&K administration on the restrictions imposed in J&K,” former Home Minister P Chidambaram said. He demanded that the entire team in J&K that designed and executed “the plan” be changed and a new set of administrators who respect the Constitution be appointed.

“The former Governor of J&K, Satpal Malik, should own responsibility and resign from his present post of Governor, Goa,” Chidambaram said in a tweet. Senior lawyer and Congress Rajya Sabha member Kapil Sibal termed as “path-breaking” the observation of the SC that Section 144 cannot be used indefinitely to suppress freedom of speech and expression and difference of opinion.

“I want to ask the Prime Minister that why do you have so much affection with foreigners and why not with the people of India. At least, you should be more transparent and open with the people of India,” Sibal said at AICC Press conference.

“This is a very important order. It is a historic verdict that has been pronounced by a 3-judge Supreme Court Bench and this will ensure free flow of information from Kashmir. It is historic because the people of India were concerned about the Jammu & Kashmir situation as no one knows about it,” Sibal said.

Sibal also sought to know from Home Minister Amit Shah as to what was the emergency on August 4, 2019, that Internet service was suspended from August 5 “without any reason”.

“The power under Section 144 CrPC cannot be used to suppress legitimate expression of opinion or grievance or exercise of any democratic rights,” he said.

“The Supreme Court has made significant comments on the curbs on civil liberties in Jammu & Kashmir which belie the false claims of normalcy that the Central Government has been peddling to the country and the world,” the CPI(M) said in a statement. It further said the Government tried to reinforce the official claims of normalcy by taking a group of foreign envoys on a “farcical” restricted tour to J&K where they were allowed to see and hear only what the Government wanted them to, which is why none of them could meet the three former Chief Ministers still in jail.

“When five months after the lockdown, political leaders, MPs and parties representing the people of this country are virtually banned from visiting Kashmir, such a tour is insulting to India’s Parliament,” the Left party said.

The party demanded the Government remove all such restrictions, fully restore Internet services, lift prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC and protect the democratic rights to Freedom of Speech and Expression of the people of Kashmir.

National Conference provincial president Devender Singh Rana said the communication clampdown has hugely impacted the people of Jammu & Kashmir in general and those engaged in trade, commerce, industry and academics in particular.

The NC leader expressed hope that the restoration of mobile Internet will go a long way in easing out the situation, saying the curbs have taken toll on youths in their pursuit of career advancement as also in the academic odyssey of vast mass of students.

“We will continue to remain in the forefront to shoulder our responsibilities and play historic role towards dignified life of the people and for lasting peace in Jammu & Kashmir,” Rana said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/opp-latches-onto-sc-order--refutes-claim-of-normalcy-in-j-k-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/opp-latches-onto-sc-order--refutes-claim-of-normalcy-in-j-k.html
201,11-1-20,"Cops name Aishe Ghosh, 8 others for JNU violence","The Delhi Police on Friday released photos of nine students, including former students, involved in attack on JNU students and teachers last Sunday and vandalism at the university’s server room.

JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) president Aishe Ghosh, whose blood-soaked picture had evoked empathy, are among the nine names, of which seven accused belong to Left students’ unions, while the remaining two are from ABVP.

Those identified are Dolan Samanta, Priya Ranjan, Sucheta Talukdar, Aishe Ghosh, Bhaskar Vijay Mech, Chunchun Kumar ( all alumni), and Pankaj Mishra from the Left. The remaining two are Vikas Patel and Yogendra Bharadwaj, both from the RSS-affiliated ABVP. However, no arrest or detention has been made so far.

Aishe Ghosh said she has not done anything wrong and the allegation is being levelled to create a narrative. Reacting to the police’s claim, the JNUSU alleged the “whole point of this exercise is to save the ABVP”.

The JNUSU accused the Delhi Police of speaking the language of the varsity’s vice-chancellor and said those who were assaulted have been “implicated as suspects”.

The Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by Dr Joy Trikey, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Crime Branch, has named four organisations, including All India Students’ Association (AISA), Democratic Students’ Federation (DSF), Students’ Federation of India (SFI) and All India Students’ Federation (AISF) for creating nuisance and threatening students who wanted to apply for the online admission for the winter semester of the university.

Addressing the media, Tirkey said a WhatsApp group ‘Unity Against Left’, believed to have been formed while the violence escalated, is also under scanner. “Notices will be served to the suspects and as the investigation progresses, we may come out with more facts,” he said.

“Ghosh and eight others were involved in an attack at the Periyar hostel on January 5,” said the DCP and admitted that lack of CCTV footage is a major hurdle in the investigation.

“The CCTV footage could not be fetched as the Wi-Fi based system and the cameras were all disabled. There is no primary evidence where some student or teachers can show us some proof like an originally recorded video on their phone. We have taken the help of viral videos and photographs to identify them and sought their information from the JNU databases,” Tirkey said.

“Since the specific hostel rooms were targeted, it indicates that there was an insider’s hand in it. JNU is so vast that outsiders cannot figure out hostel room at the spur of the moment,” said Tirkey.

Narrating the sequence of incident, the DCP said a majority of the students wanted to register for the winter semester from January 1 to 5, but the Left-leaning students’ bodies were not allowing them to do so. “On January 3, around 1 pm, members belonging to the four Left-wing student bodies barged into the server room, tempered with the server and shut it down. They also pushed the staff of the sever room outside. Around three to four hours later, the staff of the university restored the server. Thereafter, police registered a complaint for assault, damaging public property and criminal intimidation,” said the DCP.

An FIR naming Aishe and other has already been filed by the JNU administration. However, she has not been named as an accused yet, the DCP said.

“On January 4, some miscreants again entered the server room from its rear side and vandalised the room badly, following which another FIR was registered in that matter,” said the DCP.

“On January 5, the tensions flared up. At 11.30 am, four students were sitting on a bench in front of School of Social Science when a group came and there was an altercation between them over the admission process. The security staff who tried to save them also got injured,” said the DCP.

“On same day at 3.45 pm, members of the four organisations went to Periyar Hostel and attacked the students there. Some JNUSU members were also there, including their president Aishe,” said the DCP.

“Inside Periyar Hostel, the specific students were targeted. Thereafter, there was a peace meeting in which 120 to 130 students and teachers participated outside Sabarmati T-point between both the hostels. Meanwhile, a group came there with muffled faces. They got into a scuffle with students at the T-Point and later barged into the Sabarmati Hostel. They knew which rooms were to be targeted,” said the DCP.

However, the police did not name any group.

“The SIT officials have so far spoken with more than 40 people in the JNU but the officials did not get any actual witnesses who have seen the entire incident or recorded it,” the DCP claimed.

Meanwhile, JNUSU accused the ABVP of being the force behind the attack that has left more than 35 injured.

Reacting to the development, Aishe, who was injured in the attack refuted the charges saying the Delhi Police should make public whatever proof it has against her. She said the police was quick to take cognisance of the complaint filed by the JNU administration against her but has not registered any FIR on her complaint.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cops-name-aishe-ghosh---8-others-for-jnu-violence-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/cops-name-aishe-ghosh---8-others-for-jnu-violence.html
202,11-1-20,"SC finds fault with NCLAT, stays orderthat restored Mistry as Tata Sons chief","In relief to Tatas, the Supreme Court on Friday stayed in toto the NCLAT order restoring Cyrus Mistry as executive chairman of the Tata Group, observing that there were “lacunae” in the orders passed by the tribunal.

A Bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant said the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) decision suffers from “basic errors and we have to hear the matter in detail”.

While ordering interim stay of the NCLAT order, the bench also said, “You (Cyrus) have been out of the saddle for quite a long time. Does this hurt you now. How does it (stay order) hurt you today”.

The apex court said there was no prayer in the petition for reinstatement of Mistry but the tribunal went ahead with it and ordered that.

“We are looking at the order and the judicial attitude with which it was made. We find that it is sorely lacking. We find there are lacunae in the judicial orders passed by the NCLAT,” the bench said issuing notices to Mistry and others.

The only relief for the Mistry side was the top court ordering that the Tatas will not exercise power under Article 75 of the ‘Articles of Association’ for pushing out shares of minority holders in the company.

The Article empowers the company to, at any time, to transfer ordinary shares of any shareholders without following the normal procedure of transfer.

Tata Sons Private Ltd (TSPL) challenged the December 18 decision of NCLAT that gave a big relief to Cyrus Investment Pvt Ltd and Mistry, restoring him as the executive chairman of TSPL.

The Bench issued notices to Cyrus Investment Pvt Ltd, Mistry and others and posted the matter for hearing after four weeks.

Senior advocate CA Sundaram, appearing for Cyrus Investment Pvt Ltd, submitted that instead of staying the NCLAT order, notice should be issued and two weeks be given for filing the reply.

However, the Bench said, “Our first impression is not good about the order of the tribunal. The tribunal granted the prayer which was not prayed”.

The Mistry’s side wanted to place a note about interim arrangement which was not accepted by the Bench.

Senior advocate NK Kaul appeared for Mistry while senior advocate Shyam Divan was appearing for the shareholders which were on Mistry’s side.

During the hearing, Sundaram said he was not pressing for the consequential relief of reinstatement of Mistry but was against the wrongful removal of Mistry from Tata.

Senior advocates AM Singhvi, Harish Salve, Mukul Rohatgi and Mohan Parasaran represented the Tatas. Mistry came out with a statement on Sunday saying that he is not interested in returning to the Tata Group and the decision was made in the interest of the Group, whose interests are far more important than the interests of any individual.

“To dispel the misinformation campaign being conducted, I intend to make it clear that despite the NCLAT order in my favour, I will not be pursuing the executive chairmanship of Tata Sons, or directorship of TCS, Tata Teleservices or Tata Industries.

“I will however vigorously pursue all options to protect our rights as a minority shareholder, including that of resuming the 30-year history of a seat at the Board of Tata Sons and the incorporation of the highest standards of corporate governance and transparency at Tata Sons,” he had said.

TSPL, formerly known as Tata Sons Limited, had sought setting aside of the judgment in toto “of NCLAT, alleging it was “completely inconsistent with the annals of corporate law” and reflected “non-appreciation of facts”, which was “untenable in law”.

NCLAT had held that the group’s chairman emeritus Ratan Tata’s actions against Mistry were oppressive and the appointment of a new chairman was illegal.

It, however, had stayed operation of its order with respect to Mistry’s reinstatement for four weeks to allow TSPL to file an appeal in the top court. “In other words, far from putting an end to the alleged acts complained of, the judgment (of the NCLAT) has sown the seeds for a never-ending discord and conflict between shareholders of the appellant (TSPL), creating a recipe for an unmitigated disaster,” it said.

The plea raised questions of law and said the order restoring Mistry to his “original position” as the executive chairman of TSPL for the “rest of the tenure” was illegal as his tenure “stood extinguished in March 2017”.

The plea termed “illegal” NCLAT’s declaration that Chandrasekaran’s appointment as the chairman of TSPL was wrong and claimed he was appointed “in accordance with the articles and duly approved by the board and shareholders”. It alleged the NCLAT granted relief to Mistry which were not even sought.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sc-finds-fault-with-nclat--stays-orderthat-restored-mistry-as-tata-sons-chief.html
203,11-1-20,Chanda Kochhar’s Rs 78 cr assets seized for money laundering,"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached movable and immovable assets worth Rs 78.15 crore of former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar in connection with the money laundering case involving the bank and the Videocon Group.

The provisionally attached properties include her Mumbai apartment and those belonging to a company owned by her husband, Deepak Kochhar. In addition, the ED seized cash as well as plant and machineries of wind farm projects located in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.

The ED had initiated investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act after taking cognisance of a CBI FIR for illegal sanction of loans amounting to Rs 1,875 crore to Videocon Group of Companies by the ICICI Bank when Chanda was heading it. The case was registered under IPC sections relating to criminal conspiracy and cheating and provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act.

“Investigations under PMLA revealed that loans were refinanced and new loan aggregating to Rs 1,730 crore was sanctioned to Videocon Industries Limited (VIL) and its group companies and these loans became Non Performing Assets (NPA) for ICICI Bank on June 30, 2017,” the ED said in a statement.

Investigation further revealed that an amount of Rs 64 crore, out of the loan of Rs 300 crore sanctioned by a committee headed by Chanda to Videocon International Electronics Limited, was transferred to Nupower Renewables Pvt Ltd, a company owned by her husband Deepak Kochhar, on September 8, 2009, just a day after disbursement of the loan by bank.

Net revenue of Rs 10.65 crore was generated by the NRL from these tainted funds and “proceeds of crime” amounting to Rs 74.65 crore was transferred in NRPL, it said.

Investigation also revealed that Chanda and her family acquired the apartment at Mumbai owned by one of the Videocon Group Companies, by way of acquiring that company through her family trust at a nominal price by creating book entries, the agency said.

“Assets amounting to Rs 74.54 crore held in the name of Nupower Renewables Pvt Ltd and its subsidiaries; flat located at Mumbai (book value of Rs 3.5 crore); and amount of Rs 10.5 lakh already seized by ED from company of Deepak Kochhar, totalling to Rs 78.15 crore being proceeds of crime have been provisionally attached by ED under PMLA,” the ED added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/chanda-kochhar---s-rs-78-cr-assets-seized-for-money-laundering-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/chanda-kochhar---s-rs-78-cr-assets-seized-for-money-laundering.html
204,11-1-20,Shringla would be captain of India-US ties as Foreign Secretary: official,"In his capacity as India's foreign secretary, Harsh Vardhan Shringla would be the ""captain of India-US relationship"", a top American diplomat has said at a farewell reception for the outgoing envoy.

Shringla, who has been appointed as India's next foreign secretary, leaves Washington DC for India over the weekend to assume the responsibilities of his new assignment later this month.

A 1984-batch foreign service officer successfully served as India's Ambassador to the US for about a year.

""We are delighted that Ambassador Shringla will be going on to become Foreign Secretary because in that position we know that we're going to have a captain of the relationship and somebody who will be committed to doing the delicate work that needs to be done to stitch two very important countries together,"" Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia, Alice G Wells, said at the farewell reception.

US Chief of Protocol Can Henderson hosted a rare reception for Shringla at the historic Blair House that was attended by top officials from the White House, Pentagon, State Department, Department of Commerce and the US Trade Representatives.

The Blair House reception for an outgoing envoy is normally reserved only for a few countries. India has emerged as one of them. Previously it was normally done at the Foggy Bottom headquarters of the State Department.

Wells, who is headed to India next week to attend the Raisina Dialogue, said that the two countries have been working for the last two decades to realise the goal of becoming ""a natural partner"", a term that was coined during the tenure of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

""It has been extraordinary, what you have been able to achieve,"" she said.

In his brief remarks, Shringla said: ""The year has been an intense year.

In the second half of the last year, there were as many as four meetings between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump, in addition to the two phone calls between them.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar visited the US twice including the one for the successful 2+2 dialogue in December. The year also saw visits by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Similarly, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited India. To cap it all was the historic Howdy Modi event in Houston wherein Trump joined Modi to address a strong crowd of 50,000 Indian Americans.

""It has been a great tenure, not just by the way of activity, but I think I've enjoyed every moment of the time that I've been here,"" Shringla said as he echoed Prime Minister Narendra Modi in describing United States as India's partner of choice.

""I leave here with the sense that this is one of our most important relationships... The words of our prime minister constantly came to my mind, when he said that the United States is a partner of choice when it comes to the socioeconomic transformation of India through our flagship scheme and initiatives.

""I think that's what is important. As we develop and as we move forward, the US is the country that offers us the means and the ability and the capacity to achieve our objectives in developmental terms, technology terms, investment terms and in every way possible. So, as I go back to New Delhi, we look forward to expanding on the relationship, broadening it and deepening it,"" Shringla added.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shringla-would-be-captain-of-india-us-ties-as-foreign-secretary--official-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/shringla-would-be-captain-of-india-us-ties-as-foreign-secretary--official.html

The CWC calls upon the government to reveal its roadmap for reviving the economy, investors' confidence and job creation, it said.

The party's top decision-making body also called for lifting of curbs and restoration of civil liberties in Jammu and Kashmir.

It also expressed deep concerns over the recent developments in the Gulf region where tensions have spiralled between the US and Iran over the killing of top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cwc-demands-withdrawal-of-caa--stopping-of-npr-process-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/cwc-demands-withdrawal-of-caa--stopping-of-npr-process.html
211,11-1-20,Naval version of Tejas lands on aircraft carrier in major milestone,"The naval version of Tejas aircraft on Saturday made its first landing on the deck of aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, in a major milestone in the development of the aircraft.

Military officials involved in the ""arrested landing"" of the aircraft said the successful test has put India among a select group of nations having the capability to design a jet which can land on an aircraft carrier.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, in a tweet, said the successful landing of the aircraft on INS Vikramaditya is a ""great event"" in the history of Indian fighter aircraft development programme.

He congratulated the DRDO and the Indian Navy for the successful test.

The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is involved in development of the naval variant of Tejas along with Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), Aircraft Research and Design Centre of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd and CSIR among others.

""After completing extensive trials on the shore based test facility, DRDO, ADA developed LCA Navy did an arrested landing on INS Vikramaditya successfully today at 10:02 AM,"" said a DRDO spokesperson.

A similar test was carried out at a shore-based test facility in Goa in September last year.

The naval version of Tejas light combat aircraft is in development stage.

Officials said the successful ""arrested landing"" of the prototype of the naval version of Tejas on the deck of INS Vikramaditya is expected to speed up development of the jet for the Indian Navy.

The Indian Air Force has already inducted a batch of Tejas aircraft.

Initially, the IAF had placed an order with the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for 40 Tejas aircraft.

In 2018, the IAF issued the request for proposal (RFP) to HAL for the procurement of another batch of 83 Tejas at a cost of over Rs 50,000 crore.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/naval-version-of-tejas-lands-on-aircraft-carrier-in-major-milestone-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/naval-version-of-tejas-lands-on-aircraft-carrier-in-major-milestone.html

In an address broadcast by state TV on Saturday, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh says that when he learned about the downing of the plane, which killed all 176 passengers on board, “I wished I were dead.” Iran's armed forces say they mistook the passenger plane for a hostile target in the tense aftermath of Iran's ballistic missile attack on two military bases in Iraq housing US troops.

That attack was retaliation for the killing of Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani, in an American airstrike in Baghdad.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/iran-s-guard-accepts-responsibility-for-plane-shootdown-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/iran-s-guard-accepts-responsibility-for-plane-shootdown.html
214,11-1-20,Noida likely to get police commissioner,"Yogi Govt mulls to introduce police commissionerate in Lucknow also

The Uttar Pradesh Government is seriously contemplating the introduction of police commissionerate system in a phased manner to make crime control system efficient and make police officers directly accountable for law and order.

Initially, the system is likely to be introduced in Lucknow and Gautam Buddha Nagar (Noida), where no district police chiefs have been posted by the Government. While the SSP of Lucknow was transferred, the SSP of Noida was suspended by the Government on Thursday.

“The Government is discussing the commissionerate system for Lucknow and Noida,” Director General of Police OP Singh said on Friday morning.

The system gives more teeth, including magisterial powers, to IPS officers of Inspector General of Police (IG) rank and above, posted as commissioners. The system is in place in 71 cities across 15 States in the country.

As of now, magisterial powers are with District Magistrates and his deputies who are IAS and PCS officers. If the commissionerate system is implemented, District Magistrates will be left with revenue related work and decisions regarding law and order, including giving permission for programmes and issuing various licences would rest with the police commissioners.

The move was initiated earlier also but could not be implemented as IAS and IPS officers were at loggerheads over the issue. In December 2018, former Governor Ram Naik had suggested the State Government to seriously consider introducing the system in the State for improving law and order.

He had given the suggestion in the presence of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath while addressing a function at Reserve Police Lines in Lucknow.

Naik had suggested that the system be introduced on a trial basis in Lucknow, Kanpur and Ghaziabad where the populations exceeded the 20-lakh mark.

Sources confirmed in Lucknow on Friday that the DGP met Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday and submitted a plan for introduction of police commissionerate system in Lucknow and Noida. Now it is up to Yogi Adityanath to take a call.

Speculation over introduction of police commissionerate system in Lucknow and Noida gained steam as the State Government did not post SSPs in both districts.

On Thursday, Noida SSP Vaibhav Krishna was suspended while Lucknow SSP Kalanidhi Naithani was shifted as SSP of Ghaziabad.

Reports further said that IG (Meerut) Alok Singh and IG (Lucknow) SK Bhagat had been asked to take charge of the districts.

Earlier, the previous Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party Governments had tried to introduce the police commissionerate system but the IAS lobby did not allow it, offering several reasons.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/noida-likely-to-get-police-commissioner-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/noida-likely-to-get-police-commissioner.html

218,11-1-20,Looking at history through religious lens dangerous distortion: Kabir Khan,"Distortion of history and freedom fighters getting appropriated by the right wing worries him, says filmmaker Kabir Khan, who believes looking at the country's past through religious lens is dangerous.

Kabir laments this ""unfortunate time"" when new narratives are constantly being spun around and history is being tailored to cater to a certain ideology.

In an interview with PTI, the filmmaker shares how the religious identity of emperors have now become talking points.

""The Mughals have now suddenly become these invaders and this whole 'religious identities of Mughals' is now... Let's face it. Those battles were not about religion, they were about territories.

""They wanted Delhi, you wanted Delhi and a lot of the times they and you were at equal distance from it, both went for it. Sometimes they won, sometimes you won. It was never about religion,"" Kabir says.

Giving an example of Babur, Kabir says he took over Delhi by defeating, not a Rajput Prince, but Ibrahim Lodi.

""Who did the Lodis take over from? The Tughlaqs. They did it from Khalji and it goes back to thousand years. Religion was never the reason they fought. In the medieval history, kings wanted territory and didn't care whether that person was a Hindu, Muslim or Christian.

""Now, those battles are being re-presented and shown to our audiences as a battle of religions, which is the most dangerous and terrible distortion of history,"" he adds.

Kabir has directed the upcoming web series ""The Forgotten Army"" for Amazon Prime, which chronicles the story of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's Indian National Army.

The filmmaker has gone back to present a period of history at a time when the right wing has appropriated Bose, who was a self-described leftist, socialist and against any religious identity.

""The Right has also appropriated Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who had banned them,"" Kabir adds.

When asked how does he see the right wing embracing a figure like Bose, Kabir says he is concerned.

""Netaji would definitely not like the Right to appropriate him. He was very strongly against any kind of religious fundamentalism. We are living in a day and age where social media seems to be our source of information.

""Some people are using it to... As they say, repeat a lie several times and it becomes the truth. It is really uncomfortable that the right wing is appropriating Netaji, because Netaji would be really uncomfortable with it,"" he says.

The ""Bajrangi Bhaijaan"" helmer says this appropriation of Bose is nothing but an attempt to present him as a counterpoint to Jawaharlal Nehru.

""They are doing that, without understanding that the culture, ethos of politicians of that time was that they could have ideological differences but that never led to personal enmity. But, there was no lack of respect there.""

The right wing, Kabir says, does not want people to get into facts.

""The two largest brigades of the Azad Hind Fauj are called the 'Gandhi Brigade' and the 'Nehru Brigade. When Netaji was taking the first military review parade of the Azad Hind Fauj in front of the Singapore city... With General Tojo (of Imperial Japanese Army) standing next to him and 30,000 Indian soldiers marching, there is only one portrait hanging: that of Mahatma Gandhi. Those are the details they would like us not to see.""

""The Forgotten Army"" will stream from January 24.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/looking-at-history-through-religious-lens-dangerous-distortion--kabir-khan-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/looking-at-history-through-religious-lens-dangerous-distortion--kabir-khan.html

Nora feels ""Street Dancer 3D"" will be a push for her career.

220,11-1-20,Oman Sultan Qaboos has died: state media,"Sultan Qaboos, the longest-reigning leader of the modern Arab world, has died at the age of 79, the royal court said Saturday.

""With great sorrow and deep sadness... The royal court mourns His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said, who passed away on Friday,"" the court said in a statement.

Qaboos, who has ruled since 1970 when he deposed his father in a palace coup, had been ill for some time and had been believed to be suffering from colon cancer.

He left no apparent heir. He was unmarried and had no children or brothers.

It is not clear who will succeed Qaboos, whose country has a distinct method of choosing the next ruler.

According to the Omani constitution, the royal family shall, within three days of the throne falling vacant, determine the successor.

If the family does not agree on a name, the person chosen by Qaboos in a letter addressed to the royal family will be the successor.

The sultan should be a member of the royal family, as well as ""Muslim, mature, rational and the legitimate son of Omani Muslim parents"".

Local experts say that more than 80 men meet the criteria, but one name stands: Asad bin Tariq.

Tariq, 65, had been appointed deputy prime minister for international relations and cooperation affairs in 2017.

The move was seen as a clear message of support to the sultan's cousin and ""special representative"" since 2002.

Qaboos transformed the Arabian Peninsula nation from a backwater into a modern state while pursuing a moderate but active foreign policy.

Having played a role in Iran's nuclear deal with world powers while preserving its membership in the Saudi-led Gulf Cooperation Council, Oman has emerged as the Gulf's discreet mediator.

It remains to be seen whether the next ruler will take the same moderate approach in a region often in turmoil.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/oman-sultan-qaboos-has-died--state-media-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/oman-sultan-qaboos-has-died--state-media.html

The deadly blast came three days after a bomb explosion claimed two lives in Quetta.

Reacting to the incident, Prime Minister Khan condemned the explosion and demanded a report.

""I have demanded an immediate report on the condemnable cowardly terrorist attack in Quetta targeting a mosque & people at prayers. Have asked prov govt to ensure all medical facilities are provided to the injured. Martyred DSP Haji Amanullah was a brave & exemplary officer,"" he said on Twitter.

Khan said the best possible treatment would be given to the injured.

The nature of the explosion, which occurred inside the mosque during Maghrib prayers in Ghousabad neighbourhood, was not known.

Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Amanullah was among the 15 people killed in the incident, Quetta Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Abdul Razzaq Cheema said.

According to some media reports, the slain police officer was the likely target.

Last month, unidentified gunmen killed the DSP's son in Quetta, The Express Tribune reported. Twenty others were also injured in the blast, the report said.

Law enforcement agencies have cordoned off the area to investigate the incident.

The mosque, which is located in a densely-populated Pashtun-majority area, was being searched by the bomb disposal squad and security personnel.

TV footage showed debris and shattered glass spread on the floor of the mosque.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast.

Pakistan military's media wing ISPR said that troops of the Frontier Corp (FC) Balochistan have reached the site and were carrying out joint search operation with the police.

223,11-1-20,North Korea says will resume US talks if demands fully met,"North Korea said Saturday it had received Donald Trump's letter wishing a happy birthday to leader Kim Jong Un, but warned it will return to nuclear talks only when Washington fully accepts its demands.

The US president and Kim have held three meetings since June 2018 but negotiations have been largely deadlocked since the breakup of their Hanoi summit last February.

Kim Kye Gwan, North Korea's foreign ministry adviser, said Trump's congratulatory letter had arrived in the isolated, nuclear-armed state directly from the US.

""As acknowledged by the world, it is true that the personal relations between (Kim Jong Un) and President Trump are not bad,"" he said in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency.

However, it would be ""absent-minded"" to expect Pyongyang to resume dialogue because of that warm personal relationship, the statement continued.

""We have been deceived by the US, being caught in the dialogue with it for over one year and a half, and that was the lost time for us,"" the adviser said.

On the gridlocked nuclear talks, he said that reopening dialogue would only be possible in the case of Washington's ""absolute agreement"" on the issues raised by North Korea.

But the senior official was sceptical that the US would accept these demands, saying: ""we know well that the US is neither ready nor able to do so. We know... The way we should go and will go on our way.""

At a meeting of his ruling party in December, Kim Jong Un declared an end to North Korea's moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests.

The leader also threatened a demonstration of a ""new strategic weapon"" soon.

Saturday's statement on KCNA came a day after South Korea's presidential security adviser said Trump had asked Seoul to deliver his birthday message for Kim.

North Korea has never officially confirmed Kim's age or date of birth -- but on January 8, 2014, basketball star Dennis Rodman sang him ""Happy Birthday"" before an exhibition match in Pyongyang.

The adviser warned South Korean authorities against trying to act as a mediator between the US and the North.

""The South Korean authorities had better not dream a fabulous dream that we would return to the dialogue with thankful feelings for the birthday greetings like someone,"" he said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/north-korea-says-will-resume-us-talks-if-demands-fully-met-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/north-korea-says-will-resume-us-talks-if-demands-fully-met.html
224,11-1-20,Ukraine demands punishment for Iran plane downing,"Ukraine on Saturday demanded that Iran punish those guilty for the downing of a Ukrainian airliner and compensate victims while praising Tehran for cooperating with the ""objective"" investigation.

Ukrainian president Volodomyr Zelensky was due to discuss the incident with his Iranian counterpart President Hassan Rouhani at 5:00 pm local time, his press office said.

""We expect Iran... To bring the guilty to the courts,"" the Ukrainian leader wrote on Facebook, calling also for the ""payment of compensation"" and the return of remains.

Tehran admitted Saturday that it accidentally downed the Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) plane, killing all 176 people on board on Wednesday, shortly after launching missiles at bases hosting US forces in Iraq.

Rouhani said Tehran ""deeply regrets this disastrous mistake"".

Tehran has invited the United States, Ukraine, Canada and others to join the crash investigation.

Kiev said that Iran had cooperated with its experts and it expects an objective probe.

Tehran has handed Ukrainian experts enough data including ""all the photos, videos and other materials"" to show the investigation ""will be carried out objectively and promptly,"" Zelensky's office said.

""The political part of the work is finished,"" it added.

It published photos of experts examining the scene and close-ups of holes in the fuselage and shrapnel damage.

Ukraine said Friday its experts dispatched to Iran had been granted access to the flight's black boxes, debris from the plane, the crash site and to recordings of conversations between the pilot and the airport control tower.

Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine's national security and defence council, which is coordinating the probe, told AFP Kiev did not yet have evidence on where the missile was produced, only that it was ""launched from Iranian soil.""

Zelensky said earlier that Ukraine hoped the inquiry would be pursued ""without deliberate delay and without obstruction."" He urged ""total access"" to the full inquiry for the 45 Ukrainian experts, and in a tweet also sought an ""official apology"".

UIA chief Yevhenii Dykhne said at a press conference in Kiev on Saturday that Tehran should have closed the airport due to the escalation of tensions in the region following the US assassination of a top Iranian general.

""It's absolutely irresponsible... If you're playing at war, they were obliged to close the airport,"" Dykhne said.

He wrote on Facebook that the Ukrainian crew and the aircraft ""were the best."" Iran's official IRNA news agency published a statement from the military saying the Boeing 737 was mistaken for a ""hostile plane"" at a time when threats were at the highest level.

The majority of passengers on UIA Flight PS752 from Tehran to Kiev were Iranian-Canadian dual nationals but also included Ukrainians, Afghans, Britons and Swedes Many in Kiev have compared the crash to the 2014 downing of Malaysian Airlines MH17 killing 298 people over eastern Ukraine where pro-Russian separatists are fighting government forces.

Moscow has denied the findings of international investigators that a Russian BUK misile hit the Malaysian flight.

""Iran has shown itself to be more civilised than Russia,"" pro-western Ukraine MP Volodymyr Ariev wrote on Facebook.

225,11-1-20,Bushfires bring fears of 'new normal' to life Down Under,"A grim summer of fire and smoke has sullied Australia's outdoorsy and healthy image, and left many fearful for the future.

For the unfortunate few, three long months of bushfires have brought almost unfathomable pain -- homes lost, lives destroyed, families ripped apart.

But for many millions more the crisis has also shattered the long sunny days typically filled with beaches, barbecues and backyard cricket.

Sporting events were cancelled, windows shuttered against weeks of menacing toxic haze and barbecues banned to prevent even more fires.

Famed beaches like Bondi were partially blackened, as the tide washed the ash of incinerated eucalypts back to shore.

Holidays were cancelled as entire towns were shut off, highways were bumper-to-bumper with fleeing tourists and petrol stations mobbed as fuel ran out during the largest peacetime evacuations the country has ever seen.

""We've seen the whole Australian way of life over summer across the continent upended,"" social researcher Rebecca Huntley, who has surveyed Australia's attitudes to the changing climate, told AFP.

""Instead of looking at the end of the year as a time to relax, (Australians) are getting quite anxious."" Images of military evacuations and frightened families huddled on beaches under red skies have challenged many people's previously idyllic idea of the continent.

Huntley said the severity of the fires was challenging the perception that living in Australia meant having a high quality of life, with Sydney and Melbourne long-ranked as among the most liveable cities in the world.

Now residents have become expert at reading wind forecasts and fire maps to predict whether their kids will be able to play outside tomorrow.

The Christmas dinner table featured debates about specific anti-pollution masks and air purifiers, topics often associated with daily life in New Delhi or Bangkok.

Kate Noble-Judge, whose parents were evacuated from their small New South Wales town over New Year, said the festive season turned into days of dread and worry.

""It wears you down because you feel so helpless. You can't visit because the roads might close or the fires might worsen,"" the Sydney resident told AFP.

""You can't even just go for a walk to take your mind off it because the city is always full of smoke and that eerie orange glow. All you can do is stay at home and worry.""

All the while, the warnings from scientists have been stark. Australia is warming as a result of climate change, with new record temperatures set almost every year.

Catastrophic fire conditions that usually occur once in several decades are becoming the new normal.

""Those sort of conditions will become more frequent under the climate change scenario that we are looking at,"" Richard Thornton, from the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre, told AFP.

""So while they used to be spread many years apart, they'll become more regular. There'll be things we'll need to do to live through the frequent arrival some these sorts of conditions."" Many doctors say they cannot know what the impact of prolonged exposure to bushfire smoke will be.

With volunteer firefighters -- the main service battling the blazes -- already exhausted from months of work as climate change extends the fire season, Huntley said tackling emergencies rather than enjoying a vacation could define future summer seasons.

""It may be that Christmas might not be a time where you relax. You may have a posting in the country where you help with bushfire support,"" she said.

David Bowman, a pyrogeography and fire science expert at the University of Tasmania, recently speculated how Australians' daily life may change.

He called for rescheduling the peak holiday period to March-April instead of December-January, suggesting it was ""absurd"" to send thousands of tourists to bushfire prone coastal areas each year.

""It's easy to dismiss this idea as stupid but that's the nature of adaptation. Things that once seemed absurd will now need serious consideration.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bushfires-bring-fears-of--new-normal--to-life-down-under-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/bushfires-bring-fears-of--new-normal--to-life-down-under.html

227,11-1-20,Galaxy Bloom is Samsung's new foldable phone: Report,"Samsung is expected to launch its next-gen Galaxy Fold along with Galaxy S11 or S20 on February 11 at an event in San Francisco and now a new report claims that the next foldable is going to be called Galaxy Bloom.

Samsung apparently showcased the device to partners and carriers at a secret meeting held at CES 2020 in Las Vegas. During the meeting, Samsung revealed that its upcoming foldable phone will be called the Galaxy Bloom, news portal androidcentral.com reported recently.

The device will be able to record 8K video, and a 5G version will be released in South Korea.

Famed leakster Ice Universe had earlier claimed that the upcoming fold may have an ""ultra-thin glass display"" instead of plastic.

The South Korean tech giant had also applied for trademarks in Europe for Samsung Ultra Thin Glass or UTG and according to sources, this will be the material used for its next foldable.

The upcoming foldable phone is expected to cost around $1,000.

The current Galaxy Fold handset is priced at nearly $2,000 which is not an amount most people are willing to pay and is not accessible to a larger segment of the population.

Additionally, tipster Ice Universe (@UniverseIce) recently shared a tweet saying that instead of opting for S11e, S11 and S11+ nomenclature, the company would opt for S20, S20+ and S20 Ultra naming for its flagship series. This means that Galaxy S20 will succeed S10e and S20+ will succeed S10.

In terms of specifications, the upcoming smartphones will use an Exynos 990 in some markets and a Snapdragon 865 in the majority of markets.

The base variant, that is, Galaxy S20 is expected to feature a 6.2-inch screen, S20+ is expected to sport a 6.7-inch screen.

Meanwhile, the top variant Galaxy 20 Ultra is likely to come with a 6.9-inch screen.

228,11-1-20,"Galaxy S10 Lite to cost Rs 39,990, pre-order from Jan 23","Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite that will be available in India in the first week of February for Rs 39,999 can be pre-ordered on Flipkart from January 23.

The e-commerce platform has set up a landing page that reveals the pre-order date for Galaxy S10 Lite.

The much-anticipated device in one variant is likely to cost Rs 39,999 -- giving Chinese player OnePlus a tough competition in this price segment, industry sources told IANS on Saturday.

The smartphone will give a renewed push to Samsung's strategy in the premium segment (priced above Rs 30,000), where its flagship smartphones Galaxy S and Note series have traditionally done very well.

Galaxy S10 Lite will house 48MP main camera, 12MP 'Ultra Wide' and 5MP 'Macro' sensors alongside the new 'Super Steady OIS (optical image stabilisation)'. The device will feature a 32MP Selfie camera.

The device will come with 6.7-inch, edge-to-edge Infinity-O display, large 4,500mAh battery with super-fast charging and Samsung's ecosystem of apps and services, including Samsung Pay.

Samsung announced new Galaxy S10 Lite along with another flagship Galaxy Note10 Lite smartphone earlier this month.

Galaxy Note 10 Lite comes with a 6.70-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 1080x2400 pixels at a pixel density of 394 pixels per inch (ppi).

It comes with 6GB RAM, runs Android 10 and is powered by a 4500mAh non-removable battery. Note 10 Lite on the rear packs a 12MP primary camera, a secondary 12MP camera and a third 12MP sensor. The device sports a 32MP camera on the front.

229,11-1-20,All-round India thrash Sri Lanka by 78 runs to win series 2-0,"Shikhar Dhawan silenced his critics, KL Rahul sizzled as usual and the trio of fast bowlers were intimidating in India's one-sided 78-run victory over Sri Lanka in the third T20 International on Friday, sealing the series 2-0.

India were sent into bat by Sri Lanka captain Lasith Malinga but on a flat track, the hosts managed an above-par 201 for 6, largely due to Dhawan (52 off 36 balls) and Rahul's (54 off 36 balls) opening stand of 97 in little less than 11 overs.

Shardul Thakur (21 not out off 8 balls) used his long handle to a good effect and Manish Pandey (31 off 18 balls) hardly showed any rustiness adding 37 runs in final 2.2 overs to take the score past 200-run mark.

In reply, Sri Lanka managed only 123 runs in 15.5 overs as there was simply no resistance from the islanders with the gulf in class being so evident in a lopsided contest. Eight Sri Lankan batsmen failed to reach double figures with Dhananjaya De Silva (51) and Angelo Mathews (31) adding 68 for the fifth wicket.

They lost four wickets in the Powerplay overs and there was no coming back from that position. It was primarily due to the pace and bounce generated by Jasprit Bumrah (1/5 in 2 overs), Shardul Thakur (2/19 in 3 overs) and the ever-improving Navdeep Saini (3/28 in 3.5 overs), who again bowled an unplayable yorker to get Kusal Perera out.

In fact, skipper Virat Kohli could be lauded for promoting Sanju Samson (6) and Pandey, who have been benched for the longest time. While Samson fluffed his lines, Pandey did his case no harm with a useful knock towards the end.

""One thing was always in the back of my head that down the line somewhere I will get a game and I was ready for it. That's what the coaches told me also. Got my chance today, had a good partnership with Shardul,"" Pandey said after the match.

""I was batting well in the domestic season and the nets, so I knew I had to be ready when I got my chances. I had to deliver. You keep working on yourself.""

Put into bat, Dhawan, who has been under pressure for some time smashed seven boundaries and a six in his 97-run opening stand with the in-form Rahul who also hit an over boundary along with five fours.

However, the hosts suffered a middle-order collapse with Sri Lankan wrist spinners Wanidu Hasaranga (1-27) and chinaman Lakshan Sandakan (3-35) spun their web around the batsmen on a flat track.

But Pandey, playing his first game of the tournament and Thakur once again revelling in his role as a lower-order pinch-hitter (22 not out off 8 balls; 1x4, 2x6) ensured that the hosts crossed 200-run mark.

Rahul set the tone playing a cut shot off rival skipper Lasith Malinga for his first boundary. Dhawan got an early 'life', when Dasun Shanaka dropped one at deep square leg. Rahul, then hit two consecutive boundaries, both drives, off Angelo Mathews as India raced to 22/0.

The visitors introduced off-spinner Dhananjaya De Silva in the fourth over, but Dhawan welcomed him with a four over long-on. Rahul then dispatched a Silva full-toss over long leg for a maximum as India amassed 13 runs in it.

Dhawan changed his gears as he hammered two boundaries in fifth over as India reached team total of 50.

Making optimum use of the life, Dhawan smashed back-to-back fours, slashing one over backward point and another through extra cover off pacer Lahiru Kumara. The duo was coasting along well as India after 9 overs were 82/0.

After two quiet overs, Dhawan smashed Hasaranga over deep mid-wicket for a six.

Soon after completing his 10th T20I fifty, Dhawan perished after giving a sitter to Dhanushka Gunathilika off Sandakan at deep mid-wicket. However his innings certainly will make Virat Kohli's choice of Rohit Sharma's partner difficult for the upcoming Australia series.

Sanju Samson (6) got his much-awaited chance as he was promoted at No 3 and smashed a six on the first ball but was trapped in the front by Hasaranga as India slumped to 106/2.

Sandakan then pegged back the hosts by removing Rahul and Shreyas Iyer (4) in the 13th over as the hosts were in spot of bother at 122/4. While Rahul was stumped, Shreyas gave a return return catch to Sandakan.

However, then skipper Kohli (26 off 17 balls, 2x4; 1x6) and Pandey tried to rally the innings before Kohli and Washington Sundar (0) were dismissed in the 18th over. But Shardul's slogging got India past par-score mark.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/all-round-india-thrash-sri-lanka-by-78-runs-to-win-series-2-0-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/all-round-india-thrash-sri-lanka-by-78-runs-to-win-series-2-0.html
230,11-1-20,"We want to win regularly even while batting first, says Dhawan","Shikhar Dhawan says India are seeking complete mastery over defending totals, the ambition prompting them to make a ""conscious"" decision to bat first on winning the toss in a T20 World Cup year.

Invited to bat, India scored 201 for six before crushing Sri Lanka by 78 runs in the third T20 International here on Friday.

Dhawan said that as a unit, the team wanted to bat first.

""Today we wanted to bat first because we want to refine ourselves more while batting first and winning more games, so that brings more confidence,"" the opener said.

""So that is why, consciously, we are doing it and the result is in front of you that we are winning even while batting first.

""We are making (setting) big targets and that brings a lot of confidence to us as a team.""

The Indian team management is looking at trying out different players for the pivotal number three position ahead of the mega event in Australia later this year, Dhawan said.

India sprang a surprise when they promoted Sanju Samson at number three ahead of skipper Virat Kohli in the third match.

India have tried six different players at the crucial number three spot in the last six matches.

Asked about it, Dhawan said, ""I'm sure the management wants to try players. Today also we wanted to try other players who haven't batted in the series and give them a fair chance because we're only left with five T20 (actually over 12) games.

""As a team, we wanted to give chance to everyone and that's why they've been rotating players. Till World Cup comes, everyone is refined and know their job as well.""

Samson, who just played his second T20 after 2015, scored just six.

Dhawan was then specifically asked whether the move by the team management was to give every player game time or there was a plan B for World Cup. To which he said, the idea was to give players more time in the middle.

""It is more to give players (time), like how Sanju Samson came in today (at number 3), then Shreyas (Iyer), so they can get more time in the middle, because it is a totally different field when you are batting in the match and having more overs and so that was the reason today.

""And last game was quite normal and before that I was not in the team, so I didn't watch matches as well and I didn't knew what was happening. But today's one I can tell say that that was the reason.

""Even Manish Pandey went up. So they can have more time, otherwise same pattern going on,"" Dhawan said, explaining the management's rationale.

Even Pandey, who was warming up the bench series after series, played a responsible knock after being sent in at No. 4.

Dhawan also felt that the series like the one against Sri Lanka was ideal for experimentation.

""In these series we can do the experiment, it is best time to experiment and once we know that this guy is clicking, then we are going to go ahead with those pattern again, because No. 1 2 3 we always know who is going to come.

""That is why it is important to experiment and we can take that risk right now, like we won the first match,"" he added.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/we-want-to-win-regularly-even-while-batting-first--says-dhawan-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/we-want-to-win-regularly-even-while-batting-first--says-dhawan.html
