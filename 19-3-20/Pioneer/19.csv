0,19-3-20,Milking the men in uniform,"The global wave of uber nationalistic politics has accelerated exclusivism, polarisation and divides that are normally an anathema to the inclusive and apolitical moorings of a soldier

In participative democracies, the principle of civilian supremacy over the military is both mandated and essential. In democracies like the US and India, which have active combat commitments towards the armed forces, the orders to partake, intensify or withdraw from such roles ultimately come from the civilian leadership. This lends itself to strategic and operational situations where the military has to abide by civilian orders even where it disagrees as the latter has the “right to be wrong.” Such disagreements have led to subliminal civilian-military tensions, which are natural and expected in the normal course of professional disagreements.

By constructive design, the military has a black and white instinct of situational imperatives, which are supremely effective, kinetic and blunt. Whereas by nature, a political decision is more complex, asymmetric and given to the “unapparent.” This implies that the military may pay the price for partisan politics that comes along with the decision-making process in democracies. Yet, the most compelling argument for persisting with this imperfect civil-military equation is the alternative track record of nations, where the military has the last word on governance matters. The ideal leadership requirement for civilian politicians is in maintaining professional respect, mature restraint and operational independence of the military so as to ensure that its apolitical discipline, efficacy and steel is maintained.

In recent times, unrest and violence in society has posited the public faith and trust onto the “soldier” even higher when all other arms of governance seem to have failed. Unfortunately, the Indian armed forces, who ought to be the “last recourse” of the Government, are getting increasingly requisitioned to bail out the beleaguered State as it fumbles from one man-made or natural disaster to another. They have been doing it all — from fighting insurgency in Kashmir to quelling communal riots in Delhi to setting up Coronavirus-related camps across country. The “soldier” seems to epitomise solutions for all societal, natural or national urgencies.

However, this public imagination and perception of the “soldier” has not gone unnoticed to the overzealous politicians, who are increasingly and unhealthily co-opting the imagery of the “soldier” onto their own image, policies and posturings. This situation could potentially narrow the required distance and apolitical bearing of the armed forces as it risks pushing the “soldier” towards political opinions, preferences and biases. Xenophobically nationalistic and self-obsessed leaders like US President Donald Trump typify the sort of political leadership that milks the image of the “soldier” as he tries to justify his tenure decisions — for them, populism, even at the cost of long-term impact on the armed forces, is par for the course.

The recent case involving the Special Warfare Operator chief, Eddie Gallagher of the elite US Navy SEALs (Sea, Air and Land) team, is symptomatic of the political interferences in an institution that prides itself on discipline, command and ethos of the warfighters. These “frogmen” are the ultimate warriors of covert operations, who had earlier “taken out” Osama bin Laden and conducted many other acts of daredevilry. The SEALs personify the finest soldering, training, culture and compliances that are required to undertake complex and dangerous missions.

The SEALs wear a revered pin called the “trident” or “the bird,” which is freighted with incalculable heft and pride on the chest of a serving officer. It is extremely hard-earned and easy to lose, should one fail to live up to its exacting physical, moral and psychological standards. Rear Admiral Collin Green, as the Commander of Naval Special Warfare Command (which oversees SEALs and their special operations and missions), had sought to withdraw the symbolic pin from the errant SEAL, Eddie Gallagher, as he found his conduct unbecoming.

Rear Admiral Green was keen to clear the Augean stable of war crimes, murder, drug issues and sexual assaults among others that had tainted the institution in recent times. The open-and-shut case of Eddie Gallagher had been one such professional dereliction that warranted corrective disciplining.

Unfortunately, this incident offered Trump an opportunity to exhibit his misplaced sense of political “muscularity” by defending the errant SEAL, much against the professional assessment of his Commander and the institution of the armed forces. Amid disconcerting murmurs, Rear Admiral Green had to acquiesce to the presidential and unwarranted political intervention in a routine disciplinary case. His professional concerns of the “ethically misaligned” combatants were rubbished and the dignified “soldier” was left with no option but to step down earlier than required. Military culture lost, politics won.

Creating divisions within the uniformed fraternity may result in short-term political benefits for politicians but it could immeasurably weaken the sword-arm of the nation. Certain institutions and entities need to be spared the interferences and appropriations that are borne out of compulsive politicisation and partisan one-upmanship. Such misplaced political enthusiasm needs to be nipped in the bud, else politicians get emboldened by their own liberties and recklessness. Trump has unconvincingly posited his intervention towards “sticking up for our armed forces” — nothing could be further from the truth as command-and-control and unimpeachable discipline are the backbone of military professionalism. Trump will most probably be replacing Green with another two-star SEAL, Wyman Howard, who has a questionable past. He is said to have encouraged his men to carry hatchets during combat deployments.

Politicians do not understand the intricacies, sensitivities and traditions of the armed forces. To them, the “soldier” serves the limited utility of contextualising political decisions “in the interest of the soldier” and thereby, “in the best interest of the nation.” A global wave of uber nationalistic politics has accelerated these tendencies of exclusivism, polarisation and “divides” that are normally an anathema to the inclusive, apolitical and simple moorings of a soldier, who swears by his paltan (battalion), regiment and to the nation. Ever-increasing operational deployments, invocations and allusions have exposed the “soldier” to the societal morass that prevails. The duty to protect the “soldier” from political misuse is one of every serving soldier and veteran. Militaries that avowedly shun political appropriations remain strong and professional. Those that don’t, resemble political parties.

1,19-3-20,Gogoi's new run,"The former CJI’s nomination to RS is not surprising but raises questions on propriety and independence of judiciary

Ostensibly, there is nothing technically wrong with ex-Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi accepting a presidential nomination to become a Rajya Sabha member. Given his extensive domain knowledge and experience of the law, he does qualify to be a notable who can contribute valuably to the Upper House. He is, in the end, somebody who has excelled in society in his chosen field. There’s no shortcoming there. Also, he is not the first retired Chief Justice to have benefitted from the executive’s munificence; there have been others propped up by several regimes before him as a reward for services that were “friendly” to them. If whataboutery is the logic, he can quote precedence. And we know he knows his law. There’s enough counter-logic going around as to how Justice S Fazl Ali was the first Supreme Court judge to be made Orissa Governor in 1952 and was the beginning of the Congress’ endorsements of judicial luminaries that continued till the party was in power. From Assam itself, there’s the example of Justice Baharul Islam, who began as an advocate in the Assam High Court in the early 1950s and went on to serve a decade-long term as Rajya Sabha member. As far as controversial rulings go, then the Congress suitably accommodated former Chief Justice Ranganath Misra, who gave a clean chit to the Rajiv Gandhi-led Congress in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case. After his retirement, he was made the first chairman of the National Human Rights Commission and was even elected to the Rajya Sabha on a Congress ticket in 1998. The examples are so many that at one time, there was much debate over how judges should not be encouraged to take up the offer of the Government’s post-retirement benefits, like heading commissions of inquiry, simply because that could cloud their impartial judgments and colour their opinions in sensitive cases. Why then is there such deep discomfort about Gogoi’s induction in the Rajya Sabha, that, too, in a position that is much lower than the Chief Justice of India? Is it because of the immediacy of the appointment, barely allowing for a cooling off period, one that would not have led to deductions that he was being rewarded for favourable judgments, be it in Rafale or Ayodhya? Or is it because of a lack of pretence and propriety in the face of the ruling BJP’s brazenness in protecting its favourites?

Yet nobody is holding the party to account simply because it is doing what the Congress did for so long. But there’s much criticism of Gogoi because he was at one time considered a “rebel” judge and, therefore, now looks like a test case of how the institution of the executive superseded that of the judiciary and a one-time warrior appeared to have fallen in line. Remember the time when Gogoi — then the seniormost after the then Chief Justice Dipak Misra – held a press conference in January 2018 to express concern over the arbitrary manner in which Misra was running the top court? He had specifically made a reference to the selective allocation of sensitive files. Therefore, there was a sense of expectation built around him, one of them being that he would ensure the independence of the judiciary. There was faith he would not be coopted by an executive that was backed by a mammoth electoral verdict and could heave upon reasoned judgment calls as not being in sync with the times. Subsequent judgments have replaced the crusader halo with a shadow. For somebody who spoke against the roster system of his predecessor, he was seen as ensuring the Government line held ground in most politically-sensitive cases. Perhaps, Gogoi could have got some of his old glow back had he refused such an offer, knowing full well that he was landing himself in another controversy. Nobody better than him knows that Rajya Sabha nominations are quid pro quo for services rendered to the regime of the day. He perhaps could have waited to take up some national-level commission instead and not seemed so desperate. But Gogoi justified his acceptance saying, “It would be an opportunity to project the views of the judiciary before the legislature and vice versa.” He could argue that this being a presidential nomination, he was, again technically speaking, independent of political affiliations and could act as the “conscience keeper” of the nation. Perhaps, he wants to retrospectively decide to be true to his oath and “bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution” and perform duties “without fear or favour.” Only time will tell whether he scores a moral victory by trying to fight the challenging circumstances of politically charged times as a respected citizen of India. Or whether we are judging him too harshly for eroding an institution.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/gogoi-s-new-run-2020-03-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/gogoi-s-new-run.html
2,19-3-20,Put religion on hold,"The spread of COVID-19 among Shia devotees in Iran should give all religious bodies food for thought

COVID-19, a global pandemic triggered by a virus that emerged in China late last year, has had several fascinating story threads. First in list is the Wuhan-based ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, who tried to alert the Chinese authorities about the spread of the disease before it became a critical issue but was instead censured, although in death, he has become a national hero. Then there is the story of the “31st case” in South Korea, about a woman member of a cult who became a “super spreader” and was linked to almost 80 per cent of the 8,000 plus cases registered in that country. Thankfully, strict action and information transmission by authorities managed to slow down the spread and contain fatalities, too. In Iran, however, inaction on the part of the authorities in closing major sites of Shia worship has led to a national catastrophe. Coronavirus cases have exceeded 17,000 and over 1,700 deaths have been reported officially. A large number of the 255 Indians diagnosed with the virus are believed to be Shia pilgrims, many of whom had visited Qom. Opposition to closing religious sites by both religious authorities and politicians has clearly led to this crisis. Fanatical devotees have not made things easier.

India should learn lessons from both Iran and South Korea as well as the Vatican, which has even cancelled Easter festivities this year. The Maharashtra Government has taken a positive step by closing the Shri Siddhi Vinayak temple in central Mumbai. Other State Governments must follow suit. Major temples, masjids, gurudwaras, churches and other religious sites must be shut down. On this front, the Government has to be completely secular. Major religious celebrations must be curtailed, if not postponed, such as the Uttar Pradesh Government’s plans of a big Ram Navami celebration, the first one since the Supreme Court paved the way for the construction of a new temple in Ayodhya. In Tirupati, even though the authorities wanted to restrict the entry of devotees, more have thronged. This highlights the fact that in times of crisis, people turn to their gods. But devotees must be made to understand that their god is not running away. Like global civil aviation, religion, too, is a major vector for the spread of this disease. If “flattening the curve”, as authorities desire, is to be achieved, then organised religion has to be curtailed this time. Not everybody will agree but faith is in the mind and not prostrating oneself at a holy site. The latter can wait awhile.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/put-religion-on-hold-2020-03-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/put-religion-on-hold.html
3,19-3-20,All out efforts for tribal development in MP,"Envisioning fast paced development of the community, the Kamal Nath Government in Madhya Pradesh has launched various initiatives for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes.

Home to a vast population of indigenous people, the state government efforts, spread across financial, social and academic welfare, are geared towards integration of the Scheduled Tribes (STs) into the mainstream.

Enumerating welfare initiatives, officials at the state tribal development department say that a huge impetus has been placed on the education of tribal youth.

A range of scholarships have been made available to youth belonging to the scheduled tribes. Apart from pre-matriculation and post-matriculation scholarships, provisions have also been made to help community members study abroad.

In an attempt to boost enrollments of students belonging to the community in premier institutions, free coaching is being provided to 800 students preparing for competitive examinations like the JEE, NEET and CLAT.

Pushing for an improvement in female literacy, the department currently operates 73 ‘Kanya Shiksha Parisars’ with an enrollment capacity of 490 students each. Development of another nine such campuses is currently underway.

A budget of Rs 1.09 Lakh has been set for each student enrolled at Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS) in the state. The EMRS are residential schools established and managed with financial assistance from the Government of India.

Nine Kanya Shiksha Parisar and four Gurukul campuses, run by the state government, have been upgraded into Eklavya Schools in consultation with the Central Government. Budgetary allocations of Rs 13.08 crore have been made for the construction of auditoriums at 12 Eklavya campuses.

Retaining a special focus on the uplift of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTG) like Sahariya,

Bhariya and Baiga, the Kamal Nath Government disburses Rs 1,000 per month directly to the bank account of the female head of each family belonging to these groups with a vision to arrest malnutrition among community members.

The PVTGs, earlier referred to as Primitive Tribal Groups, are Scheduled Tribes which continue to reflect the lowest levels of development, and are normally involved in a pre agricultural system existence like hunting and gathering.

The state government has further sanctioned allocations of Rs.18.5 crores for the proposed tribal development and cultural center for the PVTGs. Construction of the center is currently underway in the State Capital.

Computer training facilities have been established in districts with the highest concentration of PVTG tribes at a cost of Rs 29.5 crores. The State Government also provides financial assistance to members of poor Tribal communities in order to help them fulfill their social obligations at times of a birth or demise in the family.

Indigenous people form a vast part of the citizenry in the state. 89 of the total 313 development blocks in Madhya Pradesh are earmarked as tribal areas. Taking a strong view of ruthless money lending which often results in the lender usurping the meager lands of these vulnerable groups, Madhya Pradesh has a blanket ban on the sale of tribal land to non-tribals.

Reflecting his understanding of the challenges faced by Scheduled Tribes, Chief Minister Kamal Nath has annulled all loans given to community members by unlicensed moneylenders. The State Government is further mulling policy to comprehensively wipeout the debt burden of these vulnerable groups.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/all-out-efforts-for-tribal-development-in-mp.html
4,19-3-20,"Masks, sanitisers must for ration sellers","The State Government has issued detailed guidelines to protect consumers from the infection of Novel Corona virus at ration shops of public distribution system. Use of masks and sanitisers has been made mandatory for the ration seller.

The Director, Food-Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection, Avinash Lavania, has asked the vendors of ration shops to open shops regularly and distribute ration to the eligible families regularly. Consumers must not be allowed to throng the shop and should stay at the required distance from each other. While distributing the ration, a minimum distance of 3 metres should be kept between the beneficiaries. Arrangements should be made so that as far as possible, old and sick consumers do not have to come to the shop to get ration. If such beneficiaries still come to the shop, their line should be set up separately and ration distribution should be done to them on priority basis.

Ration shopkeepers have been asked to clean the machine scanner with sanitiser after distribution of ration to each consumer based on biometric verification. For this, sufficient amount of sanitiser should be kept at the shop. Facility to get ration in the coming month also should be provided to the consumers who have difficulty in biometric verification. Instructions have been issued that vendors and helpers at every PDS shop must use masks while distributing ration and also clean their hands frequently with sanitiser.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/masks--sanitisers-must-for-ration-sellers.html

7,19-3-20,Wolves in sheep’s clothing,"An increasing number of purely business ideas is being masqueraded as social innovation. Thus several false trappings of innovation are being embraced over truly innovative ideas

The field of social entrepreneurship has attracted great global interest on account of its role in providing sustainable solutions for addressing a diverse range of complex and stubborn environmental and social problems and the systems that perpetuate them. Social entrepreneurs are drawn by a variety of social missions and are passionate about tackling a problem, have an idea for a solution and the determination to make that solution happen. This fertile field has given rise to extraordinarily ingenious people, who have conjured brilliant ideas and used them with operational prowess to dramatically improve people’s lives. At the core of social entrepreneurship is the recognition of a new mindset — that believes in an agenda oriented around making the world a more just and equal place.

Social entrepreneurship is an appealing construct precisely because it gives primacy to social benefits while at the same time remaining firmly grounded in sound financial principles. Finding the balance between social purpose and commercial viability remains the toughest challenge for any social entrepreneur.

The social entrepreneurship community has now a big tent and a major challenge is to protect the purity of its mission. It is tragic that we are witnessing an unsavory and disconcerting trend which is muddying the waters and putting this noble field under strain. An increasing number of purely business ideas is being masqueraded as social innovation. Thus several false trappings of innovation are being embraced over truly innovative ideas. Resources are squandered when the innovation’s actual capabilities fall short of its promise. We now have so many “lost Einsteins” because the proliferation of so many so-called social innovations is obscuring several genuine ones who are left to languish.

Several so-called entrepreneurs are being hailed as saviours and game changers when the impact and outcome of their work is nowhere near proven — still less studied are the damaging, unintended consequences of their enterprise. In many cases, their mission is not their work — but they themselves. There is a huge mismatch between rhetoric and reality — as is the misalignment between their personal lifestyle and the public stance about the poor, leading to a pervasive loss of trust.

Trust is the currency that facilitates every social transaction. Without trust, society risks moral bankruptcy. We cannot take trust for granted. It must be earned in all we do, every day. These new social climbers must be made to understand that the poor cannot be used as raw material for individual or corporate salvation. Microfinance was once hailed as one of the most revolutionary ideas of the century. But rigorous studies have demonstrated that microfinance, more particularly microcredit, has only a modest role in improving the lives of the poor. Microcredit is so longer an ally in a social entrepreneur’s toolbox.

Since the term social innovation is still quite amorphous, several business leaders are conflating it to cover even purely profit-driven inventions. One of the prime determiners of meaningfulness and relevance of the innovations is their affordability to end-users while being sustainable for the providers also. An initial subsidy for training support is alright but in the long run the providers must be able to meet costs .

Technology is an unmixed blessing. All technological change is a trade-off and may be better termed as a Faustian bargain. Alan Moore once said, “Technology is always a two-edged sword. It will bring in many benefits but also many disasters. For every advantage a new technology offers, there is always a corresponding disadvantage. These are unevenly distributed among the population. Some benefit, while some others are harmed. The consequences of the changes are vast and unpredictable and often irreversible. It is in this context that Bertrand Russell warned that “unless men increase in wisdom as much as in knowledge, increase of knowledge will be increase of sorrow”.

Poor societies have long been used as guinea pigs by development scientists. This is perfectly alright as long as the objectives are fair and rational. But the emergence of a tribe that sees the world through a business lens and wants to use vulnerable communities as a constituency for furthering its commercial goals has set the activist camps on fire. The avowed social mission of these self-serving entrepreneurs is meant to camouflage their rapacious business interests. In this pursuit, they are using their semantic skills to justify their action by garbing the wolfish acts in sheep’s clothing. Social science tends to focus on average outcomes and makes little allowance for negative tail-end effects. Most modern entrepreneurs are products of business schools where the training is focussed on maximising shareholder value with limited understanding of ethical and social considerations essential to a truly visionary leadership.

The key to compassionate and sustainable capitalism is reasonable profits as opposed to maximisation of profits. In the present system, one section of society is trying to maximise profits, totally unconcerned with the consequences it is having on the well-being of the larger society, while one section is investing its time and effort in dealing with the fallout. The system is not working. There are now people, particularly among the socially conscious ones, who are embracing the notion of “entrepreneurship for society” rather than “commercial” or “social” entrepreneurship.

There is no that doubt that millions of people lack access to basic services but there are ethical questions when products and services are tested and sold in the guise of a public service. Everyone has heard depressingly familiar tales of poor and uneducated people saying how privileged they were made to feel as they were suddenly offered the chance to receive medicines and nutritious food they couldn’t usually afford. Such interventions are in many cases part of clinical or field trials. These people are chosen because they do not understand their implications and agree to them without any fuss.

Every social innovation normally involves an unsettling of the status quo and reordering of the social ecosystem — and these disruptions may impose new costs for some members of a community or elements of an ecosystem. Yet, when the impact is measured, there’s a tendency to avoid assessing the full range of positive and negative impacts and to only focus on measurable effects within the “good part of the impact spectrum”, which is what is crucial to mobilise investment. Much less effort is put in for measuring the potential negatives, which are critical to the perspective of the user community. While it is true that several innovations become useful after a period of refinement, the final impact can only be measured by understanding the damage caused during the transition. Innovators must give importance to this window before scaling up and take measures to minimise the negative consequences.

Ideas that generate commercial dividends along with even bare social dividends charm investors — the investors and political actors who are now important players in the ecosystem. Most innovations are measured in terms of their business worth and how effectively they can be pitched to the investment world. The language of innovation is getting increasingly grounded in financial logic.

In their book Poor Economics, Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee have listed hundreds of “common sense” development projects — micro insurance, housing, food aid, microcredit — those either don’t help poor people or make them poorer. Many of the serious problems of farmers and the rural poor are largely a result of misguided projects that have severely impaired the local ecology, leading to soil degradation, acute shortage of water, and resistant pests. There are several policies which have novel features that are not organically integrated. They have excellent ingredients but have to be meshed in proper proportions so that they make an effective recipe. A policy must be seen as a living organism where each organ has its own unique role

Every society is going through different stages of development and the necessary solutions and interventions must be appropriate for its unique cultural and economic context. By respecting the cultural outlook of the people and embracing their concerns we enlist their buy-in and that is what paves the way for enduring and sustainable success.

8,19-3-20,Boris’ sinister Coronavirus plan,"The problem is that this would kill a great many Britons for nothing if Johnson is wrong — which most experts think he is

I must level with the British public. Many more families are going to lose their loved ones before their time,” said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on March 11.

“Just stay calm. It will go away,” said US President Donald Trump, March 10.

The contrast between the two major populist leaders of the English-speaking world could not have been greater. Donald Trump, who spent two months dismissing the Covid-19 virus as a “hoax” cooked up by his opponents to crash the market and scupper his re-election chances, finally did an about-face on March 13 and declared a “national emergency.” But on Sunday he was still fantasising that “we have tremendous control” over the virus.

Johnson, on the other hand, assumed a grave manner as he delivered the bad news. It’s serious, many people will die but we do have a plan. The problem is that the plan would kill a great many Britons for nothing if he is wrong — which most experts think he is. “When I heard about Britain’s herd immunity Coronavirus plan, I thought it was satire,” epidemiologist William Hanage of Harvard University told The Guardian on Sunday. But it is deadly serious. Boris Johnson, unlike Donald Trump, listens to scientists but the ones he listens to most, Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and Chief Medical Adviser Chris Whitty, have a plan that most other experts think is crazy. “Herd immunity” occurs when a large majority of the community has acquired immunity to a disease. That breaks the chain of transmission for the virus in question and even those without immunity are fairly safe so long as their numbers stay low. So this is Boris’ cunning plan.

Let the coronavirus spread until around 60 per cent of the population has acquired and survived it. Then the dreaded “second wave” of the epidemic will not happen, because herd immunity will protect everybody. Alas, there are a few flaws in this plan.

For starters, 60 per cent of the British population is about 40 million people. Only 0.2 per cent of adults under 40 who contract Covid-19 die from it (and those under 10 don’t get sick at all). The death rate goes up steeply for older age groups but even for those in their 60s it’s only 3.6 per cent. So for all the under-70s it’s only — hang on a minute, that’s 445,000 deaths. More than British military deaths in World War-II. That’s assuming that Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) can give intensive care to all the severe cases of Covid-19. If the UK follows the pattern in China, around one in five Coronavirus patients will need intensive care to recover. One in five of 40 million people is eight million.

The number of beds in intensive care units (ICUs) in British hospitals is 4,300. Maybe the NHS can improvise 10,000 more, but it still wouldn’t go far if up to eight million severely-ill patients need ICU beds this year, each for weeks at a time. Many more than 445,000 would die. The whole scheme is lunacy — and we still haven’t got to the plan for the over-70s.

The death rate from Covid-19 for people in their 70s is eight per cent. For 80 and over, it’s at least 15 per cent. So while everybody under 70 takes their chances with the virus, all those over 70 must self-isolate for four months. Moreover, there may be unknown after-effects of having Covid-19, like getting shingles decades after you had chickenpox. There are reports of lung damage in many survivors. Re-infection may be possible: Infected people have tested positive again after being discharged negative. Why don’t we give Covid-19 to 40 million people and see what happens?

Now, it’s possible that Boris Johnson’s advisers are right and everybody else is wrong. Maybe there is a devastating “second wave” coming next winter and this bizarre plan is the only way to stop it. But we don’t even know if Covid-19 will have a second wave. There wasn’t with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a similar Coronavirus. As William Hanage said, “Vulnerable people should not be exposed to a virus right now in the service of a hypothetical future.”

Elsewhere, there’s a dramatic fall in the number of new infections in Asian countries that started testing, contact tracing and social distancing early on. China has had 81,000 cases but on Monday reported only seven new cases.

No official will say this aloud but Britain is deliberately neglecting all that and letting the infections rip. Testing, contact tracing and social distancing may turn out to be ineffective: Infections may pick up again in other countries when the rules are finally relaxed. (280 million Chinese went back to work recently after two months of lockdown). But that strategy is certainly worth a try, whereas Johnson, in the words of Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of leading British medical journal The Lancet, is “playing roulette with the public.”

So not all that much difference between the mini-Trump and the real thing after all. And the “herd immunity” nonsense won’t last much longer. The British public is starting to realise what Johnson’s Government was actually planning and he has begun his retreat back to sanity.

9,19-3-20,Need to POP this pollution bubble,"Though India signed the Stockholm Convention in 2002, new and preemptive regulations banning the manufacture, use and trade of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) were only introduced in March 2018

The Environment Ministry’s notified rules on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP) completed two years this month. POPs are used in a wide range of industrial and agricultural applications. Some are pesticides, others are industrial products or unintended by-products resulting from industrial processes or combustion.

They are rapidly becoming a source of concern globally as there is documented evidence of POPs causing damage to human health and the environment. Also termed as the “forever chemicals”, POPs are organic compounds that are resistant to environmental degradation through chemical, biological or photolytic processes and it may take them centuries to be degraded. Due to this persistence they tend to bioaccumulate and pose a serious threat to humanity and the ecology.

POPs enter into a cycle in nature, accumulating in the bigger animals as they eat the smaller ones. Immune dysfunction is considered as a plausible cause for increased mortality among marine mammals. It is postulated that the consumption by seals of fish contaminated with POPs may lead to vitamin and thyroid deficiencies and cause increased susceptibility to microbial infections and reproductive disorders.

The Stockholm Convention, 2001, became one of the first major international congregations to discuss the possibilities of radically restricting the use of POPs across the world in order quell their adverse impacts.

Though India signed the convention in 2002 and ratified the same in 2006, new and preemptive regulations banning the manufacture, use, trade and import or export of POPs were only introduced in March 2018 by the Government. Though India has been a party to the Stockholm Convention, its progress has been rather slow, especially when compared to other nations such as China, where the regulations have been tightened to restrict the use of POPs. As a result today, China has less exposure to POPs as compared to India.

Other Stockholm Convention signatory nations have also been able to tighten the noose on the seven most dangerous POPs notified under the Stockholm Convention by banning the same.

POPs have a perilous impact on human health. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), POPs are confirmed Group 1 carcinogens which can also cause allergies, hypersensitivity, damage to the peripheral nervous system, immune system and reproductive system. In spite of the glaring evidence against POPs, India has been conspicuously slow in adopting a proactive and expedited approach towards banning their use.

This can be understood by the fact that it was only in 2018 — a full 12 years after India ratified the Stockholm Convention — that the Government banned 18 pesticides that were harmful to human health and the environment. But even this ban was not complete and comprehensive as many of the actually harmful chemicals, pesticides and mosquito repellents such as DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) which are a part of the POP family have been left out of the ban.

In order to ensure security to both human health and the environment, there is an urgent need to strengthen India’s chemical proliferation and bring the nation at par with international regulations as laid by the conventions of Basel, Rotterdam, Stockholm and Minamata.

The Government’s efforts to rein-in POPs can bear results if the policies and regulations are implemented better. For instance, the compliance report for the regulations introduced in 2018 need to be critically examined in order to understand the gap between policy and implementation and how the suppliers, users and manufacturers are still able to get away by using POPs and disposing the same in an unsafe manner, thereby polluting soil and water-bodies.

Additionally, the Government must also strengthen the capacity and reliability of its offices so that the regulations and policies pertaining to the use and disposal of hazardous chemicals are minutely observed by the related departments and offenders and violators are exemplarily punished.

This will also help the offices to adequately deal with issues of lack of awareness, outdated technologies under use and substandard policy implementation. Moreover, collaboration with international aid organisations and institutions must also be forged to ramp up skill imparting and training, which in turn will stimulate nationwide capacity-building and research. These initiatives will enable enforcement of the conventions to which India is a signatory.

POPs have reigned supreme in every Indian citizen’s life, either in the form of pesticides or countless chemicals that one comes in contact with on a daily basis. Already every human today carries approximately 250 chemicals within his body that did not exist prior to 1945. Therefore, it is imperative for the Government to reduce this chemical load by focussing on those chemicals which have a diabolical history of claiming life and ensure that their manufacture and use is stopped immediately.

However, the critical aspect here is to act expeditiously as more and more humans are exposed to POPs daily, foremost being the Indian farmers who spray a deadly cocktail of pesticides on a regular basis, exposing them to an array of health problems whose treatment they cannot even afford.

11,19-3-20,BJP to propagate achievements of Yogi govt,"The Uttar Pradesh unit of Bharatiya Janata Party will start a campaign at the village level from mid April to celebrate Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath completing three years in office and to educate people about the achievements of the state government.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that in view of the coronavirus threat, the party and the government had shelved the celebration of BJP government’s three year in office.

He said from mid April, by when the coronavirus outbreak would subside, the party workers would go to villages and tell people about the achievements of the state government.

The BJP state unit had earlier planned a campaign from March 19 to 26 in which party leaders and lawmakers were to go to villages and hold meetings.

It was to be a three-pronged campaign in which the BJP leaders were to interact with parents of students at primary schools, people at gram chaupals and at Arogya Melas held at primary health centres.

As the government has asked people to avoid crowded places and closed schools till April 2, the party leaders have decided to meet people after the coronavirus scare subsides.

Meanwhile, BJP state president Swatantra Dev Singh said that in the last three years, the Yogi Adityanath government had got the state rid of corruption, casteist politics and politics of appeasement.

“The people are appreciating the good work being done by the BJP government. The opposition cannot digest the achievements of the present government.

12,19-3-20,‘Declare Mahendragiri hills as biosphere reserve’,"With mythological, historical, archaeological and above all ecological significance attached to it, the Mahendragiri or Kulagiri hills in Gajapati district are considered as a unique magnificence of the nature.

The Eastern Ghat hill ranges has the Rushikulya river on its north, the Vamshadhara, the Bahuda and the Nagabali rivers on the south and vast expanse of blue waters of Bay of Bengal on the east. As the abode of clouds and rains, lush greenery all around, and temples of Gokarneswar and five Pandavs at the peak of the Mahendragiri at a height of about 5,000 ft, it has been captivating the attention of poets, historians, archeologists and tourists since ancient times. As a hotspot of diverse species of medicinal plants, it is considered as a storehouse of herbal medicines. Having such vast significance attached to it, the hill ecosystem is progressively confronted with diverse challenges due to increased human intervention and the natural resources are declining, including its rich biodiversity. Keeping this in view, the Orissa Environmental Society (OES) has been raising its concern in various forums over the past three decades and has submitted proposals to the State Government to declare it as a biosphere reserve for its effective protection and conservation.

An expert committee of the OES led by secretary Dr Jaya Krushna Panigrahi visited the Mahendragiri hills and took stock of the present state of affairs. Dr B Sitaram Patro, Er Gandhi Choudhury, Er Manoranjan Mishra, Dr Pradeep Kumar Rath, Raghunath Prusty, Dr Jayaram Patro, Dr Prakash Chandra Jena, Tripati Prasad Panda and local sage Laxmi Baba were members of the committee.

Presently, the ecosystem encounters deforestation by felling of trees and fire of slash and burn cultivation that culminates in decline of biodiversity and even making some species endangered. The visit of lakhs of people to the Gokarneswar temple on the eve of Shiv Ratri degrades the forests in diverse ways. The road construction work to the peak that is being carried out now to facilitate ecotourism also causes a lot of damage and much more stress may be generated in the future, viewed the team.

The Mahendratanaya and other rivers originating from the hills are now fast-starved of their water flow. The flora and fauna are deprived of their food and water requirements. In such a scenario, the State Government should recommend to the Central Government for declaring the hill ecosystem as the second biosphere reserve of Odsiah, demanded the team.

OES president Dr Sundar Narayan Patro and the secretary Dr Panigrahi apprised PCCF (Wildlife) Dr Hari Shankar Upadhyay of the OES’ concern. They suggested for creation of herbal garden, research centre, interpretation centre and deer park at the base of the Mahendragiri hills in addition to efficient management of the ecosystem.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---declare-mahendragiri-hills-as-biosphere-reserve---.html

The surrendered Maoists were identified as Sambal Khara, Bhaskar Khilla, Jogi Khara, Trinath Khilla, Radhaba Khilla, Khatru Hantal, Raghu Ram Hantal and Nindi Pangi

Sambal Khara, a resident of Luchhapani village under the Papermetla police station of the district, had joined the organisation in February, 2017. He was involved in many criminal activities including blasting of IEDs, killing of MLAs and civilians and gun battles with the security forces.

He decided to join the mainstream as he saw various developmental activities being undertaken by the State Government. He was disappointed with the party leaders as they did nothing for the development of Swabhiman Anchal, rather focused on their interests and they were using innocent tribals for their own individual interests and killing them mercilessly, police sources said.

The surrendered Maoists have requested and appealed to innocent tribals and villagers from Swabhiman Anchal to shun the path of violence and join the mainstream for the development of the area.

In another development, CRPF personnel unearthed a Maoist camp near Niyamgiri Hills under the Kalyansighpur police station of Rayagada district on Wednesday.

21,19-3-20,BJP govt has changed people’s perception of UP in 3 yrs: CM,"The day Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath completed three years in office, he claimed that people’s perception of Uttar Pradesh had changed in the last three years because of improvement in law and order and infrastructure and the state now occupied the first position in programme implementation and had become the most sought after destination for investors.

“The hard work of last three years has started bearing fruits. People are now talking about UP because we have delivered. When we took charge there was no such thing as law and order and the development was in a shambles. The circumstances were challenging. We turned those challenges into opportunities,” Yogi said.

“Today we have managed to create an atmosphere of development, trust and good governance in the state. We have set new standards of development in every field. This has helped us in changing the people’s perception of UP,” the chief minister said.

In his about an hour-long speech, the chief minister talked about the change in perception five times. He justified it by saying that his government had implemented infrastructure development projects and taken stern action against criminals to remove the fear from the minds of the masses.

The chief minister also said that three lakh government jobs were generated in the last three years and in the remaining two years this number would further increase.

“We are working in a transparent manner. We have given jobs to over three lakh people in the government sector. With the investment of about Rs 3 lakh crore in the first and second groundbreaking ceremonies and other events, over 33 lakh people have got direct and indirect employment. No complaints have been reported regarding these appointments, he said.

The chief minister said that the last three years saw improvement in crime control. He said in view of better law and order, police commissionerate system had been introduced in Lucknow and Noida.

“Organised crime was effectively curbed in 2019 as compared to 2016. There has been a decrease of 59.70 per cent in robbery, 47.09 per cent in loot, 21.71 per cent in murder, 27.20 per cent in rioting, 37.74 per cent in kidnapping and 17.90 per cent in rape cases,” Yogi said, adding that his government had done a lot for modernisation of police by recruiting 1.37 lakh police personnel and setting up cyber police stations and forensic labs in every police range.

The chief minister talked at length about his government’s achievements in various sectors like health, irrigation, agriculture, power, infrastructure and industry including micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME).

“The One District One Product (ODOP) scheme is an innovative one and has led to increase of exports by 28 per cent. Not only this, the scheme has been recognised at the national level. This year’s Union budget states that the ODOP scheme should be implemented in all states of the country and this is a feather in UP’s cap,” he said.

Yogi spoke on how his government was planning to construct 30 new medical colleges. He said OPDs had started in two new AIIMS and Mukhyamantri Arogya Mela was being organised at all primary health centres across the state.

“The Bharatiya Janata Party government has created a record in power distribution as all districts are now getting electricity without any discrimination. Under Saubhagya scheme, over 1.24 crore families have been given free connections. Electricity is now being provided to 1.67 lakh villages,” he said.

The chief minister said that before 2017, Uttar Pradesh stood nowhere in implementation of Central government schemes but today it was at number one position in the country. “These schemes include Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Ayushman Bharat, Swachh Bharat Mission, Saubhagya Yojana, Ujjwala Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana,” he added.

The chief minister declared that Purvanchal Expressway would be opened for public by the end of this year while the Bundelkhand Expressway would be completed by the end of the next year. He added that work on Ganga Expressway was in progress. “These three expressways will give a new direction to UP’s economy, he said

The chief minister said that what UP had achieved was possible because of the efficient guidance and inspiration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. There was also full support of the Central parliamentary team, state BJP organisation, ministers and other people’s representatives,” he added.

The chief minister underwent precautionary thermal screening for coronavirus before presenting the report card for his three-year term.

Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma and Keshav Prasad Maurya, and BJP state president Swatantra Dev Singh. also underwent thermal screening.

On this occasion, the chief minister released a book ‘3 years of good governance’.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-govt-has-changed-people---s-perception-of-up-in-3-yrs--cm.html

But over the next three years, the government took some bold steps, improved law and order, invested more in infrastructure and improved availability of electricity.

A study carried out by local circles shows 63 per cent citizens are happy with the work done by the Uttar Pradesh government in the last three years.

A detailed survey was conducted in Uttar Pradesh to evaluate the performance of the Yogi government. The 12-poll survey received more than 80,000 responses from citizens residing in over 55 districts of the state.

When people were asked how they rated the overall performance of the Yogi Adityanath government in the last three years, 26 per cent rated the 3-year performance as excellent, 20 per cent as very good, 17 per cent good, 17 per cent as average, 9 per cent as poor and 11 per cent as very poor.

On law and order, 49 per cent respondents said there was significant improvement, 31 per cent were of the view that there was minor improvement, 16 per cent said there was no improvement and only 2 per cent said the law and order had become worse.

According to the survey, communal harmony has improved in the state with 46 per cent respondents saying the improvement was significant.

The results of the survey clearly point out that the present UP government has done good work in the last three years and the people are happy with the development and progress the state has made.

23,19-3-20,"Yogi’s report card ‘filled with lies’, says Priyanka","Hitting out at the Yogi Adityanath government on completing three years in office, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said the report card of the government was “filled with lies” while Samajwadi Party gave zero out of 10 to Yogi’s achievement.

Earlier, chief Minister Yogi Adityanath held a press conference on the occasion of his government completing three years and announced the achievement of his dispensation.

“The Bharatiya Janata Party government of UP is releasing its report card. In this report card filled with lies, big claims have been made about women’s safety. But after the horrific Unnao incident, the incident in Lakhimpur today exposed the claims of women safety. When will the government wake up?” Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet.

“Dream big, do big work, only then the state can grow,” commented Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, while reacting to the report card presented by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.

“The BJP government just believes in propaganda but it should be supported with truth and facts,” Yadav said, saying that Yogi Adityanath and BJP leaders believe that spreading lies a hundred times makes it true and so they are just following that rule and doing nothing on ground but making false propaganda.

The former chief minister of UP said that since the BJP government assumed office three years back, not a single project had been completed.

He alleged that Yogi Adityanath was not even honest towards promises made by him during election campaign.

Yadav said that youths, farmers, women, businessmen and everyone was feeling cheated by the present government as it had only burdened the people with rising prices, taxes etc besides giving a jungle raj by its failure to maintain law and order.

The SP chief alleged that crime was at its peak in the present BJP rule and whosoever dared to come on road to expose the failure or excesses of the government faced the wrath of the present dispensation in the form of police case and being putting behind the bars.

Yadav said he would give zero out of ten to the Yogi Adityanath government as not a single new project had been started by this government.

Terming as fake the report card presented by the Yogi Adityanath government on completion of three years in office, Rashtriya Lok Dal national spokesman Anil Dubey said the three years of BJP rule were very disappointing.

He said the UP government had failed to carry out development in the past three year of the present dispensation.

“Farmers, youths, women, labourers, people of backward class and the downtrodden feel let by the Yogi government. The people had given BJP a thumping majority in the hope of seeing development and uplift of their lives but the government has disappointed them,” he said.

Ridiculing the BJP claim of having worked to the satisfaction of every class of society and creating new job opportunity, Dubey said the farmers did not get their arrears while the BJP promise to doubling their income was still a far fetched dream.

Dubey said the massacre in Sonbhadra, death of children due to lack of oxygen at the BRD Medical College hospital in Gorakhpur, rapes in Unnao, Lakhimpur and Shahjahanpur were some of the incidents which belied the BJP government’s claims.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/yogi---s-report-card----filled-with-lies-----says-priyanka.html

34,19-3-20,Corona concern is fine; panic by social media horrific,"Ever since smart phone became cheaply available, gossipmongers turned hyperactive. The panic coronavirus has evoked, even among Government systems, is because of the social media. People need to know that around the end of 2019, this virus began making people sick with flu-like symptoms.

The virus resembles a ‘crown'. Hence, the illness is called coronavirus disease-19 or ‘COVID-19' for short. ‘Corona' means crown in Latin which how the virus looks.

People must know:

• Roughly 14% infected people need hospital care.

• Thousands have already recovered from infection.

• Covid-19 is 10 times more fatal than the common flu.

• The first symptom is usually a dry cough or sore a throat soon followed by a fever; and then, in some cases, fatigue. Some people develop shortness of breath around the sixth day after first starting to feel unwell. Other symptoms include headaches, dizziness and confusion, diarrhoea, difficulty in walking, nausea or vomiting as well as loss of appetite.

• Experts say mortality rate is between 1% and 2%. Most mild cases are not reported. So, the proportional death rate is inflated at 3%.

Until March 18, 2020, out of the 107,959 infected patients, only 101,544 (94%) are with very mild symptoms. Out of that, only 6,415 (6%) are known to be in serious conditions. As many as 90,768 cases have been closed; 82,779 (91%) have recovered completely and discharged from hospitals. Only 7,989 (9%) have died.

Incidentally, mosquitoes kill 2,740 people every day due to malaria complications.

Viruses, different from bacteria in physiology, can only survive in host cells by duping them with their genetic materials like DNA or RNA for multiplication. They are not killed by antibiotics which find no virus target to destroy. However, rare antiviral medications and vaccines are discovered from time to time for specific virus strains. Vaccines do only stimulate the host immune system to produce adequate antibodies that can deactivate and dis-empower the virus before it can cause disease by replication tricks in the host cells.

The first cases were diagnosed in people who had visited a market in China that sold live seafood and animals. The virus spreads easily if simple precautions are not taken. A doctor should be consulted if someone has prolonged fever, cough or other flu-like symptoms. It is very important that children have had all their vaccinations. It's not too late to get a flu shot as that too triggers the immune system strongly.

People, particularly babies and the very elderly with weak immune systems, need be protected with care. Most people with COVID-19, including children, do not have serious problems. They usually get better with rest and fluids. But it is important to keep infected ones away from others. Home isolation is a good idea unless symptoms are severe. Very ill ones get scientific care in a hospital with breathing help, IV fluids, and other treatments.

History has severally reminded the mankind that nature becomes unforgiving when the human race turns arrogant with artificial materials including food, gadgets and the works. No matter how sophisticated the internet, smart phones or jet travels are, the viruses will invariably remain indifferent to the so-called human progress.

Modern life squeezes millions into cities. Crowded planes and airports can spread diseases from continent to continent in hours unlike in the past. Diseases remain restricted to specific geography. Globalisation is a two-edged sword. It may enrich billions of people with material goods, but the effects of instant communication and travel can spread diseases at a speed difficult to fathom today.

Right at this moment, the entire human media across the globe is gripped by coronavirus. With warnings and alerts, people are bombarded with fake information and crap. Some create immeasurable panic; others keep spreading messages about untested, unreliable remedies that can cause more harm than the corona can ever bring about. The repercussions have already moved from the global health sphere into business and politics. Nation states are witnessing hard-generated wealth evaporating in hours at the stock exchanges as unfounded fear has brought economic activities to a grinding halt.

But there are reasons for optimism as ways to contain and defeat the virus are fast becoming visible.The first cases of AIDS were detected in June 1981; and it took more than two years to identify the virus (HIV) causing the disease. With COVID-19, the first cases of severe pneumonia were reported in China on December 31, 2019; and by January 7, 2020, the virus had already been identified. The genome was available on day 10. By January 13, a test to detect the virus was also available. Although viruses live by mutating in a confused host cell, the mutation rates are certainly not very high.

The situation is improving in China by strong control and isolation measures. For several weeks now, the number of cases diagnosed every day is decreasing. A very detailed epidemiological follow-up is being carried out in other countries. Outbreaks now are very specific to early-identified locations, which makes control and prevention much easier.

Even by today, the news is that 80% of cases are mild. In about 14%, it has caused severe pneumonia and only in 5% it can become critical or even fatal. Most infected people are cured. There are 13 times more cured cases than deaths; and this happy proportion is increasing by the day. Symptoms in children are so mild as to go unnoticed. Only 3% of cases occur in people under 20; and mortality under 40 is only 0.2%.

The virus can be wiped clean. It can be effectively inactivated from surfaces with a solution of ethanol (62-71% alcohol), hydrogen peroxide (0.5% hydrogen peroxide) or sodium hypochlorite (0.1% bleach), in just one minute. Frequent hand-washing with soap is the most effective way to avoid contagion.

It is the age of international cooperation in science and research. Within just over a month of the global outbreak, 164 articles could be accessed in ‘PubMed' on COVID19 or SARSCov2. Many more are available in repositories of articles not yet reviewed. They are preliminary works on vaccines, treatments, epidemiology, genetics and phylogeny, diagnosis, clinical aspects, etc. There are already vaccine prototypes. The vaccine group at the University of Queensland has announced vaccine production in record time. Prototypes may soon be tested on humans. There is big news that ‘chloroquine', an inexpensive anti-malarial drug has been seen to have potent antiviral activity.

The state machinery all over India has to keep people alert, not frightened. Fear may eventually cause more damage than the virus!",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/corona-concern-is-fine--panic-by-social-media-horrific.html

In a letter to the CM, the members of Lead Rourkela have appreciated the CM for ordering to close down the educational institutions and other institutions in a precautionary measure to combat COVID-19.

But keeping in view the career of the students, the pre-scheduled +2 examination is going on. The problem is congregation of more than 200 students in a queue in the gate of an examination centre for checking.

That may create problem for the students. So, abandoning the checking at gate is the need of the hour while the screening should be taken inside the hall by the invigilators, it said.

Besides, the organisation urged that keeping in view the heavy fine under new MV Act, hundreds of people are gathering at RTO office to obtain the requisite documents.

Though her disease got cured. But she developed a new problem. That, all the 10 fingers of her hands didn’t function properly. At the same time, she also became unable to walk properly.

Suman has two other siblings, a brother and a sister. Her father Jaya Kumar Bhoi deserted the children and wife as a matter of practice in most of the working class family here.

Her mother Jangyasini maintains the whole family with four members including her with untold difficulties. She works as a domestic help to feed her children and meet their other requirement. But her income is too meager.

Initially, Suman was reading in a local school in the primary class. But ill- health didn’t permit her for so. She was unable to write a single word with here defunct fingers. Teachers also advised her to go to school meant for the physically challenged students and that didn't happen in her fate.

As per the latest requirement, an Aadhaar Card is now necessary for all purposes. May it be admission in school or for getting any help under different schemes including medical aid from district Red Cross society. But her defunct fingers are her problem as computer doesn’t accept her finger prints.

“I have applied for Suman's Aadhaar card many a time. But all the times failure reports came due to her deformed fingers. And no one guides me what to do next,” says Jangyasini, the mother of Suman. “The result being I am unable to get any help from Government for this girl,” she added.

When contacted, CDMO of Sambalpur Dr SB Patel said: “I can’t say about Aadhaar card. But if she comes to the medical, we can begin treatment and if necessary can send her to Burla MCH for further consultation. Let’s motivate her to consult the doctors first.”

41,19-3-20,"Badal demands arrest, probe against Cong leaders","Punjab’s five-time Chief Minister and Akali supremo Parkash Singh Badal on Wednesday asked his successor Capt Amarinder Singh to share with the people why his Government was not acting against the Congress leaders — Kushaldeep Singh Kiki Dhillon and Gurpreet Singh Kangar — despite “clear evidence and written complaints against them for putting political, official and psychological pressure on the key witness in the painful Behbal Kalan incident, leading to his death”.

Badal demanded that the accused in the prime eye-witness Surjit Singh’s alleged “murder through emotional torture” be arrested on charges of interfering with the due process of law and they must be questioned on the motives behind their attempts to coerce the eye witness to change his stance.

“The hapless widow of the principal eye witness has been going from pillar to post seeking action against the Congress leaders alleging that they put her husband under unbearable strain to coerce him to change his statement and tell lies on the most crucial link in the chain of sacrilege events. Why is she being denied justice?” asked the Akali stalwart.

He said that it was for Capt Amarinder, his party’s and his government now to prove their guiltlessness. “One of the best ways to do so is to take credible and transparent action against his colleagues whom the unfortunate widow is accusing of killing her husband through mental torture,” he said.

Badal pointed that the Congress used to “ask us why we were not able to unearth the conspiracy in a year and half of our government after Behbal and Bargadi. Now, twice the number of years has passed since the Amarinder Government came to power on the back of some false promises made on oath of a holy scriptures. And at the end of these three years, the only thing that has emerged is that the Congress Government is merely trying to shield the guilty and suppress the wider conspiracy as they seem to be scared of the footprints leading to their door. They are clearly trying to cover some tracks”.

At the same time, Badal asked Capt Amarinder to get out of his habit of foul mouthing his opponents and critics every time he is cornered. “It behoves neither his age nor the dignity of the high office he holds to keep abusing others like a rude, ill-mannered teenager. He may be young but must a CM act like a spoilt brat? He must behave is age and stature as CM,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/badal-demands-arrest--probe-against-cong-leaders.html

43,19-3-20,Harsimrat asks CM to complete Ladhowal Food Park,"Asking Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to bestow “serious attention” to the Ladhowal mega food park project and ensure its early completion, the Union Food Processing Industries Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal said that “lethargy” on the part of the Congress-led Punjab Government had delayed the project by two years and deprived farmers and youth of its benefits.

Harsimrat, in a letter to the Chief Minister, said that the mega food park was approved by Food Processing Ministry in 2015 with a grant in aid of Rs 50 crore out of which Rs 35 crore had been released to Punjab Agro Industries Corporation (PAIC), which is the implementing agency.

“The project had a completion deadline of 2018 but poor planning and slow decision making of the Congress Government had resulted in frequent changes in the project components due to which PAIC had repeatedly missed target timelines for completion of the project,” she said.

Harsimrat, who was replying to the Chief Minister’s letter requesting for release of the fourth and final instalment of the Ministry of Food Processing Industry grant for the project, informed Capt Amarinder that he was not updated about the project’s correct position.

She said that the progress of implementation was also reviewed by the Food Processing Ministry’s Additional Secretary and it was noted that major facilities had not been made operational. “In view of all these facts, it would not be possible to release the fourth and final instalment of grant in aid of Rs 10 crore to PAIC. I am constrained by the scheme guidelines which clearly stated that the final instalment could only be released following completion of the project which would include expenditure of 100 per cent contribution of the Implementing Agency, allotment of 75 per cent of total plots and commencement of operations in at least 25 per cent of the allotted units,” she said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/harsimrat-asks-cm-to-complete-ladhowal-food-park.html
44,19-3-20,Criminals go scot-free as police show laxity,"The police are inactive against certain influential people despite their involvement in serious offences in Keonjhar district.

As per rules after receiving a complaint of a cognizable offence ,it is the primary duty of the police to register an FIR and arrest the culprit and inquire into the matter but it is alleged that police under pressure were mute spectators in a handful of cases.

It indicates that there is complete failure of any impact of 5T and Mo Sarkar in the district, alleged the locals.

This has come to light recently on February 23, when one Purnachandra Barik and one Maheswar Barik of Unchbali village under Joda block made a complaint in Bamebari police station that they had been brutally attacked by one Sanjay Barik and 21 others after being dragged from their houses.

However, the police were not taking action against the accused for which they were moving freely even after passing of 21 days.

It is alleged by the duo victims that police were showing tacit support to the accused not just in their case but in many other cases too.

Prior to this , two other cases: case No. 18/ 19 dt.07.12.2019 and case No. 1/20 dt.27.01.2020 under different sections of IPC including Section 25 of the Arms Act, were still pending in the name of Sanjay and others.

Sources further revealed that some days back , accused Sanjay was a close confidant of former Champua MLA Sanatan Mahakud but being envious of Mahakud's influence, some mining companies worked behind the scene to field Sanjay to counter Mahakud. With the support of a mining company ,a cooperative society named as ' Baba Dhabaleswar Committee' was formed with Sanjay as its main trusty to undertake mining work but problem started after some days when the members revolted against him saying that Sanjay had betrayed them by not paying what he had promised to pay at the time of formation of the committee.

It is further alleged that Sanjay who claims himself to be a close aide of former powerful Minister and MLA Badrinarayan Patra also doesn't hesitate to attack his opponents who go against him.

On the other hand, local Government officials , knowing fully well that there is a strong corporate lobby behind Sanjay ,are also allegedly ignoring all the allegations levelled against Sanjay and Baba Dhabaleswar Committee . Recently, ZP member Basudev Naik had raised an allegation in the last Zila Parishad meeting that Baba Dhabaleswar Committee had encroached vast acres of forest land aswell as adivasi land in the name of growing agriculture but no action has been taken as yet to evict the encroachment.

It is further alleged one senior police official who is working for a pretty long period in the district headquarters is trying to put pressure on the local police of Bamrbari not to take any action against Sanajay.

It is demanded by the locals that the district police administration should interfere in the matter and take action.

They too demanded that the post of Inspector In Charge of Bamrbari PS should be filled up and officers working for a long period in the district be transferred immediately.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/criminals-go-scot-free-as-police-show-laxity.html

Our second major decision was the formation of the Char Dham Devsthanam Board. The Char Dham Yatra will now be conducted under this system. We had promised the public good governance and corruption-free government. Taking strong measures, we struck hard at corruption and proved that a government can be run with honesty too.

The Uttarakhand government made the order of SC as basis of denying the benefit of reservation in promotions which is being seen as a victory of general and OBC employees.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-govt-removes-ban-on-promotions.html
58,19-3-20,BJP Govt of U’khand total failure on all fronts: Pritam Singh,"The Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief Pritam Singh has accused that BJP government of Uttarakhand is being influenced by sand, liquor and land mafia.

He said that the Trivendra Singh Rawat government is blowing its own trumpet on completion of its three years in office but the fact is that it has fulfilled no promise it made to the people of the state. The PCC president was addressing a press conference at the head office of Uttarakhand Congress here on Wednesday.

Taking a dig at the claim of chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat that he has freed the IV floor of the state secretariat from mafia, Singh said that the people of state had voted BJP for development and removing corruption from all parts of the state.

He reminded that the BJP in its vision document had claimed that it would set up office of Lokayukt within 100 days but after three years Lokayukt is nowhere to be seen and rampant corruption prevails in the state.

He said that BJP also promised to reduce price rise within 100 days but the prices are at their peak. “During the Congress government, the cooking gas cylinder was of Rs 414 but now it has being sold at Rs 950. The prices of petrol and diesel have increased despite of the fact that prices of crude oil have declined steadily,’’ he said.

The Congress leader claimed that the economy of the state is going through a bad phase. “If one removes the centrally funded projects from the budget, there is no provision for the developmental schemes.

The BJP had promised that it would waive off the loans of the farmers but this promise too has remained unfulfilled.

Thirteen farmers have committed suicide in BJP regime so far,’’ Singh quipped. Continuing his diatribe over the BJP government, PCC President said that a promise of providing employment was made but the government has sent unemployed behind bars for demanding jobs.

Terming the government’s claim to provide employment to 4 Lakh unemployed as laughable, Singh said that it appears this government has included those selling Pakoras outside railway stations in the list of employment provided by it.

He said that the Uttarakhand government has brought the Chardham Devsthanam board without consulting the Teerth Purohits and the stake holders.

The PCC chief claimed that the Congress when voted to power would abolish this board after consultation with Teerth Purohits. He said that in last three years this government has reduced the prices of liquor and done nothing to provide relief to the people of the state.

Former cabinet minister Dinesh Agarwal, Vice President Dhirendra Pratap, Rajkumar, Garima Dassauni and Lalchand Sharma accompanied the PCC president during the press conference. As a mark of protest, all the Congress leaders wore black clothes.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-govt-of-u---khand-total-failure-on-all-fronts--pritam-singh.html
59,19-3-20,"Cong struggling to survive, venting frustration: BJP","The Bharatiya Janata Party has termed press conferences held by Congress leaders on the state government’s completion of three years in office as a “platform for frustration”.

The BJP state media in-charge Ajendra Ajay said that the Congress members have become habituated to writhing when not in power. He said, “The people of Uttarakhand have strongly rejected the Congress two times consecutively in the Lok Sabha elections and the last Vidhan Sabha elections. However, the statements being made by the Congress leaders make it appear as if they have not been able to come out their shock yet. The Congress leaders are struggling to maintain their existence.

In their struggle for survival, they are unnecessarily levelling baseless allegations on the BJP government,” said Ajay.

He said that the allegations levelled by Congress leaders in the Press conferences lacked substance, adding that there is neither anything new nor any facts in these allegations.

The people are also bored listening to these overused allegations. The Congress leaders should do some homework so that they can at least level some new allegations, quipped the BJP state media in-charge.

He further said that the Congress leaders are working on the policy of opposing for the sake of opposing. That is why they are unable to see any achievements during the state government’s three year term so far.

The BJP state government is moving ahead on its vision document released ahead of the 2017 Assembly elections. The double engine which Prime Minister Narendra Modi had referred to during the Assembly elections is benefitting the state fully. Responding to leader of opposition Indira Hridayesh’s questions on employment, Ajay said that this government had increased the age limit for applying for government jobs from 40 years to 42 years.

After the investers summit, grounding of 437 projects amounting to more than Rs 21,000 crore has been achieved in the first stage.

This will provide employment to 57,000 people. In the past three years, 13,484 units were established with 95,847 people getting jobs in these. Ajay also cited other statistics to rebut the allegations levelled by the Congress leaders.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-struggling-to-survive--venting-frustration--bjp.html
60,19-3-20,MCD expects NOC from UEPPCB this week,"The Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) is expected to get the No Objection Certificate (NOC) renewed for its solid waste management and recycling plant at Sheeshambada from the Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB) this week.

Meanwhile, the chairman of Environment Protection Council, Vishwas Dawar inspected the said site on Wednesday and according to him, the management of the Sheeshambada plant needs some considerable improvements in the process of proper dumping of garbage.

The operation of dumping the garbage in Sheeshambada solid waste management and recycling plant without NOC is being carried out for more than six months.

According to the locals of Sheeshambada, UEPPCB has not renewed the NOC of Dehradun municipal corporation because of irregularities in the management of the plant. The locals have also alleged that the operation of plant without NOC is illegal besides other anomalies in the plant like improper treatment of leachate and foul smell in the area. However, MCD officials and the project head MA Saify had rejected all the allegations saying that the plant is running considering the NOC as deemed to be sanctioned because, as per MCD officials, the application of NOC was never rejected by the pollution control board.

According to Dehradun municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey, the process for the renewal of NOC is in its final stage and most probably the MCD will get the NOC from the pollution control board in a couple of days.

He also added that there are no anomalies in the waste management plant and the no harm is done to the environment during the process of garbage dumping.On the other hand, Dawar said that there are several anomalies inside Sheeshambada waste management plant.

According to him, Ramky Company that manages the functioning of the plant needs to do significant improvements in its garbage dumping procedure.

He further added that a notice concerning the garbage dumping in the plant had also been sent earlier to Ramky Company.

The issues in the waste management plant are not simple but with some efforts, the situation can be improved in the plant, said Dawar.

Meanwhile, the locals claimed that during the inspection of the plant, Dawar found the improper treatment of leachate, several dogs roaming around, a heap of mixed dry and wet garbage and numbers of rag pickers inside the plant.

The locals are protesting near the waste management plant for its shifting for more than five months claiming it to be hazardous for the people living nearby due to the improper handling of garbage collected from the whole city.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mcd-expects-noc-from-ueppcb-this-week.html

This time our protest will be bigger than our previous protest.”It is pertinent to mention here that Anganwadi workers protested for two months and some of them also began a hunger strike to escalate the protest.

The strike of the workers affected several government schemes like the distribution of Take Home Ration (THR) under Supplementary Nutrition Programme (SNP) of Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) for children, pregnant women and lactating mothers and the pulse polio campaign.

82,19-3-20,Japanese anti-flu medicine effective in COVID-19,"Medical experts in China have claimed that a new flu drug is 'clearly effective' in treating the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

Favipiravir, the active ingredient in a Japanese anti-flu medicine called Avigan, was trialled on 340 patients with the disease in China, reported dailymail.co.uk

Patients who took the flu drug recovered quicker and showed greater lung improvement compared with patients not given the drug.

The component is thought to block the virus from replicating in the body.

Doses will be investigated in more COVID-19 patients by Hong Kong researchers, who claim they will give their pill 'for free' if studies show it is safe.

However, contradictory clinical trials suggest Favipiravir will not be useful in patients who have more severe illness.

As of yet, there isn't a treatment for the coronavirus pandemic. Most people have mild symptoms and can recover at home within a week.

Almost 200,000 have been infected and 7,900 have died.

It was given to 80 patients in Shenzen and in Wuhan, where the novel coronavirus first emerged in December 2019.

Favipiravir has been effective, with no obvious side-effects, in helping coronavirus patients recover, Zhang Xinmin, an official at China's Science and Technology Ministry, told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday.

An oral medicine using favipiravir, developed by Hong Kong-based Sihuan Pharmaceutical, is also in line to try on COVID-19 patients.

Led by Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, a clinical trial is part of a programme by Sihuan and the Institute of Microbiology Epidemiology, a division of the Chinese armed forces.

The study will involve 60 COVID-19 patients who will be given treatment for around 10 days. Larger trials are expected later.

Sihuan executive director Che Fengsheng has said, ""After all the efforts and preparations, our group is fully prepared for favipiravir's raw material and preparation production.""",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/japanese-anti-flu-medicine-effective-in-covid-19.html
83,19-3-20,"Locked at home, NRIs from State face tough times amid restrictions","Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) hailing from Jharkhand are facing a tough time in foreign nations as the fear of Coronavirus has led to lockdowns and even curfews in some parts of the world. While fetching Indian grocery has become a daunting task in foreign shores, some NRI’s plans of visiting home – either to attend events or address exigencies – had to be cancelled as the fear of being quarantined has gripped foreign travelers to India.

Nishant Priya, a software engineer based out of New Jersey in the United States of America (USA) said that there was no supply of Indian grocery to his city, and other daily-use products too were not easily available. The administration there has clamped curfew from 8pm to 5am in New Jersey, and people have been locked in their own houses. “I have an infant at home, and even diapers are not available in the market. We have been forced to stay indoors and move out only when the curfew is lifted,” said Priya, originally a resident of Ranchi.

The situation may not be as severe in Dubai as in New Jersey, but Indians living in UAE are avoiding visits to India fearing quarantine. TS Nand, a Geo-Scientist based out of Dubai, could not come to India to attend his brother’s open-heart surgery due to the various restriction imposed on travelers. “I had to be in India to support my family at a time when my brother is undergoing an open-heart surgery but I could not come. I will be quarantined if I come to India, and I cannot afford that at this moment,” he said.

Coronavirus has killed more than 100 people in the USA and infected around113 in the UAE. More than 2 lakh people have been infected by the lethal virus across the globe and over 8,000 of them have died. While India is taking all possible measures to prevent the virus from spreading, and screening foreign travelers is an important part of the drill, the preventive measures have hit some NRIs hard.

However, Indians stuck in Japan, where more than 600 people have been infected by the virus, have not been restricted to their homes. Shashwat Satyawrat, an engineer working in Japan, said that educational institutions have been shut in his city till April, but shops are open. “The cases of Coronavirus surged in Japan in February, but they are now under control. We are also going to office daily, and there is no major restriction as such,” he said.

Prafull Nanda, a native of Simdega living in Ghana Republic, said that the country is still in stage one of Coronavirus and serious restrictions have not been imposed. However, some locals in Ghana fear that outsiders, including Indians, may bring Coronavirus to the country and infect them, he said. “I have had a few such encounters recently. Most of times, they (locals) stare at me as if I am carrying Coronavirus with me. Sometimes, they joking ask me not to spread the virus,” said Nanda as he chuckled. “It is not serious discrimination, but it is funny,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/locked-at-home--nris-from-state-face-tough-times-amid-restrictions.html

94,19-3-20,EOW registers FIR to probe role of officers in PDS scam,"The state economic offences wing (EOW) registered a case in the alleged multi-crore Public Distribution System (PDS) scam, which took place during the previous BJP government's tenure, and launched a probe into the role of concerned officials.

The case was registered on Tuesday after a probe revealed the irregularities committed by the officials who were employed with the food department and incurred a loss of Rs 2,718 crore to the exchequer, a press release from here said.

As per the 2011 socio-economic census, there were 56,50,724 families in the state and there should have been 45 lakh ration cards, it said.

But by the end of 2013, a total of 71,30,393 ration cards existed across the 27 districts of Chhattisgarh, indicating that there were 14.80 lakh bogus ration cards as the number of families in the state was only 56.5 lakh, the release said.

From July 2013 to December 2013, as many as 41,847 ration cards were invalidated. But until 2016, new ration cards were issued every year and some of them were canceled after it came to light that they were bogus, it added.

Between April 2013 and December 2016, 11,08,515 tons of rice was distributed at subsidized rate against these bogus ration cards which were eventually canceled, incurring a loss of Rs 2,718 crore to the state government, it said.

The responsibility of transportation and distribution of food grains lay with the Directorate of Food Department and the transportation agency, it mentioned.

The officials who were then posted with the food department, misused their powers to facilitate issuance of bogus cards and distribution of foodgrain through them, the release said.

The EOW is now probing the scam and the role of civil servants, it added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/eow-registers-fir-to-probe-role-of-officers-in-pds-scam.html

98,19-3-20,Building more of real resilience to handle crisis,"Organisations have been spending millions on business resilience programs over the last decade or so. The COVID-19 or Corona outbreak has been a good health check of the actual effectiveness of these business resilience programs. The question is, how good is a business resilience program that can’t save enough lives in pandemic situation.

ISO (International Organization for Standardization) has a dedicated compliance standard, ISO 22301:12 that is focused on building business resilience across all key business drivers including, people, process and technology. And in every business resilience initiative people come first. Agree or not? After all a single life is more valuable than any financial or brand specific value a company can build. And looking at it from the other side also, if lives are compromised, both brand and revenue can take a huge hit.

Now coming back to the effectiveness of business resilience programs and their real benefits. With the sudden Corona outbreak, a lot of organisations (many ISO 22301:12 certified) were clueless on how to respond effectively and timely, looking at their neighbours or competitors to act first. And this was in a situation where lives were at stake and every minute mattered when it came to the best decision making.

Some organizations just waited and followed on advisory from their local governments without any proper execution plan in place and many are still figuring out. Many haven’t been able to sufficiently enlighten their employees on the basic precautions to be taken. Worse than that, they have not been able to caution and safeguard their people from false advisory’s, that have created panic amongst millions.

Dig out the policies and stacks of documents/ paperwork and try to find out execution plans around addressing such an outbreak and most organizations would fail to justify. And this can very well be seen on ground with all the chaos around handling the Corona pandemic.

I’m not questioning the compliance programs or organizations like ISO that have built these programs (they are meant to address situations like the one we are in right now), but I’m questioning effective execution. Compliance certificates mean nothing, if some of the most sensitive issues that they are meant to address aren’t getting addressed. So do the certifying bodies need to relook at their audit approach and focus more on the real work done by organizations while certifying them on business resilience standards...

The underlying question that we need to answer is, what needs to be done to make business resilience programs genuinely and effectively address health and safety concerns during a pandemic. In today’s context some of the key ones per me are:

1- Controlling social media to avoid spreading of conflicting and false advisory. For example circulate regulated/ authorised digital content around awareness. This is where governments and social media giants need to step up. And I have seen one of the biggest social media players act on this.

2- Ability to scale up first aid facility and quickly get them to the masses. For example, supplies of essentials to address the pandemic should be optimised and governments should take control of all supplies (to minimise mismanagement and malpractices) of such products and of-course subsidise them (after all every individual has right of sufficient access to basic healthcare facilities in any pandemic situation).

3- Effective use of tech and digital to rollout healthcare and well being programs. Best times to make real use of the high-tech tech and expedite the rollout of products and services that can address mass requirements. Lot of startups are doing amazing stuff that even the multi-billion dollar firms are not able to.

The best analogy to take effective steps is considering it as a war like situation. So work with governments and policy makers to get the best results.

And finally, as a wise person has said, when there is crisis, first calm down.

99,19-3-20,3-fold rise in number of under observation Jharkhandis,"The number of Jharkhand residents under observation amid Coronavirus fear has tripled in the past one week – an indication that while the health machinery is leaving no stone unturned to keep the lethal virus at bay, the number of travelers returning to the State from foreign shores is rapidly increasing, officials from the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) said.

According to figures with the IDSP, around 80 people – all with travel history to foreign countries – were under observation and self quarantined in Jharkhand on March 11. However, the latest figures with the IDSP show that the number of people under observation increased to 233 by Tuesday evening.

“At present, not only the ones traveling from foreign countries, but also the local residents who have stayed in close proximity to the travelers are being kept under surveillance,” said IDSP State Director Rakesh Dayal.

However, amid the panic and pandemonium related to COVID-19 and its impact on the human race, Jharkhand residents may take a sigh of relief as the test results of at least 100 of the 233 people kept under observation here have come out negative. “We can say that more than half of the people kept under observation in Jharkhand have not tested positive for Coronavirus. We are keeping our fingers crossed and trying to do our best in ensuring that no positive case is reported from the State,” Dayal said.

The number of positive cases of Coronavirus rose to 151 in India on Wednesday, and the country is still said to be in the second stage of the pandemic. In case, the pandemic reaches its third stage in India, then it may lead to a complete lockdown across the country, said Dayal. The concerned in Jharkhand have been in touch with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, which has been taking regular updates about the situation in Jharkhand, sources said.

By now, no cases of Coronavirus have been reported in Jharkhand.

101,19-3-20,Rape conviction rate just 27.2%: Experts,"The 2012 Nirbhaya case is nearing closure with the four men held guilty of the crime scheduled to be hanged on Friday, but the conviction rate for rape remains an abysmal 27.2 per cent due mainly to lapses in the criminal justice system, say experts. From sensitising police personnel to strengthening the investigating infrastructure, what is needed is a complete overhaul of the system to ensure speedy justice to victims and survivors of sexual assault, they said.

""The low conviction rate shows that perpetrators of sexual violence enjoy a high degree of impunity, including being freed of charges,"" said Vani Subramanian from the women's empowerment group Saheli. Calling for an overhaul of the judicial system, former National Commission for Women (NCW) chief Lalitha Kumaramangalam said, ""It took seven years (since 2012) to get justice and there are hundreds of cases which do not evoke this kind of a response (that the Nirbhaya case got). We must have a moratorium on time.""

According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), 1,56,327 rape cases were on trial in 2018. Of these, trials were completed in 17,313 cases, resulting in conviction in only 4,708 cases. There were acquittals in 11,133 rape cases and discharge in 1,472 cases.

A case can be discharged before charges are framed but acquittals only happen when the trial concludes. Moreover, 1,38,642 rape cases remained pending in 2018.

""The case of the 23-year-old physiotherapy intern who was savagely gangraped on the night of December 16, 2012, and died a fortnight later, galvanising a movement for change in India's rape laws, is not an isolated one.

""Sexual assault occurs with frightening regularity in this country. We need to evolve punishments that act as true deterrents to the very large number of men who commit these crimes,"" said Subramanian.

Of the six convicted in the Nirbhaya case, one died during trial and another, a juvenile at the time of the offence, was set free after serving a three-year term in a reform facility. The four remaining convicts in the case are scheduled to be hanged together at 5.30 am on March 20. The implementation of their death warrants may send a strong message across but that may not be enough.

The situation could actually be getting worse rather than better. The 2018 conviction rate of 27.2 per cent was significantly less that in 2017 — when a conviction rate of 32.2 per cent was recorded. There were convictions only in 5,822 of the 18,099 rape cases whose trials were completed during that year, the NCRB data showed.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rape-conviction-rate--just-27-2---experts.html

104,19-3-20,"Malls, restaurants see 50% decline in footfall amid virus fear","Deserted restaurants, empty showrooms and closed multiplexes, malls in the national Capital amid coronavirus outbreak are a pale shadow of their former bustling selves.

Be it South Delhi's posh Select City Walk mall, its neighbour and newly-renovated DLF Avenue Mall or West Delhi's favourite go-to destination Pacific Mall, all have been at the receiving end of the coronavirus pandemic, witnessing over ""50 per cent"" decline in the footfalls so far.

""The fear of the novel coronavirus outbreak has resulted into 60 per cent less footfall in the mall. Shutting down of theatres is also the reason behind the sharp decline I guess,"" said Ankit Seth, Manager, Bath & Body Works at Select City mall.

The Delhi government on March 12 declared the coronavirus (COVID-19) an epidemic and decided to shut down cinema halls, schools and colleges till March 31 in the national capital as a precautionary measure. Decision on the closure of malls is still awaited.

Even weekends did little to bring back the absent cheer in the various plush stores which visibly remained empty during the good part of the day and staff members outnumbered customers by a fair margin.

""I have been working as a salesman for over 13 years now but I have never seen this slow business in a mall, and that too on weekends,"" said a salesperson of a famous clothing brand on the condition of anonymity.

""To be honest, it is as good as being shut. Forget about getting good sale numbers, people are just not visiting the mall in the first place,"" he said.

Home Centre, a well-known home furnishing retail stores chain, refused to comment on the sales or dip in footfalls in their store. While the coffee shops, food court or sit-in are still registering a decent customer count, the situation is stark opposite for several fancy stand-alone and fine dining restaurants with staff members idly standing by empty tables.

""Yes, the dip in footfall is for everyone to see. There is hardly any customer in most of the restaurants. There are no cancellations, because people are hardly making any bookings,"" said an employee of Mamagoto in Select City mall.

Things were no different for Hotel Delmaar, Saatvik, Punjab Grill or the recently-opened Daryaganj restaurant in Pacific mall -- all waiting desperately for customers but to no avail.

Interesting enough, the few who did turn up in the mall amidst this widespread fear of the deadly virus said this would be their ""last visit"" till the time the dust settles on the highly contagious disease.

""I mainly came because of my children. They were so hell-bent that they had to go and were not ready to take no for anything. But then I have made things very clear that this one would be for the last time until things improve. Also, we don't plan to stay for long,"" said 35-year-old Gurpreet Singh, who had come to Pacific mall along with his family members.

That said, most of these malls are claiming to follow all the guidelines issued in the health advisory by the government to ensure ""hygiene and clean environment"" in the premises.

Besides providing sanitizers at entrance, washrooms and lobbies, Select City mall also has the facility of thermal scanners checking the temperature of incoming visitors at different entry points.

""The housekeeping staff has been guided to wipe door handles, escalator belts, lift handrails, lift buttons, WC seat covers and faucets at increased frequency and hourly mopping with Virex II 256 disinfectant.

""Also, a communication has been sent to the retailers in the shopping centre to keep hand sanitisers at the store entrance so that people entering the store sanitize their hands,"" said Yogeshwar Sharma, executive director & CEO, Select Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.

116,19-3-20,Nath’s fear stops rebel MLAs from return: BJP,"When the Congress party leaders led by Digvijay Singh ran from pillar to post to meet their “rebel” MLAs in Bengaluru on Wednesday, the BJP claimed that Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister is an accused in 1984 riots so the MLAs camping in Karntaka are apprehensive of possible attack if they return to home State.

While talking to media persons at Sehore, BJP state president VD Sharma told, “The Chief Minister in Madhya Pradesh is an accused in 1984 riots so out of fear of being crushed, people who are outside the State, don’t wish to return.” Former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan accompanied Sharma.

Chouhan after days of political bickering, seemed in jovial and relaxed mood as he played cricket with his partymen in his home town Sehore where the BJP MLAs are kept in a hotel for the last few days. Chouhan tried hands in batting and bowling.

“We have utmost faith in the apex court and those who don’t have are resorting to foul language and physical tussle,” Chouhan said apparently hinting towards Congress workers’ protest at BJP office in Bhopal during which the workers of both the parties physically assaulted each other on Wednesday.

On charges of him being power greedy, Chouhan said, “Friend, I could have continue in power (after a close result in 2018) when people were ready to switch over but I offered you the chance to run the government but you failed to do so and your MLAs ran away.” Chouhna also affirmed that MLAs outside MP had threats to their lives if they returned to the state.

Meanwhile, in Bhopal, hundreds of Congress workers annoyed with the arrest of their leaders in Bengaluru marched towards the BJP office and some of them, dodging, police barricading approached the gates of the opposition party office. Armed with sticks, both the party workers assaulted each other before the police personnel stepped in and whisked away some Congress workers in their vans.

Later alleging armed assault by Congress workers, led by district head Vikas Veerani approached Habibganj police station to lodge a complaint. “When the Congress has failed to tackle us in assembly, its workers are resorting to such dastardly acts,” BJP state head VD Sharma said in a statement.

Congress leaders also staged a protest march till Rajbhavan against BJP’s attempt to dislodge an democratically elected government and preventing Digvijaya Singh from meeting party MLAs in Bengaluru.

Meanwhile after making a surprise visit at Bengaluru in wee hours, Digvijaya Singh and others had tried meeting the DGP in Bengaluru and after failing to meet him, Singh started his dharna in the Karnataka city while several others returned to Bhopal.

In between the Kamal Nath cabinet which met in Bhopal early in the day offered district status to Maihar, Chachoda and Nagda towns to please it’s MLAs. Maihar’s elevation as district was a demand from BJP MLA Narayan Tripathi who is hovering between the Congress and BJP for the past few months. The State Government also assigned cabinet and MoS status to several leaders recently appointed in State Commissions.

Meanwhile the Supreme Court after hearing arguments in the petition of MP BJP, posted the matter for hearing on Thursday.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/nath---s-fear-stops-rebel-mlas-from-return--bjp.html

High drama unfolded this morning near the resort, as Singh, a two-time Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister, staged a protest accusing the police of not allowing him to meet the legislators, following which he was detained briefly and released later.

Singh, along with Karnataka Congress chief DK Shivakumar, is meeting police top brass seeking opportunity to meet the MLAs.

He hit out at Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa, accusing them of trying to block their efforts to get in touch with the legislators.

""We have come here voluntarily on our own wish; we have got to know from some people that a few leaders from Madhya Pradesh including Digvijaya Singh and some MLAs have come here. We don’t want to talk to anybody,"" Congress rebel MLA from Sumawali Adal Singh Kansana said in a video message.

""We have tried enough to speak with every one for the last one year, when they did not hear us for one year, what they will hear us in one day? We want to say only this that we have come here as per our wish and go back as per our wish,"" he added.

Another rebel MLA Govind Singh Rajput too said they have come voluntarily and don’t want to meet anybody.

""We got to know that Digvijaya Singh has come with a few Ministers and leaders. Unnecessarily at the gate they are saying they want to meet us. When no MLA wants to meet him, they should not be doing this. All MLAs have sent in their resignation,"" he said in a video message.

120,19-3-20,"Shorten Budget Session, demand OPP mps","A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated that current Budget Session of Parliament will not be curtailed, Opposition members in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday demanded calling off the ongoing Session in view of the coronavirus scare across the country. Congress and other Opposition MPs suggested that the Budget Session be curtailed to practice social distancing being advocated by the Government to limit the spread of Covid-19 (coronavirus disease).

Some members wearing face masks as protection against the coronavirus walked in the upper house but the same was objected by Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu who said it was against the rules to wear any masks inside the House. However, when senior Congress leader P Chidambaram urged Naidu to allow MPs to decide on using protective gear depending on their perception of vulnerability, the Chair agreed.

Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi opposed any curtailment saying the House has to show the resolve to fight the infection. ""Showing any panic will not be in the national interest,"" Naqvi said. He went on to quote Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the need to show resolve to fight the coronavirus.

Naidu said the entire Parliament Complex has been sanitized and hand sanitizers have been kept at various places. ""I cannot simply respond to you on my own behalf. After all, it is the decision of the government and then of the House,"" he said on pleas for curtailing the session. Two sanitizers were also placed inside the House as well.

Members also highlighted problems being faced by people due to shortage and high prices of sanitisers and masks amid outbreak of coronavirus. Trinamool MPs Derek O'Brien, Sukhendu Sekhar Ray said they were following the government advisory in wearing the masks.

While Congress' M V Rajeev Gowda urged the government to either curtail or postpone the remaining sittings of the Budget session, his party colleague Anand Sharma said the government was preaching social distancing but is not following it in Parliament.

""We meet people from everywhere across the country and we are probably most at risk within Parliament, and the House of Elders with extremely senior people are also at risk. The virus does not know that we are MPs. The virus does not care about MPs,"" Gowda said.

While several members associated themselves with Chidambaram's submission that they should be allowed to wear masks, Naidu accepted his argument but said the House was setting a precedent. ""I want all these things to go on record. That is all. We are setting a precedent,"" he said.

""I have no problem personally, if members feel vulnerable, as Chidambaramji has said, and they make their own preventive arrangements,"" Naidu said. He said MPs can make suggestions on further strengthening measures in the Parliament House complex to check the spread of coronavirus.

Congress MP Ripun Bora highlighted problems being faced by people due to shortage and high prices of sanitisers and masks amid outbreak of coronavirus. He urged the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to monitor the supply, and ensure their availability and proper prices so that there is no panic among the public.

Making a special mention on the coronavirus issue, Sanjay Singh (AAP) stressed on increasing number of testing centres, and follow the model adopted by South Korea in this regard. He also made a case for increasing the number of quarantine centres as the country should be prepared for a ""medical emergency"".",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/shorten-budget-session--demand-opp-mps.html

122,19-3-20,"PDS beneficiaries can lift 6-month quota of grains in one go, says Paswan","Consumers will be allowed to lift their rations from ration shops for six months in one go amid the coronavirus outbreak across the country.

As the number of coronavirus cases rise to 151, Union Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Wednesday said 75 crore beneficiaries under the public distribution system will be allowed to lift their quota of subsidised foodgrains for six months in one go. Against the backdrop of rising coronavirus infections, the decision seeks to ensure that poor people have enough foodgrains in the event of possible restrictions that could lead to difficulty in getting the supplies.

Currently, beneficiaries are lifting grains in advance for maximum two months, while the Punjab Government is already distributing six-month quota in one go. The Ministry has issued an advisory to state governments for taking necessary safety measures to manage crowd at ration shops in view of the COVID-19 outbreak.

""Lifting of more grains in one go will ease pressure on central storage as some quantity of wheat is kept in the open. We have enough foodgrains in our godowns. We have asked state governments and Union Territories to distribute six-month quota of grains to the poor in one go,"" Paswan added. The government has surplus foodgrains of 435 lakh tonne as of now, of which 272.19 lakh tonne is rice and 162.79 lakh tonne is wheat.

The PDS requirement for April is about 135 lakh tonne of rice and 74.2 lakh tonne of wheat, the minister said adding the government has enough supply to meet the demand and states can lift the quota in advance. At present, the government supplies 5 kilogram of subsidised foodgrains per month to each beneficiary under the PDS through 5,00,000 ration shops in the country. This costs the exchequer about Rs 1.4 lakh crore annually. Foodgrains via ration shops are supplied at a highly subsidised rate of Rs 3/kg for rice, Rs 2/kg for wheat and Rs 1/kg for coarse grains under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).

Paswan also stated that the Centre is closely monitoring the prices of soaps, floor cleaners and thermal scanners because of surge in demand of these items amid growing coronavirus cases in the country.

Using the phone’s location, the Geo-map automatically zooms into the user’s location on the map, allowing them to see the reports of cases around them. This is the most important information people are looking for, and now, they can find it within seconds,” said Anupam Tiwari.

He said the CORONAPP was different from what was available in the market. “There were only websites that provided chunks and chunks of information. We wanted to create a platform that had all the information one should know about the Coronavirus; from statistics to basic precautions, and one can also input information manually. The app is updated in real-time as it is powered by data provided by the Centres for Disease Control and World Health Organisation,” said Tiwari.

Tiwari is working as an exchange student in University of California, Berkely. The CoronApp is the outcome of a joint venture he had with likeminded students from various universities working with him in UCB.

The Commission headed by former Bombay High Court Chief Justice J. N. Patel, which should have begun the hearings in Pune by now, has deferred the hearings till March 30 in view of the pandemic Covid-19.

It is further notified that these hearings will take place in Mumbai from March 30 to April 4. Detailed schedules of hearing will be notified,” VV Palnitkar, Secretary to the Commission, said in a statement issued here.

Seventy-nine-year-old Pawar, who being the chief minister of Maharashtra on three occasions is well versed in running the State Government, will depose before the Commission on April 4, apparently on the “politically biased” manner in which the previous Devendra Fadnavis Government ensured the investigations into the December 31, 2017 Elgaar Parishad and subsequent disturbances at Bhima-Koretgaon on January 1, 2018.

More than a month back, Pawar had made no bones about his displeasure over chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s decision to let the National Investigation Agency (NIA) over the 2018 Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case, last month.

Expressing his displeasure to the chief minister’s decision, Pawar had said: : “Under the Constitution, maintaining law & order is a state subject. In the first place, it was improper on the Centre to encroach upon the rights of the state and take over the case from the Pune police. It was much more improper on the state government’s part to support the Centre’s move (to ask the NIA to take over the case).

It may be recalled that on January 25 --a day after the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) handed over the investigations in the Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case to the NIA, a miffed Pawar had charged that the ruling BJP – with an acute fear of being exposed in the case – had hurriedly handed over the investigations to the NIA.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sharad-pawar-to-appear-before-bhima-koregaon-panel-on-apr-4.html

The erring youth who had returned from London —where he picked up the disease in a birthday party — chose to ignore the Airport staff advice to get admitted to the Beleghata Infectious Disease Hospital and drove straight back to his home.

To add salt to injury his mother a Deputy Secretary level officer chose not to pay heed to the doctors’ advice and avoided her son’s hospitalization for the second time when the doctors at MR Bangur Hospital advised her to do so.

The medical staff with whom the official and her son met at the MR Bangur Hospital too have been quarantined, sources said.

A visibly angry Chief Minister on Wednesday said, “no one is allowed to break the protocol. It is not the question of whether one is a VIP or an LIP … it is the question of the safety of the people in general. No one must behave irresponsibly so as to infect the others … This is an irresponsible response…” she said wondering how the youth managed to ignore the advice of the Air Port staff.

Between March 15 when the infected youth from London returned and March 17 — when he was finally admitted to the hospital along with his parents, two drivers and two domestic helps — the youth allegedly visited some places where he came in contact with some persons, sources said.

His mother, a senior official in the Home Department who too was currently in hospital attended her office at Writers’ Buildings and Nabanna (State secretariat) attending meetings with Home Secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay.

Incidentally Bandopadhyay and his wife, the Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University too went into self-quarantine on account of his coming in contact with the said erring official, Home Department sources said adding not only the staff but also the Ministers who too sit at Nabanna could be at risk.

While the youth had tested positive the pathological samples of the persons he came in contact with including his parents were yet to be tested, sources said.

Meanwhile, the Chief Minister advised utmost caution saying about a lakh people have flown back home from foreign countries. “We want everyone including the officials and the common public to follow the basic protocols as we in Kolkata have received about 95,000 people who have flown back home from foreign countries. Many more people are flying back tomorrow. So we have to be extremely cautious,” Banerjee said.

150,19-3-20,Cong MP demands legislation for protection of journalists,"A Congress MP in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday made a demand for enacting a legislation for protection of journalists, claiming India has become one of the most dangerous countries in the world to be a journalist. MV Rajeev Gowda (Cong) raised the issue through a Zero Hour mention in the Upper House.

""There is an urgent need to enact a national legislation for protection of journalists. In the past several years India has become one of the most dangerous countries in the world to be a journalist,"" he said. Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu pointed out that he should not make sweeping remarks and cautioned him.

""Let us not make such a sweeping remark. You (Gowda) are a well read person...Some report, some international...Member saying it from Parliament that will be quoted outside also. I am only cautioning...,"" he said.

Gowda said last year, India ranked 13th in the global impunity index by the community to protect journalists which features countries with the worst record of punishing killers of journalists. The organisation Reporters without Borders has listed India at 140 out of 180 countries on its World Press Freedom Index, he said.

The Congress MP said a sub-committee of the Press Council of India prepared a detailed report on attacks faced by working journalists in 2015. ""It found 80 journalists have been killed in India since 1990 and most of the cases are still pending in courts,"" he said.

""We have also heard of tragic cases of murder of journalists. Along with that threats, intimidation and violence against journalists are also a major problem. How long we will let this happen,"" he asked.

152,19-3-20,All out efforts for tribal development in MP,"Envisioning fast paced development of the community, the Kamal Nath Government in Madhya Pradesh has launched various initiatives for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes.

Home to a vast population of indigenous people, the state government efforts, spread across financial, social and academic welfare, are geared towards integration of the Scheduled Tribes (STs) into the mainstream.

Enumerating welfare initiatives, officials at the state tribal development department say that a huge impetus has been placed on the education of tribal youth.

A range of scholarships have been made available to youth belonging to the scheduled tribes. Apart from pre-matriculation and post-matriculation scholarships, provisions have also been made to help community members study abroad.

In an attempt to boost enrollments of students belonging to the community in premier institutions, free coaching is being provided to 800 students preparing for competitive examinations like the JEE, NEET and CLAT.

Pushing for an improvement in female literacy, the department currently operates 73 ‘Kanya Shiksha Parisars’ with an enrollment capacity of 490 students each. Development of another nine such campuses is currently underway.

A budget of `1.09 Lakh has been set for each student enrolled at Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS) in the state. The EMRS are residential schools established and managed with financial assistance from the Government of India.

Nine Kanya Shiksha Parisar and four Gurukul campuses, run by the state government, have been upgraded into Eklavya Schools in consultation with the Central Government. Budgetary allocations of `13.08 crore have been made for the construction of auditoriums at 12 Eklavya campuses.

Retaining a special focus on the uplift of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTG) like Sahariya,

Bhariya and Baiga, the Kamal Nath Government disburses `1,000 per month directly to the bank account of the female head of each family belonging to these groups with a vision to arrest malnutrition among community members.

The PVTGs, earlier referred to as Primitive Tribal Groups, are Scheduled Tribes which continue to reflect the lowest levels of development, and are normally involved in a pre agricultural system existence like hunting and gathering.

The state government has further sanctioned allocations of Rs.18.5 crores for the proposed tribal development and cultural center for the PVTGs. Construction of the center is currently underway in the State Capital.

Computer training facilities have been established in districts with the highest concentration of PVTG tribes at a cost of `29.5 crores. The State Government also provides financial assistance to members of poor Tribal communities in order to help them fulfill their social obligations at times of a birth or demise in the family.

Indigenous people form a vast part of the citizenry in the state. 89 of the total 313 development blocks in Madhya Pradesh are earmarked as tribal areas. Taking a strong view of ruthless money lending which often results in the lender usurping the meager lands of these vulnerable groups, Madhya Pradesh has a blanket ban on the sale of tribal land to non-tribals.

Reflecting his understanding of the challenges faced by Scheduled Tribes, Chief Minister Kamal Nath has annulled all loans given to community members by unlicensed moneylenders. The State Government is further mulling policy to comprehensively wipeout the debt burden of these vulnerable groups.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/all-out-efforts-for-tribal-development-in-mp.html

Earlier in the day, S&P Global Ratings lowered India’s economic growth forecast to 5.2 per cent for 2020, saying the global economy was entering a recession amid the coronavirus pandemic. The agency had earlier projected a growth rate of 5.7 per cent during the 2020 calendar year.

Asia-Pacific economic growth in 2020 will more than halve to less than 3 per cent as the “global economy enters a recession”, S&P said in a statement.

Banking and telecom stocks came under heavy selling pressure after the Supreme Court pulled up the telecom companies for doing self-assessment of the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues fixed by the apex court in its verdict on October 24 last year.

The telecom companies have to clear all dues mentioned in the judgement, the court said.

“Indian markets ended at three-year lows, with Nifty below the 8,500 mark, in tandem with Asian and European markets after global agencies warned of a global recession following the impact of Covid-19. At the same time, rising infections in India and associated disruption in businesses led to India’s GDP growth forecasts also being downgraded. This will also affect the government’s fiscal maths, which was already tight.

“Additionally, with the supreme court not providing any respite to telecom players, the banking stocks which have exposure to the telecom sector were most impacted today. Nifty Bank index fell by around 7 per cent,” said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services.

All sectoral indices closed with losses, with BSE telecom, finance, utilities, bankex, power, realty and auto tanking up to 9.48 per cent. The BSE midcap index fell 0.73 per cent, while the smallcap gauge crashed 6.09 per cent.

On the global front, the stimulus measures announced by various countries failed to dispel investor gloom over the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul and Japan plunged up to 4.86 per cent.

Equity benchmarks in Europe tumbled up to 4 per cent in early trade.

US President Donald Trump has proposed an economic package which could approach USD 1 trillion, a rescue initiative not seen since the great recession of 2008.

Further, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has announced a USD 6.5 billion package for its developing member countries to fight the pandemic.

The number of deaths around the world linked to Covid-19 has topped 7,400, with over 1,80,000 infections recorded globally so far.

In India, the number of infected cases stood at 130, as per the union health ministry.

The Indian rupee pared initial gains to close 2 paise lower at 74.26 (provisional) against the US dollar on Wednesday amid sustained foreign fund outflows and heavy selling in domestic equities.

Forex traders said the Indian rupee failed to find a foothold as there were still concerns over the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the global as well as domestic economy.

At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local currency opened at 73.98. During the day, it shuttled between a high of 73.92 and a low of 74.42 against the greenback. The domestic unit finally finished at 74.26, down 2 paise over its previous close.

Besides, the lender would extend banking time for three days starting Thursday.

Soon after the lifting of the 13-day moratorium at 6 pm, some customers took to social media complaining that they were not able to access certain services, including internet and mobile banking.

“Our banking services are now operational. You can now experience the full suite of our services. Thank you for your patience and co-operation. #YESforYOU @RBI @FinMinIndia,” the lender said in a tweet.

There are also concerns in certain quarters that Yes Bank could see significant amount of deposit withdrawals.

“To serve you better, our branches will open one hour earlier at 08:30 hours from March 19 to 21, 2020. We have also extended banking hours across branches for our senior citizen customers, from March 19 to March 27, 2020, 16:30 hours to 17:30 hours,” the bank said in another tweet.

On March 5, the Reserve Bank of India had imposed a moratorium as well as superseded the board of the then struggling Yes Bank. Deposit withdrawals were capped at Rs 50,000 per account apart from other restrictions.

Under the Yes Bank reconstruction scheme, SBI and seven financial institutions, including private sector lenders, have infused around Rs 10,000 crore in the bank.

The top court, which was also anguished by frequently published newspaper articles on the AGR issue, said all managing directors of telecom companies will be personally responsible and held for contempt of court for any such future write-ups hiding the truth.

A Bench of Justice Arun Mishra, Justice SA Nazeer and Justice MR Shah refused to take up the Centre’s plea for allowing telecom companies to pay AGR dues in 20 years, saying the application will be taken up after two weeks.

“The time frame of 20 years is unreasonable. The telecom companies have to clear all dues mentioned in the judgment,” the bench said, adding it had settled all AGR dues after hearing telecom companies and the government then had fought tooth and nail for interests and penalties.

The Bench said it will summon the secretary and desk officer of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) who permitted telecom companies to do self-assessment of AGR dues.

“Exercise of self-assessment of AGR dues by telecom companies cannot be permitted even in wildest dreams,” it said. The court said serious fraud was being committed by telecom companies by asserting to do self-assessment of AGR dues and that its judgment was final and to be followed in letter and spirit.

“We will be party to fraud if we allow self-assessment of AGR dues by telecom companies,” the Bench said, adding, it cannot permit encroachment of its powers by allowing self-assessment.

The court also said that newspaper articles will not be able to influence its decision and it will draw contempt proceedings against the managing directors of telecom companies if they publish “fake news” against court on payment of AGR dues.

“Any future newspaper article hiding truth from public on telecom case will make MDs of telecos personally responsible,” the bench said.

The apex court had on October 24 last year ruled that the statutory dues need to be calculated by including non-telecom revenues in AGR of telecom companies.

166,19-3-20,Telcos self-assessed dues short of DoT’s AGR math,"Airtel, VIL, Tatas Rs 82,300 crore short

Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Group’s self-assessment of dues to the Government are a whopping Rs 82,300 crore short of what the telecom department calculated after the Supreme Court’s ruling on AGR.

The apex court on Wednesday lashed out at the telcos for trying to reopen the dues they owed to the government through the self-assessment exercise.

The Department of Telecommunications (DoT), according to its own submission to the apex court seeking relief in payment tenure, has put dues of the three companies at Rs 1.19 lakh crore.

The dues estimated by DoT for Bharti Airtel and Telnor was pegged at Rs 43,980 crore, while that of Vodafone Idea was Rs 58,254 crore, and Tata Group of companies at Rs 16,798 crore outlined under ‘total demand of DoT incorporating CAG and special audit as on October 2019’.

Against this, Bharti Group has calculated its dues at Rs 13,004 crore, Vodafone Idea at Rs 21,533 crore and Tata Group of companies at Rs 2,197 crore.

In all, AGR dues calculated by the government for 16 entities add up to Rs 1.69 lakh crore, while telcos’ self-assessment place their dues at a mere Rs 37,176 crore.

These dues arose after the Supreme Court, in October last year, upheld the government’s position on including revenue from non-core businesses in calculating the annual AGR of telecom companies, a share of which is paid as licence and spectrum fee to the exchequer.

The SC on Wednesday pulled up the Centre and telecom companies for doing self-assessment or reassessment of the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues fixed by the apex court in its verdict given on October 24 last year.

A Bench of Justice Arun Mishra, Justice SA Nazeer and Justice M R Shah refused to take up the Centre’s plea for allowing telecom companies to pay AGR dues in 20 years, saying the application will be taken up after two weeks.

The court said serious fraud was being committed by telecom companies by asserting to do self-assessment of AGR dues and that its judgment was final and to be followed in letter and spirit.

Beleaguered Vodafone Idea has pegged its total dues to the government following a Supreme Court order at Rs 21,533 crore. Earlier this week, Vodafone Idea paid another tranche of Rs 3,354 crore to the government, thereby taking its total payments to Rs 6,854 crore. The company said this was equivalent to full principal amount as per its self-assessment.

Bharti Airtel has paid Rs 13,004 crore to the government in two installments. It had also deposited an additional Rs 5,000 crore “as an ad-hoc payment (subject to subsequent refund/adjustment) to cover differences, if any, arising from the reconciliation exercise with the DoT.

170,19-3-20,Govt may cut rate on small savings schemes in next quarter,"The government is considering rate moderation for small savings schemes in the upcoming quarter, a development that could lead to speedier transmission of monetary policy rate cuts, sources said.

During the current quarter, the government refrained from cutting interest rates on small savings schemes, such as Public Provident Fund (PPF) and National Savings Certificate (NSC), despite moderating bank deposit rates.

Bankers have been complaining that high rates on small savings schemes prohibit them from cutting deposit rates.

Currently, there is a difference of nearly 100 basis points between deposit rate of banks and small savings rate for one-year maturity.

Earlier this week, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will take a call on an interest rate cut and all options were on the table to counter the coronavirus blow. Last month, the governor in an interview with PTI had said, “We have said it in MPC resolution that there is a case for reducing the small savings rates and aligning it more with the formula-based rate fixation. We have referred to it in the MPC resolution.”

The MPC in its February Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement said that while there is a need for adjustment in interest rates on small saving schemes, the external benchmark system introduced from October 1 last year has strengthened the monetary transmission.

The Finance Ministry has been nudging public sector banks to pass the whole repo rate cuts to retail loans for pushing consumption. Banks have resisted it fearing their margin will take a hit in case of 100 per cent transmission. Rates on small savings schemes are revised on quarterly basis.

On December 31, 2019, the government decided to keep interest rates for small savings schemes like PPF and NSC unchanged at 7.9 per cent for the fourth quarter of the current financial year, while the rate for the Kisan Vikas Patra maturing in 113 months was kept at 7.6 per cent.

The interest rate for 5-year Senior Citizens Savings Scheme was retained at 8.6 per cent, while that for savings deposits was kept unchanged at 4 per cent a year. The interest on the senior citizens’ scheme is paid quarterly.

However, the government had said that during the January-March 2020 quarter, the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana will offer 8.4 per cent rate.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-may-cut-rate-on-small-savings-schemes-in-next-quarter.html

In a report, it said that some airlines may choose to temporarily shut down their operations by design on the basis that demand is so low that such action would result in reduced losses than if they continue to operate.

As per the report, even before COVID-19 (coronavirus) appeared on the scene, most Indian carriers already had very strained balance sheets and almost no liquidity.

“This latest shock will once again expose the vulnerability of India’s aviation system as happened during the fuel price spike in 2008.

175,19-3-20,Trump becomes GOP's presumptive prez nominee,"US President Donald Trump has become the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee after his home state of Florida awarded him with enough numbers to cross the pledged delegate threshold.

As per the national delegate count, Trump on Tuesday had 1,330 pledged delegates in his kitty.

A Republican presidential aspirant needs 1,276 of the total 2,550 pledged delegates. A formal nomination would be announced at the Republican National Convention in August.

Trump's campaign in a statement said that the primary in his home state of Florida put him above the delegate threshold to become the presumed 2020 Republican nominee for president.

The primary season saw him shatter records for vote totals and vote percentages.

With Florida's 122 delegates awarded to the President, he has 1,330 delegates, above the 1,276 needed to win the nomination.

“The Republican Party is more unified and energized than ever before and it's because of President Trump's leadership and clear record of accomplishment on behalf of all Americans,” said Brad Parscale, Trump's 2020 campaign manager.

177,19-3-20,"World virus infections hit 2L, Borders jammed in Europe","Desperate travellers choked European border crossings on Wednesday after nations implemented strict controls in an attempt to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus, creating traffic jams miles long and slowing the passage of trucks carrying critical supplies.

The number of people infected worldwide crested the 200,000 mark and deaths topped 8,000, with the number of people now recovered at more than 82,000, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.

In an attempt to alleviate some of the pressure from eastern Europeans stuck in Austria trying to return home, Hungary overnight opened its borders in phases. Bulgarian citizens were first allowed to cross in carefully controlled convoys, then Romanians had a turn.

But by early Wednesday on the Austrian side of the border, trucks were backed up for 28 kilometers (17 miles) and cars for 14 kilometers (nearly 9 miles) as rules allowing only Hungarians or transport trucks through the country's borders kicked back in.

European Union leaders have been working on how to make sure that food, medical supplies and other essential goods keep flowing but so far borders have been clogged. Looking ahead, they're also trying to figure out ways to allow seasonal agricultural workers, needed to keep the production of food going, to travel back and forth across essentially closed borders.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/world-virus-infections-hit-2l--borders-jammed-in-europe.html
178,19-3-20,Iran reports largest spike in virus as 147 more die,"Iran reported its single biggest jump in deaths from the new coronavirus on Wednesday as another 147 people died, raising the country's overall death toll to 1,135.

The nearly 15 per cent spike in deaths — amid a total of 17,361 confirmed cases in Iran — marks the biggest 24-hour rise in fatalities since officials first acknowledged cases of the virus in Iran in mid-February.

Still, even as the number of cases continues to grow each day, food markets were still packed with shoppers on Wednesday and highways were crowded with traffic as families traveled between cities ahead of the Persian New Year, Nowruz, on Friday.

Iran's deputy health minister, Alireza Raisi, urged the public to avoid travel and crowded places. In a statement on state TV, Raisi told Iranians the coming period represented two ""golden weeks"" to try curb the virus from spreading further.

He criticized people for not adhering to the warnings to stay home, saying the virus is very serious. ""This is not a good situation at all,"" he said.

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday defended his government's response to the coronavirus outbreak in the face of of widespread criticism that officials acted too slowly and may have even covered up initial cases before infections rapidly spread across the country.

In a speech to his Cabinet, Rouhani said the Government was “straightforward"" with the nation, saying it announced the outbreak as soon as it learned about it on Feb. 19.

""We spoke to people in a honest way. We had no delay,” he added.

The Government has come under heavy criticism for what has been seen as a slow and inadequate response. For weeks, government officials implored clerics to shut down crowded holy shrines to stymie the spread of the virus. The Government finally closed the shrines this week.

""It was difficult of course to shut down mosques and holy sites, but we did it. It was a religious duty to do it,” Rouhani said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/iran-reports-largest-spike-in-virus-as-147-more-die.html
179,19-3-20,More than functional,"Bathroom accessories are not just visually appealing but also capable of delivering an indulgent experience with therapeutic benefits, says Ayushi Sharma

Bathrooms are not just for functional needs any more. These are spaces where you spend some ‘me time’, reflecting and rejuvenating. Elegance, mood lighting and world-class amenities are some of the upgrades that we are looking at. So some careful thinking and planning are the order of the day in conceiving a bathroom with the right materials, textures, lighting, accessories and facilities that can uplift one’s mood and relax completely.

But the question is how and why traditional bathroom accessories are getting an uber upgrade? Sandeep Shukla, Head Marketing and Communication, Global Operations, Jaquar Group, feels that with evolving requirements and increasing income, the way we use our spaces is being re-imagined and that includes bath spaces as well. “From a purely functional space, bathrooms have emerged to becoming aspirational and designer. Consumers want to build a retreat, away from all the stress and strains of modern, urban life. Often our bathrooms are that wellness haven. This, in turn, has driven consumers towards bathroom accessories that are not just visually appealing but also capable of delivering an indulgent experience with therapeutic benefits,” says he.

The discerning customers seek luxury and at the same time want their bathrooms to reflect their personality. “This has led to an increase in mindshare of bath spaces,” believes spokesperson from Kohler. And Monica Chawla, Founder and Principal Designer at Essentia Environments, concurs with it. She says, “Having travelled abroad, Indians have got more exposed to a refined lifestyle and designs. They want the same in their homes.”

Bathroom accessories were usually monochromatic but during the past few years, colours have been adding character to bath spaces. The spokesperson from Kohler tells us that colours can give your bathroom a new lease of life. Another aspect is faucets. It is an “important design element in your bathroom and so is its finish, which can fundamentally change the look and feel of a bathroom. One needn’t stick to the standard steel grey faucets as there are a variety of finishes to express your style — vibrant brushed nickel, transitional like vibrant brushed bronze or chic like vibrant rose gold,” adds the spokesperson.

Aesthetics that follow a common plan in the entire bathroom with a uniform design of fixtures in faucets, showers and sanitaryware clubbed with technology is the rising trend, Sandeep shares. Consumers are customising not just their living areas but are taking a keen interest in ensuring their bathrooms are just as luxe and visually stunning. He says that they are experimenting with light-play in showers, tuning into music as per their moods or features such as automatically regulating the water temperature and flow through touch-enabled smart controls.

Moreover, with water scarcity imminent in the near future, conservation without compromising on the experience is something that the customers are actively exploring. “Also, consumers are more conscious of investing in sustainable products and therefore, there are numerous options that companies now offer. For instance, we have the Jaquar Air Shower that can save up to 30 per cent water and the Jaquar Maze Shower that offers improved performance even in low water-pressure conditions. Products like the Jaquar iFlush save space and can be installed directly in regular pipelines. Whereas, the Dual Flushing systems with beta valves are designed to save up to 50 to 60 per cent water daily,” adds Sandeep.

Experts share that wallpapers have travelled beyond the living and bedrooms to the bathrooms imparting these spaces a personal touch. They suggest that wallpapers are the best way to transform a room’s mood. A wallpaper doesn’t take up much space yet instantly injects personal style. There are a lot of nature-inspired 3D wallpapers that people are choosing more for their bathrooms as they make the space more interactive.

Cabinet spaces too blend into the changed asthetics. Monica tells us that bathrooms will display simpler ways of life as they minimise item storage and the space required. “Compact storage closets, cabinets, shelves which are simple and promote minimalist habits are the way to go. Even if your other rooms are not as minimal, the bathroom is a relaxation sanctuary and compact storage can effectively provide just that,” she says.

In today’s era of stress, pressure and fatigue, personal wellness, relaxation and luxury are important features in bathrooms. Many brands have a range of wellness products that help you relax your body, calm your nerves and invigorate your senses. Sandeep says that a caressing and stimulating power bathing experience is therefore a must, today, to unwind, replenish and recharge our stressed-out bodies. A lot of bath and sanitaryware companies are focussing on premium bath and wellness quotient. For instance, there are swimming pools with UV filtration system, ozone filtration and much more as the demand for indulgent bath and wellness has risen. With that, products such as spas, whirlpools, saunas, bathtubs and steam cabins have also become an essential element in urban households, he says.

The role of technology in the evolution of these products has expanded. “The importance of therapeutic treatments such as hydro and chromotherapy in spas has become a crucial feature. The primary motive behind such features is to accentuate and customise experiences offering maximum benefit to customers. They often want spa-like features in swimming pools where they can swim as well as rejuvenate. Our wellness models such as the Jaquar Swim Spas with the swim and spa zone options cater to that very trend. They have multiple features including the in-demand UV sterilising system and Ozone filtration for maximum benefits and hygiene,” he shares.

Another example comes from Kohler — One Touch Spa at Home DTV+, which brings in a multi-sensory, ultra-luxury spa experience via a cutting-edge touchscreen shower technology.

Besides serving a functional purpose, a bathroom is also a private space which enhances your unique lifestyle. Call it a freshness boost, a relaxing massage, a cleaning ritual or in short, dub it as ‘power bathing’, the modern-day bathroom is very much a personal sanctuary that spells the ultimate in relaxation.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/more-than-functional-2020-03-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/more-than-functional.html

Steven reimagines West Side Story

Filmmaker Steven Spielberg says that he wanted to make a film on the battle against xenophobia and racial prejudice.

That's the reason he decided to reimagine the musical West Side Story for the big screen.

It was actually the first piece of popular music our family ever allowed into the home. I absconded with it — this was the cast album from the 1957 Broadway musical — and just fell completely in love with it as a kid. West Side Story has been that one haunting temptation that I have finally given in to,” Spielberg said.

181,19-3-20,Speak to be heard,"Talking to kids about virus? Experts say be calm and honest

It was a routine game of schoolyard tag — except the children had dubbed this version “Coronavirus.” The kids ran around and tagged one another, but instead of being “it,” they “caught” the virus.

Children like the ones a reporter saw playing recently at a school in Washington, DC, are becoming more aware of the coronavirus — though they may not fully understand it or know how seriously to take it — as it begins to affect their daily lives with school closures and event cancellations, restrictions on travel, and the NBA nixing the rest of its season.

Many parents are now deciding how to talk to their children about the virus. Some said they are checking in daily, while others worry talking about it could make their kids more anxious or fearful. “We talk about it a lot. I watch the news every morning and they’re always watching it, too,” said Nicole Poponi, mother of Clara, 10, and Jane, 12, in the Philadelphia suburb of Audubon, New Jersey.

Both girls said they’ve talked a little about the virus at school, but Jane, who is a few grades ahead, said she has talked about it much more, including in science lessons. “I’m not really as scared of it. It’s still not even that many people getting sick here. And it’s less dangerous than the flu,” Jane said. “One of my friends is really scared of it, but she’s honestly really scared of all diseases.”

Beth Young, who lives in Fort Mill, South Carolina, said she has decided to limit the conversation with her four kids, ages 8, 10, 12 and 15. “I don’t want to doom and gloom them into being afraid of getting sick because, let’s face it, kids get sick pretty often,” she said. “And I don’t need a sniffle to turn into them worrying about dying.”

For most people — including children — the new coronavirus, which causes a disease called COVID-19, results in only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organisation, which has declared the outbreak a pandemic, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

Child psychology experts’ advice is to be reassuring, focus on proactive steps and do research to truthfully answer children’s questions. In Kathleen McEvoy’s house in Norton, Massachusetts, she and her husband, Thom Daly, decided they wanted to talk with their 8-year-old daughter, Kennedy, before something like a quarantine or school closure was announced. “We thought it would be confusing and scary for a kid if they were told that school has to be closed for two weeks,” McEvoy said. “We felt like it was important ... to give her a lot of information about how this might impact her life even if we don’t know exactly how yet.”

McEvoy, 38, works as a paraprofessional at a different school district and said some second graders had talked about how they thought the virus was spread. Some thought they could catch it from eating Chinese food or from touching bats or pigs.

The teacher spent some time searching for an age-appropriate video to help them understand how the virus is actually spread, McEvoy said. It’s important to reassure children, to ask whether they have questions and to stress safety, said Dr. Jamie Howard, a clinical psychologist at the nonprofit Child Mind Institute. The institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention both offer tips on talking to children.

Some teachers and coaches are working to dispel any idea that the virus, which was first recorded in China, is tied to ethnicity or race. Seattle Public Schools posted on its website that misinformation has led to fear and hostility and it urged students to combat racism and bias. “We are aware of reports that some of our Asian students have been targeted and discriminated against in connection to COVID-19. This is unacceptable and contrary to our values of racial equity and social justice,” district leaders wrote.

Lacy Hilbrich’s two daughters, ages 14 and 18, are part of an online school that has students from all over the world. They live near Houston, but some of her daughters’ classmates are in countries where there are quarantines in place.

The virus, she said, has been part of her family’s daily discussion. “In our family we all talk about it, so it’s pretty open and so they’re not hiding anything from us,” said daughter Ally, 14. “And I think that’s helped a lot.” Parents should explain that measures like wearing face masks and closing schools are preventative and temporary, Howard said. She urged them to take a page from Mister Rogers, who taught kids to “focus on the helpers” — what doctors, teachers, parents and scientists are doing to keep them safe.

Whatever the conversation looks like, Howard said, parents should not collude in their child’s anxiety by refusing to go outside or by buying masks. “In doing those behaviours, you’re saying this is really dangerous and we really are in danger right now,” she said. “And that’s not true, and it will make them more anxious.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/speak-to-be-heard-2020-03-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/speak-to-be-heard.html

Outside experts say a coronavirus epidemic in the North could be devastating due its chronic lack of medical supplies and outdated health care infrastructure. Kim's comments were made during a ceremony Tuesday marking the start of construction on a new hospital.

North Korea has engaged in an intense campaign to guard against the new virus, though it has steadfastly maintained that no one has been sickened, a claim many foreign experts doubt.

190,19-3-20,Ticket to Hollywood,"Producer Shardul Sharma narrates that after being mentored by choreographer Shiamak Davar, he took a huge leap and landed at Paramount Pictures, redefining his goals amid steady competition

A dream doesn’t become reality through magic. It takes sweat, determination and hard work to make it come true.” These words by Colin Powell worked as the guiding force for a happy-go-lucky Mumbai boy, Shardul Sharma, who started working with ace Indian choreographer Shiamak Davar at the age of 16. He wanted to make his own space in the entertainment industry. He has given several national and international dance performances and also represented India in the closing ceremony of Commonwealth Games 2006, being part of two Bollywood films — Kisna and Bunty Aur Babli. He has trained several ‘A’ list actors too.

Shardul, after taking a huge leap in his career, has now landed in Hollywood with Paramount Pictures, redefining his goals amid steady competition. Soon after college, he started working with 108 Productions as a producer/partner, which made corporate films, ads, commercial films and music videos. Unfortunately, in 2007, he met with an accident and after working for six years as a part of the core team for Davar, Shardul had to quit dancing.

He continued to work with Davar, managing all his business operations. However, if it wouldn’t have been for one of his close friends, he wouldn’t have landed in Hollywood. His friend, who did a filmmaking course from New York Film Academy in Los Angeles, suggested Shardul to take up the same course. The course later proved to be the turning point. Eight years on, he joined Paramount Pictures, which is recognised as one of the top five entertainment studios in Hollywood.

Shardul, who is coordinating the physical production in the film department, says, “Since I have joined, I have worked on two films — Clifford: The Big Red Dog and Infinite. The films are scheduled to release later this year. It’s been almost a year since I started working at Paramount and I am thoroughly enjoying it. I have produced several short films, commercials, music videos and feature films both in India and the US. The last film I produced here in LA was Normal, written and directed by Mragendra Singh.”

The film also premiered at the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival and has been well received at several other film festivals, including Singapore South Asian International Film Festival and Jagran Film Festival in India. Normal will also be screened at the Seattle Asian American Film Festival in April.

Shardul adds, “Currently, we are also in talks with major digital networks for releasing the film later this year. I am also developing and producing feature films independently both in the US and India. I have three films and one TV series that will go for production this year.”

Talking about the differences of working in Hollywood as compared to Bollywood, he says, “In Bollywood, the director is considered to be the most important person in making a film which is undoubtedly true. But in Hollywood, the producer has the important role. It is the producer who hires a director and leads the entire production. Here, it is the producer’s job that starts right from developing the film and goes on until the film is distributed or sold.”

The list of Hollywood directors Shardul wants to work with is long. Naming some of them, he says, “The list is so long that I don’t even know where to start from. I would definitely like to work with new and emerging filmmakers. I would love to work with Damien Chazelle (director of movies La La Land and Whiplash) and Ryan Coogler (director of Creed, Fruitvale Station, Black Panther). I grew up watching films made by David Fincher, Cohen brothers, Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, Sam Mendes, Ang Lee and James Cameron, and hence, working with them will be a dream come true.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ticket-to-hollywood-2020-03-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/ticket-to-hollywood.html

And there is little hope that Saina Nehwal and Kidambi Srikanth will be able to make the cut, especially after Badminton World Federation (BWF) was forced to postpone all events due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 57-year-old Vimal, who represented India at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, said it will be sad to see Saina and Srikanth miss Olympics this time.

“They were going through a low phase for quite sometime and even if the qualifying tournaments happened, it would have taken a herculean task to qualify for Olympics. Even at the All England, their performance wasn’t very good,” he said.

“Srikanth needs a separate program regarding his physical training, take more initiative and find his way back. He might not play Olympics this time but can still come back and play at top level for 3-4 years. He had niggles so he couldn’t play attacking badminton.

“Saina also had injury issues. She is putting the effort in the practice sessions but not able to convert in match situations. It is sad that they are going through such a low phase. It will be a blow for Indian badminton, they missing out,” said Vimal, who had coached Saina from 2014 to 2017.

Srikanth and Saina are currently ranked 14th and 20th respectively in the BWF ranking with only the top 16 making the cut when the Olympic qualification deadline ends on April 28.

Vimal said Srikanth can still squeeze in if BWF freezes the ranking and doesn’t extend the qualification period.

“Srikanth is still 14th in ranking now and if BWF maintains this ranking till April 28, he can get lucky and still make it,” he said.

The former India badminton coach is also extremely disappointed with the way Indonesian doubles coach Flandy Limpele left abruptly in an Olympic year and said foreign appointees must be held accountable for departing without completing their tenures.

Limpele, who was hired in March 2019, recently stepped down as India’s doubles coach, citing family reasons, becoming the fourth such foreign coach to have resigned without completing the tenure.

“It was very unfortunate and unprofessional of Flandy to leave this way. When the doubles players had qualified for Olympics and had chances of doing well, to leave in the middle of it, I was disappointed,” Vimal, who served as India’s chief national coach from 2003 to 2006 said.

“I had a long chat with him in January. He had said then that some players were not disciplined but he said he will work with them and then suddenly he left just before All England.”

Earlier, Korean Kim Ji Hyun, who guided P V Sindhu to a world championship Gold, made an unceremonious exit last September.

Renowned Indonesian coach Mulyo Handoyo also resigned abruptly in late 2017 before joining the Singapore squad.

Malaysia’s Tan Kim Her stepped down as India’s doubles coach early last year, 18 months before his tenure was to end.

“I think they have to be made accountable. We need to be very clear that they stick to the group, or the certain number of players that they have to handle. It should be in the contract.

“We are paying them huge money, so we have to take that responsibility. They just can’t walk off without notice,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/it-will-be-sad-to-see-saina--srikanth-miss-olympics--vimal.html
193,19-3-20,Indian boxer’s Oly preparation won't be affected by travel bans: Santiago,"The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown the build-up to this year’s Olympics into disarray, but Indian boxing’s High Performance Director Santiago Nieva feels the country’s Tokyo-bound pugilists won’t be affected as they would be just fine training at home if travel restrictions don’t ease up.

Nieva is in precautionary quarantine till March 27 after the team’s return from the Asian Olympic Qualifiers in Jordan, where India secured an unprecedented nine Tokyo spots.

The entire squad was training in the Italian city of Assisi before heading to Jordan.

“It’s actually quite boring (in quarantine). I just about manage to pass my time here but we all have to be patient. This will be over soon and the preventive measures are for our good,” he said.

The Argentina-born Swede, who came on board back in 2017, sounded relaxed about India’s build-up plans.

“What’s the point in panicking?” he asked. “Whatever happens, it is going to be same for all the countries. So, even if the travel bans are not lifted, we have the infrastructure in India to ensure that our training is not affected,” he asserted.

The Indian boxers have traditionally preferred to travel abroad for training before the Olympics. They were, in fact, scheduled to be in Russia on a training-cum-competition trip in May before the now-postponed world qualifiers but that plan looks unlikely to work out in the current circumstances.

“The world qualifiers (in Paris) are in any case suspended as of now and we have secured Olympic spots in nine out of 13 categories. That is a huge advantage given the situation. As such, we are not under any pressure,” he explained.

Given that all training activities are suspended for now due to the precautionary measures in place, Nieva and his women’s team counterpart Raffaele Bergamasco will be conducting online classes for Indian coaches.

“I have been notified about it by the federation yesterday (on Tuesday). We will get going soon enough to utilise this time,” he said.

The idea behind the online classes is to ensure coaches in India are abreast with the latest technical rules. For this, they will also be given handbooks, detailing the changes that have come about in the scoring system among other things.

Talking about the Olympics, Nieva said the preparation for Tokyo began soon after he joined the Indian team in 2017. This was months after the Indian boxers failed to win any medals at the 2016 Games in Rio.

“We now enter the last leg of a process that started after the Rio Olympics. What we achieved at the Asian Qualifiers is a result of extensive training and competitions that we continuously participated in India as well as outside the country,” Nieva said.

“The India Open has become a huge platform for our boxers to gain experience against the best in the world. All that has made them a very confident bunch and they are not bothered who is the opposition.

“Plus we are also able to bounce back from deficits (during bouts) more strongly. We have a large pool of boxers as well which is keeping the national camp pretty competitive,” he added.

“When I joined in India, some journalists would ask me what I would do to improve the boxers' mental strength and I always considered that question funny because I never found anything lacking,” he recalled.

“I always knew they had it in them to take on anyone. And they demonstrated that in these qualifiers. I feel very proud of this performance and my conviction,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/indian-boxer---s-oly-preparation-won-t-be-affected-by-travel-bans--santiago.html
194,19-3-20,Wimbledon still planning for play despite virus mayhem,"Wimbledon organisers are still planning to play the Grand Slam this year, despite the coronavirus chaos that led the French Open to be pushed back until September.

Wimbledon is scheduled to run from June 29 to July 12, but All England Club chiefs are aware the sporting schedule has been decimated by the deadly pandemic.

French Open bosses on Tuesday revealed the clay-court event will move from its scheduled spring slot to September.

The year’s second Grand Slam was due to begin on May 24, but will now run from September 20 to October 4.

A roof has been installed over Roland Garros’ centre court, Philippe Chatrier, with floodlights on the three other main courts, enabling play to go on later.

Wimbledon remain hopeful that play at the grass-court tournament will be able to go ahead if the spread of the virus is slowed.

But Richard Lewis, chief executive of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, insisted they would put public safety first.

“At the heart of our decision-making is our commitment to the health and safety of our members, staff, and the public, and we are grateful to the government and public health authorities for their advice and support,” Lewis said.

“While we continue to plan for The Championships at this time, it remains a continuously evolving situation and we will act responsibly, in the best interests of wider society.

“We thank all of our members, staff, players, partners, contractors and the public for their patience and trust as we continue to navigate this unprecedented global challenge.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/wimbledon-still-planning-for-play-despite-virus-mayhem.html
195,19-3-20,Dutee worried about Oly qualification,"India’s fastest woman Dutee Chand is wary of missing out of the Olympics after she was deprived of her training-cum-competition stint in Germany, which affected her plans to qualify for the Tokyo Games.

The 24-year-old Dutee was to train and take part in Olympic qualifying events in Germany from March 2 but despite getting the visa and sponsorship, she could not make it there as Europe has now turned into an epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.

“I was to go for a training-cum-competition stint in Germany from March 2. I was planning to run in some quality competitions in Europe and hoping to qualify for the Olympics. But all my plans fell apart due to this coronavirus,” Dutee said from Patiala where she is taking part in the first leg of the Indian Grand Prix series on Friday.

“I have got the visa and other travel documents and was ready to go to Germany. But suddenly I got the message from the training base in Germany that I should not come due to the spread of coronavirus. I am very disappointed,” said the national record holder 100m sprinter. Asked how confident she is about qualifying for Tokyo Olympics, Dutee, who won a Silver each in both 100m and 200m in 2018 Asian Games, said, “I don’t know. I am worried that I may not qualify for the Olympics.

“It is very tough to qualify for the Olympics, the qualification mark is 11.15 seconds. You get good competitors in Europe and that pushes up your timing. Here only five athletes are taking part in 100m (in Indian GP). Competition is not much here,” said Dutee, who has a personal best of 11.22 secs.

She is still hoping that the situation caused by the virus improves in the days to come and she gets some quality competitions in Europe.

“I know the situation is bad and I may not get any race in Europe. But I am still hoping. Now I have these Indian GP series and the Federation Cup (in Patiala next month) to try and qualify for Olympics. Let us see.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dutee-worried-about-oly-qualification.html
196,19-3-20,US Open could be postponed,"The US Tennis Association acknowledged on Tuesday that developments in the coronavirus pandemic could dictate moving the US Open, now scheduled to start in August.

But the American federation said it wouldn’t determine any new date for its flagship Grand Slam without consulting the other major championship organizers, the International Tennis Federation and the ATP and WTA tours.

“We recognize that such a decision should not be made unilaterally,” the USTA said in a statement — a scarcely veiled jab at the French Tennis Federation.

In postponing the event originally sheculed for May 24-June 7, the French Federation apparently declined to consult other stakeholders in the sport.

The chosen dates, one week after the current scheduled conclusion of the US Open, caught the ATP and WTA by surprise.

They conflict with the Laver Cup in Boston, where Europe’s top players are scheduled to take on a World team.

Roger Federer has already committed to the event.

197,19-3-20,Italian FA looking at May return for Serie A,"Italian football federation (FIGC) president Gabriele Gravina expressed his hope Wednesday that Serie A would resume on May 2 with a possible finish in July at the latest.

All Italian sport has been suspended until April 3 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic which has killed more than 2,500 in the country.

“I don’t even want to think that we won’t start again, it would be a hiatus, it would worry me for our country,” Gravina told Italian radio.

“We’re working on the hypothesis of starting again on May 2 and completing the championships possibly going into July if we don’t achieve it by June 30. “In the event that it’s impossible to use all the windows as planned, we will resort to a change in the format of the competitions.”

The FIGC president welcomed the postponement of the European Championship until 2021, stating that as far as they were concerned “national championships have priority”.

“We don’t want to penalise anyone, but just as we evaluate format changes in the event of a reduction of the windows to play, so UEFA must do so by remodelling the Champions and Europa League,” added Gravina. The Champions League final is scheduled to take place on June 27 and the Europa League final on June 24.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/italian-fa-looking-at-may-return-for-serie-a.html

200,19-3-20,SRM student develops real-time COVID-19 tracker,"The COVID-19 or Coronavirus has taken the world by storm, giving fear a new name. And a student of SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, Anupam Tiwari has developed an app that provides live information about the virus — CoronApp.

Anupam is an exchange student at the institute, who is studying mechatronics (electrical engineering and computer science) at UC Berkley. He, along with his teammates, came up with this idea. Talking about the app, Anupam said, “With Coronavirus fear at peak, we thought having an app that can provide all information and data about the virus will be helpful.” He created a prototype overnight, which he pitched to his friends, who in turn loved the idea and decided to work on it with him.

The app for mobile browsers, now available, allows users to click on red dots on a world map to get updates on virus cases in that particular location. It integrates COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins University, the Centre for Disease Control and the World Health Organisation (WHO). A Twitter feed provides the latest curated news.

“The process was tiresome,” Anupam said and added, “When we were developing this application, to begin with, there were no other similar applications. There were only websites that provided chunks of information. We spent sleepless nights and massive brainpower on this. We gave ourselves a week because time was sensitive and the process had to be quickened. However, finally, everything was worth it.”

He further explained, “We wanted to create a platform that had all the information one should have about the Coronavirus. From statistics to basic precautions, it also enable one to add some information manually. The app is updated in real-time as it is powered by data provided by the CDC and WHO.”

Asked about how their app is different from the ones that already exist, he responded, “All apps seem to focus only on world data but our application provides people with localised user experience. Using the phone’s location, the Geo-map automatically zooms in on the map, allowing them to see the reports of cases around them. This is the most important information people are currently looking for, and now, they can find it within seconds.”

Anupam’s team consists of Anushka Purohit, Sahil Mehta, Ean Hall, Akonkwa Mubagwa, Manuel Smith, Daniel Smith and Sevith Rao.

The Indian Stroke Association (ISA) has launched the StrokeSOS App, which is aimed at helping stroke patients in an emergency situation. The app will help facilitate patients /caretakers find the nearest listed hospital which specialises in stroke treatment and request them for assistance. The user will be able to navigate the selected hospital with maps directly from the application.

The app, now available, cater to stroke rehabilitation, promotes educating medical professionals and common public to know about stroke-related risks. It will help healthcare providers in providing a customised rehabilitation process. It will bridge the gap between patients and emergency care pan India.

Dr Vinit Suri, president of ISA, senior consultant neurologist and coordinator — Department of Neurology, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi, said, “Stroke is a devastating medical emergency which requires immediate management and attention to restore circulation in the blocked vessels by intravenous thrombolysis (conducted up to 4.5 hours) or mechanical thrombectomy (conducted up to six hours and up to 24 hours in selected patients). Unfortunately, in India, only one to five per cent patients get access to this therapy because of lack of awareness to recognise stroke and towards where and what treatment needs to be administered once a stroke strikes.”

He added, “The application called StrokeSOS helps stroke patients in an emergency situation. It picks up the location of the user, provides information about common symptoms of stroke and nearby hospitals (both government and private) where stroke management can be administered. It provides contact numbers of the hospital and navigates the patients on Google maps with indication of the time taken to reach the medical care centre.”

Stroke is the second leading cause of death globally, with one stroke case occurring every two seconds and claiming lives every six seconds. One in four people across the world develop a stroke in their lifetime.

202,19-3-20,The future is AI,"Eckovation, in association with the E&ICT Academy of IIT Guwahati, has launched a new post-graduate online certification course in artificial intelligence and machine learning for young professionals

There have been fast-paced advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies, which has led to Al applications being used in everyday life. Automated customer support systems, chatbots, and personalised shopping experience with product recommendations are common examples.

And with the technology rising worldwide, India is expected to see 1.5 lakh new job openings in AI, Machine Learning and related fields this year, and see an increase to up to 62 per cent as compared to the last year, says a recent tech report.

The average salary for positions in AI and related roles start at Rs 15 lakh per annum, with senior positions earning more than SOL per annum. However, the people who currently possess relevant skills in AI and who are fit for a job in the field, are quite less, which is why Eckovation in association with E&ICT Academy of llT Guwahati have launched a post-graduate online certification course in Al & ML. the eight-months course will be led by Dr Prithvijit Guha, faculty. The students will have to spend the final two weeks of the course at IIT Guwahati itself.

India has set a target to become a $5 trillion economy by 2025 and as per a report released at lAMAl India Digital Summit, India can achieve the target by using automation technologies such as, AI, natural language processing and machine learning that will drive increased efficiencies and new jobs resulting in economic growth in the next few years.

Kris Gopalakrishnan, co-founder, Axilor Ventures, and former executive vice chairman of Infosys, said emerging technologies such as AI and machine learning would impact the Indian economy like the $177 Billion IT services sector. The veteran added that the use of Al and ML in industries and every aspect of life would significantly increase the use of these technologies. It could form up to 40 per cent of the government’s estimated $1 trillion digital economy in the next 20-30 years.

“If I look back and see the introduction of digital computers in India, the best example is the IT services industry, which has today rose up to $177 billion and around four million people are employed through it. It had a significant impact and Al and ML will have a similar result too,” said Gopalakrishnan, the chairman of India Innovation Summit organised by industry body CII.

In order to meet the massive demand for Al & ML engineers in the market, through the course, the candidates will also have a unique access to the placement services offered by Eckovation, which aims to transform the entire career cycle of students as well as working professionals by offering them a conducive learning ecosystem and distinguished content leveraging on bleeding-edge technologies.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-future-is-ai-2020-03-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-future-is-ai.html
203,19-3-20,"No ‘ideal’ solution for Tokyo Olympics, says IOC","Olympic chiefs acknowledged on Wednesday there was no “ideal” solution to staging the Tokyo Olympics in response to a growing number of athletes expressing concern as the coronavirus pandemic swept the globe.

“This is an exceptional situation which requires exceptional solutions,” an IOC spokesperson said after criticism from top athletes that they would be forced to take health risks should the Games go ahead.

“The IOC is committed to finding a solution with the least negative impact for the athletes, while protecting the integrity of the competition and the athletes’ health,” the spokesperson continued.

“No solution will be ideal in this situation, and this is why we are counting on the responsibility and solidarity of the athletes.”

Olympic pole vault champion Katerina Stefanidi and Britain’s world champion heptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson both voiced concerns at the IOC’s stance.

Stefanidi, one of Greece’s most prominent athletes, was scheduled to hand the ceremonial flame to Japanese officials before the Greek leg of the torch relay was scrapped over COVID-19.

“The IOC wants us to keep risking our health, our family’s health and public health to train every day?” Stefanidi tweeted.

“You are putting us in danger right now, today, not in 4 months.”

‘Zero risk consideration’

On Tuesday, minutes before the IOC statement that it was pressing ahead with its preparations, Euro 2020 was delayed for a year, bowing to the crisis that has paralysed Europe and drastically curtailed international travel.

Olympic qualifying tournaments are among the swathe of sports events that have been cancelled or postponed. Only 57 percent of athletes have booked their places so far.

“It’s unbelievable,” said Stefanidi. “What about team sports that have to train together? What about swimming? What about gymnastics, that they touch the same objects?

“There is zero consideration of the risk they are putting us in right now.""

French swimming federation president Gilles Sezionale expressed his disappointment at the IOC “evoking the possible continuation of the Games”.

“I am devastated by so many inconsistencies when we should today devote ourselves solely to the epidemic to save lives!”

Johnson-Thompson, who won her multi-event world title in Doha in October, criticised the IOC for telling athletes to train “as best they can”, saying it was at odds with stringent government health measures.

“I feel under pressure to train and keep the same routine which is impossible,” she wrote on Twitter.

“It’s difficult (to) approach the season when everything has changed in the lead-up apart from the ultimate deadline,” added the Briton.

‘only fair solution’

France’s 110m hurdler Pascal Martinot-Lagarde, a European champion and world Bronze medallist who finished fourth at the 2016 Rio Olympics, said a postponement was the only fair solution.

“We’re not all in the same boat, there are countries which are less affected than others. In some countries athletes can train normally while we can’t even access our training track,” he said.

“We are not on an equal footing when it comes to preparation. The Games should be postponed until the end of 2020, not next year.”

Germany’s six-time Olympic dressage Gold medallist Isabell Werth meanwhile said not talking about a potential postponement was “an incomprehensible and unjustifiable delaying tactic by the IOC and the Japanese”.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/no----ideal----solution-for-tokyo-olympics--says-ioc.html
204,19-3-20,"Tokyo plans ‘insensitive, irresponsible’","International Olympic Committee member Hayley Wickenheiser said that vows to press ahead with plans for the Tokyo Games are “insensitive and irresponsible.”

Wickenheiser, a member of Canada’s women’s ice hockey team that won four straight Olympic Golds between 2002 and 2016, made her comments on Twitter.

The 41-year-old IOC Athletes Commission member was speaking as the IOC said there was no need for “drastic decisions” over the staging of the July 24-August 8 event.

IOC and Japanese officials have insisted they are working towards staging the Olympics as planned despite the escalating coronavirus pandemic.

“This crisis is bigger than even the Olympics,” said Wickenheiser.

“We don’t know what’s happening in the next 24 hours, let alone the next three months.”

She pointed to the disruption the pandemic had already caused to athletes preparing for the games.

Athletes have been prevented from accessing training facilities because of virus-related lockdowns, while others have seen key competitions and qualifying events cancelled. “From an athlete perspective, I can only imagine and try to empathise with the anxiety and heartbreak athletes are feeling right now,” Wickenheiser said.

“The uncertainty of not knowing where you’re going to train tomorrow as facilities close and qualification events are cancelled all over the world would be terrible if you’ve been training your whole life for this.

“Athletes can’t train, attendees can’t travel plan. Sponsors and marketers can’t market with any degree of sensitivity.

“I think the IOC insisting this will move ahead, with such conviction, is insensitive and irresponsible given the state of humanity.”

In a later tweet, Wickenheiser expanded on her criticism.

“Should the Olympics be cancelled? No one knows at this point and that IS my point,” she wrote.

“To say for certain they will go ahead is an injustice to the athletes training and global population at large. We need to acknowledge the unknown.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/tokyo-plans----insensitive--irresponsible---.html
205,19-3-20,"UEFA to reschedule women’s Euro 2021, Nations League finals","The women’s 2021 European Championship and next year’s Nations League finals will both be rescheduled for a later date after Euro 2020 was postponed by 12 months due to the coronavirus pandemic, UEFA said.

Both tournaments were due to take place in June and July next year, with the latter being held in England, but the move by European football's governing body means neither competition will clash with the rearranged men’s European Championship.

The latter competition, to be played in 12 different cities across the continent with the semi-finals and final in London, will now take place from June 11 to July 11 next year, UEFA said earlier in the day, although those dates are not yet officially confirmed.

The women’s Euro was scheduled to run from July 7 to August 1 next year, with the final also at Wembley.

In addition to those tournaments, the 2021 Under-21 European Championship, due to be staged in Slovenia and Hungary, has also been postponed.

The announcements were made as UEFA said it had agreed on a course of action following a series of crisis meetings on Tuesday involving the European Club Association, the European Leagues body representing nearly a thousand clubs in 29 countries, and also the players’ union FIFPro.

A statement said that “the parties consider it is their duty to take a responsible lead in developing a united European approach in response to the global pandemic”.

Europe has become the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, with France on Tuesday joining Italy and Spain in applying strict lockdown measures and European leaders also planning to ban all non-essential travel into the continent.

The club season has been frozen across Europe, with league campaigns still having around two months to run and the Champions League and Europa League having ground to a halt at the last-16 stage.

UEFA did not reveal a specific way forward for those tournaments but said that they had made “a commitment” to finish all domestic and club competitions by June 30, “should the situation improve and resuming playing be appropriate and prudent enough.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/uefa-to-reschedule-women---s-euro-2021--nations-league-finals.html
206,19-3-20,Bangar not taking up BCB coaching offer,"Former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar has decided against taking the Bangladesh Cricket Board’s offer to become its Test team’s consultant citing his personal and professional commitments.

“They offered me the position eight weeks ago. But in the interim, I finalised finalised my contract with Star which gave me the opportunity to balance out my personal and professional commitments. However, I look forward to working with BCB in the future,” Bangar said.

Former South Africa batsman Neil McKenzie is primarily working with the Bangladesh side for the shorter formats.

Bangar was with the Indian team from 2014 to 2019 and was replaced by Vikram Rathour at the start of the home season in September. The West Indies tour, which took place after the World Cup, was his last assignment with the Indian team. Bangar has been busy commentating on the game ever since he was replaced by Rathour. The 47-year-old played 12 Tests and 15 ODIs for India between 2001 and 2004.

“We have spoken with Bangar (for Test batting consultant) but nothing is finalised yet,” BCB chief executive Nizamuddin Chowdhury told reporters in Dhaka earlier on Wednesday.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bangar-not-taking-up-bcb-coaching-offer.html
207,19-3-20,Hanuma will play County once COVID-19 is under control,"Hanuma Vihari wanted to utilise the summer months playing county cricket in England but the COVID-19 pandemic has put paid to the India all-rounder’s plans for the time being.

Slowly becoming a key member of the Indian Test side, the 26-year-old wants to hone his skills with a prominent county side but now the deal will be inked when the situation comes under control and travel bans are lifted globally.

“I was supposed to play four English county games this season. I would only be able to tell you the name when all the paperwork is complete. Right now, it’s on hold due to the unavoidable situation (COVID-19),” Vihari said.

The Andhra man is confident that he will be able to travel to the UK during the later part of the county season which is played from April to September.

“Hope once it’s under control, I will be able to play those games. It will be a learning experience for me,” said the soft spoken Vihari.

The BCCI, in recent years, has allowed top cricketers who are not playing in the IPL to compete in county cricket during the summer months.

The likes of Cheteshwar Pujara, Ishant Sharma, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ajinkya Rahane are some of the prominent Test specialists who have plied their trade in division 1 and 2 of English county.

Vihari’s commitment to the game can be gauged from the fact that he played for his employers Nelson CC in the Tamil Nadu CA league on Tuesday. He scored 202 not out against Alwarpet CC in a drawn game.

“I work for Nelson and I am committed to play when I am available. It was good match practice. Now I am back in Hyderabad. I will be taking a break for the time being,” he informed.

Talking about his 55 off 70 balls against New Zealand on a green top at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch, the gutsy right-hander was a touch disappointed.

“I wouldn’t call it my best innings. Yes, I was playing well but that innings didn’t get a victory for my team. It was good to score runs in tough conditions but you value it more when the team wins,” he said.

Vihari, who made his debut in England, has a decent Test record of 552 runs in nine games with an average of just under 37. Incidentally, he has eight of his nine Tests abroad.

“I have the self belief and the team believes that I have the technique to get success in overseas conditions,” he said.

So, what has been the key to his four half centuries and a century in countries like England, West Indies, New Zealand?

“Adaptability. I believe I have been able to adapt well in all conditions and I have confidence that I can perform any role that the team assigns me,” he said.

India will be playing nine Test matches (four away against Australia and five at home against England) between November 2020 and February 2021.

“I am sure that I will get a chance to play in home conditions as well. My job is to work hard and be prepared for any situation,” he said. With no cricketing activity right now due to COVID-19, Vihari, like all other sportspersons, is at home but will follow the routine given by Team India’s strength and conditioning coach Nick Webb.

“We all have individual training chart during off time. I will try and follow that,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hanuma-will-play-county-once-covid-19-is-under-control-2020-03-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/hanuma-will-play-county-once-covid-19-is-under-control.html
208,19-3-20,IOA confident of on-time Tokyo Olympics; backs IOC to beat COVID-19 storm,"Skepticism is sweeping through the world but the Indian Olympic Association on Thursday backed the IOC's assertion that the upcoming Tokyo Olympics will weather the COVID-19 pandemic and be held on time without a glitch.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Tokyo Games organisers are adamant that the Games will start on July 24 as scheduled despite the coronavirus pandemic crippling health care systems and destroying economies across the world.

""The coronavirus is creating havoc throughout the world but we are hopeful it will be contained in one or two months. It has already been controlled in China, the epicenter of the disease, and we are expecting the Olympics to be held without any hindrance on its scheduled time,"" a senior IOA office-bearer told PTI.

""But having said that IOC is our parent body, we will have to abide by what the IOC decides. If the IOC says the Olympics will go on we will have to participate irrespective of any threat,"" he said.

The IOC's stance has angered many athletes, who have accused it of putting them at risk. Some officials have also expressed their apprehension.

Responding to the criticism, the world body on Wednesday conceded that there are no easy solutions for the current situation.

The pandemic, which has caused more than 8,000 deaths since being discovered in China, has wreaked havoc on Olympic preparations of athletes, including those from India. Several qualifiers have been suspended and training trips abroad are off the table thanks to COVID-19 travel restrictions.

The IOA admitted that country's preparations have been hit hard but should the Games happen, it is nonetheless expecting an unprecedented double digit medal haul from the athletes.

""Yes, it is true our preparations have been hit with many Olympic qualifiers, Test events and preparatory camps abroad being postponed or cancelled because of the coronavirus,"" the official said.

""But it is not just India, every country is facing the same situation so, the impact is same for every competing nation. So, our expectations still remain the same -- 10 or more medals in Tokyo,"" he asserted.

He said the IOA is closely monitoring the situation with all the stakeholders in the country.

""We are monitoring all our athletes' preparations as well as their well-being. We are also closely working with the Government of India, Tokyo Games orgainsers as well as IOC in this tough time,"" he said.

The number of people infected with the highly contagious novel coronavirus has risen to 169 in India with three deaths reported in the country so far.

The total number of cases reported worldwide so far stand at more than 218,800.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ioa-confident-of-on-time-tokyo-olympics--backs-ioc-to-beat-covid-19-storm-2020-03-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ioa-confident-of-on-time-tokyo-olympics--backs-ioc-to-beat-covid-19-storm.html
209,19-3-20,It is better if Olympics is postponed: Gopichand,"India's chief badminton coach Pullela Gopichand believes the Tokyo Olympics should be postponed given the unprecedented crisis that the world is facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The call to defer the Olympics, scheduled to be held in Tokyo from July 24 to August 9, is growing after most of the major sporting events were either cancelled or postponed due to the deadly outbreak, which has killed over 8000 people and infected more than 2,00,000 globally.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC), however, said on Wednesday it expects the Games to begin on time.

""I have my doubts about the Olympics. It is not like it is far away. The preparation has to start now. So, the IOC has to take a call now for everyone to relax,"" Gopichand told PTI.

""I think, in the present scenario, with the health scares and all the travel restrictions and all, it is a tough time and at the moment the whole world is thinking about health and safety for its citizens, so I think given the situation it is better if the Olympics are postponed,"" he added.

The Badminton World Federation was severely criticised for conducting the All England Championship earlier this month, despite the rapid spread of the deadly disease.

International players, including London Olympics bronze-medallist Saina Nehwal, slammed BWF saying players' safety was compromised for financial gains and Gopichand also didn't mince any words.

""Definitely, I think it was a wrong decision on BWF's part to put the players at risk by hosting the All England,"" said Gopichand, who is currently in self-isolation after returning from Birmingham.

After being condemned by the players, the BWF suspended all tournaments till April 12.

There have been calls to extend the Olympic qualification period, which ends on April 28, following the postponement of a number of Olympic qualifiers.

Gopichand, however, feels there are no easy answers and BWF is in a tough spot.

""What is happening is unprecedented, so I think any decisions will have its merits and demerits. I think whatever is equal and fair for everybody should be done. We can't satisfy everybody and hopefully it is equal for most people,"" said the 2001 All England Champion.

""I think BWF is in a tough spot, any decision will be criticised. When you extend Olympic (qualification) period, you are talking about a lot of things like accreditations, visas, support teams, local associations.

""So it is not easy and there are constraints. Unfortunately it is an unprecedented situation, so we have to follow whatever decision they take.""

The SAI-Gopichand academy in Hyderabad has been shut down till March 31 to contain the virus following the directive of the Telangana state government.

Asked if it will affect the preparations of the Olympic-bound players, Gopichand said, ""The players who had come from All England via various places like Dubai, they have to be quarantined. They don't have any tournaments in April, so till the time it is a two week break from training it is fine. If it extends further then we will have see.

""The players also need some rest, so it is better to stay home and work on fitness.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/it-is-better-if-olympics-is-postponed--gopichand-2020-03-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/it-is-better-if-olympics-is-postponed--gopichand.html

Matuidi used a play on the word ‘positive’ in posts on social media to describe his mood at contracting an illness.

215,19-3-20,Infantino offers to move CWC to accommodate Euro,"FIFA president Gianni Infantino proposed delaying next year’s revamped 24-team Club World Cup in China after UEFA postponed the European Championship until 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic.

South America’s equivalent of the Euros, the Copa America, also scheduled for this June and July, has also been postponed by a year, ensuring European-based players will be free to finish the season with their clubs.

Moving the tournaments by a year puts them on a collision course with FIFA and its president Infantino, who had planned to stage the inaugural edition of his highly lucrative Club World Cup in June and July next year in China.

Infantino said in a statement he would hold a conference call with FIFA officials, during which he will suggest “to decide at a later stage — when there is more clarity on the situation — when to reschedule the new FIFA Club World Cup, later in 2021, in 2022 or in 2023.”

He also said FIFA will plan “to discuss with the Chinese FA and the Chinese Government the postponement of the new FIFA Club World Cup from 2021 in order to minimise any negative impact.”

UEFA said the new proposed dates for the tournament were June 11 to July 11 next year, as Euro 2020 becomes Euro 2021.

This year’s tournament was due to be held in 12 countries. There is no suggestion the format or number of venues will change.

“The world is facing an unprecedented health challenge and clearly a global and collective response is needed,” said Infantino.

“Cooperation, mutual respect and understanding must be the guiding principles for all decision makers to have in mind at this crucial moment in time.

“Particularly in football, finding appropriate and fair solutions at global level is imperative.”

Infantino added FIFA would pledge $10 million (9.1 million euros) to the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/infantino-offers-to-move-cwc-to-accommodate-euro.html
216,19-3-20,Langer felt like punching bag during India’s 2018-19 tour,"Australian coach Justin Langer has revealed that he felt like a “punching bag” after Virat Kohli’s aggressive celebrations during India’s 2018-19 tour while also calling out the “double standards” when it comes to sledging in cricket.

India, led by Kohli, enjoyed an unprecedented summer Down Under, winning the Border Gavaskar Trophy 2-1, their first-ever Test series win on the Australian soil. It was followed by a 2-1 victory in the ODIs, while the T20 series ended in a 1-1 draw.

During the series, Australia, who were determined to patch up their severely dented image in the wake of the ball-tampering scandal, had decided to not engage with the Indian captain verbally during the series.

However, Kohli’s on-field antics angered Langer but he could not be expressive about it.

“I remember that afternoon (feeling) like a punching bag. We can’t fight back because it felt like we had our hands behind our backs and we just had to take it,” Langer said in Amazon’s recently released docu-series titled The Test.

“You must be feeling the double standards the way their captain is carrying on and we sort of have to be careful. Imagine if we behaved two out of ten (of) that,” he said.

Langar asked his players to take on Kohli but warned the hosts not to cross the line between banter and abuse.

“There is a difference between abuse and banter. There is no room for abuse. We don’t need to abuse him but there is banter where you stick up for your mate.”

On day four of the second Test at Perth, Kohli and his Australian counterpart Tim Paine were involved in a verbal spat. That was time Paine thought he had enough.

“I sort of just had enough and thought you also have to stand up for yourself and your teammates and that was one of the reasons I thought, ‘no, I’m the captain, it’s my turn, I have to stand up and show him we’re here for the fight’,” Paine said.

Paine was at the receiving end just after he had gone out to bat. “If he messes it up, it’s 2-0. Who’s gonna talk then?” Kohli was caught saying by the stump microphones.

Paine did not hold himself back and replied “You’ve got to bat first, big head”.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/langer-felt-like-punching-bag-during-india---s-2018-19-tour.html

218,19-3-20,Monkeygate was lowest point of Punter’s captaincy,"Australia’s two-time world Cup-winning former skipper Ricky Ponting considers the 2008 Monkeygate scandal the lowest point of his captaincy stint as he feels he was not in control of what was happened at that time.

The scandal unfolded when senior Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh was charged with racially abusing Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds during the second Test at Sydney.

“Monkeygate was probably the lowest (point in career as captain). Losing the 2005 Ashes series was tough but I was in full control of that. But I wasn’t in full control of what happened during the Monkeygate thing,” Ponting, who led Australia to 48 wins from 77 Tests and 164 triumphs in 228 ODIs, told a Skysports podcast.

Harbhajan was eventually cleared of the charge and Symonds’ career went into a downward spiral after the incident.

“It was a low point and also because it dragged on for so long. I remember coming off the ground during the Adelaide Test match and speaking to Cricket Australia officials about the case because the hearing was at the end of the Adelaide Test match,” Ponting added.

The incident created a lot of bitterness between the two teams with India threatening to pull out of the tour before the ICC intervened.

“We all felt let down by the end result (of the the Monkeygate controversy). The fact that it got in the way of the way we played our cricket for the next Test match was probably the most disappointing thing,” said the Australia batting great.

“So we go over there and India at Perth is game we expect to win and then we lost the match and after that the next few days things just got worse and worse,” he went on to add.

Under Ponting’s captaincy, Australia also suffered Ashes defeats in 2005, 2009 and 2010-11.

“The first two probably hurt more because we were expected to win more, certainly in 2005,” he said.

“Everyone in 2005 expected us to just come over here, whitewash them [England] again and come back with the Ashes. That didn’t happen that way.

“Certainly, for me, the 2005 defeat was the hardest to cope with. But 2010-11, we were just completely outplayed.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/monkeygate-was-lowest-point-of-punter---s-captaincy.html

223,19-3-20,"Over 2L down with corona globally, 151 in India","59,587 beds across country for quarantine; PM to address nation today

The coronavirus cases crossed 2 lakh worldwide and 150 mark in India on Wednesday as scientists and doctors burnt midnight oil to find a cure, which is elusive till now, to the outbreak which has brought the world to a virtual standstill, destroyed the financial market, and posed an unprecedented threat to millions of people around the world.

The Government stepped up its quarantine facilities with a combined capacity of 59,587 beds across the country. The normal life was further disrupted with the Centre and States initiating more precautionary measures, like closure of the Vaishno Devi yatra in Jammu & Kashmir to keep the virus at bay.

Tamil Nadu on Wednesday became the first State in the country asking its residents not to travel to neighbouring States unless necessary as part of measures to control the spread of coronavirus.

Meanwhile the Prime Minister's Office on Wednesday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation on on the situation arising out of coronavirus outbreak and the efforts to combat it Thursday evening at 8 pm.

224,19-3-20,1st case in Army as jawan in Leh tests corona +ve,"Soldier contracted it from his father who returned from Iran recently

In the first positive case of coronavirus in the armed forces, a 34-year-old jawan of the Indian Army in Leh tested positive. The jawan contracted it from his father who returned from Iran recently. The soldier from Ladakh Scouts went on casual leave from February 25 to March 1 and rejoined on March 2.

As a precautionary step, the Army may quarantine all the other soldiers who came into contact with the affected jawan at the Ladakh Scouts Regimental Centre, Leh.

Giving details of the case, sources said here on Wednesday the soldier’s father returned from Iran by Air India flight on February 27 after undertaking a pilgrimage and was quarantined from February 29 at Ladakh Heart Foundation. The soldier was helping his family even during quarantine period and was staying at Chuchot village for some time, they said.

The jawan’s father tested positive for COVID-19 on March 6 and was isolated at the hospital. The soldier was also quarantined on March 7 and tested positive on March 16 and was isolated at the hospital. His sister, wife and two children have also been quarantined at the hospital.

Meanwhile, as precautionary measures to curb spread of coronavirus in the rank and file, the Army has postponed all courses starting from March 23 and cancelled all non-essential training, conferences and movements. However, courses in progress will continue with precautions, sources said.

Some Army officers have expressed concern on training and exercises being carried out in Rajasthan despite COVID-19 being declared a global pandemic. “Soldiers belonging to different parts of the country are camping in open and carrying out training activities near Suratgarh which is a potential threat to the locals,” one officer there stated. A directive on exercises is also expected to be issued shortly.

The Army some days back had issued an advisory to all its personnel to refrain from visiting public places like malls and gatherings for festivals.

The commanders were also directed to regularly hold sessions on educating the troops at all the military stations about the pandemic and precautions to be exercised. The military hospitals also set up separate OPD for treating patients having flu and other such symptoms. The personnel were also directed to avoid non-essential foreign travel.

The Navy earlier postponed its Milan international multilateral naval exercise to be held off Visakhapatnam from March 18 to 28. More than 40 countries were scheduled to take part in the prestigious event held every two years.

Moreover, the Navy directed its personnel deployed on warships now operating in deep seas to avoid port calls and immediately lodge any suspected patient in the quarantine.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/1st-case-in-army--as-jawan-in-leh--tests-corona--ve-2020-03-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/1st-case-in-army--as-jawan-in-leh--tests-corona--ve.html

227,19-3-20,Unshackle 16 rebel MP Cong MLAs to exercise choice: SC,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday said the 16 rebel Madhya Pradesh Congress MLAs cannot be held captive and rejected a proposal by former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan that they may be produced in the court.

The court was hearing cross petitions filed by Chouhan and the Congress on the ongoing political crisis in the State after 22 rebel MLAs of the ruling combine purportedly offered to resign. The hearing will resume on Thursday.

Before winding up the matter for the day, the Bench wanted to know from the Assembly Speaker whether he will decide on the resignations of MLAs if they appeared before him on Thursday and observed, “a latest judgment asks the Speaker to decide quickly. Tell us when will you decide”.

To this, senior advocate AM Singhvi, appearing for the Speaker, said, “I don’t want the Speaker’s discretion to be curtailed. I can inform about it tomorrow morning.”

Senior advocate Maninder Singh, appearing for the 16 rebel MLAs, intervened: “We do not want to appear before the Speaker. It is a question of our safety.”

Earlier, observing that the MLAs may or may not go to the Assembly but they cannot be held captive, a Bench comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta said it was not going to come in the way of the legislature to decide as to who enjoys the trust but has to ensure that there is a free exercise of choice which these 16 MLAs can make.

“It is their choice whether they want to enter, comply with whips, etc. But certainly, when allegation is that they are being held in captivity, we have to see they are at free will. These 16 either proceed to the floor or don’t but surely they can’t be held captive and how do we ensure this,” the Bench asked.

When the counsel for Chouhan and the rebel MLAs asserted that they are in Bengaluru at their own free will, the bench said, “We are not saying they are held captive. Our concern is to ally the apprehension.”

The Bench declined the offer of the rebel Congress MLAs and of Chouhan that either they be allowed to appear in the court or the Registrar General of the Karnataka HC be allowed to meet them to ensure that they are not captive.

“As a constitutional court, we have to discharge our duties,” said the Bench, adding, as of now it knows that the 16 rebel MLAs in Madhya Pradesh tilt the balance one way or the other. The court asked lawyers to assist it on modalities for ensuring free access to the Assembly and choice.

Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Chouhan, offered to produce all 16 rebel MLAs in the judges’ chamber, which the court denied. He also said as an alternative, Registrar General of Karnataka High Court could go and meet the rebel MLAs on Thursday and video record everything.

Rohatgi questioned maintainability of the Congress plea and said how can a political party ask for access to rebel MLAs in their petition? The problem is Congress wants the rebel MLAs to go to Bhopal so that they can be lured and it can do horse trading, he said.

The rebel MLAs told the Bench that they were ready to face consequences as per the Constitution and expressed their unwillingness to meet Congress leaders.

“Speaker cannot sit on our resignations. Can he choose to accept some resignations and not others because political game is going on,” asked the MLAs.

Singh, appearing for rebel MLAs, said their right to resign was constitutional and asked what was the corresponding duty of the Speaker for accepting resignations. Singh said all these MLAs held a Press conference declaring that the decisions they took was based on their own free will and the same has been sworn in their affidavits as well.

“We aren’t abducted and are producing this evidence in a CD to the court. We don’t want to meet the Congress leaders, there is no principle of law to compel us,” the MLAs told the Bench.

Earlier in the day, the Congress sought trust vote in the State Assembly to be deferred till by-polls for the vacant seats are concluded, saying “heavens are not going to fall” if its government led by Kamal Nath is allowed to remain in office till then.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/unshackle-16-rebel-mp-cong-mlas-to-exercise-choice--sc-2020-03-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/unshackle-16-rebel-mp-cong-mlas-to-exercise-choice--sc.html

235,19-3-20,"DAC OK’s 83 desi Tejas for IAF, final call lies with CCS","In a major fillip to Make in India, the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) on Wednesday approved a proposal worth over `38,000 crore for procurement of 83 indigenously designed and manufactured Tejas light combat aircraft (LCA) for the Indian Air Force (IAF). The aircraft are manufactured by the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).

The DAC chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has given the nod for the acquisition, but the final clearance will come from the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The DAC is the apex body for approving the acquisition proposals of the armed forces.

Incidentally, the DAC meeting held on Wednesday was the first one since the separation of duties between Department of Defence (DoD) and Department of Military Affairs (DMA) following the creation of Chief of Defence Staff in January this year.

The HAL which will produce the upgraded version of the fighter jet has already inked a deal for supplying 40 Tejas and the IAF has already inducted one squadron (18-20) jets.

Designed by Aircraft Development Agency (ADA) under the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Tejas will be the backbone of IAF in future.

While orders of 40 Tejas aircraft were earlier with the HAL in initial configurations, the DAC on Wednesday paved the way for procurement of 83 of the more advanced Mk1A version of the aircraft from HAL by finalising the contractual and other issues.

This procurement will be a major boost to ‘Make in India’ as the aircraft is indigenously designed, developed and manufactured with participation of several local vendors apart from the HAL.

The DAC had given initial clearance for the 83 LCA-Mk1A aircraft in November 2016 and the IAF issued the Request For Proposal (RFP) in December 2017. However, negotiations have been stuck due to the steep price quoted by HAL which the IAF had said was more than the price of a Su-30MKI.

The 83 jets are in addition to the 40 LCA already ordered by the IAF in two batches of 20 each in the Initial Operational Clearance (IOC) and Final Operational Clearance (FOC) configurations.

Officials said approval was also accorded for acquisition of indigenous Defence equipment for about Rs 1,300 crore. The proposals were for procurement of Aerial Fuses and Twin-Dome Simulators for Hawk Mk32 aircraft for the Indian Air Force.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dac-ok---s-83-desi-tejas-for-iaf--final-call-lies-with-ccs-2020-03-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/dac-ok---s-83-desi-tejas-for-iaf--final-call-lies-with-ccs.html
236,19-3-20,Trump signs multi-billion coronavirus aid package,"US President Donald Trump has signed into law a sweeping multi-billion emergency aid package to help Americans mitigate the adverse economic impact of the fast-spreading coronavirus that has killed over 8,800 people, including nearly 150 in America.

The bill, called the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, includes provisions offering paid sick leave for impacted workers and free COVID-19 testing.

It also boosts unemployment insurance, food assistance and federal funding for Medicaid as part of an ongoing effort by the US government to combat the rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

""Today, I have signed into law H.R. 6201, the 'Families First Coronavirus Response Act' (the ""Act""). The Act makes emergency supplemental appropriations and other changes to law to help the Nation respond to the coronavirus outbreak,"" Trump said in a statement on Wednesday.

Passed by the House of Representatives 363-40 and Senate by 90-8 votes, the act is designed to bolster the federal government's response to the accelerating novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and address the impacts the virus is having on Americans' health and financial security.

According to the White House, the act ensures that American families and businesses impacted by the virus receive the strong support they need.

This legislation provides strong economic assistance to American businesses, workers, and families, alleviating financial burdens experienced by those affected by the virus, it said.

Noting that the act provides free coronavirus diagnostic testing for the American people, regardless of their economic circumstances or health coverage, the White House said the Trump administration's negotiation efforts were highly effective and resulted in substantial improvements from the initial bill brought by House Democrats.

Building on the administration's longstanding commitment to take every step necessary to provide economic relief and support for Americans affected by the virus, the act establishes tax credits to provide paid sick and family leave for coronavirus-related employment interruptions.

Eligible workers who are sick with the virus, quarantined, taking care of someone affected or caring for a child whose school has closed, will continue to be paid. Employees will receive pay directly from their employers, rather than from a less-efficient government-run programme, the White House said.

Though every dollar of required paid leave will be offset by tax credits for eligible employers, the act protects small businesses by offering an exemption in the rare event that paid leave requirements would jeopardise their business.

The legislation incentivises states to ease access to unemployment benefits, assisting Americans who may be unemployed due to the impact of the virus.

To support families and the most vulnerable, the bill also provides funding and flexibility for emergency nutritional aid for senior citizens, women, children, and low-income families, it said.

The bill offers free coronavirus testing – including free testing through commercial insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, Indian Health Service, and TRI-CARE.

""This is a national emergency, not time for intra-party squabbling among Republicans. It is inexcusable that Congressional Republicans needlessly slow-walked this crucial assistance in the midst of a crisis while they debated amongst themselves,"" said Senator Jack Reed.

In an interview to CNN, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for a Marshall Plan for hospitals and health care system.

""We need a Marshall Plan immediately. And the ventilators, you know, a few weeks ago some of us were talking about the testing problem, and we fell behind. Two weeks from now, the problem of a lack of respirators, a lack of beds, will be just as crucial. We need that,"" he said.

""We need a second thing: we need what we call Employment Insurance. Right now, Unemployment Insurance is hard to get. You get paid only a fraction of what you'd have at work, and many people are not covered,"" he said.

""We want to say anyone who loses his or her job because of this crisis will get paid fully by the federal government— it's Employment Insurance, not Unemployment Insurance, and that will put money in the pockets of the people who need it most,"" Schumer said.

The coronavirus outbreak has killed 8,809 people and infected 218,631 across 157 countries and territories, according to a tracker maintained by Johns Hopkins University.

The United States now has at least 8,736 cases of the coronavirus and 149 deaths, according to state and local health authorities and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

237,19-3-20,Dow falls 6.3% in latest US stocks rout,"Wall Street stocks plunged again Wednesday as the economic toll from the coronavirus mounts and analysts warn of a deep recession.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 6.3 per cent, or more than 1,300 points, to close the day at 19,898.92, its first close below 20,000 since 2017.

The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 5.2 per cent to finish at 2,398.10, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 4.7 per cent to 6,989.84.

The Dow fell as much as 10 percent during the early afternoon, but stocks rallied somewhat near the end of the session as the US Senate passed a USD 100 billion emergency package for free coronavirus testing, sick pay and other benefits related to the crisis.

Economists are slashing their forecasts as more sectors shut down. A note from JPMorgan Chase projected US activity would shrink 14 per cent in the second quarter, while Europe's output would plunge 22 per cent.

""These outcomes are worse than were recorded during the global financial crisis or the European sovereign crisis,"" the note said of the second quarter.

Petroleum-linked shares suffered an especially brutal round as US oil prices plunged 24 percent to USD 20.37 a barrel, its lowest price since 2002 on a demand outlook that worsens by the day.

US automakers were another hard-hit industry, with General Motors losing 17.3 percent and Ford 10.2 percent as the ""Big Three"" shuttered their American production plants because of the virus.

242,19-3-20,Freida Pinto: We were ridiculed for speaking so many languages,"Freida Pinto feels there was a time when the world ridiculed Indians for speaking so many languages and celebrating so many festivals. The actress says the world needs to imbibe the ethos of Indian culture in this ""dark time"".

The actress is excited about her new animated show ""Mira, Royal Detective"", weaved around with the Indian culture and traditions. She feels people will be amazed to look at the myriad colours and diversity of India.

""I think the first thing is that the world is going to be absolutely enthralled by the fact that there are so many languages and festivals that we celebrate,"" Freida told IANS in an interview.

""We, in the past, have been ridiculed for speaking so many languages and celebrating so many festivals. Now, they are going to see the beauty of these and then realise what they are missing on. They will want to celebrate a few of them here in America and I think they rightfully should, similar to celebrating Christmas, Easter or any other festival,"" she added.

The US-based Indian actress, who found fame with the Oscar winning ""Slumdog Millionaire"", continued: ""I hope they celebrate Eid, Holi and Diwali and understand the significance of these festivals. All these festivals are tied to Mother Nature but also in good and evil, the same way all the other religious festivals are tied into. So, I think it will be a great learning and perception building as well.

""Also, as a point of view of how much the Indian culture and tradition is weaved around family, friendship and togetherness. I think the world really needs it right now. We need this at this dark time,"" she added.

Freida has carved out a niche of her own in world cinema through her roles in films like ""Miral"", ""Day Of The Falcon"", ""Immortals"", ""Desert Dancer"" and ""Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes"". Freida was also seen with Christian Bale in Terrence Malick's film ""Knight Of Cups"", which brought to light Hollywood's underbelly. Her work resume also includes projects ""Guerrilla"", ""Yamasong: March of the Hollows"", ""Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle"" and ""Love Sonia"".

The actress feels that lack of awareness of Indian culture led to stereotypes.

""There's this beautiful thing about the Indian culture that it's very welcoming but because of the lack of awareness of the culture over the years, it has been reduced to stereotypes. And this show (‘Mira, Royal Detective') shatters all of these. No one speaks in a particular accent; we all just keep our own, just to make it universally understood. This will make people seen and heard and not make them feel ridiculous while watching a show like this,"" she said.

Set in the fictional land of Jalpur, ""Mira, Royal Detective"" follows the life of Mira, a commoner who is appointed to the role of royal detective by the queen. Freida has voiced the character of Queen Shanti who appoints a kind, empathetic, intelligent and confident little girl named Mira to be the Royal detective to her kingdom.

""Playing Queen Shanti in ‘Mira, Royal Detective' is extremely special because firstly, I never grew up watching a show like this. The fact that the show now gets made with a whole South Asian cast, theme, songs along with clothing, language etc just means that we get to normalise the South Asian and Indian culture. We get other people to watch this and be a part of it as well. It's like we all are invited to this one big party at ‘Mira, Royal Detective',"" she said.

The series features an all-star cast of prominent South Asian actors including Jameela Jamil, Kal Penn, Freida, Hannah Simone, Utkarsh Ambudkar, Aasif Mandvi and Aparna Nancherla amongst others. It will also introduce 16-year-old newcomer Leela Ladnier as the voice of Mira. The show will premiere in the US on March 20 on Disney Channel. It will go on air on Disney Channel India on March 22.

Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Dharmendra Rana issued notices to the Tihar Jail authorities and the police on the plea and said he will hear it on Thursday.

Meanwhile, on Wednesday, another convict, Pawan Gupta moved the Supreme Court with a curative petition against the dismissal of his review plea rejecting his juvenility claim.

The Delhi High Court on Wednesday reserved order on the plea of Mukesh, one of the four death-row convicts, challenging a trial court order dismissing his plea that he was not in the national Capital when the crime took place on December 16, 2012.

Justice Brijesh Sethi reserved the order after hearing arguments of counsels of the convict and the Delhi Government. Earlier, the trial court had dismissed Mukesh’s plea and asked the Bar Council of India to give sensitisation exercise to his counsel.

The convicts — Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay (31) — are scheduled to be hanged on March 20 at 5.30 am.

The death warrant of the four convicts was deferred for the first time on January 17. The court issued death warrants again with execution date as February 1 at 6 am.

On January 31, the court again postponed the execution till further order. On February 17 it issued fresh death warrants for March 3. On March 2, it deferred hanging of the death-row convicts till further order and on March 5 it fixed March 20 as the fresh date of execution of the convicts.

245,19-3-20,Trump urged to address long sufferings of H-1B visa holders,"A nonprofit body, representing high skilled immigrants from India, has urged President Donald Trump to address their long sufferings of H-1B visa holders by accelerating the pace of Green Card or legal permanent residency and remove bureaucratic, legal hurdles from the most-sought after work visa.

The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.

A Green Card allows a non-US citizen to live and work permanently in America.

In a recent memorandum to the President, High Skilled Immigrants For America has requested Trump to address their sufferings by recovery of Green Cards unused in previous years, allow US Citizenship and Immigration Services to receive application for Adjustment of Status and issue Employment Authorisation with approved I-140 immigrant petition and unitary counting of derivatives.

""The assistance in resolving above will provide needed relief to over 500,000 skilled immigrants and their families,"" High Skilled Immigrants of India said in its memorandum to the president.

According to the memorandum, this will significantly benefit the US in many ways. These talented labour force will be able to directly work with the leading American companies, without having to go through middlemen, who make the most money in the current situation, the memorandum said.

""This will enable the American companies to manufacture and develop product and systems right here in the US and not have to send the work offshore due to lack of talent pool,"" High Skilled Immigrants For America said.

""Many of us have entrepreneurial skills, but we are not able start our business due to long wait for the Green Card. Clearing the backlog will unleash our true potential and setting up hundreds of startups, creating innovations and high end jobs, Making America Great Again,"" the memorandum said.

The memorandum opposed the allocation of seven per cent quota per country for the employment based on the Green Card, irrespectively of country's size and demography.

“As we come from the world's second most populous country and are in high demand by the US companies in need of skills in the area of science and technology, we form far larger pool of immigrants, and thus in a long backlog for the Green Card,"" it said.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-urged-to-address-long-sufferings-of-h-1b-visa-holders-2020-03-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/trump-urged-to-address-long-sufferings-of-h-1b-visa-holders.html
246,19-3-20,97 Indian passengers stranded in Singapore due to coronavirus travel restrictions,"Nearly 100 Indian travellers, arriving from the Philippines and Malaysia, are stranded at Singapore's Changi Airport and are unable to get back home due to the travel restrictions imposed by India in response to the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic, the Indian High Commission said here on Thursday.

The Commission said it was working out arrangements to put the 97 stranded Indians on a flight back to India.

Most of these Indian passengers arrived from the Philippines and Malaysia, the Indian High Commission said.

Due to Singapore's own travel restrictions on visitors coming from or through ASEAN region, these passengers cannot enter Singapore, it said.

""We have worked with the Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Civil Aviation to facilitate the return of these Indians back home,"" India's High Commissioner to Singapore Jawed Ashraf told PTI on Thursday.

""We are also working with Air India, Singapore Airlines and Changi Airport to get the stranded passengers flight back to India and lend support during their stay in transit,"" Ashraf said.

Officials at the High Commission are at the Changi Airport assisting the 97 passengers with arrangements for food, freshening up and any other assistance needed in the airport transit area.

Most of the passengers had travelled through Malaysia and faced stringent arrival and departure procedures both in India and Malaysia.

Malaysia has shut its borders, not allowing foreigners in and have also ordered its citizens not to travel.

India has also restricted arrival of passengers from some countries including Malaysia and the Philippines.

The Singapore Airlines has agreed to fly the stranded passengers to India, as there is no scheduled Air India flight for Thursday.

The Delhi administration is in the process of clearing the passengers for entry into India.

India on Monday banned the entry of passengers from Europe, Turkey and the UK from March 18 till March 31 to contain the spread of the deadly virus.

Singapore on Wednesday advised its citizens to defer all foreign travel plans as it reported 47 new coronavirus cases, mostly imported ones, taking the total number of infections in the country to 313.

247,19-3-20,Popular dementia test adapted in seven Indian languages to boost diagnosis,"A fast and inexpensive diagnostic test for dementia has been adapted in seven major Indian languages to help boost the detection of the disorder in the country, scientists announced on Thursday.

A team of Indian and UK researchers adapted the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-III), a well-known screening instrument for dementia detection, for use in Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Urdu, Tamil and Indian English.

""Accounting for cultural differences and linguistic characteristics of different populations is crucial for the development of a common instrument to diagnose dementia,"" said Eneida Mioshi, a professor of dementia care research at University of East Anglia in the UK.

""The development of a common diagnostic tool will facilitate harmonisation of dementia research across diverse populations, and catalyse the development of preventative and treatment strategies for larger cohorts of dementia from diverse demographic and geographic backgrounds,"" Mioshi said.

The study, published in the journal Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology, aimed to standardise and validate ACE-III across seven Indian languages, and to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the test to detect dementia and mild cognitive impairment.

The researchers said a major proportion -- 58 per cent -- of people with dementia reside in low- and middle-income countries, and by 2050 that will increase to 68 per cent.

Standardising diagnostic tools for dementia is important to accurately determine prevalence rates and to establish risk and protective factors for dementia, they noted.

""With the rising burden of dementia globally, there is a need to harmonise dementia research across diverse populations,” said Suvarna Alladi, professor of neurology at National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in Bengaluru.

""The ACE-III is a well-established cognitive screening tool to diagnose dementia, but there have been few efforts to standardise the use of it across cohorts speaking different languages,"" said Alladi, who led the study.

As many as 1,203 study participants from Hyderabad, Delhi, Thruvananthapuram, Bengaluru and Puducherry were examined by an experienced neurologist.

The team, including researchers from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi and Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research in Puducherry, also interviewed a reliable family caregiver for each participant.

They reviewed their demographic and cognitive histories and medical records to determine their eligibility for the study.

The study included controls and participants who were diagnosed with dementia or mild cognitive impairment, but those with moderate or severe dementia were excluded.

In accordance with the original version of ACE-III, the Indian versions look at five different cognitive functions: attention, memory, fluency, language, and visuospatial functions, according to the researchers.

Culturally appropriate modifications were formulated based on the clinical and research expertise of the researchers.

The researchers noted that each of the five domains of the test were evaluated for cultural relevance, translatability, comparable difficulty and adaptability.

For example, in the memory section, participants were asked about Indian politicians and movie actors, they said.

A common administration and scoring guide was developed and psychologists were trained to ensure standardised test assessment in seven Indian languages.

The researchers said ACE-III had previously been adapted and validated into one of the Indian languages -- Gujarati.

The ACE-III tool has been validated in languages including Arabic, English, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Portuguese, Spanish and others.

""The adapted versions of ACE-III show great diagnostic accuracy in identifying dementia and mild cognitive impairment in a linguistically diverse context,"" Miloshi said.

""Not only the ACE-III is a quick and inexpensive method of screening for dementia, it will also allow for harmonisation in future cross-national research studies, propelling Indian dementia research forward,"" the scientist explained.

""This adapted version of ACE-III is necessary and can be used to uniformly diagnose cognitive impairment in people speaking different languages from both rural and urban populations located across India,"" said Professor BN Gangadhar, Director and Vice-Chancellor of NIMHANS.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/popular-dementia-test-adapted-in-seven-indian-languages-to-boost-diagnosis-2020-03-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/popular-dementia-test-adapted-in-seven-indian-languages-to-boost-diagnosis.html

249,19-3-20,About 25 mn jobs could be lost worldwide due to coronavirus: UN,"Nearly 25 million jobs could be lost worldwide due to the coronavirus pandemic, but an internationally coordinated policy response can help lower the impact on global unemployment, according to a UN agency.

In its preliminary assessment report titled ""COVID-19 and world of work: Impacts and responses"", the International Labour Organization (ILO) calls for urgent, large-scale and coordinated measures across three pillars - protecting workers in the workplace, stimulating the economy and employment, and supporting jobs and incomes.

The ILO said these measures include extending social protection, supporting employment retention (i.E short-time work, paid leave, other subsidies), and financial and tax relief, including for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.

It also proposes fiscal and monetary policy measures, and lending and financial support for specific economic sectors.

The economic and labour crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic could increase global unemployment by almost 25 million, the ILO said.

""However, if we see an internationally coordinated policy response, as happened in the global financial crisis of 2008/9, then the impact on global unemployment could be significantly lower,"" it added.

The report provides different scenarios of how unemployment and underemployment will be impacted due to the coronavirus.

Based on different scenarios for the impact of COVID-19 on global GDP growth, the ILO estimates indicate a rise in global unemployment of between 5.3 million (""low"" scenario) and 24.7 million (""high"" scenario) from a base level of 188 million in 2019. By comparison, the 2008-09 global financial crisis increased global unemployment by 22 million.

Underemployment is also expected to increase on a large scale, as the economic consequences of the virus outbreak translate into reductions in working hours and wages.

Self-employment in developing countries, which often serves to cushion the impact of changes, may not do so this time because of restrictions on the movement of people (eg service providers) and goods, it said.

The note said that falls in employment also meant large income losses for workers to the tune of between USD 860 billion and USD 3.4 trillion by the end of 2020. This will translate into falls in consumption of goods and services, in turn affecting the prospects for businesses and economies.

Working poverty is expected to increase significantly too, as ""the strain on incomes resulting from the decline in economic activity will devastate workers close to or below the poverty line,"" the ILO said.

It estimates that between 8.8 and 35 million additional people will be in working poverty worldwide, compared to the original estimate for 2020 (which projected a decline of 14 million worldwide).

Underscoring the need for swift and coordinated policy responses, ILO Director-General Guy Ryder said ""this is no longer only a global health crisis, it is also a major labour market and economic crisis that is having a huge impact on people.""

""In 2008, the world presented a united front to address the consequences of the global financial crisis, and the worst was averted. We need that kind of leadership and resolve now,"" he added.

The ILO note warns that certain groups will be disproportionately affected by the jobs crisis, which could increase inequality.

These include people in less protected and low-paid jobs, particularly youth and older workers and women and migrants too, who are vulnerable due to the lack of social protection and rights, and women tend to be over-represented in low-paid jobs and affected sectors.

""In times of crisis like the current one, we have two key tools that can help mitigate the damage and restore public confidence.
