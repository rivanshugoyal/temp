0,03-4-20,India must seize the day,"Considering the impact of the US-China trade war, the Hong Kong revolt and the Covid-19 spread, it is likely that the US, and the world at large, would reduce trade ties with Beijing

The COVID-19 menace continues to expand globally as the virus has infected 9,38,348 people till now and killed 47,286. And the number is going up by the hour. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has imposed a nationwide lockdown for three weeks in an attempt to slow the spread of the Coronavirus. Everyone, except those related to essential services or facing a medical emergency, has to stay confined to their homes as social distancing is the country’s only hope of getting through this crisis without major damage. Though, as of now, the number of reported Coronavirus infections and casualties remains relatively low in India — around 2,032 confirmed cases and 58 dead — the fear is that, should the virus hit as it has in the United States (US), Europe or Iran, it would lead to a disaster far bigger than anywhere else because of our teeming population and cheek by jowl existence. The Indian economy is large and complex and the pandemic will have direct and indirect consequences over a longer period of time. However, as the American business tycoon Warren Buffett once said, “A great investment opportunity occurs when a marvellous business encounters a one-time huge but solvable problem.”

Governments to the rescue: Right now, the whole world is dealing with losses, both human and economic because of the pandemic. However, we humans have survived in this world despite all the numerous disasters that have visited the planet because we have learnt to adapt ourselves to the environment, no matter how tough it is. In keeping with our indomitable spirit, Governments worldwide have opened up their treasuries and announced financial packages to help businesses and ordinary people tide over these tough times and make up for the financial losses they are experiencing due to lockdowns. While the US approved an over $2 trillion rescue plan for its people, India announced a $22.6 billion (Rs 1.70 lakh crore) package.

China has bigger problems than Covid-19: Before the Coronavirus outbreak shook the world, newspapers were flooded with news related to the US-China trade war. The US imposed three rounds of tariffs on Chinese products last year on over $250 billion worth of goods. While justifying these, US President Donald Trump said that he wanted to “stop the unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China” and protect jobs.

Apart from this, China is also facing anti-Government protests in Hong Kong. The agitations started in June 2019 and the demonstrations, which began as a fight against a Bill that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be extradited to the mainland, have morphed into a call for free elections, which largely do not exist in China. The Bill was withdrawn later but demonstrations continued and protesters demanded full democracy and an inquiry into police atrocities. The rallies have quietened considerably as most residents hunker down at home to avoid being sickened by the Coronavirus. However, smaller protests nevertheless flare up now and then and arrests continue. To Beijing, it is a direct challenge to the leadership, tantamount to losing control of Hong Kong, which it can never tolerate.

An opportunity for India: Right now, the US has more known cases of the Coronavirus than any other country and people in general blame China for the outbreak of this pandemic. Considering the impact of the US-China trade war, the Hong Kong revolt and the Covid-19 spread, it is likely that the US, and the world at large, would reduce trade relations with China. When it comes to choosing the best overseas manufacturers in Asia, two countries, India and China, are at the forefront. Both nations have very dynamic production capabilities and unique economic landscapes with proven skills, strengths and weaknesses, that make them both viable choices. But now, India will surely have an edge over China and must make the most of this opportunity. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s goal through the ‘Make in India’ initiative is to bring basic manufacturing to an economy that needs better-paying jobs. With an increasing share of a young working population, India can achieve its full manufacturing potential as it looks to benefit from its demographic dividend and large workforce.

However, it is imperative to weigh our choices carefully by considering specific external factors that will have an impact on our supply chain. First, let’s review the economic landscape in India and China followed by five key factors that influence manufacturing in these two countries.

Pricing: Purchase cost is usually the most important factor when manufacturing overseas. But so is quality, delivery times and the ease of doing business. India’s manufacturing labour is more competitive when compared to China. In 2014, the average cost of manufacturing labour per hour was $0.92 in India and $3.52 in China. India has a huge number of labourers who are skilled as well as unskilled. The skilled, educated workers like researchers, engineers and IT professionals are able to contribute cost-effective development support to manufacturing operations.

Along with a massive workforce and an emerging supply base, India also has access to natural resources needed in production. Notably, iron ore and aluminum for engineered goods, cotton, silk and jute for textiles and coal for power generation.

Logistics: Newer roads and highways, railways, waterways and airports give China an advantage from a logistics perspective. On the other hand, India relies heavily on a massive network and grids of roads which are not always paved or wide enough to be able to transport products comfortably. But, with the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) E-way bill, the time for delivery of consignments has reduced. The Government is working steadily on investing in the development of railways, highways, ports and airports, which is expected to cut back transportation time and costs by 20 per cent.

Product expertise: China’s major advantage over India is its ability to scale. Beijing has created Special Economic Zones (SEZ) and industrial clusters to encourage manufacturers, suppliers and other relevant parties to be physically close to one another. It provides higher flexibility and the ability to react in case of insufficient quality, non-conforming materials, or other issues. As per McKinsey, Chinese manufacturers are five times more productive than their counterparts in India. However, most Indian manufacturers use high quality machines and tools to produce good quality products. Many Indian industries are well-known for this and are considered trustworthy when it comes to their work ethics and business deals. Unlike China, India does not carry the stigma of poor-quality production.

Language skills: English is the second official language in India and executives have embraced it to conduct business. In contrast to China, India incorporates British customs and legal systems, ensuring a smaller culture gap that needs to be bridged. Therefore, India has a clear edge over China in soft skills.

Manufacturing processes: India’s culture, as compared to China’s, has always been to manufacture at a small scale. In certain instances, to keep costs low, China is relocating production sites to other developing countries and entrepreneurs are replacing manpower with machines. Overall, China is maximising its manufacturing processes, aiming to stay competitive and delivering larger quantities on tight schedules.

India’s manufacturing culture of producing at a smaller scale has at times created a poor image in the eyes of big companies, entrepreneurs and investors. In addition, India favours family and artisanal models which result in buyers facing greater quality risk and production delays.

After China, India is the only country in the world to match the scale of operations and integrate its supply chain for global customers. To effectively harness the emerging opportunities, India needs a carefully-crafted strategy and its meticulous implementation at the grassroots level. Policymakers are far more prepared today than they were during the 2008 economic meltdown. Crude oil is at the lowest it has been in the last few decades, thus reducing overall costs. India has a huge domestic market with a rapidly-increasing middle class and overall population. Investments in the Indian manufacturing sector have been on the rise and post COVID-19 they would increase further. Initiatives like ‘Make in India’ and sector- specific incentives to various manufacturing companies aim to make the country a global production hub.

India is already an attractive destination for foreign investments in the manufacturing sector as several mobile phone, luxury and automobile brands, among others, have set up or are looking to establish their production bases here. This sector has the potential to rank among the top three growth economies and manufacturing destinations of the world. Corporations have a golden opportunity to emerge from the shadow of the services sector and seize more of the global market. Therefore, when we think of scope, this seems to be the best time for India to achieve its dream of becoming a $5 trillion economy. As they say, “Victory comes from finding opportunities in problems.”

1,03-4-20,Let us restart the economy,"The young workforce has to be thrown back into the great rebuild ahead. But the playbook will be revised many times as we go

I was at the serving end of a serpentine queue of humanity, distanced by a metre each, standing under the hot sun with whatever containers they could grab at the last minute, to fill with food. As I stood there trying to help all with a spoonful or two of nourishment, it struck me that these people, who form the invisible algae layer of the economy, will soon wither away with a scarred psyche of a war they couldn’t see or understand. The invisible virus is a mystery in terms of its mutations and manifestations to the best scientific minds in the world. Hence, it leaves little scope of being understood by a lay person. In such a scenario, based on the limited and evolving research on the Coronavirus, it is imperative for each State to decide the best way forward to protect its citizens and save the economy.

India took the bold step of putting its 1.3 billion citizens under lockdown for almost a month. Much has been written and published on the plight of migrant workers walking along railway tracks in hopes of reaching home, some succumbing to fatigue and hunger. But the lockdown is possibly the only solution to save a giant scoop of humans from an epidemic. Criticism and the emergence of a “hard State” have become topics of conversations and on the social media. Somewhere, as it always happens in a war, these messages start being taken seriously and a fertile patch is laid for seeds of discontent against the powers that be.

However, in this new India, the reach of the Government has been amplified tremendously via the digital media. To the Government’s credit, despite a sudden hard lockdown for almost a month, it ensured the supply of essential items like food and medicines for citizens and critical business continuity as far as possible in the current scenario. But the biggest niggling point which remained was the lack of seamless flow of information from the top to the executor wielding a stick and many times a clueless policeman manning a checkpoint.

The country watched the Prime Minister, for the second time in a couple of days, addressing the nation at a time unseen and unheard of in this century. The citizens then rushed out in a collective panic to stock up on whatever they deemed necessary to prepare for an uncertain time ahead. Such was the panic that policemen on the streets had to intervene and the much-talked-about police bandobast and upturning of supply carts got ample publicity. In retrospect, a lockdown of this magnitude could have been planned better, with Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and clear dos and don’ts percolating from the top Government official at the Centre to the lowest clerk in the States, the police force, civil defence personnel and right up to the volunteers on the ground. It could have saved the Government from a lot of criticism for an otherwise, “just in time decision.” The other issue is that almost simultaneously all Central Government departments got into a frenzy of issuing multiple advisories which further multiplied at the State and District Magistrate level. This led to obvious confusion among the law-enforcers and law-abiders, alike. Sure it is also a great sign of participative governance where almost every key decision is available for the common man to see and share. However, it would be best to create a central dashboard or tracker of all crisis-related orders, right to the village panchayat level if need be, in one framework. The world-class digital channels of a giant connected governance created in the last few years will need to be integrated right to the last mile, once this crisis is over.

The next step would be to plan the kickstart of the nearly $3 trillion economy, even as the full ramifications of the dreaded virus play out in the subcontinent. A task force comprising several inter-ministerial departments and senior-most Government officials has been created to rebuild the India of tomorrow. This task force should open multiple channels of communication with the war room officials currently waging a battle against Covid-19 and with industry bodies to chalk out a post-crisis revival plan.

Again, the decision to allow transportation of essential and non-essential items stuck on trucks in highways crisscrossing the country is a positive one. However, the vital question of those vehicles still stuck has to be sorted. The labour force, which was unloading those trucks and was the crucial link in the supply chain, has fled. It will take a huge amount of confidence-building measures, including giving some sops like a free, post-health check-up documented ticket back to the fields, factories and under construction buildings of India. The word documented here means a proper ticket issued in any category with the name and details of the person travelling for work in any mode of transport.

While it may look like a hard State keeping a tab on people’s movement, yet the irony is, one has to somehow track, if any resurgence of the dreaded virus is to be prevented. There could be other better ways to do the same in anonymised formats as well. The crux remains once at the end of 21 days, hopefully the virus has been clustered and isolated, the rest of the country can be eased back to normalcy.

The young workforce has to be thrown back into the great rebuild ahead. But the playbook will be revised many a time as we go about this business of kickstarting the Indian economy.

2,03-4-20,The buck stops with the WHO,"There is an urgent need to reform the global health watchdog to ensure that such an outbreak like the Coronavirus pandemic should not occur in the future due to lack of transparency and strong work ethics

As the Coronavirus pandemic continues to rapidly spread across the globe, countries have also intensified their efforts to protect their people from this deadly virus. Of course, human civilisation has seen several deadly contagions in the past and the Coronavirus outbreak would also not be the last one. But this comprehension does not allow us to overlook some critical facts about the present global health crisis: This is the first time in recent history when a deadly virus could spread to almost all parts of the world. The global economy has never in the past faced such a critical situation due to a pandemic and the international community has never appeared so helpless as it is today, especially when it is equipped with a highly advanced healthcare system.

This, in turn, brings us to a focal question on the outbreak. Was it possible to prevent the global spread of this contagion? It is certainly not easy to answer this question but it is equally true that had China and the World Health Organisation (WHO) acted promptly and honestly, the impact of this virus could have been reduced to a minimum. In this context, it needs to be recalled that while the first case of COVID-19 was identified in Hubei province on November 17, the Chinese Government acknowledged that there were Coronavirus cases in Wuhan only at the end of December 2019. And it was only on January 23 that China finally decided to put Hubei province under lockdown. Not surprisingly, Beijing did not think it prudent to inform the WHO and other countries of the world well in advance about the serious implication of this virus. The whole world came to know about this deadly virus only when China failed in its efforts to hide information about the COVID-19 outbreak.

But, Taiwan, which is one of the leading countries in the health sector and also happens to be China’s neighbour, did not waste a second in informing the WHO about the possible global outbreak of the Coronavirus, as it transmits from human to human. Sadly, the WHO completely ignored Taiwan’s early warning and the movement of people between other countries and China continued at a normal pace. Even after becoming aware of the global risk of the Coronavirus in December 2019, WTO Director General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was busy praising China’s “commitment to transparency.” Eventually, a significant portion of curtail time was already lost before the WHO got its act together and announced on January 24 that COVID-19 can spread from human to human and as late as on March 13 declared the Coronavirus a pandemic. As a result, China’s efforts to suppress information about the Coronavirus and the WHO’s complete failure in its duty have so far resulted in over 9,38,348 confirmed cases and 47,286 deaths worldwide.

Now, while there is a growing understanding among scientists and doctors that the Coronavirus hopped to humans from a bat and they are also trying to identify “patient zero” to reach the bottom of the Coronavirus pandemic, China appears more interested in saving its dubious prestige in the international community than explaining the truth behind the global spread of this virus. Undoubtedly, China’s unscrupulous behaviour has set off an ugly spat between China and the US, with President Trump repeatedly calling the Coronavirus the “Chinese virus.” In retaliation, China launched a propaganda war, saying that the virus was planted by the American army and also expelled US journalists. At the same time, it is also very interesting to note that the US and most of Europe is dependent on China for its medical items, including pharmaceutical ingredients, masks and gloves. In fact, the spread of the Coronavirus could be seen as a golden opportunity for China to make a better trade deal with the US. Whatever may be the possible impact of the COVID-19 on bilateral relations between Beijing and Washington, the fact remains that the global geopolitical and economic milieu shall not remain the same at the end of this crisis. And, certainly, China’s cosmetic efforts to extend a helping hand to other countries in controlling this disease shall not remove the bloodstains from its hand.

On the other hand, sensing the gravity of the situation and realising that no country can effectively battle an outbreak of this magnitude alone, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting with the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) member countries on March 16 and an emergency fund was created with India making an initial contribution of $10 billion.

Soon after, member countries of G-20 held a meeting through video-conferencing, expressing their collective resolve to minimise the social and economic damage of the Coronavirus pandemic. In doing so, they have decided to inject $5 trillion into the global economy.

Another important aspect of this G-20 meeting that has largely remained underemphasised is Modi’s call for the need to strengthen and reform the WHO. The fact that its Director-General supported China’s cover-up efforts is the prime reason for the exponential explosion of COVID-19 across the globe, because countries heavily rely on WHO reports and trust it to warn them of any outbreaks.

The larger question is not just why the WHO failed in its duty but how China succeeded in not letting the world know the actual number of COVID-infected people. And also how it persuaded the WHO to spread pro-China information to the international community. Of course, this is not the first and the last time when WHO has worked at the behest of China, especially when its DG happens to be a pro-China man.

It is a serious indication of how China will continue to undermine global democratic institutions if necessary and corrective measures are not taken by the world community to address this challenge. There is an urgent need to reform the WHO to ensure that such a crisis should not occur in future due to lack of transparency and ethics.

3,03-4-20,Shortage of nurses affects health services of U’khand,"The threat posed by the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has forced the medical health and family welfare department of Uttarakhand to recruit 477 doctors but it appears that the health department is unconcerned on appointment of the nurses. Along with the doctors, pathologists and other health workers, the nursing staff is at forefront in dealing with the menace of COVID-19. At times their works assumes more importance since they are in direct touch with the patients all the times.

The nurses have to work in three shifts of eight hours in a day and due to shortage of staff many a times the nurses have to work in two shifts in a day. In view of the threat posed by the spread of COVID-19, the Uttarakhand Government has recently recruited 477 medical officers to boost its ranks. Interestingly, the health department created more posts of doctors at entry level to accommodate more doctors. However, for recruitment of nurses, no such action is visible.

The medical health and family welfare department has 1117 sanctioned posts of the staff nurses, 363 posts of sisters and 47 posts of matrons in its system. The department has only 1,097 nursing staff against these posts. Interestingly, the sanctioned posts of the nurses are based on the population of year 2011.

The medical colleges of the state are also facing shortage of the nurses and in absence of recruitment the medical college hospitals are banking on makeshift measures like appointing nurses on contract. As per the norms of agencies of like World Health Organisation (WHO), the health department of Uttarakhand should have at least 5,000 posts of nurses.

The Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) hospital, which is the biggest Government hospital of the State has 94 sanctioned posts of staff nurses out of which only 76 are deployed here.

Similarly, 35 sisters are working against sanctioned 40 posts. To add to the woes of the hospital, the health department has attached some nurses and staff nurses to Gandhi Centenary Eye hospital. The medical colleges of the state also need at least 600 nurses but they too are facing shortage of staff.

The president of the Uttarakhand Nurses Association, Meenakshi Jakhmola said that the government should fill the vacant posts of the nurses. She said that at the time when the whole of the world is fighting a battle against Coronavirus, the nurses are playing a key role in the care of the patients and hospital management.

She said that the shortage of nurses is creating problems. Jakhmola added that the state government has done permanent appointment of doctors for the state health services but for nurses temporary appointments are being made.

She added that the nursing staff should be provided with the protective gear and masks for their safety. The joint director (administration), state health services, Dr A S Senger said that the department is inducting nurses from time to time and the applications for the nurses would soon be sought so that there is no shortage of staff.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/shortage-of-nurses-affects-health-services-of-u---khand.html
4,03-4-20,Punjab prohibits all gatherings in State,"Punjab Government has completely banned all gatherings, including religious, in the State. Taking a tough stand on the issue in the light of Nizamuddin incident, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday said that the State Government will impose a total ban on all congregations, irrespective of the religion involved.

For the same, the Chief Minister said that he would personally talk to Akal Takht’s acting Jathedar. He also directed the Chief Secretary Karan Avtra Singh to discuss the matter with the SGPC, in view of the upcoming Baisakhi festival.

At the same time, the Chief Minister ordered 21 days of quarantine for all those who had returned to the state from Nizamuddin (Delhi) since January this year, while asked the police and administrative officials to move aggressively to track, trace and isolate all such people.

Capt Amarinder, discussing and reviewing the current situation through a video conference with the Deputy Commissioners and other senior officials of the civil administration and police department, directed the police and health department to constitute special teams to track and follow up on those who had returned to Punjab from Nizamuddin.

DGP Dinkar Gupta said that some 200 persons from Punjab had visited Nizamuddin and returned here, at different times, with 12 districts believed to be affected. “They are being tracked, along with some from others states, who have arrived in Punjab for Tabligh Jamaat work. The Health Department is debriefing and contact tracing them, though, so far, no Corona confirmed cases has come to light,” he added.

Principal Secretary (Health and Family Welfare) Anurag Aggarwal informed the Chief Minister that the department had, so far, received a list of 125 of these persons, of whom 73 had been tracked and samples collected in 25 cases some of whom had come to Mansa as late as March 19. As a precautionary measure, all of them had been placed in quarantine, he added.

Kapurthala Deputy Commissioner told the Chief Minister that 31 people, who had returned from Nizamuddin, had been quarantined though they had been found to be asymptomatic so far.

In Patiala too, 29 of them had been quarantined but there were no symptoms shown by them. Sangrur SSP said that they had tracked and collected samples of all the attendees whose names they had received, and the incubation period had ended in most cases already.

On DGP Dinkar Gupta’s suggestion, the Chief Minister also ordered quarantining of the Pakistani nationals who were in Amritsar, saying that the State could not afford to take any chances at this critical juncture.

Amritsar Deputy Commissioner said that Pakistan had given permission to allow entry of four of its citizens who had come from Delhi, of whom three had tested positive. The BSF and immigration staff, who handled them, had been quarantined, he said, adding that there were a few more Pakistanis still stuck in Amritsar.

“Some medical students from Jammu and Kashmir are also stranded due to the lockdown even though they have completed their quarantine period,” said Amritsar DC.

The meeting was further informed that the families of Hazuri Ragi Padma Shri Bhai Nirmal Singh, who passed away on Thursday morning, had been quarantined. Those who had come in contact with him at a wedding he attended in Moga have also quarantined though they were found to be asymptomatic.

The Chief Minister, who is personally monitoring the “fast-moving situation” closely, stressed the need to minimize the impact of the unprecedented crisis and asked the top officials to intensify their efforts and hard work even more.

He asked the officials to identify lodgings and suitable places for treating patients, adding that he did not want to be pessimist but it was important to be realistic in the given circumstances.

Capt Amarinder also warned the officials against any complacency in terms of curfew enforcement and law and order, as well as relief measures and management of essential supplies.

The DGP informed the Chief Minister that the law and order situation was in control across the state but suggested continuation of curfew restrictions for some more time.

He disclosed that thikri pheras (volunteers in villagers) were contributing significantly to the enforcement and relief operations. At present, around 2000 such volunteers had been appointed to assist the police and civil administration.

To prevent rush at the banks, they were being asked to give appointments on phone, and to ensure that ATMs have distance markers for queue, said the Chief Secretary. He suggested quarantine for those found travelling between districts too, as a precautionary measure, but made it clear that movement of harvest combines and trucks carrying essentials was allowed.

The Chief Minister inquired about the steps being taken to protect and provide for the migrants who are stranded in Punjab due to the sealing of the borders and other restrictions.

Amritsar Deputy Commissioner informed the meeting that the migrant labourer issue in the district was not significant as most of them had been engaged to work in transport, railways and other departments. Those, who had no jobs, were being fed, he said.

Pathankot Deputy Commissioner said that some 111 migrant labourers from J&K were stuck and had been accommodated in marriage palaces and other places, with strict social distancing norms being maintained. Three had been quarantined as they had fever and cough.

Ludhiana, with 5.25 lakh migrant labourers, had built 60 camps though only two were occupied, said the Deputy Commissioner, adding that food was being supplied there regularly.

Gurdaspur Deputy Commissioner said that while Radha Saomi bhawans were available, the migrant labourers were currently being housed by the owners of the brick kilns where they were working. In Tarn Taran, four centres had been opened to house the migrants.

In the worst affected Mohali (SAS Nagar) district, the Jagatpura area had been totally sealed off after confirmation of COVID outbreak, with mass sampling being done in this and Nayagaon area, said the Civil Surgeon.

Mohali district administration was in the process of securing exclusive rights for use of some beds and about 140 ventilators available in private hospitals, the Chief Minister was informed.

In Kapurthala, two quarantine centres had been set up with a total of 150 beds, and the district administration had taken university hostels to set up isolation ward, informed the Deputy Commissioner.

The Ludhiana Deputy Commissioner said that the administration was in the process of acquiring the wings of some private hospitals for COVID patients. Sampling had been increased in Ludhiana after three positive cases came up in the urban areas.

In response to a concern expressed by the Pathankot Civil Surgeon regarding availability of PPE kits, Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu assured of a stock of 100 kits to be supplied by Friday.

DCS DIRECTED TO TAKE ALL STEPS FOR HASSLE-FREE HARVESTING AND MARKETING OF WHEAT

Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday directed the Deputy Commissioners to take all necessary steps to ensure hassle-free harvesting and marketing of wheat, amid the continuing COVID-19 and curfew restrictions in place in the State.

The Chief Minister asked the Deputy Commissioners to ensure micro level planning to ensure seamless farm operations and maintenance of the supply chain of food at the field level. The Chief Minister said that a detailed advisory had already been issued by the Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department in this regard.

Elaborate arrangements were being made to harvest and procure every single grain of wheat, Capt Amarinder assured the farmers, while directing the Additional Chief Secretary (Development) to further ramp up the machinery for the ensuing harvest and marketing of wheat, and other summer field crops apart from the horticulture produce.

During the meeting, DC Ferozepur requested that BSF personnel be provided the 400 PPE kits they had asked for to undertake physical checks of farmers who had land across the fence and were not currently being allowed to go there.

The DCs have also been instructed to ensure free movement of farm operation machinery including tractors, trolleys, combined harvesters, other harvesting machinery and transport vehicles for carrying the farm produce, tilling and sowing implements etc.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-prohibits-all-gatherings-in-state.html
5,03-4-20,Ensure effective implementation of directions issued by PM & GoI: CM,"Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has directed officials to ensure effective implementation of the directions and guidelines issued by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Government of India. The Chief Minister said this while chairing the meeting of the state task force after attending the video conference of Chief Ministers chaired by the PM regarding novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on Thursday.

The Chief Minister said that the PM had reiterated the need for social distancing, adding that even slight carelessness could dilute the effect of the 21-day lockdown.

While chairing the meet of the State task force, the CM told officials that the people should be made aware as much as possible.

The people should be encouraged to wear masks. The officials concerned should also ensure proper training of all the personnel involved in efforts for treatment and containment of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The general public should be made aware of the recommendations issued by the ministry of AYUSH for strengthening the immune system. The officials should also ensure that there is no crowding of beneficiaries in banks for securing the amount announced under the PM Garib Kalyan package. Rawat also stressed on the need for taking special care of senior citizens living alone in old-age homes. There should be no hindrance in working of firms related to medicines and medical equipment. Plans should be made for utilisation of National Cadet Corps (NCC), National Service Scheme (NSS) and other volunteers as per the requirement.

Further, the strict enforcement of the lockdown should also be ensured. Action must be taken under the Disaster Management Act against those found flouting the government directions, stressed the CM.

The chief secretary Utpal Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary Om Prakash, director general of police Anil Kumar Raturi, secretaries Amit Singh Negi, Radhika Jha, Nitesh Jha and other officials concerned were also present in the meeting.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ensure-effective-implementation-of-directions-issued-by-pm---goi--cm.html
6,03-4-20,Youngest corona case in Chandigarh,"In what would be Chandigarh’s youngest COVID-19 positive case so far, a 10-month old girl has been tested positive for the deadly disease.

The baby girl and her 59-year old grandmother were tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday.The infant is the daughter of NRI couple who had come from Canada on March 13 and was tested positive of Coronavirus on March 30. The Sector 33-A based Non-Resident Indian couple had developed symptoms on March 26 and got admitted to the GMCH-32 on March 28.

The couple was not on the passengers list sent to the Chandigarh Administration by the Centre and also did not follow the 14-day quarantine as per the protocol. As many as 58 persons have been put under quarantine from Sector 33-A till Thursday evening.

“A 59 years old female and 10 months old baby girl (child and her grandmother), living in Chandigarh who are primary family contacts of NRI couple (positive for COVID-19) have also tested positive. All of them are admitted at GMCH-32,” said an official spokesman. The spokesman said that three contacts of a neighbouring family have also been admitted in GMCH-32.

With two more fresh positive cases of COVID-19 in the city, the total number of cases has jumped to 18 in the city. More than 1200 are currently under home quarantine in the city.

7,03-4-20,Jumbo takes a dip in Ganga at Har ki Paidi,"With humans remaining indoors resulting in drastic drop in disturbance caused by their activities, wild animals are now venturing back in areas where they were once thriving before constructions and human activities took over.

One such scene was witnessed during the wee hours on Thursday when a lone elephant was seen venturing in the Har ki Paidi area where the jumbo also bathed in the Ganga.

Between 2 AM to 4 AM on Thursday, an elephant reached Har ki Paidi via the railway line of Bhagat Singh Chowk. Apart from CCTV footage, the policemen present at Har ki Paidi post also filmed the elephant.

The jumbo then took a dip in the Ganga river near Hanuman Ghat.

A local shopkeeper said that while he was asleep he was woken up by the sound of people shouting about the presence of the elephant. From a window, he then saw the pachyderm move from the Ganga, take the steps and then saunter on Subash Ghat and Har ki Paidi. The jumbo spent some time in the city before returning back to the jungle.

Haridwar divisional forest officer Akash Verma said that earlier two herds of elephants had moved towards the city at around 10 PM. These pachyderms were traced by the department.

Later, a lone elephant ventured in the Har ki Paidi area at around 2 AM.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jumbo-takes-a-dip-in-ganga-at-har-ki-paidi.html

9,03-4-20,IIT Roorkee develops low-cost portable ventilator,"The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee has developed a low-cost portable ventilator that can be useful to ensure the survival of COVID-19 patients. Named ‘Prana-Vayu,’ the closed-loop ventilator is developed in collaboration with AIIMS, Rishikesh, and is equipped with state-of-the-art features. The ventilator is based on the controlled operation of the prime mover to deliver the required amount of air to the patient. The automated process controls the pressure and flow rates in the inhalation and exhalation lines.

Besides, the ventilator has feedback that can control tidal volume and breathe per minute. The ventilator will be useful for a wide degree of congestions in the respiratory tract and is applicable for all age group patients, especially the elderly.

The prototype has been tested successfully for normal and patient-specific breathing conditions.

Additionally, it does not require compressed air for functioning and can be especially useful in cases when hospital wards or open areas are converted into ICUs. It is safe and reliable as it is equipped with real-time spirometry and alarms. It can automatically limit high pressure with an alarm system. In case of a failure, the circuit opens to the atmosphere which prevents choking.

Some additional features are remote monitoring by health professionals, touch screen control of all operating parameters, moister, and temperature control for inhaled air. The manufacturing cost per ventilator is estimated to be Rs 25,000.

The research team from IIT Roorkee included professors Akshay Dvivedi and Arup Kumar Das with online support from Dr Debendra Tripathi from AIIMS Rishikesh. They teamed up a week ago by remote communication to develop a quick time technology to help the distressed in the situation of COVID-19.

The research development on the ventilator started during the lockdown period necessitating the development of many parts like microprocessor-controlled non-return valves, solenoid valves, one-way valve, etc. using the facilities of Tinkering Laboratory, IIT Roorkee.

“Prana-Vayu has been designed especially for COVID-19 pandemic. It is low-cost, safe, reliable, and can be quickly manufactured. We have successfully achieved the ventilatory requirement on a test lung, and it can be used for both infants and even overweight adults,” said Dvivedi. “Our commercial product will be of approximate dimensions of 1.5 feet × 1.5 feet for effective portability,” he added.

“Today ‘Prana-Vayu’ was presented to more than 450 industries in a webinar organised by CII. I am happy to share that we have received interest from multiple industries for its mass production. We are committed to augmenting the efforts of the Government in tackling the pandemic.

This low-cost ventilator will be highly useful for COVID-19 patients, especially when there is a shortage of ventilators,” said IIT Roorkee director professor Ajit K Chaturvedi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/iit-roorkee-develops--low-cost-portable-ventilator.html
10,03-4-20,A novel course correction,"With a rapid rise in COVID-19 cases, the Government can ill-afford to either extend the lockdown or do without it. The best course of action is to opt for a gradual lifting of the curfew

Among the vast numbers of pictures starkly reflecting the reality of the utter deprivation and difficulties confronting the migrants trying to reach the safety of their own homes, there was one that truly encapsulates the tragedy. It was aptly captioned as: “Bharat meets India.” There can be no two opinions that at this time of great peril, India once again let down Bharat, the colloquial euphemism for those vast numbers who inhabit the hinterland. While the labourers may be blamed for having panicked, that would be excusable given the limited amount of information made public by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he announced a nationwide lockdown for 21 days on March 24.

It can be debated as to who should be blamed for this avoidable tragedy but what cannot be disputed is the fact that the implementation of the Prime Minister’s directive was poorly organised with little or no cooperation among various Ministries or States. And for this, bureaucrats, who are the final arbitrators of how things should proceed, must take a major share of the blame. The situation was not helped in any way by Union Minister Prakash Javadekar’s asinine tweet about the Government’s decision to screen the Ramayana on public demand. As usual, the police were left to muddle through, which by and large they did at their incompetent best; though examples of exemplary behaviour on the part of some personnel must be appreciated.

While the scale of these heart-rending scenes is only a small fraction of what occurred, they are still reminiscent of the Partition and the refugee crisis. Most of us would be aware that the communal riots prior to the Partition left millions of people dead or homeless, forcing the minority community, from both sides of the newly demarcated borders, to migrate with what little they could salvage. However, what most of us would not be aware of is the fact that former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and MA Jinnah moved quickly to handle this tragedy and established an ad hoc Military Evacuation Organisation (MEO) in September 1947, under Maj Gen Chimni. The body functioned for just three months and did yeoman service. It was responsible for escorting Muslim refugees from India to Pakistan and Hindu refugees from Pakistan to India. Within that period, it escorted 85 lakh refugees, providing them with not just secure passage but also arranging for their transportation, food, campsites and medical support, a far cry from what we witnessed recently. This clearly shows the level to which our political leadership and administrative capabilities have sunk.

Notwithstanding the fact that a nationwide lockdown was inevitable, given our distinct set of challenges, if we were to have any hope of controlling the virus, it still required immense courage and decisiveness on the part of the Prime Minister to have gone ahead with it, at the time he did. Though, instead of just exhortations to follow his directions, it may have been more appropriate to have treated his listeners as adults and laid out the line of thought that was guiding his decision-making and the likely future course of action.

In democracies, citizens abhor autocratic behaviour and generally tend to show displeasure by exhibiting disobedience. That, unfortunately, along with ignorance on the part of some and a complete disregard for social norms by those who should have known better, resulted in the measures being implemented as envisioned.

In this context, the action of religious groups and political leaders organising large gatherings is condemnable. In addition, one has no choice but to cater to the average citizens’ excessive reliance on fate. This has, in turn, rendered us more vulnerable to the onslaught of the virus. The fact is that even without these hiccups, the Government already has an extremely challenging task ahead. Its response to the spread of the virus is based on data. No matter how accurate it may be, it is a minimum of two weeks behind, given the lag between an individual becoming infected, the emergence of the symptom and the diagnosis finally being confirmed.

Having realised that it has not been fully effective in preventing the community spread of the virus, the Government now faces the dilemma of how to proceed ahead even as the time for the lockdown to be lifted approaches. Conventional wisdom suggests the Government can hardly afford to do so as there’s a possibility that cases may spike, Hong Kong and Singapore being recent examples. On the other hand, it also cannot afford to let the lockdown continue indefinitely given the impact such an action would have on the country’s economy. Thus, one reasonable option would be for the Government to lift the lockdown in a graduated manner, district wise. This would require identifying “hotspots,” from where the virus seems to be spreading, and keeping those areas in complete isolation while opening up activity in other areas that appear to be free of the virus. To make this happen, it is essential to scale up our testing apparatus and tracking capabilities, along with following strict isolation norms. The fact is that till now, testing has been poorly handled by the nodal agency responsible, the Indian Council of Medical Research. This needs immediate rectification.

Of course, there are some who believe that for a country which lost approximately six million people to the Spanish flu and three million to the Bengal famine, numbers mean little. We should, therefore, get back to business as usual and hope for the best, much in the manner in which Japan has been acting till recently.

There’s also the speculation that high temperatures may actually impact the spread of the virus. A case in point is Australia, which is in its summer season and where the Government has been able to control the spread of the virus despite a disjointed effort in this direction. This suggests that if we are willing to take some risks, we could go with the gradual lifting of the lockdown, increasing the pace of opening up as ambient temperatures rise.

Whatever decisions he may take, Prime Minister Modi finds himself in an unenviable position of being damned if he does and damned if he does not. There is also no getting away from the fact that our administrative machinery is in a state of disrepair. Gross neglect and misgovernance of the past 70 years have led to the present situation. There’s a need for the present Government to greatly up its game if it is to remain in control of the outcomes.

Finally, it also stands to reason that we cannot get back to our bad old ways. The involuntary improvement in pollution levels that have occurred because of the lockdown must not be frittered away in the name of economic progress. We must give sustainable development more than just lip service. Undoubtedly, in the long term, we will also have to address the weakness in our administrative and police infrastructure to make them more effective, efficient and decentralised.

More importantly, we must look at our primary and secondary education syllabi and introduce changes that will give much more importance to developing social responsibility and character building. Without attention, how can we ever develop responsible citizens in the future?

11,03-4-20,Our own safety net,"As we run against time in our battle to fight the virus, we need to scale up domestic manufacture of medical devices

The Coronavirus spiral was inevitable but now that it is squeezing health infrastructure and medical care staff, we are battling a second front of the disease, when it attacks the preparedness. Doctors and care-givers from around the country have complained, even threatened to go on strike, because they do not have enough personal protective equipment (PPE), namely coveralls, gloves, goggles, masks and so on. There have been reports of frontline staff making use of raincoats and anything else that they can lay their hands on. The lockdown and the migration of labour have meant that even those manufacturing these essential gear are not being able to roll them out at breakneck speed. Though there is no dearth of Indian innovation — like the Pune virologist’s version of the test kits, IITs’ collective efforts to roll out apparatus or even car companies’ offer to make ventilators — the fact of the matter is these are all small-scale efforts. What is needed is a massive rollout, which, because of policy hurdles, delay in placing orders and over-dependence, like the West, on China for crucial components, has been halted badly. Even the contracts being handled by domestic companies are of a small to middling nature, with no capabilities to scale up output. It would be easy enough to attribute the scarcity to a global trend, arguing all countries battling the coronavirus are facing it as well. But we didn’t plan it as well with the Government ordering PPEs just before the lockdown. Safety wear would now need at least three weeks to be readied domestically, considering imports are not that reliable with most infected countries dependent on factory floors in China and Southeast Asia. China has just about emerged after the first wave of the virus and its manufacturing prowess is still not 100 per cent. The Government could also not have exported 90 tonnes of medical equipment and safety gear to Serbia at this time of a national emergency, confirmed by a tweet from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) though denied by the Health Ministry. Leave aside N95, even the triple layer surgical masks are not available for healthcare staff. There is also the issue of facilitating working capital for these units in the time of lockdown. As for chemicals and disinfectants, India has been dependent on China for critical intermediate goods and components. With so much dependence on China, particularly for raw materials, it is difficult to find easy replacements.

As we ride this unprecedented World War III, that literally came from nowhere and hit us before we could realise it, what should be the road looking ahead? Simply prioritise our health sector and go back to home-grown drug and health equipment manufacturing. They were there before but globalisation meant these units were sidelined and lost out on the cost advantage to cheaper imports. And now that the virus may spur the process of de-globalisation as it were, we need to begin with crucial sectors that impact national safety, health and well-being. Immediately after Wuhan, the Government drew up a list of 38 drug raw materials that it wants locally produced to end the country’s dependence on Chinese imports. Some of our key life-saving drugs, including those for cardio-vascular issues, use active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which are solely sourced from China. Indian drugmakers import around 70 per cent of their total bulk drugs from China. Now there is no time for committees, policy or pondering. There is already a Make in India wishlist suggesting ways to make India one of the top five medical devices manufacturing hubs in the world. Most domestic manufacturers have in pre-crisis days shut their idling units and become importers and traders themselves. We have ignored an industry that could have helped us stave off this crisis. What else explains that though there are 1,000 domestic medical devices manufacturers, only 15 have a turnover of above Rs 200 crore and the rest are less than Rs 10 crore. If they are to scale up, then they need an enabling ecosystem, a level-playing field vis-a-vis imports and assured volumes. The last won’t be difficult given India’s huge market for healthcare, projected to be the fourth largest in Asia. Post-Corona, the demand is not expected to dip but rise. This way we can easily end our import dependence by 70-90 per cent. And be self-sufficient in the time of unforeseen crisis.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/our-own-safety-net-2020-04-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/our-own-safety-net.html
12,03-4-20,No Wimbledon,"The cancellation of this summer's edition of the tennis tournament is a big blow for fans and athletes as well

The length of the men’s tennis season at Wimbledon is one that is often debated and there seems to be a general acceptance that it is undoubtedly the longest when compared with other forms of team sports like football. Wimbledon is not just a championship, it is a culture. But in all the eeriness of the Coronavirus, this sporting event, too, has fallen victim like other games and championships. Everybody understands the need to prioritise public health but the regret is more about not getting back to the constancies that have so far defined our lives as we knew it. It was, perhaps, the biggest blow that the oldest Grand Slam tournament, one that has maintained continuity ever since it was first held in 1877 with the exceptions of World War-I and World War-II, suffered when its leaders unanimously announced not a postponement but the rescheduling of the event for June next year. But the cancellation was inevitable. Some may argue that the decision came too early with the game scheduled for May and the UK Government yet to review restrictions but the organisers took the right call by giving certainty to the players than the game itself. Yes, with global sporting events receding on account of the present crisis, the news that there will be no Wimbledon this year will jolt many fans and athletes as well. Millions of spectators will miss the classic final between Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, unending rallies by champions and traditional delicacies like strawberries and cream. Of course, players, for whom rankings depend on their form and performance, stand to lose the most, especially when it is a matter of prowess on the grass court. Eight-time Wimbledon champion Roger Federer took on to Twitter to express his shock and could do so with a one-liner, “devastated.” An equally devastated seven-time Wimbledon singles champion Serena Williams, too, expressed it with a two-liner, “I’m shocked.”

With age not on their sides, it remains unclear if Federer and Serena would still be playing when Wimbledon resumes in 2021. Federer is almost 40 now and with the Wimbledon cancelled this year, he stands to lose an opportunity to add the 20th slam to his well-decorated cap. Serena, 39 right now, remains stuck with 23 Grand Slam singles titles, just one step away from equalling that of Margaret Court’s record. In the midst of all this, the only succour is that the game will still manage to maintain its relevance, prestige and financial clout. Unlike other sporting events, Wimbledon may not face any monetary rout for the early decision and has an extensive insurance policy that would guard it against the global pandemic.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-wimbledon-2020-04-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/no-wimbledon.html
13,03-4-20,Engine stalled,"The Indian automotive industry will take a long time to recover from the pandemic

The sales figures for March are in, and the year-end usually used to see a lot of deals as dealers and manufacturers tried to clear their stocks. This March has been a bloodbath though. With dealerships effectively closed from the middle of the months and footfalls having dried up even earlier, the best that can be said about the sales figures is that they’re not pretty. And where next for the industry? As long as the lockdown continues, and we should be aware that even if the lockdown is not a ‘total’ one, it might be several weeks before ‘business as usual’ resumes, one will wait and have to watch to see how demand reacts.

It is likely that newer models will continue to do well. But after a global crisis, it is human nature to hold onto resources particularly cash so discretionary spends will evaporate for a while. That said, the ‘great Coronavirus migration of 2020’ as we will describe the events of late last week will likely mean that there will be a shortage of auto and taxi drivers in many parts of the country, which might actually drive more people to own personal transportation. Conversely, as the very concept of working has changed, millions of office workers have realised that working from home is a viable option. This will lead not only to an interesting situation for commercial real estate but also for daily commuters. Maybe the types of cars people need and want will change, smaller hatchbacks might do fine as commuter cars.

That said, time and time again whenever there has been a sustained downturn, it has emerged that newer models always tend to do better than older ones. Expect cars like the Creta and possibly even the new Honda City to at least make a slight mark on sales. Older models always tend to do a bit worse but with demand changing, one expects models like the Ertiga and XL6 to continue to do well, or as well as one can do in the circumstances.

But let us be honest, sales will not recover for a while. Indeed it might take several months for the shocks to the supply chain to recover. The migration of workers from factories in the industrial heartlands of the country might not impact the car manufacturers directly, as their line employees tend to be better paid. However, it will impact companies that make ancillaries and components. It is almost certain that even if the lockdown is lifted on April 14, it might take weeks before internal travel restrictions are lifted. And that assumes that demand for products also goes back to normal quickly.

Indeed, it is in the government’s interest, that is the central, state and local governments to get the economy back to normal as quickly as possible. That will involve getting consumer spending going. It is not of much help if interest rates go down, but consumers do not bite. Ergo, I feel that it would be in the government’s interest to reduce excise duties for cars, maybe not by much, but even a five per cent cut would reduce prices at least by Rs 10 to 20,000 for hatchbacks and compact sedans. And consumers will bite if they see a good deal. I know that reducing taxes on products like cars might be anathema to fiscal policy experts, but if coupled with the car companies offering deals, if prices go down Rs 30,000 to 40,000 for cars, at least some consumers will go back into showrooms. Heck, offer a slight reduction on luxury cars as well, if demand picks up in the sector, the revenues earned from increased sales and more jobs will be much more than the revenues lost.

The auto industry does not only keep the stomachs of automotive journalists well-fed, a whole ecosystem that comprises almost a fifth of the entire economy depends on it, from petrol and diesel sales, showroom staff and transporters. It is in the government’s interest to revive it quickly and it does not need to pour money to do that. It needs to forego some potential money but if a rate cut can come with an end date, say the end of December, it could provide a spur that could save 2020 for the automotive industry. Alas, if only government officials and politicians thought like that, but if the economy has to pivot to job preservation, they will have to think in such ways. Till then stay safe, and if you have a car, do remember to start it up once every 10 days to ensure the battery and fuel systems stay running. Also think about releasing the handbrake and using stoppers (or bricks) for your tires.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/engine-stalled-2020-04-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/engine-stalled.html

16,03-4-20,Haryana CM to launch telemedicine services,"Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday announced to roll out telemedicine services besides stressing the need to augment testing facilities during a video conference over the Coronavirus outbreak with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Khattar said in a bid provide to healthcare services to those unable to visit hospitals due to the nationwide lockdown, the state government has decided to begin the telemedicine services with immediate effect.

Under the telemedicine services, patients are treated and diagnosed with the help of the telecommunications technology.

He also stressed the need for rapid testing and suggested that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) should augment the testing facilities to effectively combat the infection.

The CM said the state government has already designated hospitals with an accumulated capacity of 3,000 beds at 14 places for COVID-19 patients. Thirty-three people have tested positive for coronavirus so far with one death in the state.

Khattar also listed listed out the steps taken for the safety of the medical staff involved in the fight against the coronavirus outbreak. Though at present the State Government has adequate personal protection equipment (PPE) kits for them, an order has been placed for around 2.5 lakh such protective gear, he said.

He, however, suggested that the option of importing such kits should also be considered. Khattar also thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the Rs 1.70 lakh relief package announced by the Centre in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, adding that the state has already spent Rs 3,000 crore on providing relief and a provision of additional Rs 1,500 crore has been made for the current month.

The State Government has ensured the continuity in the supply chain of all essential commodities, including medicines, he said, claiming that Haryana has so far been successful in controlling the community transmission of the disease. On the issue of migrant workers, Khattar said relief camps have been set up in the state with basic facilities. At present, around 13,000 migrant workers have taken shelter in these camps, wherein counselling services have also been provided, Khattar claimed. Each of the 13.50 lakh construction workers is being provided a financial assistance of Rs 1,000 per week, the Chief Minister added.

Television has also been provided at a few camps, he said, adding that people in the camps are also being encouraged to practise yoga, meditation and take part in recreational activities. Apart from this, state government employees have contributed over Rs 100 crore for the fight against the virus, he said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday told Chief Ministers through the videoconference that to check the spread of the novel coronavirus, testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine should remain the focus in the next few weeks.

21,03-4-20,Security forces ready to provide backup ahead,"Following police’s overexposure IG (Provisions) Vipul Shukla has issued instruction to cops and officials to wear full sleeve uniform from April 01. Sources said from imposing lockdown to asking people to maintain social distancing be it at medicine shops, veggies market, LPG cylinders distribution points the state police have found itself ‘too open’. Banks are another rubbing salt to cops said sources.

Sources said State police get more vulnerable when it rushes out to disperse gatherings.

Sources said Jharkhand has a large number of companies of CRPF, five of which are in Palamu district deployed at locations like Chak, Dagra, Harihurganj, Kooh Kooh Kalan and Taal. The popular perception among the people here is that CRPF is sitting safely on the back seat, while the state police are taking all the brunt of the virus, public criticism and risk to life.

Sources in state PHQ said, “ The visibility of police are too high and thus what you point out risk too is visible then no sane person can belie it as well but police will do its duty in all circumstances.”

These sources said the state PHQ’s plan is not to involve all brands of forces in this battle but to keep some beyond the line to be drawn into action if there arises any more calamitous situation.

Commandant 134 battalion of CRPF A D Sharma said, “We are not maintaining any safe distance. We are equally involved in our own way.

We with the local civil administration and police are making outreach with food to people in need of it like the one at Harihurganj where hundreds of labourers came from Bihar and UP and there my boys provided them food.”

Sharma said, “We have no earmarked regimental fund for outreach to fight hunger of the poor. We pooled in our own money and are arranging food for the needy. State police have too many funds while we are yet to get it. Our CRPF directorate is seriously mulling over this fund issue and once we get it we will be as on front as others.

Our own prepared masks are for the needy commoners, which our tailors have stitched but as we have no sterilization facility we cannot get it sterilized.”

Sharma said, “We on our own cannot start running unless a requisition comes from the concerned SP to walk down with police.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/security-forces-ready-to-provide-backup-ahead.html

About 1.5 crore Indians are working as slaves in other countries but they run to India to show off their patriotism during calamity; how many of them have donated dollars to India?

These epidemics help the political parties, rich and famous to show off their wealth! People have come back to India not to help their countrymen but to spread the disease, remember that. Vote bank politics will ruin India not coronavirus!

My servant, a vegetable vendor, is going to market twice a day for last ten days without a mask but he is free from any infection!

The bottom-line is leading a healthy lifestyle and avoiding foreign culture and foreign citizenship will help India! Those who have gone out of their own to earn dollars must return with their own money, India Government is not responsible for their safety.

In order to take the body of his elder brother, the local police had given permission for 8 to 10 persons in the bier procession by maintaining social distancing.

42,03-4-20,"City’s good samaritans help needy, poor","In the darkness of the corona crisis, there is a bright light to be found in the acts of kindness shown by ordinary people in Bhubaneswar. Many individuals and groups are distributing food and grocery kits to the needy, feeding the street dogs and the stray cattle. The COVID-19 crisis is bringing out the best and the worst in human beings.

The authorities have chosen to be cruel in order to be kind. Several harsh measures to halt the rapid spread of the virus are being adopted. There are many who think they can defy these restrictions and have at instances been savagely dealt with. In most cases, it is instant flogging of the lockdown breakers. Policemen have been dispatched into temples and mosques to horsewhip those who disobeyed the order to avoid large gatherings. Fortunately, the irrational persons are in the minority. The majorities of the people appreciate the enormity of the problem and are willing, even if grudgingly, to give what it takes for them and their families to stay alive.

In these difficult times, there are some who have taken the onus of providing free disinfecting services to police stations and distributing sanitisers and masks.

Meet Prafulla Swain and his band of Good Samaritans. This resident from Old Town has started disinfecting police stations and police vehicles. According to Prafulla, police stations see the movement of both police personnel and others. They cannot be shut down like other offices as the cops remain on duty overtime. The cops also come in close contact with many while discharging their duties of ensuring a proper lockdown.

Prafulla’s team of half a dozen youths has so far sanitised the police stations of Old Town as well as police vehicles. Their band has been at work with six handheld sprayers, scouring the nooks and crannies of Old Town, educating the locals about proper hygiene, distributing masks and sanitisers and locating families in distress. They arrange rations for those in need, ensuring that nobody goes hungry.

While the rich have opened their coffers and donated liberally for the purpose of tackling the enemy at the door, these ordinary persons with the milk of human kindness are also playing their part, minor or major, in combating the fury of the virus. It is the right spirit at this time; and everyone who can help someone in ways big or small should do so.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/city---s-good-samaritans-help-needy--poor.html

52,03-4-20,‘Frequent hand-wash to lead to huge water wastage',"In the present scenario of Coronavirus pandemic worldwide, it is advised to wash hands frequently with soap and water and also for at least 20 seconds. But when 2.2 billions of people in the world are not getting safe drinking water, has anyone thought of the wastage of water in regular hand-wash by millions and millions?

A proper hand-wash involves lathering soap and scrubbing hands on both sides for at least 20 seconds, according to WHO guidelines to resist the virus from spreading. A 30 to 40 second hand wash would use up around four litres of water if the tap is on, or two litres with the tap closed, while scrubbing with soap.

A family of five members would thus need 100 to 200 litres of water per day only to wash hands 10 times a day than 4-5 times as usual.

""But for the 2.2 billion people in the world who lack safe drinking water — mostly in low- and middle-income countries — that advice will be difficult to heed. A running tap uses 6 litres of water per minute. One gallon contains roughly 3,785 ml, so that's 15,140 drips per gallon, which means our 1-second-dripping faucet wastes over 5 gallons of water per day and just under 2,083 gallons per year,"" said environmentalist Dr Manas Ranjan Senapati, who is presently Dean Science of Biju Patnaik University of Technology and Professor of Chemistry in Trident Academy of Technology, Bhubaneswar.

He cautioned that the earth would be overburdened with waste water because of frequent hand washing which will be another challenge.

The Government and policy makers should take a note of this as a future environmental concern, he added.

Different measures are to be taken like setting up a network of public hand-washing stations – something done in West Africa during the Ebola outbreak of 2014, he opined.a",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---frequent-hand-wash-to-lead-to-huge-water-wastage-.html

58,03-4-20,Lockdown: E-office in JSpur dist comes handy,"The lockdown due to COVID-19 has put restrictions on movement of people except emergency departments. However, the model e-office practice introduced and executed by the district administration has proved to be a boon.

On an average, 40-50 files are approved daily by the District Magistrate without any hindrance, said district Collector Sangram Keshari Mohapatra.

The e-office system in the entire collectorate and district level offices along with subdivision and block/tehsil level offices has been fully functional. As a result, there is no physical movement of files. The staff can process and approve the files with the help of desktop, home computer or mobile phones within no time.

Therefore, the files move from lower levels to the Collectors instantly and get approved, said Mohapatra, who initiated and worked relentlessly to bring the district to the fold of e-office before COVID19 lockdown.

Now, people are getting the benefits, said a beneficiary in the department of Social Security and Empowerment of Persons with Disability.

The e-office system in Jagatsinghpur has helped in no movement of paper files as it was done earlier. So, there is no fear of Corona virus infection, he added.

Apart from these, an official can work anywhere to process and forward the file to the next level upto the level of the Collector who very promptly disposes the file thereby saving time. So the entire process of file submission and final approval takes a few hours on the same day, which looks like a dream come true in Jagatsinghpur district, said Sarada Prasanna Satapathy, a local engineer turned businessman.

The Collector always observes the movement of files and any cause of delay is taken seriously, said Chairperson, Gurukul Foundation, SmitaTripathy. The organisation works for good governance.

Jagatsinghpur model is about to be replicated in other districts and States as other district officials are coming to study the process and programmes of e-governance in the district which is unique in the entire country.

""We toiled hard for past six months or so since I joined in office as District Magistrate in Jagatsinghpur. Mapping was done throughout the district from the office of the clerk to the Collector. Accordingly computer systems and other gadgets of ICT were provided, training labs constituted, several rounds of handholding support and weekly follow up and review conducted. Accordingly entire LAN switching was done with the help of NIC New Delhi and Bhubaneswar with regular touch and at last we became successful,"" said Mohapatra.

This has completely prevented delay, red-tapism, gathering of dusts over files, administrative harassment to common man, corruption and venal practices in the governance. Several social security pensions such as old age and widow pensions along with stipend for divyangs have been hailed all through the district. Therefore, Mohapatra is known as the people’s Collector throughout the district. Recently, he issued stricture with dire consequences and held up salaries of several Government officials for delaying the implementation of e-office following which all fell in line.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lockdown--e-office-in-jspur-dist-comes-handy.html

100,03-4-20,52-year-old Hazaribag man tests corona +ve,"A 52-year-old Hazaribag man, who returned from West Bengal on March 29, has tested positive for coronavirus, health officials said on Thursday.

The man's negligence towards the lockdown and carelessness may have got him infected, they added.

""A man in Hazaribag has tested positive. He has travel history to West Bengal, and was already in quarantine when we tested him,"" said Health Secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni.

Jharkhand's first positive case of COVID-19 – a mysterious virus that has claimed more than 50 lives in India and infected over 20,000 people across the country – was reported from Ranchi earlier this week.

The woman who became Jharkhand's first Coronavirus patient had travel history to Malaysia.

However, the Hazaribag man who tested positive on Thursday has no travel history to foreign countries – an indication that he may have possibly contracted the virus from an Indian carrier in the neighbouring State, a health official said.

According to National Health Mission (NHM), the Government here has collected samples of at least 421 Coronavirus suspects, and the reports 38 of them are awaited. The entry of COVID-19 in Jharkhand has also led to speedy testings, officials said.

The Government of India enforced a nationwide lockdown from March 23 midnight as a preventive measure against the virus. The State Government too has been running rigorous campaigns to maintain the lockdown. However, in such a situation, what urgency made the Hazaribag COVID-19 patient violate the rules of the lockdown is not known.

""It is high time that we start taking the lockdown seriously and realise that moving out can actually be dangerous,"" a health official in the thick of events said, adding that abiding by the rules of the lockdown could have protected the Hazaribag man from getting infected by the lethal virus.

Government has swung into action across the state to prevent the virus from spreading further. A State Minister’s son, who also happens to be an office bearer of the Tablighi Jamaat, was sent to a Government quarantine centre along with seven others on Wednesday in Deoghar district. The Minister too was put in home quarantine along with his family, they added. Their test reports are awaited, district officials said at the time this report was filed.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/52-year-old-hazaribag-man-tests-corona--ve.html

President of Anjuman Islamia, Ibrar Ahmed said that some rumours about poor treatment of people at the isolation centre had gone viral on social media, and some provocative videos were also circulated over WhatsApp. ""The locals said that they were not informed about the inspection beforehand, and therefore, they were not ready for it,"" he said, adding that the Anjuman Islamia members later convinced the locals to cooperate with the inspection team.

Meanwhile, raids were conducted in different localities across Jharkhand on Thursday to apprehend people who visited the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in New Delhi. However, the Government could not share the exact number of Tablighi Jamaat attendees in Jharkhand.

""We are trying to identify people who have connections with Tablighi Jamaat. It is difficult to state exact figures as many people from across the State are under scanner,"" a health official said, requesting anonymity.

Police have by now apprehended nearly 30 foreign nationals from Ranchi alone, sources said. All the foreign nationals apprehended in the past one week attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation – a religious gathering that is said to be the hotspot of Coronavirus in India.

During the harvesting and processing of Rabi crops, scientists have asked farmers to strictly follow social distancing, apply mouth masks and take utmost care in the use of crop harvesting equipment and food utensils.

BAU Crop scientist and Dean Agriculture, Dr MS Yadav said that in view of the Corona crisis, it would be better to use machine-driven equipment in harvesting. “There is a need to disinfect the equipment by using soap-powered water at least three times throughout the day in the use of hand-operated agricultural equipment.

In harvesting, farmers need to pay special attention to social distance. At the time of harvesting and eating food in the fields, a distance of at least 5 meters between two persons should be kept. Keep food and drink utensils separately, wash them thoroughly with soapy water and use them only. At the time of agricultural work, keep sufficient quantity of drinking water and soap water in the fields. At the time of harvesting, the equipment used by one person should not be used by another person. Individuals associated with agricultural work should keep their agricultural equipment separately,” he added.

The Scientist suggested that at the time of harvesting, all farmers and labourers should keep separate water bottles. “Drink water in a few intervals. During the harvesting, he used to wash his hands thoroughly with water. Clothes worn on the first day in agricultural work were not worn on the second day. Wash clothes thoroughly with soap and re-wear clothes after drying them completely in the sun,” he said.

Dr. Yadav has advised farmers to harvest Mustard and Tisi crops without any delay. When the crop is mature, it is asked to harvest other standing crops,he added. Yadav said that in the coming days, with clear sky, there is a hint of an increase of two to three degrees Celsius in day and night temperatures.

“Considering the possibility of the weather being dry and clean, it is advised to complete harvesting of all mature crops and dry harvesting and harvesting the harvested crop in a safe place.

During this time, the farmers have been asked to wash them thoroughly with soapy water, sanitation of crop rosemary and washing with soap and dry drying of burrows,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bau-comes-forward-to-help-farmers-in-crisis.html

107,03-4-20,Mahindra Group refutes PGI's allegations on copyright violation,"A day after the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh accused business conglomerate Mahindra and Mahindra of intellectual theft and breach of patent law while coming out with a low cost ventilator, the Mahindra group termed it as “unfounded allegations”.

A day before, the PGIMER Association of resident doctors’ in an official statement had claimed that Dr Rajeev Chauhan, Assistant Professor, Department Of Anesthesia, PGIMER has been working on designing a low-cost ventilator over the past one year and filed a patent on December 22, 2019 with application no 201911053339 to Indian Patent Authority.

The institute’s ethics committee had already given approval for this device in October last year. Mahindra company had approached the institute in the name of national emergency of COVID 19 (through emails) and patriotism and copied their innovation in a short span of 48 hours, stated the PGIMER Association.

A team led by Dr Rajeev Chauhan had come up with a prototype for an affordable and automatic Ambu bag operating device, which could prove to be the need of the hour as India struggles amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The device was stated to cost less than Rs 15000.

The Ambu bag is a self-inflating device used to provide positive pressure ventilation to patients who are not breathing or not breathing

adequately. Dr Rajeev Chauhan said that the Mahindra group approached them via email due to the national emergency in the wake of Covid-19. The same mechanism has been applied by them, which we had developed to create Ambu bag. Despite having patent filed for our device and proceeding in legal manner over the last one year, Mahindra has claimed that they were able to have the same idea over a mere span of 48 hours, he added.

Refuting the allegations, an official spokesman of Mahindra group said, “There are many differences in the concept claimed to have been developed by Dr Chauhan and the prototype displayed by our team. One major difference is that while in his design, the Ambu bag is pressed vertically from both sides with the help of a motor and lead screw mechanism having both clockwise and anti-clockwise threads with microprocessor based electronic controls, in our case the Ambu bag is pressed horizontally from one side only with a motor and ball screw mechanism and with PLC based electroniccontrols.

All our parts are standard off the shelf ones which are used in the engineering industry, while Dr Chauhan claims to have incorporated 3D printed parts in his concept”.

The Mahindra group is ready and willing for an examination by relevant authorities to establish the independence of our design and technology and to withdraw the product, if it is established that we infringed any intellectual property owned by the claimants, the spokesman added.

Notably, Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra had on March 27 took to Twitter and applauded the engineers from his company who have been involved in making the prototypes of a low-cost ventilator.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mahindra-group-refutes-pgi-s-allegations-on-copyright-violation.html

118,03-4-20,COVID-19 patients to be shifted to exclusive facility,"At a time when the positive COVID-19 cases are surging in the city, the Chandigarh Administration has decided to shift all positive cases to an exclusive COVID dedicated facility at PGIMER, ignoring the advice of medical experts.

An order issued by UT Home Secretary Arun Kumar Gupta on April 1 stated, “The person who is confirmed COVID positive shall be shifted to exclusive COVID dedicated facility i.e. Nehru Hospital Extension Centre, PGIMER. This is issued with the approval of UT Administrator.”

“All three hospitals i.e. PGIMER, GMCH-32 and GMSH-16 will continue to screen the patients, take the samples of suspected patients and keep the sampled patients in their isolation wards till the receipt of results,” the order stated.

The doctors at PGIMER have however expressed concerns over Administration’s decision stating that transfer of COVID positive patients at this stage poses a risk of bringing them out of effective isolation and putting at risk those involved in transportation and their families.

Currently, there are 14 positive COVID-19 patients admitted in GMCH-32 and two in GMSH-16.

So far, the city has recorded 18 positive COVID-19 patients till Thursday evening. Out of 18 patients from the city, one under treatment at PGIMER has recovered and was discharged on Wednesday.

Apart from this, more than 1300 are put under home quarantine in the city.

Dr Uttam Thakur, president, Association of Resident Doctors (ARD), PGIMER, said, “ We believe the measure to convert NHE, PGIMER as COVID hospital will facilitate the further spread of COVID-19, a scenario that we are attempting at all costs to avoid.

It is better that patients be referred from other hospitals in PGIMER only if they require ventilator support and if the same is not available at the other tertiary care facilities.”

“Two able tertiary care government hospitals (GMCH-32 and GMSH-16) are being absolved of their responsibility toward managing patients in this time of crisis, where the contribution of every healthcare worker is of immense importance,” he said.

“Feasibility of vacant or almost ready other hospitals of UT like the one in Sector 48 to convert it as COVID Hospital should be considered.

Entire medical fraternity with nursing staff can be included for rotational postings,” he added.

Earlier also, the medical fraternity had criticized the Administration for giving relaxations in curfew, defeating the entire purpose of social distancing in the city.

Curfew was imposed in the city on March 24 to ensure social distancing and combat the spread of COVID-19. However, curfew relaxation from 11 am to 3 pm was allowed from March 27 onwards by the UT Administration to facilitate the residents to buy essential items in the city.

When contacted, UT Home-cum-Health Secretary Arun Kumar Gupta said that the decision to shift all the positive COVID-19 patients have been taken by the UT Administrator VP Singh Badnore.

14 positive COVID-19 patients admitted in GMCH-32 and two in GMSH-16 will be shifted to PGIMER on Friday, he said.

When asked whether the UT Administration will reconsider its decision after the advice of PGIMER doctors, Gupta said, it will not be reconsidered.

Giving details of COVID-19 positive cases in Chandigarh, he said that the 26-year-old woman doctor who had returned from London and was tested positive of COVID-19 on March 20 has recovered and discharged from PGIMER. She was tested negative for the disease twice and hence, discharged, he said.

Apart from her, three more patients under treatment have been tested negative and second test will be conducted to check their recovery, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/covid-19-patients-to-be-shifted-to-exclusive-facility.html
119,03-4-20,HC stays Kerala Govt’s liquor supply order,"Spirit of tipplers in Kerala got dampened as the Kerala High Court played spoilsport by staying the State Government order of authorising the Excise Department to supply liquor on receipt of prescription by doctors.

Last week saw the Kerala Government led by Pinarayi Vijayan coming to the rescue of tipplers who were in a fix following the downing of shutters of BEVCO (Kerala State Beverages Corporation), the monopoly retail and wholesale liquor traders.

The BEVCO shut down the counters because of the Corona Virus scare and the 21-day national lock down declared by the Prime Minister last Wednesday.

With 40 per cent of the population in the State addicted to alcohol, the tipplers were in for an uncertain future in the backdrop of the shut down.

The serpentine queues in front of the BEVCO counters are the only places in the State where one will see disciplined crowds.

To circumvent the shut down, the Department of Excise came out with a solution; the BEVCO staff would home-deliver three liters of spirit (mainly rum and brandy, the favorite drinks of Kerala’s veteran alcoholics) provided they submit prescriptions from medical doctors stating that the bearer is not in a position to survive without liquor.

The Indian Medical Association (IMA) as well as associations of government doctors expressed their displeasure over the Government move to make liquor available at doorsteps through prescriptions.

“The only option available is to subject the alcoholics to deaddiction treatments and make them come out of the drinking habit. Nowhere in the world liquor is supplied based on medical prescriptions,” said the doctors.

The Pioneer had quoted Dr CV Krishnaswamy, eminent physician of Tamil Nadu who saw nothing wrong in doctors prescribing liquor as a suppressant to persons addicted to alcohol. “Deaddiction treatment is a long drawn out process and till then we have to sustain the life of the alcoholics.

There were reports that seven persons committed suicide in Kerala because of their failure to get the usual quota of spirit,” said Dr Krishnaswamy.

But the Kerala High Court on Thursday stayed the Government order for three months. “It is not the responsibility of the government to make liquor available to the people. Doctors need not issue prescriptions to alcoholics to help them procure liquor from BEVCO outlets,” said a Division Bench consisting of A K Jayasankaran Nambiar and Shaji P Chaly.

But a former chief of Tamil Nadu Police told The Pioneer that there were instances in the past when liquor was made available to alcoholics based on medical prescriptions.

“During the days when prohibition was in place in the State, we used to get liquor and that too original foreign brands from star hotels and clubs with prescriptions issued by doctors. There was nothing illegal in it, ” said the former chief who is known for his uncompromising stance against law breakers.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/hc-stays-kerala-govt---s-liquor-supply-order.html

""We have identified 391 Tablighis in the State who went to Nizamuddin mosque in March. Of them, 91 from Bidar in the state's northern region were tested and 11 of them reported positive and 80 tested negative,"" Yediyurappa told reporters here.Bidar is about 690 km north of Bengaluru in the southern State.

The State health department has kept the remaining Tablighis under home and institutional quarantine across the state for check-up and observation.

""Efforts are on to trace other Tablighis, their primary and secondary contacts, as they might have gone on return from Nizamuddin to other districts for religious activities and stranded due to lockdown,"" said the Chief Minister.

The State Government has also directed the district administration to trace, isolate and quarantine the remaining Tabligbis who are yet to report to the health department for testing.

""About 30 Tablighis identified in Bengaluru tested negative for Covid-19. The remaining have also been tested and their results are awaited,"" Yediyurappa added.

With the 21-day lockdown in force since March 25 to April 14, Chief Minister appealed to all religious leaders to cooperate with the state in creating awareness of the virus fallout within their community and help his government in locating other Tablighis.

Meanwhile, state health commissioner P.K. Pandey told IANS that about 1,000 people across the state were under the scanner to find out if they came in contact with the Tablighis who returned from Nizamuddin or their primary contacts.

""Based on inputs from police and the central government, we have so far screened about 1,000 people across the state who seemed to have links with the Tablighi returnees from Nizamuddin. Six of them were found to be Covid symptomatic,"" said Pandey. The health department also took about 200 swab samples from the 1,000 people for testing.

121,03-4-20,"WB flip-flop on corona: 53 cases, 7 deaths","State Government agencies tended to come out with conflicting assertions on the number of corona infections and resultant deaths in Bengal even as the political opposition called the State’s “tendency to hide facts” as “suicidal.”

While the designated expert committee of doctors on Thursday told in a media briefing that the total number of corona infections in the State had gone up to 53 with 16 new cases reported in the last 24 hours at a subsequent press conference State Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha provided “clarifications” capping the number of active Corona cases to 34.

Earlier at 4 pm the spokesperson of the expert committee of the Health Ministry said: “the total number people tested till date is 763 and the number of cases found positive is, 53 out which 3 have been cured.” He also said that “in the past 24 hours there have been 16 positive cases,” adding “the total number of patients succumbing to the disease is 7 … out of which 4 persons have expired in the past 24 hours.” A total number of three patients have been cured and discharged from the hospitals he said.

However two hours later at a subsequent media conference the Chief Secretary making “some clarifications,” — on the statement issued by the Health Department — said that 4 out of the 7 cases of claimed Corona related deaths “Co-morbidity — like kidney and other ailments — was present and it is not clear whether they died due to the viral attack.” He said that the pathological samples of all the patients had tested positive for Corona notwithstanding the fact that they had come to the hospital for treating other ailments.

The Chief Secretary also said the samples of 9 other patients had reported negative in second test and so they should be taken out of the total number 53 patients given by the Health Department experts.

“Out of the remaining cases three have died of confirmed Corona infection and another three have been released which brings the total number of active cases to 34,” Sinha said reminding “out of the total number of reported cases there are 20 patients from five families.” There was no point in providing inflated numbers “so that there is panic in the society,” he said.

Reacting strongly to the conflicting reports emanating from two agencies of the Government BJP State president Dilip Ghosh on Thursday accused the Government of suppressing facts.

“We have reports that the Government is hiding facts and in a bid to do so the Corona patients are being kept with other patients in general ward which is dangerous,” Ghosh said adding “not only the doctors and the health staff are being given substandard protection gear but also the hospitals are not testing the patients who are going with specific complaints.”

Elsewhere in a related development Bengal Government has decided to promote all the students till standard VIII to the next class considering the gravity of the situation emerging in the wake of Corona outbreak.

State Education Minister Partha Chatterjee said the “Education Department was passing on instruction to the schools (state-run and state-aided) to fully enforce the ''no detention'' policy in all institutions for those studying up to the eighth standard, in view of the present situation.

The Government had earlier ordered the closure of all educational institutions from March 16 till further decisions.

The Minister also said that the Government was considering measures and mechanisms to ensure that the students of Class IX to XIII can be held can get some kind of instruction aided by technology.

“It may be through website, video conferencing or even we can take help of Doordarshan if possible to run the classes,” he said.

Meanwhile, residents of Bhangar in north-eastern fringes of Kolkata attacked and injured the police and health workers even as they went there to advise the people about the efficacy practicing hygiene and staying indoors.

122,03-4-20,Lockdown improves health of Ganga,"The health of Ganga River has seen significant improvement since enforcement of the nationwide lockdown that has led to reduction in dumping of industrial waste into it, experts have said.

India has been placed under a three-week lockdown since March 24 with its 1.3 billion people instructed to stay home in view of the coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed 50 lives so far and infected over 1,965 people in the country.

The Ganga river water was found to be suitable for bathing at most monitoring centres, the Central Pollution Control Board data showed.

According to the real time water monitoring data of the CPCB, out of the 36 monitoring units placed at various points of the Ganga river, the water quality around 27 points was suitable for bathing and propagation of wildlife and fisheries.

The parameters that the monitoring stations monitor online are dissolved oxygen (more than 6 mg/litre), biochemical oxygen demand (less than 2 mg/litre), total coliform levels (5000 per 100 ml) and pH (range between 6.5 and 8.5) to assess the health of the river.

Earlier, other than stretches in Uttarakhand and a couple of places as the river enters Uttar Pradesh, the river water was found to be unfit for bathing the whole way till it drains into the Bay of Bengal in West Bengal.

Experts said the water quality of Ganga river has improved since the enforcement of the lockdown, especially around the industrial clusters.

Environmentalist Manoj Misra said it is a very good time for the CPCB to study the level of pollution coming from the industry.

""The improvement that is visible needs to be validated with proper data. It is very good time for CPCB to study the level of pollution coming from the industry. It is a very good time to set up a baseline,"" he said.

Environmentalist Vikrant Tongad said the improvement has been specially seen in the industrial clusters which used to see huge pollution level due to dumping by industries.

Tongad said the improvement has been seen around Ganga in Kanpur, an industrial town, from where huge industrial waste is generated and thrown into rivers.

""The improvement in the quality of water has also been observed in Ganga''s tributaries like Hindon and Yamuna,"" he said. While the domestic sewerage has not reduced, industrial effluent has nearly finished and that is why the water quality has improved, he said, adding that the water quality is expected to further improve in the coming days till the enforcement of lockdown. Bhim Singh Rawat, environmentalist and Associate Coordinator South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers, People (SANDRP), said improvements have also been seen in Ganga around Mathura.

""The organic pollution level still gets diluted in the river but it is the chemical pollution by industries that destroys river''s self cleansing properties. The self-cleansing properties have improved due to which the water quality has improved,"" he said.

Himanshu Thakkar, environmental activist and water expert, coordinator of South Asia Network of Dams, Rivers & People (SANDRP), said the improvement is a temporary respite.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/lockdown-improves-health-of-ganga.html
123,03-4-20,Navy develops infrared-based temp sensor,"Pitching in for the national effort to fight coronavirus pandemic, the Navy has designed and developed its own handheld temperature sensor costing Rs 1,000. The temperature gun is manufactured through in-house resources of Naval Dockyard, Mumbai. If need, the Navy will ramp up production of these guns.

At present, these sensors, which are a fraction of the cost of temperature guns in the market, are used for screening of large number of personnel at the entry gates of the dockyard reducing the load on the security sentries at the gate.

The 285- year- old Naval Dockyard (ND) of Western Naval Command (WNC) has an average influx of around 20,000 personnel entering its premises every day. In view of COVID-19, initial screening of these personnel entering the dockyard was essential to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within the yard and the Western Fleet. The most preliminary method to screen a probable patient is to check for body temperature by a non-contact means.

Since the outbreak, the non-contact thermometers or temperature guns have become scarce in the market and are being sold at a very high cost. To overcome the scarcity and requirement of large numbers, ND (Mumbai) has designed and developed its own handheld IR based temperature sensor with accuracy of 0.02 deg Celsius. The non-contact thermometer has an Infrared sensor and an LED display integrated with a microcontroller which runs on a 9V battery, navy officials said here on Thursday.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/navy-develops-infrared-based-temp-sensor.html

125,03-4-20,"Book people who violate lockdown, peddle fake news: Centre to States","The Government on Thursday directed States and Union Territories to book people who violate lockdown rules or peddle “fake news” on the coronavirus pandemic under relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Disaster Management Act, 2005.

Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla wrote to all chief secretaries of the states and union territories saying the lockdown measures issued on March 24 clearly mention that “any person violating these containment measures will be liable to be proceeded against as per the provisions of Section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, besides legal action under Section 188 of the IPC”.

According to the laws, anyone who obstructs any government officer or refuses to comply with any direction given by or on behalf of the government shall on conviction be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine, or with both.

And if such obstruction or refusal to comply with directions results in loss of lives or imminent danger thereof, shall on conviction be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years.

Bhalla also asked States and Union Territories to take stringent action to prevent ‘fake news’ on Coronavirus pandemic. Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, envisages one to two year imprisonment and fines for those creating panic and spreading wrong information.

The SC, while hearing to a writ petition, had taken serious note of the panic created by fake news leading to mass movement of migrant labourers and untold suffering to these people. It has been communicated to the States/UTs that the Government of India is creating a web-portal for people to verify facts and unverified news promptly. States/UTs have been requested to create a similar mechanism at their level for issues relating to them,” said Home Ministry in a statement.

126,03-4-20,Naidu puts on hold oath-taking of 37 newly-elected members,"Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu has put on hold the oath-taking of 37 newly-elected members till the lockdown in view of the coronavirus outbreak is over.

Some of the prominent members elected unopposed to the Rajya Sabha and waiting to take oath are -- Deputy Chairman Harivansh, Sharad Pawar, Ramdas Athawale, Premchand Gupta, B Kalita, Deepender Singh Hooda, Thambidurai, GK Vasan, Tiruchy Siva, K Keshava Rao, Dinesh Trivedi and Priyanka Chaturvedi.

Fifty-five vacancies were due to arise in the Rajya Sabha from 17 states between April 3 and 13, against which 37 members have already been elected unopposed.

“The newly-elected members of Rajya Sabha are advised to wait for subscribing oath or affirmation till the lockdown period is over,” an advisory from the Rajya Sabha chairman to the newly-elected members said.

Naidu said in the context of the nationwide travel restrictions on account of the lockdown, the newly-elected members of the Upper House of Parliament were informed that there was no immediate requirement of taking oath.

While seven Rajya Sabha seats are falling vacant from Maharashtra, six are falling vacant from Tamil Nadu, five each from West Bengal and Bihar, four each from Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Odisha, three each from Assam, MP and Rajasthan, two each from Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Haryana and Telangana, and one each from Himachal Pradesh, Manipur and Meghalaya. The newly-elected members of the RS are entitled to all perks from the day of notification of their election, officials said.

A member elected to the Rajya Sabha is entitled to make and subscribe the prescribed oath or affirmation and take his seat in the House only upon the commencement of his term of office under the relevant provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.

However, the Constitution (Article 99) and Rule 5 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Rajya Sabha do not prescribe any time limit within which a newly-elected member has to subscribe the oath or affirmation.

A new member is, however, not entitled to sit, participate and vote in the House or in a committee until he has subscribed the oath or affirmation, according to rules.

“In view of the present lockdown in the country, neither the Rajya Sabha nor any of its Committees is likely to meet till the lockdown period is over,” the advisory said.

It also said that according to the relevant provisions of the Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament Act 1954, a newly-elected member is entitled to all facilities, perks and privileges that are available to the members of Parliament from the date of commencement of his term of office, which is the date of notification of his election to the Rajya Sabha by the Ministry of Law and Justice.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/naidu-puts-on-hold-oath-taking-of-37-newly-elected-members.html
127,03-4-20,"PM CARES will accept donations from individuals, organisations based in foreign countries","The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) on Thursday clarified that the apprehensions raised by certain quarters and some political parties about the Covid-19-specific relief fund – PM-CARES Fund – was totally wrong and foreign contributions were allowed to facilitate the contributions from individuals, NRIs, persons of Indian origin and organisations based abroad.

The Fund is formed as a Trust for specific purpose to deal the Corona crisis and separate from the usual PM’s Relief Fund, which is general purpose in nature, PMO officials said adding that Government is not accepting aide from foreign Governments.

“There has been a lot of misinformation on the news of PM CARES fund accepting foreign donations. What has been announced is that PM CARES fund will simply accept donations and contributions from individuals and organisations who are based in foreign countries. This is consistent with India’s policy with respect to PMNRF. PMNRF has also received foreign contributions as a public trust since 2011,” they said.

The officials said that it was wrong to compare the objection of certain Opposition States’ demand to receive aides from foreign Governments during 2018 natural calamities. As a policy for the past decade, Government is not accepting any foreign Government aides. There was a protest after it was said the Kerala Government was banned from accepting UAE’s aide during the worst floods in 2018. Later, it was found that there was no offer from UAE. The PM-CARES Fund has been created as a special trust to deal the Corona crisis and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the Chairman of the trust with Home, Finance and Defence Ministers as members. In line with the existing policy, the Government is committed to meeting the requirements for relief and rehabilitation through domestic efforts. Contributions to the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund and the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund from NRIs, PIOs and international entities such as foundations would, however, be welcome, they added. While declaring the formation of the Fund, Modi said that many persons are interested in offering contributions to Government in its fight with Covid19 crisis.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pm-cares-will-accept-donations-from-individuals--organisations-based-in-foreign-countries.html
128,03-4-20,WHO praises Modi for his social welfare measures,"World Health Organisation (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Thursday praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for announcing $24 billion relief package envisaging provision for food rations, cash transfers and free cooking gas amid the lockdown imposed to contain the coronavirus.

Taking to twitter to express his appreciation, he noted that steps like lockdown can lead to dire consequences for the poor and vulnerable section of the society. It is, however, important that they are assured food and shelter. “Countries are asking people to #stayhome and shutting down population movement to limit #COVID19 transmission. These steps can have unintended consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable,” Ghebreyesus twitted.

“My appreciation to Prime Minister @narendramodi for announcing a $24 billion package to support Flag of India’s vulnerable populations during #COVID19 crisis, including free food rations for 800 million disadvantaged people, cash transfers to 204 million poor women, free cooking gas for 80 million households,” Ghebreyesus added in another tweet.

He further said that many developing countries may struggle to implement social welfare programs upto this scale.

The WHO chief said that countries are asking people to stay homes and shutting down population movement to limit COVID19 transmission. These steps can have unintended consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable. I call on countries to ensure these populations have food and life essentials during the crisis, he added.

“Broad and expedited agreement on debt relief is essential to enable them to care for their people and avoid economic collapse. #Solidarity,” he tweeted.

The Modi Government last week announced $24 billion fiscal stimulus package to help the poor tackle the financial difficulties arising from the 21-day lockdown. Under the relief package under PM Gareeb Kalyan Scheme , direct cash transfers (under the DBT or Direct Benefit Transfer scheme) and food security-related steps are being doled out aiming giving relief to the poor workers.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/who-praises-modi-for-his-social-welfare-measures.html
129,03-4-20,Absence of caregivers troubles divyangs,"Persons with disabilities (PwDs) across the States are having tough times in managing day-to-day affairs in the absence of caregivers as well as essential supplies and medical aid because of the lockdown imposed to curb spread of the coronavirus.

This, despite clear guidelines from the Centre to the States issued late last month that they should ensure that the sector has smooth access to essential support services, including caregiver support, supplies and medical aid at their doorstep, pointed out Arman Ali, Executive Director, National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP).

He said, “Our helpline 73039 44839 set up to provide guidance to the PwDs has been keep on buzzing with requests and complaints since its launch on March 29.”

For instance, many people with Thalassemia have complained of facing difficulty in blood transfusion as limited blood is available in hospitals. Many private hospitals have ceased to deliver their services. For persons who do not have private transportation, arranging transportation for basic health services is a major task.

“We got a call from a PwD from Nagpur in Maharashtra, that he has not been able to take his pregnant wife to the hospital as there is no transportation available due to the lockdown, while, the State Government is yet to ensure ration for PwDs on urgent basis.”

Ali explained that it becomes difficult for PwDs who have mobility issues to step out for buying essentials. Also, the extra pension of Rs 1,000 announced by Finance Minister Sitharaman in her economic package is yet to reach to the intended beneficiaries, he said.

Moreover, in view of the rising prices of essential commodities, this amount is far from sufficient. Just recently, Shakunthla Gamlin, Union Secretary(DPwDs), following complaints from the sector, asked the States to ensure easy accessibility of the caregivers to the PwDs by issuing them e-passes on priority basis.

“One key reason for the gap is that Disability Commissioners have been designated as nodal officers under the central guidelines, but in many States Disability Commissioners have either not been appointed, are hard to reach, or are unresponsive,” said Ali.

However, some States have started taking disabled-friendly steps, though more are needed. Karnataka and Assam have developed videos and circulated information on Covid19 while Uttarakhand has facilitated easy movement of caregivers, as well as any assistance required by PwDS in terms of food, medicines or counselling. States like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu too have set up separate helpline numbers.

On their part, Jharkhand and Delhi Governments have issued special e-passes specific for PwDs while for people with hearing impairment, states such as Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Karnataka have enacted video conferencing facilities with sign language interpreters.

To ensure that daily wagers with disabilities should not suffer due to the lockdown, Family of Disabled (FoD), an NGO has launched fund raising initiative.

“These are the people, who despite of their disabilities were making both the ends meet and were leading a respectable life. We hope these unfortunate circumstances won’t last long and contribution from good Samaritans will help in re-establishing them in their respective trades,” Preeti from the FoD said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/absence-of-caregivers-troubles-divyangs.html

Since March 24, a total of 257 complaints related to various offences against women were received, out of which 69 were of domestic violence, she said. State-wise analysis of the data showed that the maximum number of complaints were received from Uttar Pradesh (90), followed by Delhi (37).

Thirty domestic violence complaints were received between March 2 and March 8, while 58 such complaints were received between March 23 and 30, according to the data.

Complaints of other crimes like rape or attempt to rape and dowry harassment saw a slight reduction in the mentioned period, the NCW data showed.

Sharma said the number of domestic violence cases must be much higher but the women are scared to complain due to constant presence of their abuser at home.

She said from March 24 till April 1, the NCW has received 69 domestic violence complaints and it is increasing by the day.

""Women are not approaching the police because they think that if they take her husband away, the in-laws will torture her. Because of the lockdown, women are not able to reach out to the police. They don't even want to go to the police because they are afraid that once their husband comes out of the police station, he will again torture her and she can't even move out,"" she said.

""Earlier women could go to their parents' place but now they are unable to reach. The NCW is in touch with these complainants,"" she added. Women rights activists said they have also received numerous complaints of domestic violence from women since the enforcement of the lockdown. Activist Kavita Krishnan, also the secretary of All India Progressive Women's Association, said vulnerable women could have moved to safer places if the government had given some warning of the lockdown.

131,03-4-20,5 Tablighis who attended Delhi meet test positive: Haryana Govt,"In what is likely to set alarm bells ringing for the health authorities, the Haryana Government on Thursday said five people who came to the State after attending the Tablighi Jamaat's congregation in New Delhi' last month have tested positive for coronavirus.

Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij said two of the infected patients were traced to Ambala while three in Palwal tested positive for coronavirus.

Later in the day, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar told Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a videoconferencing that the count of those who attended the Tablighi Jamaat's congregation and came to Haryana afterwards has shot up to 1,277.

He said the number also included 107 foreigners and the jamaat returnees were traced to five districts in the state.

About the foreigners, Khattar said their passports have been confiscated and FIRs registered for various violations, a state government statement said.

He said samples of all 107 foreigners have been sent for testing and reports were awaited.

Vij said these foreigners were from Bangladesh, Malaysia, South Africa, Nepal and Sri Lanka.

He said a majority were on tourist visas. All had concealed information regarding their travel details within the country and action as per law is being contemplated against them, he said.

Asked if the foreigners will be deported, Vij, who is also Haryana's Home Minister, replied, ""We cannot do so till they test negative.""

All those who had been traced to the state so far are from outside Haryana, he said.

""We do not exactly know who all they have met. There is a possibility that some of them may have infected others who in turn unknowingly may be carriers,"" he said.

Asked how many of these could have entered the state after the lockdown, Vij said, ""This information is being gathered. In every district, they have an in-charge and we are trying to gather more details.""

Health teams are at their job after the Haryana Police traced the congregation attendees in several districts such as Ambala, Palwal, Gurgaon and Faridabad.

All 107 foreigners had been kept in isolation while samples of several others suspected cases have so far been sent for testing and all are being quarantined, Vij said. PTI

When asked about the purpose of this group entering Haryana, Vij said after attending the congregation, they are assigned duties and sent to different places across India to preach.

""They stay in mosques, go to people's homes and hold meetings,"" the minister said.

The Tabligh-e-Jamaat's markaz (headquarters) in Nizamuddin West has emerged as a hotspot of coronavirus, following which a major area has been sealed and an FIR lodged against its cleric for violating government orders.

The Telangana government had said on Monday that six people who attended the religious congregation between March 13 and 15 died due to coronavirus.

Subsequently, authorities across the country swung into action to trace the contacts of those who went to the gathering, attended by hundreds of people, including from Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia.

A two-day mega religious programme was planned in Vasai, on outskirts of Mumbai, but the home department denied permission for it after initially giving the go-ahead.

An official statement, quoting Home Minister Deshmukh, said an outfit, Shamim Education and Welfare Society, had formally sought permission from the department for organising a programme, Tablighi Ijtema, near Diwanman village in West Vasai on March 14-15.

The society, while seeking permission, had conveyed to the department that around 50,000 devotees would attend the event in which the Quran was to be recited besides offering of namaz.

The police, in a letter dated February 5, had informed the society about granting permission for the event.

In the meantime, Deshmukh said COVID 19 cases were being reported in the country and the state, and several people were quarantined, while suspects were being treated.

The department reconsidered granting permission to the Vasai event amid such a situation given that coming together of 50,000 people would have been detrimental to controlling the spread, the release said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nizamuddin-like-event-near-mumbai-was-averted--maha-govt.html

Addressing party leaders at the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meet, which was held via video conferencing, Congress president Sonia Gandhi said the unplanned lockdown has resulted in harassment of lakhs of migrants across the country.

“The 21-day lockdown was necessary but implemented in an unplanned manner. This unplanned lockdown has caused harassment to lakhs of migrant workers,” Sonia said.

Sonia also called on the Modi Government to provide personal protection equipment (PPE) to doctors, nurses and medical staff. The Government must publish details of designated hospitals, number of beds, quarantine and testing facilities and medical supplies, she said.

The Congress also stressed on the need to support the agriculture sector which is suffering due to the lockdown. Ease restrictions on farmers for harvesting. Farmers must be provided fertilzers and pesticides and access to easy lines of credit, the Congress interim chief said.

Sonia also urged the Centre to prepare and publish a Common Minimum Relief Programme for the middle class.

During the CWC meet, Sonia called upon the Congress governments, frontal organisations, leaders and workers to offer help to those who are at extreme risk. She urged the Congress chief ministers to call for better coordination and funds from the Centre, including early distribution of states’ share of GST, for effectively combating Covid-19.

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said that non release of State’s share of Rs 5,000 crore by the government of India is a hindrance in the fight against Covid-19 and he has taken up the matter with the Union Finance Minister.

Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Bhagel said, “The Congress Government in the State has given 10 kgs of ration free to all the families under the PDS system. Food to all children in anganwadis is being sent to their home. However, the GST share of over Rs 2,000 crore has not been released by the government of India.”

Former party president Rahul Gandhi, who also took part in the CWC, lashed out at the the Modi Government over the exodus of migrants in the country.

“We have looked at Covid-19 for two months since February and have spoken to experts. No country in the world has attempted a lockdown with huge migrant labour without arranging for their stay, food and ration and pushing them back home,” Rahul said.

Priyanka Gandhi, who is also the in-charge for Uttar Pradesh, took on the Yogi Adityanath-led government, saying that the state has faced the maximum brunt of lockdown.

“Instead of supporting those returning home, the police and administration in UP are thrashing them.

People are now being quarantined in inhuman conditions and sprayed with insecticides,” Priyanka said as she urged for more testing for coronavirus.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sonia-hits-out-at-govy--says-lockdown----unplanned---.html

Shah said while the world is lauding Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership and bold decisions in containing the spread of virus, the opposition leaders are busy flaying their own government. “Under PM Narendra Modi’s leadership, India’s efforts to fight Coronavirus are being lauded domestically and globally. 130 crore Indians are united to defeat COVID-19. Yet, Congress is playing petty politics. High time they think of national interest and stop misleading people,” the Home Minister tweeted.

Shah’s remark comes in the wake of the Congress criticising the Modi government for not effectively fighting the Covid-19 menace.

At the Congress Working Committee meeting today, top Congress leaders discussed the situation arising out of the coronavirus outbreak and criticised the Centre for unplanned implementation of the lockdown. Party chief Sonia Gandhi said that the unplanned lockdown has caused chaos and pain to millions of migrant workers.

For his part, Javadekar termed Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s criticism of the Centre as “unfortunate” and an unnecessary politicisation of the crisis. Javadekar said the Prime Minister is taking everyone along in his handling of the situation, and his measures, including the nationwide lockdown, have “received” praise from the world in an apparent reference to World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praising Modi for his efforts to help poor amid the lockdown.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/playing-petty-politics-over-virus--shah-hits-back-at-congress.html

Veterans are already helping local authorities in some States in collecting data from villages and assisting the police in maintaining order, and their involvement will only increase in the coming days given their pan-India presence.

Highlighting these points here on Thursday, Defence Ministry officials said the NCC has offered a helping hand to civilian authorities in the country’s fight against COVID-19 by extending the services of cadets under ‘Exercise NCC Yogdaan’. It has issued guidelines for temporary employment of its cadets to augment relief efforts and functioning of various agencies involved in battling the pandemic.

The tasks envisaged for NCC cadets include, manning of helpline and call centres, distribution of relief materials, community assistance, data management and queue & traffic management. According to the guidelines, cadets should not be employed in handling of law and order situation or for active military duties or at hot spots.

Only Senior Division volunteer cadets above 18 years of age will be employed. They should be employed in small cohesive groups of eight to 20 under the supervision of Permanent Instructor Staff or/and an Associate NCC Officer, officials said.

Moreover, for employment of volunteer cadets, state governments have to send the requisition through State NCC Directorates. Details will be coordinated at Directorate/Group Headquarters/Unit level with state government/local civil authority. Before the cadets are deployed for the duty, ground conditions and laid down requirements are to be ensured.

The NCC, which operates under defence ministry, is the largest uniformed youth organisation of the country and has been engaged in conducting various social service and community development activities. The NCC cadets have been contributing to the national cause during natural calamities like floods and cyclone since its inception.

As regards mobilizing ex-servicemen, they said Rajya Sainik Boards, Zila Sainik Boards are playing a dynamic role in identifying and mobilising maximum veterans to assist the state and district administration in performing public outreach activities such as contact tracing, community surveillance, management of quarantine facilities or any such tasks assigned to them.

As per the Supreme Court judgment, incumbent telcos have to make full payment of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues including interest, penalty and interest on penalty, it said noting that Bharti Airtel appeared better placed to make the payment, given the recent fund raise.

Introduction of floor pricing and cut in levies to ensure that market continues to have four players, can further benefit the industry including Airtel, Reliance Jio, it said.

""However, floor pricing may be delayed due to the lockdown. Also, due to economic stress from the lockdown, demand for relief by other industries may increase, which could impact Vodafone Idea's prospects of getting relief from the government,"" it said.

Axis Capital said Airtel and RJio will continue to gain market share at the cost of Vodafone Idea due to latter's worsened financial health which may deteriorate further after the AGR judgment.

It noted that telcos had introduced new packs for customers for work from home, had engaged in ensuring service continuity and had rolled out relief offers to low income customers.

In its note on Friday, Axis Capital asserted that telcos' subscriber addition will be hit, as the lockdown in wake of COVID-19 will sharply pull down subscriber acquisition, given that people mostly remained at home and shops were closed.

""COAI expects subscriber addition of less than 1 million in March 2020 versus average of 3 million per month. Subscriber addition to be hit for most of Q1FY21 due to 21-day lockdown and possibility of restrictions/ partial restrictions getting extended,"" Axis Capital said.

Also, conversion from 2G/3G to 4G may also be hit as it requires new SIM, ""which is difficult in a lockdown"", it said.

""These may partially impact revenue growth that was expected in 9MCY20 (nine months of calender year 2020) from the tariff hike taken in December 2019. Accordingly, we have trimmed our revenue estimates for wireless telcos,"" Axis Capital said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on March 24, had announced a complete lockdown of the entire country for 21 days in an unprecedented move to try halt the spread of coronavirus, shortly after which the Centre said road, rail and air services will remain suspended during this period.

As on early Friday, the pandemic had claimed 56 lives in the country and number of COVID-19 cases had increased to 2,301.

140,03-4-20,"Sensex slumps 674 pts; Nifty drops below 8,100","Equity benchmark Sensex tumbled 674 points on Friday, weighed by losses in banking stocks as unabated spike in new Covid-19 cases fuelled uncertainty over the economic impact of the pandemic.

After hitting a low of 27,500.79 during the day, the 30-share BSE barometer ended 674.36 points or 2.39 per cent lower at 27,590.95.

The NSE Nifty shed 170 points, or 2.06 per cent, to finish at 8,083.80.

Axis Bank was the top loser in the Sensex pack, cracking over 9 per cent, followed by IndusInd Bank, ICICI Bank, Titan, SBI, Maruti, HDFC and Asian Paints.

On the other hand, Sun Pharma, ITC, ONGC, M&M and Tech Mahindra were among the gainers.

With fresh cases of novel coronavirus mounting by the day, concerns over a looming economic recession kept investors on the edge, traders said.

The Asian Development Bank warned on Friday that the Covid-19 pandemic could cost the global economy USD 4.1 trillion as it ravages United States, Europe and other major economies.

It also said that India's economic growth rate will slip to 4 per cent in the current fiscal.

The number of Covid-19 cases in India has crossed 2,300 while the death toll rose to 56, according to the Health Ministry.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases around the world has soared past one million and fatalities have topped 50,000 as the US reported the highest daily death toll of any country so far.

The Sensex plummeted 674.36 points or 2.39 per cent to close at 27,590.95 on Friday.

Selling in markets led to a decline in market capitalisation of the BSE-listed companies which tumbled Rs 4,82,033.63 crore to Rs 1,08,66,722.96 crore in two days.

""The Indian benchmark indices continued to plunge southwards, after a surge in the number of coronavirus cases in India.

142,03-4-20,Record 10 mn sought US jobless aid in 2 weeks,"More than 6.6 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week — doubling a record high set just one week earlier — a sign that layoffs are accelerating in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. Combined with last week’s report that 3.3 million people sought unemployment aid two weeks ago, the US economy has now suffered nearly 10 million layoffs in just the past few weeks — far exceeding the figure for any corresponding period on record.

The stunning report Thursday from the Labor Department showed that job cuts are mounting against the backdrop of economies in the United States and abroad that have almost certainly sunk into a severe recession as businesses have shut down across the world. “This kind of upending of the labor market in such a short time is unheard of,” said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank.

Further signs of a surging wave of layoffs are likely in the coming weeks. Seth Carpenter, an economist at Swiss bank UBS, estimates that about one-third of last week’s claims had been delayed from the previous week, when state offices that handle unemployment benefits were overwhelmed by a surge of online and telephone claims.

Yet many of those offices are still struggling to process all the claims they have received, suggesting more claims will be pushed into the following week.

The magnitude of the layoffs has led many economists to envision as many as 20 million lost jobs by the end of April. That would be more than double the 8.7 million jobs lost during the Great Recession. The unemployment rate could spike to as high as 15 per cent this month, above the previous record of 10.8 per cent set during a deep recession in 1982.

Employers are slashing their payrolls to try to stay afloat because their revenue has collapsed, especially at restaurants, hotels, gyms, movie theaters and other venues that depend on face-to-face interaction. Auto sales have sunk, and factories have closed. Roughly 90 per cent of the US population is now under stay-at-home orders, which have been imposed by most US states.

This trend has intensified pressure on businesses, most of which face rent, loans and other bills that must be paid. The reversal in the job market has been dizzying. Four weeks ago, weekly unemployment claims amounted to only 211,000, near a 50-year low. Since then, they have jumped 30-fold.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/record-10-mn-sought-us-jobless-aid-in-2-weeks.html
143,03-4-20,Spain sees record rise in unemployment,"New data has revealed that almost 9,00,000 people in Spain have lost their jobs since the country imposed strict measures to fight the coronavirus pandemic, another sign of the economic impact of the outbreak in Europe’s second worst-hit country.

The data shows 898,822 people have now lost their jobs since the start of the lockdown, including about 550,000 temporary workers, the BBC reported citing the data as saying. Spain’s official unemployment figure rose to 3.5 million, the highest level since April 2017. March’s figure was the highest monthly rise in unemployment ever recorded in the country, which already had one of the eurozone’s highest jobless rates.

The country has also banned all but essential outings and shut most businesses in mid-March. “This is an absolutely unprecedented situation,” the BBC quoted Labour Minister Yolanda Daz as saying at a news conference. The tourism and construction sectors were the hardest hit.

Meanwhile, 10,003 people in Spain have died from the coronavirus as 950 new deaths were reported in the last 24 hours, another daily record, the Health Ministry said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/spain-sees-record-rise-in-unemployment.html
144,03-4-20,Testing is solution to unlock virus puzzle: UK PM,"Testing was the solution to “unlock the puzzle” of the novel coronavirus, said the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was currently in self-isolation after contracting the disease which has infected 29,865 people and killed 2,357 others in the country.

“I want to say a special word about testing, because it is so important, and as I have said for weeks and weeks, this is the way through,” the BBC quoted the Prime Minister as saying In a video message on Twitter on Wednesday evening.

“This is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle. This is how we will defeat it in the end.” Johnson said more coronavirus testing would enable staff who were self-isolating, either because they had symptoms or shared a household with someone who was sick, to know if they were safe to work.

Antibody tests, which look for signs of immunity in the blood, could also show who had already had coronavirus and was therefore not at risk of being infected or passing the infection on to others, the PM said.

However, these tests were not yet ready for use and it was not clear when they will be.

Meanwhile, the PM’s official spokesman said the Government was working with NHS England, Public Health England and other organisations to boost test capacity with an additional network of labs and testing sites, the BBC reported. Also on Wednesday, Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England medical director, said during Downing Street’s daily coronavirus briefing that the “intention” was for testing for frontline staff to increase from “thousands to hundreds of thousands within the coming weeks”.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/testing-is-solution-to-unlock-virus-puzzle--uk-pm.html

146,03-4-20,RBI director Marathe presses for bold initiatives to revive MSME sector amid COVID-19 crisis,"The Government and the Reserve Bank need to come out with a bold and comprehensive package to help small and medium enterprises tide over the unprecedented crisis created by COVID-19, said veteran co-operator and RBI central board director Satish Marathe.

Piecemeal initiatives will not help the industry as “this is an exceptional crisis and warrants exceptional response,” Marathe told PTI.

The coronavirus crisis is likely to end in the next three to six months, but the industry, which bore the brunt of slowdown during 2019, will take much longer to recover, he said.

Referring to the recent measures announced by the Government and the RBI to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, he said, these are only for short term and may not yield the desired results as the problem is severe and has been further aggravated by the lockdown. There is a need for a bold and comprehensive package to ensure that the industry, especially unorganised sector and MSMEs, comes back on track as quickly as possible once coronavirus is contained and the lockdown is lifted, said Marathe, who is also the founder member of Sahakar Bharati.

In a letter written to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Sahakar Bharati said announcements made by the government and the central bank would make little impact both on the borrowers and lenders. There is a need to relax bad loan guidelines for classification of non-performing assets (NPA), it said, adding the delinquency period should be raised from 90 days to 180 days.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/rbi-director-marathe-presses-for-bold-initiatives-to-revive-msme-sector-amid-covid-19-crisis.html

148,03-4-20,Boeing announces voluntary layoff plan,"Boeing unveiled a voluntary worker layoff programme on Thursday, telling employees that it hoped to avoid “other workforce actions” as the aviation industry reels from the coronavirus crisis.

The initiative was announced by Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun, who said such belt-tightening was needed amid the hit to the industry caused by the pandemic. “It’s important that we start adjusting to our new reality now,” he said.

Boeing’s financial picture was already a bit cloudy prior to the coronavirus outbreak because of the crisis surrounding the 737 MAX, which has been grounded for more than a year following two fatal crashes. But the COVID-19 crisis has made Boeing’s situation significantly worse, grounding most commercial airline travel and putting major carriers in a life-or-death fight to go forward.

“When the world emerges from the pandemic, the size of the commercial market and the types of products and services our customers want and need will likely be different,” Calhoun said.

“We will need to balance the supply and demand accordingly as the industry goes through the recovery process for years to come.” Calhoun said the company would have additional information on the programme in three to four weeks. A Boeing official said the company expects “several thousand employees to take the voluntary layoff package or retire,” adding that the company would continue to recruit in some targeted areas, including for defence and space programmes.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/boeing-announces-voluntary-layoff-plan.html
149,03-4-20,"FMCG to liquor makers, all pitch in to make hand sanitisers","The soaring demand for hand sanitisers following the coronavirus pandemic has made several companies —from FMCG players such as Patanjali, Emami, Raymond Consumer Care and Dabur to liquor makers like Radico Khaitan and Diageo — to venture into manufacturing of the disinfectant.

Recently, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs had directed State Governments to grant licences to distilleries and sugar companies to manufacture hand sanitisers to prevent shortage.

Besides, the ministry had also directed deodorant makers to either manufacture or bottle hand sanitisers made by sugar companies and distilleries, which lack capabilities to pack in small units consumed in the market.

Raymond Consumer Care, the FMCG arm of the Raymond Group, which sells personal grooming items such as deodorant and perfume under Park Avenue brand, plans to manufacture hand sanitiser and is awaiting clearances from the Government.

“At Raymond Consumer Care, we intend to make a positive contribution to India’s fight against COVID-19. We are committed to creating innovative products that resonate with the needs of our consumers and we have currently developed an effective hand sanitiser,” said Raymond Consumer Care spokesperson.

“The commercial production of hand sanitiser is currently awaiting the Government approval and it is our endeavour to make the same available across the country through our expansive distribution network,” he added.

Baba Ramdev-led Patanjali Ayurved, which also forayed into the hand sanitiser manufacturing last week, claimed it is selling the item at below the price capped by the Government. “We have already sent one million units into the market and would soon produce over one crore units to battle the spread of Covid-19,” said Patanajali Ayurved spokesperson SK Tijarawala.

Last month, the Government capped the maximum retail price of hand sanitiser at Rs 100 per 200 ml bottle till June 30 this year following a sharp rise in prices of this product owing to the coronavirus outbreak. Kolkata-based FMCG major Emami, which owns ‘HE’ brand of deodorants, also has plans to start manufacturing hand sanitisers.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/fmcg-to-liquor-makers--all-pitch-in-to-make-hand-sanitisers.html
150,03-4-20,All precautions taken in handling cargo,"All precautions are being taken in handling export-import (EXIM) cargo at ports and more than 43,000 crew and passengers have not been allowed to disembark since January 26, in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus, a shipping ministry official said.

“Stepping up measures to contain the spread of deadly coronavirus, the Government has so far prevented over 43,000 crew and passengers onboard about 1,300 ships from disembarking on Indian shores and arranged for safe transport of EXIM cargo,” the official told PTI.

Apart from restricting cargo handling, and scanning passengers and crew, the government has prohibited entry of any international cruise ship, crew or passengers with a travel history to coronavirus-hit countries post February 1, 2020, to its major ports till March 31.

They have not been allowed to disembark as a precautionary measure to contain any possible spread of the virus. They were allowed to anchor at designated places, but no shore passes were issued to such crew and passengers post January 26, the official said.

As per the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO), all passengers and crew aboard the vessels are being scanned, and all necessary facilities are being extended to them, the official said.

All required protocols are being followed and help is being provided in case of fever or sickness, the official added.

India has 12 major ports — Deendayal (erstwhile Kandla), Mumbai, JNPT, Marmugao, New Mangalore, Cochin, Chennai, Kamarajar (earlier Ennore), VO Chidambarnar, Visakhapatnam, Paradip and Kolkata (including Haldia) — which handled 699.04 MT of cargo during 2018-19.

There are about 200 non-major ports under the control of States. The Government in February had directed all 12 major ports to immediately put in place screening, detection and quarantine system for disembarking seafarers and cruise passengers as a preventive measure against the coronavirus outbreak.

Directions had also been issued to ports to procure N-95 masks as well as thermal scanners to screen passengers, besides obtaining self-declaration from arriving crew/passengers. To prevent the spread of the deadly virus, the ministry had said it will allow only such international cruise ships which had intimated their call to ports by January 1, 2020.

“Only those international cruise ships which had planned and intimated their call to an Indian Port not later than 1st January, 2020 will be allowed to call on such port,” it said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/all-precautions-taken-in-handling-cargo.html
151,03-4-20,Indian economy to lose $4.64 bn daily during lockdown: Acuite,"The ongoing disruption caused by the spread of Covid-19 will have a significant economic consequence with estimates suggesting that every single day of the 21-day nationwide lockdown will cost the Indian economy almost $4.64 billion, Acuite Ratings & Research has said in its latest report.

The single-day loss number will translate into a GDP loss of almost $98 billion during 21-day lockdown, the credit rating agency said.

“We have employed multiple methods to assess real GDP estimates for Q1 of FY21 and believe that there is a significant risk that it may contract up to 5%-6% as compared with a pre-Covid growth estimate of 5%,” Sankar Chakraborti, CEO, Acuite Ratings & Research, said.

In such a lockdown scenario, the most severely impacted sectors are transport, hotel, restaurant and real estate activities. According to Acuite, there would be around 50% GVA (gross value added) loss in these sectors, which account for around 22% in overall GVA, in Q1 of FY21.

On the other hand, services expected to see enhanced activities during this crisis are communication, broadcasting and healthcare; however, at 3.5%, these sectors have a small contribution in the overall GVA.

The impact of the lockdown is also fairly severe on industrial activities, which are set to witness significant contraction in Q1 except in the pharmaceutical, gas and electricity and medical devices which account for around 5% of GVA.

Unlike the services sector, the industry, however can manage demand to some extent with inventory drawdowns until the resumption of production.

Karan Mehrishi, Lead Economist of the rating agency, said: “The agricultural sector, which accounts for 15% of GVA, is nonetheless, expected to see continuing activity even in the lockdown period; however, the allied activities are partly impacted as livestock and fisheries are experiencing mute demand due to the Covid-19 concerns.”

Acuite said it would take at least 2-3 months to restore the industry supply chain even if the lockdown is limited to 21 days; there are also further risks of local lockdown in different regions in India, depending on the extent of the outbreak and partial disruption in economic activities till H1FY19 is a realistic scenario.

It is estimated that the second quarter may show a moderately positive growth of just under 3% on the back of the expected normalization process and some pent-up demand although it is also linked to the intensity of the pandemic.

On the positive side, a quick recovery in the domestic economic activities is likely in H2, which may in turn benefit from the increased fiscal and monetary measures along with lower global oil prices.

“We, therefore, believe that the average H2 GDP expansion may be in the vicinity of 6.5%. Overall, a likely contraction in Q1 followed by a modest growth in Q2 will clearly have a severe impact on India’s economic trajectory that has already been under the effect of a prolonged slowdown,” the report said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/indian-economy-to-lose--4-64-bn-daily-during-lockdown--acuite-2020-04-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/indian-economy-to-lose--4-64-bn-daily-during-lockdown--acuite.html

153,03-4-20,Putin extends non-working period to end of April to curb virus,"President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said Russians will continue not going to work while receiving pay until the end of the month to combat the coronavirus.

“I’ve taken a decision to extend the period of non-working days until April 30,” Putin said in an address, adding that each region can decide what lockdown measures are needed. Since Monday Russians have had a period of national non-working days when they are still entitled to full pay in a bid to reduce transmission of the virus.

In his second televised address on Russia’s response to the virus, Putin said that in Moscow “so far it has not been possible to turn around the situation despite the measures taken by federal and city authorities.” The capital city with more than 12 million inhabitants has seen the most cases so far.

Moscow has been under lockdown since Monday with all but essential shops closed and residents told to stay at home. “The threat remains” Putin said, with the peak of the pandemic still to come both globally and in Russia. Regional authorities should take decisions on what needs to be shut down based on the “objective situation” while ensuring people’s safety, Putin said. He said Russia will take further measures and it was possible the period of non-working days could be reduced if the situation improves.

156,03-4-20,"Virus masks, apps: The race is on to avoid hidden carriers","The worldwide race to protect people against being infected by unwitting coronavirus carriers intensified Thursday, pitting governments against each other as they buy protective gear and prompting new questions about who should wear masks, get temperature checks or even be permitted to go outside.

In the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic began in December, a green symbol on residents’ smartphones dictates their movements. Green is the “health code” that says a user is symptom-free. It’s required to board a subway, check into a hotel or enter the central city of 11 million. Serious travel restrictions still exist for those who have yellow or red symbols.

In northern Italy, the country with the most virus deaths in the world at over 13,000, guards with thermometer guns decide who can enter supermarkets. In Los Angeles, the mayor has recommended that the city’s 4 million people wear masks. They’re mandatory for all Israelis who leave home, as well as customers of grocery stores in Austria and pharmacies in Pakistan.

A top official in France’s hard-hit eastern region complained Thursday that American officials swooped in at a Chinese airport to spirit away a planeload of masks that France had ordered.

“On the tarmac, the Americans arrive, take out cash and pay three or four times more for our orders, so we really have to fight,” Dr. Jean Rottner, president of the Grand Est regional council and an emergency room physician in Mulhouse, told RTL radio.

A study by researchers in Singapore estimated that around 10% of new infections may be sparked by people who carry the virus but have no symptoms yet or never do.

In Greece, authorities placed an entire refugee camp of 2,400 people under quarantine Thursday after discovering that a third of the 63 contacts of just one infected woman tested positive — and none had showed symptoms.

The top US infectious disease official, Dr Anthony Fauci, said medical experts are no closer to figuring out why some seemingly healthy people have only mild or no symptoms while others become catastrophically sick. “I’ve been doing infectious diseases now for almost 50 years, and I can tell you I don’t fully understand exactly what the mechanism of that is,” he told NBC’s “Today” show.

In response to the study, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed how it defined the risks of infection, saying essentially that anyone may be a carrier, whether they have symptoms or not. But neither it nor the World Health Organization changed their recommendations that not everyone need to wear a mask.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said even a “tucked-in bandanna” could slow the spread of the virus and remind people to keep their distance from each other.

157,03-4-20,"I don’t, for now","Big fat Indian weddings have taken a direct hit in days of social distancing. Team Viva delves into the immediate and long-term impact on the industry

Indians and their love for big fat weddings, with a thousand guests and lavish spreads, is legendary. So in times of a pandemic when it is advised to avoid large public gatherings and restrict travel, soon-to-be brides and grooms are facing tough and hitherto unheard of choices. The lockdown has sent ripples through the wedding industry, from vendors, wedding planners and venues to guests, relatives and couples. A layer of caution and concern, thicker than that of butter on dal makhni at the banquet, has enveloped the celebrations. And the question that we are faced with is — even if we emerge out of this situation, will Indian weddings ever be the same again or will we now be more cautious of social gatherings?

Luxury caterings

Well, Indian weddings, especially the big fat ones, aren’t just about their vibrant dance and music, decor and lights, and dresses, it’s a lot about food, too. However, with the food industry hit badly due to the deadly virus, experts predict that ‘bahar ka khaana’ would mostly be avoided for a long time even if we have fought this war and emerged out of it. So how is it going to affect the wedding catering business when ‘shaadiyon ka khaana’ won’t be appealing anymore?

Karann Talwar, managing director and the gastronome chef, Kitchen Kraft Luxury Catering, points out that he has already faced some of the brunt. He says, “A lot of replanning and cancellation of weddings has happened in the past one month. Close to half of those planning to tie the knot in the coming quarter have also postponed or cancelled their plans to the later part of the year. We had our bookings full for March-end and the first week of April but we saw nine wedding bookings getting cancelled and six being postponed.”

He highlights that the destination weddings have been hit the hardest with most of them, even if planned in the next few months, being cancelled already. “We had some bookings mainly for destination weddings in cities like Udaipur and Jaipur. However, due to the nationwide lockdown and advisory issued by the Rajasthan state, we cannot proceed further,” says he.

Looking at future prospects, he says that for some time, people will become more cautious and for that, even they, as a catering industry, will also have to take more precautions in preparing the food as and when they get the bookings and orders for weddings now. He adds, “We will ensure we get our staff members and employees vaccinated if any vaccination is available for COVID-19. Besides this, we will only hire people who have no previous history of Coronavirus or any other form of infection, including in their families.”

Wedding organisers might also hesitate in laying out a large spread for their guests at weddings since the very idea of large gatherings would see a scaling down. How will the luxury catering market deal with it? Karann says, “No one ever expected such a time. Nobody imagined themselves to be sitting at home, doing nothing for so many days. Not just the catering market, but all the other industries are also shattered. A wedding is such an auspicious moment where people cannot miss anyone and invite a huge list of guests and relatives. I believe gradually, when the situation gets better, people will start to trust and would indulge in surplus items in the menus. Right now, I believe it is a difficult time for us but I am sure things will be back on track for the whole food and catering industry.”

Beauty

The pandemic has affected the beauty industry drastically. It has brought a major shift in the mindset of the consumers which in turn has impacted the economy. “We have suffered a lot of losses as several make up bookings have been canceled and postponed. The pandemic has brought down the spending capacity of the consumers as everyone wants to save money for an emergency rather than spending on luxury. Approximately 70 per cent of my orders have been postponed to November and December and the rest 30 per cent have been canceled. I don’t blame my clients as no one has an idea of the future,” says Agrika Kalra, celebrity make up artist. It will take a couple of years for not only this industry but the entire economy to come back to normal.

However, the larger question that lies here is — even if we emerge out of this situation, will Indian weddings ever be the same again as we will now be more cautious of public gatherings? “I doubt that. Even after emerging out of this they won’t be the same for a couple of years as people will always have this sense of fear. They would prefer smaller wedding affairs,” says Kalra and adds, “People won’t go for costly outfits, makeup artists, venue, etc as they would focus on simple weddings with limited people.”

Fashion

The outbreak has sent ripples through the fashion industry as it has escalated in the midst of the 2020 spring-summer season, causing brands and design houses to shutter their doors and postpone upcoming runway shows. Last month we even saw some fashion shows getting cancelled in Paris, Milan and Italy. From vendors to fashion designers to wedding planners, everyone is going through a tough time.

“As we all know, April, May and June are the months when weddings are scheduled in bulk. And now they all are getting affected. Most of the weddings, social gatherings and events have been already canceled. Even the shoots have been canceled, this has affected our sales. The closure of malls and retail outlets with a view to control the situation has resulted in a substantial reduction in the sales of domestic textiles and clothing,” says Ravi Gupta, owner, Gargee Designers.

After we emerge out of this situation, people are going to be more cautious about gatherings. And Indian weddings are not a small affair. It’s like a three-day long festival that has people of all age groups. Ravi says, “People will be selective in inviting their guests now. I don’t think the invitees too would not take any risky steps of attending public gathering in the coming months.”

The lockdown has impacted everyone’s pocket which, in turn, will impact the shopping patterns of people. But, Ravi feels that once the cash inflow and outflow will regularise, people will start buying new things and market will witness a positive change.

Jewellery

The sudden outbreak of the virus has impacted the Indian global gems and jewellery market. If we look at the present statistics, the lockdown in the metropolitan has resulted in an additional loss of five percent in exports, besides a generally low demand due to economic slowdown. Also, as the outbreak has affected countries like Japan, China, and South Korea, there is a sharp fall in demand in the global market.

“As of now, we are having a 100 per cent cancellation, especially for all marriage orders. No new orders have been placed and the status of the old booking is also not clear. All the clients mentioned that they will only be able to confirm once the lockdown is over and the situation gets better. Most of the marriages have been postponed to later this year,” says Bhuvan Goel, founder, S.KA Diamonds.

He adds that more than 60 to 70 percent marriages have been canceled and 20 to 30 per cent have been rescheduled and 10 per cent have gone for court marriages and probably when things are better, they will go for some small reception or a small family gathering. So even when we emerge out of this crisis, nothing is certain about the market

“All this will result in the decline of demand and thus affect the business. Due to the current situation of the jewellery industry, there will be a massive drop in sales. I presume that there could be a 50 to 70 thousand crore loss in business activities in the jewellery segment,” says Goel.

Further, as we talk about rental jewellery options, people will be more hesitant as there will always be a fear about their hygiene.

A more holistic approach

The global rental market was expected to reach $335 billion by 2025 as it offers the convenience of living without the responsibility of maintaining or upgrading them. So will this affect the rental market as hygiene issues are involved? Sanchit Baweja, co-founder of Stage3, feels that rentals will increase post COVID-19 as consumption patterns would change. He shares that sustainability as a way of living and the pandemic we are witnessing are interconnected. We are all a part of the same planet. It is a wake up call to stop overusing the resources as the threat from climate change is as real as the pandemic. The year 2020 will be remembered as a turnaround point in global markets and pave the way in reinvention of how resources are consumed. “With sustainability being at the core, we expect to reach more and more people in reinventing their fashion consumption choices. More people will resonate with the vision of conscious consumption and would want to reduce their carbon footprint on the planet, and hence, explore renting outfits they hardly repeat,” says he.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/i-don---t--for-now-2020-04-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/i-don---t--for-now.html

Actor Taapsee Pannu says slow and steady is the mantra that has helped her get an audience and their trust.

She is elated to see her number 1 spot on a list created by Bollywood Ranker on the basis of votes that audience gave to her films on IMDb.

“I might not have the maximum hundred-crore grossers, but it’s quite satisfying to see that the audience has voted me on the basis of the kind of films I have done,” Taapsee said.

She added, “Slow and steady is the mantra that has helped me get my audience’s trust. I hope I live up to their expectations every time they decide to spend the few hours of their life watching my films.”

‘Writing is a creative extension of me and I don’t do it with the motive of writing a screenplay. I began penning down my thoughts for the sake of keeping my skills sharpened. Writing and acting are interconnected for me. I am writing to fulfill my own creative quest. Let me see how the finished product turns out.’

—Pankaj Tripathi

For actor Ananya Panday, being nominated for best supporting actress in her latest release, Pati Patni or Woh, is a “great feeling.”

She said, “It’s really great. Especially, for a film that has such an experienced actor like Bhumi (Pednekar) as my co-star. With so much love coming my way, I feel that all my hardwork has paid off. This only drives me and motivates me further to continue giving my best with each of my projects and hopefully later, even bag a nomination as the best actress, you know. I am super delighted and humbled.”

Ananya is currently working for her next, Khaali Peeli.

Dolly donates $1mn for Corona

Singer Dolly Parton is continuing her efforts to aid in the Coronavirus crisis by donating $1 million to help researchers find a cure for COVID-19.

Parton pledged the money to medics at Nashville, Tennessee’s private research school Vanderbilt University on April 1 as she urged others who are financially secure to consider doing the same.

Parton took to social media where she wrote, “My longtime friend Dr Naji Abumrad, who’s been involved in research at Vanderbilt for many years, informed me that they were making some exciting advancements towards research of the coronavirus for a cure. I am making a donation of $1 mn to Vanderbilt towards that research.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trend-blazer-2020-04-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/trend-blazer-trend-blazer-2020-04-03.html
159,03-4-20,Making home Corona-free,"As the deadly Coronavirus pandemic spreading rapidly, people are doing everything to keep themselves safe but what about your own abode? To make your home Coronavirus-free, health experts have shared some tips such as cleaning all kitchen surfaces every time you finish cooking and keeping separate pairs of footwear for outdoors and indoors to fight the virus.

According to Praveen Gupta, Director and Head Neurology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute in New Delhi, all surfaces should be cleaned routinely with soap and other disinfectants available to make your house coronavirus proof.

“Apart from cleaning the surfaces, other objects like light switches, desk, keyboards, doorknobs, toilet, closets should also be cleaned. Please make sure that you do not touch any object while cleaning with bare hands; gloves are necessary and make sure to dispose of these gloves after the cleaning is done,” Gupta said.

In case when you are buying vegetables and fruits from outside, please make sure that you clean the bag very carefully before entering the house. If possible, it is advisable to keep the bags outside your home or in a corner for at least 24 to 48 hours.

“Considering coronavirus spreads through droplets, please make sure to wash your vegetables and fruits in potassium permanganate solution or you can also wash it with hot water as well for at least 5-10 minutes,” the doctor suggested.

Stay home as much as possible but there are times when we can’t avoid visits to grocery store or pharmacy at some point. “It is advisable to avoid unnecessary to and fro to any market area and stay in house. Disinfect everything you touch thoroughly and make sure that you wash your hands frequently. Also, supervise your pets in the backyard and keep them away from meeting or playing with other people,” said Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, Respiratory Medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals.

“Make use of hypochlorite to clean every corner of your house or make use of bleaching powder to clean your house,” he added.

If someone is sick at your home, please make sure that a distance is maintained from that person and his or her clothes should be washed separately. “One needs to understand while performing all the above activities, wearing gloves is necessary and when you are giving your clothes for laundry, please use disposable gloves and it is preferred to wash your clothes at home only and avoid any outside contact,” Chawla said.

Dr Sudhish Sehra, HOD, Internal Medicine, Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute in New Delhi said that in addition to frequently sanitizing your hands, keeping the house and your immediate surroundings clean is equally important.

“Start with basic dusting while covering your face with a mask/alternative clothing such as a handkerchief, and disinfect the furniture surfaces and the floor. Clean all kitchen surfaces every time you finish cooking. Keep separate pairs of footwear for outdoors and indoors,” Sehra said.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/making-home-corona-free-2020-04-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/making-home-corona-free.html
160,03-4-20,Netanyahu quarantined for 2nd time,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday went into isolation for the second time in a week after his Health Minister Yaakov Litzman tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Netanyahu, 70, will remain in self-quarantine until April 8 as he had frequent meetings with Litzman, reports Xinhua news agency.

The move follows the recommendation of Netanyahu’s personal doctor and guidelines of the Health Ministry, the Office added.

Litzman, leader of the Jewish ultra-Orthodox party of United Torah Judaism, was in self-isolation with his wife who has also contracted the virus.

On Wednesday, Netanyahu completed a two-day isolation after one of his advisors was diagnosed with the novel coronavirus.

In addition, the Health Ministry’s Director-General Moshe Bar Siman Tov, who has been running Israel’s efforts to halt the rapid spread of the virus, also went into isolation for his contact with Litzman.

He will continue to work and coordinate the efforts from a designated facility in the Sheba Hospital outside Tel Aviv, the Ministry said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/netanyahu-quarantined-for-2nd-time.html
161,03-4-20,Saudi Arabia seeks urgent OPEC+ meeting to stabilise oil market,"Leading world crude exporter Saudi Arabia on Thursday made a surprise call for a meeting of the OPEC+ oil producers to “stabilise the oil market” amid a price war.

“The kingdom calls for an urgent meeting of OPEC+ and a group of other countries with the aim to try and reach a fair deal to restore balance to the oil market,” said a statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency. The move followed a phone call between US President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince and de facto leader Mohammed bin Salman. “This call comes in the framework of the kingdom’s continued support for the global economy under these exceptional circumstances and in estimation of a call by US President Donald Trump and US friends,” the statement said.

Riyadh reiterated that it had tried to reach an agreement among OPEC+ members to cut production and “secured the support of 22 countries... But failed to secure consensus”. Saudi Arabia had blamed Russia for refusing to agree to an additional output cut of 1.5 million barrels per day on top of reduction already in place of 1.7 million bpd. As a result, the kingdom opened its crude oil taps, deciding to raise its production to a record 12.3 per cent from April 1. It later said it will export at least 10 million bpd in April, which will be raised to a record high 10.6 million bpd to flood the global markets.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/saudi-arabia-seeks-urgent-opec--meeting-to-stabilise-oil-market.html
162,03-4-20,Virus death toll above 50K,"With new coronavirus cases set to breach the 1-million mark, the world is witnessing an “exponential growth” which is a bad sign as the number of deaths has more than doubled in the past week, the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned on Thursday.

According to latest data from Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE), there were 9,86,373 lakh cases globally, with over 50,399 deaths and 2,06,372 have been recovered in more than 180 countries.

“As we enter the fourth month since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic I’m deeply concerned about the rapid escalation and global spread of infection,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a virtual media conference on Thursday.

Europe reeled from the pandemic and the US prepared for what President Donald Trump warned would be “horrific” days ahead.

The virus claimed thousands more lives in its relentless march across the globe, including nearly 1,000 new deaths in Spain, despite more than half of the planet subjected to some form of lockdown.

World Health Organisation head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said there had been a “near exponential growth” in new cases over the past five weeks and a doubling of deaths in the past week alone.

New figures on infection rates and virus-related deaths would show whether there were signs the epidemic could be peaking in Europe, where at least 34,000 have died. Britain and France both reported their highest daily death tolls on Wednesday, but infection rates in Italy and Spain — the two countries hardest hit — were slowing.

Spain said on Thursday it had suffered a record 950 deaths in 24 hours, bringing the total number of fatalities to 10,003. The number of confirmed cases passed the 1,10,000 mark, the government said, although the rates of both new infections and deaths continued a downward trend. “The data show the curve has stabilised” and the epidemic has entered a “slowdown” phase, Health Minister Salvador Illa said.

The virus has chiefly affected the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions, but recent cases have highlighted that it can kill people from all walks of life.

The dead have included a 16-year-old in France, a 12-year-old in Belgium and Ismail Mohamed Abdullah, 13, in Britain, whose family said the “gentle and kind” boy had no underlying health issues. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, himself in isolation after testing positive, announced plans for a massive increase in virus testing after it emerged that just 2,000 of hundreds of thousands of staff in the state-run National Health Service had been tested.

The United States, which now accounts for almost a quarter of reported global infections, saw its death toll pass 5,000 by the early hours of Thursday, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Among the latest known US fatalities was a six-week-old baby who was taken to a Connecticut hospital late last week. “Testing confirmed last night that the newborn was COVID-19 positive,” the state’s Governor Ned Lamont tweeted. “This is absolutely heartbreaking.” Trump, who was criticised for initially playing down the virus but has stepped up containment efforts in recent days, warned that the situation was going to get much worse. “We’re going to have a couple of weeks, starting pretty much now, but especially a few days from now, that are going to be horrific,” he said.

“But even in the most challenging of times, Americans do not despair. We do not give in to fear.” More than three-quarters of Americans are under lockdown, including tens of thousands of prisoners, who were told on Wednesday they would be confined to their cells for two weeks.

Officials also shuttered the Grand Canyon to prevent tourists gathering there, and New York announced that outdoor basketball courts would be closed as the city grapples with sky-rocketing infections and a severely strained health system.

The US Labor Department was due on Thursday to provide weekly figures on first-time claims for unemployment benefits after last week’s report showed a record 3.3 million filed claims. Economists are warning that US job losses could surge to the previously unimaginable range of 10 to 20 million in April.

The virus and the measures taken to contain it have raised fears of the worst global economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. It has also claimed the lives of many high-profile figures, including on Wednesday jazz legend Ellis Marsalis, whose family said the “giant of a musician and teacher” died at the age of 85 after contracting the virus.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/virus-death-toll-above-50k.html
163,03-4-20,Europe’s hospitals running out of ICU meds,"Nine leading European university hospitals are warning they will run out of essential medicines needed for COVID-19 patients in intensive care in less than two weeks as they are increasingly crushed by the pandemic.

The European University Hospital Alliance said that without countries cooperating to ensure a steady supply of these drugs, doctors and nurses might no longer be able to provide adequate intensive care for people critically ill with the new coronavirus.

In a statement published this week and sent to national governments, the group said that aside from the need for protective gear and ventilators, “the most urgent need now is for the drugs that are necessary for intensive care patients.” They wrote that existing stocks of muscle relaxants, sedatives and painkillers were likely to run out in two days at the hardest-hit hospitals, and in two weeks at others.

Last week, Italy’s national pharmaceutical agency issued a formal alarm to regional health authorities that the recent jump in demand for some medicines had depleted supplies. The agency set up a special email address for the regional authorities to report any difficulties finding certain drugs.

The shortage of such critical medicines has led some hospitals to buy alternative drugs or to try giving patients different dosages.

“It is extremely worrying that overworked and often less-experienced nurses and doctors-in-training, drafted to fill the gaps, have to use products and dosages that they are not used to,” the group wrote, on behalf of hospitals in Austria, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden and Spain.

A team of experts for the hospitals authority in Paris last week drew up a list of suggested workarounds for emergency units to employ to try to ward off what it identified as a “strong risk” of some sedatives and painkillers running out. The experts said that for each prescription, medics should ask themselves whether a drug is really necessary and if doses can be reduced, as well as consider alternative drugs.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/europe---s-hospitals-running-out-of-icu-meds.html
164,03-4-20,"China’s Shenzhen city bans eating of cats, dogs","Shenzhen has become the first Chinese city to ban the sale and consumption of dogs and cats, a move that comes after the coronavirus outbreak was linked to wildlife meat, prompting authorities to ban the trade and eating of wild animals, a media report said on Thursday.

The new law will come into force on May 1, the BBC report said. In a statement, authothorities in Shenzhen said that “dogs and cats as pets have established a much closer relationship with humans than all other animals”, adding that the ban “also responds to the demand and spirit of human civilization”.

In February, Chinese authorities banned the trade and consumption of wild animals.

The move came after it emerged that a wet market in Wuhan could have been the starting point for the outbreak of the new coronavirus, providing the means for the virus to travel from animals to humans.

News of this led the Chinese Government to crack down strongly on the trade and on the markets that sold such products.

The coronavirus pandemic was still raging across the world, posing a test for countries and regions, as the global number of confirmed cases increased to 937,567, according to the latest update by the Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE).

167,03-4-20,Pandemic pantry,"The virus has sent a nation of restaurant-goers back to the kitchen

Last Tuesday night in Tennessee, bluegrass musicians David and Virginia Blood were busy making sandwiches. In Pittsburgh, real estate agent Michelle Bushee was stirring a pot of homemade black-bean chilli in her kitchen instead of shepherding curious buyers through potential dream homes. Marty Prudenti, whose nights are usually spent working backstage at New York City’s Lincoln Center, was in his Long Island backyard grilling burgers for his twins. And in Texas, Babette Maxwell — who would otherwise have been running at least one of her three teenage sons to sports practices or school events — was Googling recipes to engineer homemade versions of her boys’ favorite Taco Bell items.

Throughout the the globe, lives have been radically upended by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is worry and washing of hands. But one bright spot is emerging from self-quarantine and mandatory working from home: In this nation that so often dines out or gobbles processed food on the run, people are suddenly cooking a whole lot more.

Before the coronavirus emerged, Kim Bierly often worked late at her office and then met her husband for a quick dinner at one of the restaurants in their central Pennsylvania neighbourhood. If they didn’t eat out, they’d reach into the refrigerator and choose something packaged to heat up.

“I’ve always enjoyed cooking,” Bierly says. “But it was being saved for weekends. And by the time you get to the weekend you had all the other things you need to do. So it would be something quick or something prepared.”

Now working from home, she’s pulling out old recipes — the kinds of things she remembers her mother making, like stuffed pork chops or a bubbling pot of chicken and noodles. “I think we need comfort right now,” she says, “and food is comfort.” Unavoidably, these home-cooked dishes come with a side of stress. We’re trying to protect ourselves from germs at the grocery store, and may wonder whether supermarket shelves will become emptier in the coming weeks. But those worries are encouraging people to get creative by trying new ingredients and sharing advice on how to use unfamiliar vegetables or cuts of meat bought out of necessity.

What can you do with the canned foods that have been idling since last year at the back of your kitchen cabinets? Facebook groups like Pandemic Pantry have sprouted up as gathering places for strangers to share advice.

Michael Volpatt, owner of the gourmet Big Bottom Market in Sonoma County, California, tackled the subject of canned goods on a recent installment of the impromptu cooking show he began hosting from his kitchen on March 14. Scrolling through Facebook while gathering ingredients to make himself dinner that night, Volpatt noticed the Facebook “Live” button on his phone screen. With his store closed, he realised it was a way to connect with friends and customers, and not be alone while preparing his meal. “Hey everybody,” his first broadcast began. “I’ve never done Facebook Live before. But I figured since I’m kind of staying at home and going to do some cooking later on, you’re going to join me.”

A growing audience now watches and comments nightly as he prepares everything from his mother’s marinara sauce to pot pies made with his Big Bottom Market biscuit mix, which appeared on Oprah’s Favorite Things list in 2016. “It’s heartwarming,” Volpatt says, “and it takes a lot of the awkwardness of this whole experience away.”

Returning to old recipes and learning new ones can be both a necessity and a welcome distraction during this strange time. “Cooking brings back good memories,” Bierly says, “like standing there at the pot on my stove, cooking the spaghetti and thinking of when my mother used to do that.”

Food Network president Courtney White says her channel has seen a double-digit ratings increase in the past week, as viewers watch marathons of comfort food-focused shows like Guy Fieri’s “Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.” FoodNetwork.com has also had a double-digit increase in visitors and page views, White says. And many of the channel’s chefs have been broadcasting informally from their home kitchens via social media, while viewers pepper them with questions in real-time.

Alone at our stoves, we’re realising how good it can feel to make dinner from scratch by using just a few ingredients consciously and carefully. Families are also getting their kids involved.

“Now, more than ever, we hope you’ll find moments of peace when gathering around the dinner table,” the co-founders of the retail chain Savory Spice wrote in a website post to their customers over the weekend. “We hope you’ll find moments of joy when preparing food with your little ones. We hope the simplicity of a home cooked meal is a quiet reprieve from the chaos outside.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pandemic-pantry-2020-04-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/pandemic-pantry-pandemic-pantry.html

In a letter to Modi, dated April 1, Bach said he was “grateful” to the Indian Prime Minister for his support to the Tokyo Games during the recent G20 Leaders’ Summit which was held via video conference in the wake of the pandemic.

“Please accept my sincere thanks for the support you have given to the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, expressed in the Extraordinary G20 Leaders’ Summit Statement, commending the International Olympic Committee for contributing to the containment of the COVID-19 virus,” Bach wrote in his letter.

“I am really grateful for your support for the Olympic Games and their unifying role, which the G20 Leaders’ Summit had already expressed at your meeting last year in Osaka.”

The IOC chief firmly put his support behind Tokyo, saying despite the pandemic, the Japanese city is well-prepared to host the quadrennial Games.

“Given the great work having been done by our Japanese partners and friends, Tokyo is the best-ever prepared Olympic city.”

He is confident that with the support of the global leaders, the Tokyo Games next year will be a grand success.

“Thanks to the excellent and trustful cooperation we are enjoying, like from the G20 Leaders’ Summit, we are confident that these Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 will be a great success,” Bach said.

“Like you, we are confident that the Olympic Games 2020 will be a symbol of human resilience. They will again show the unity of humanity in all our diversity by bringing together the world’s best 11,000 athletes from all 206 National Olympic Committees and the IOC Refugee Olympic Team.”

“As humankind currently finds itself in a dark tunnel, together with our Japanese partners and friends we want to make these Olympic Games a light at the end of this tunnel,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ioc-chief-bach-thanks-pm-modi-for-his-support-to-tokyo-olympics.html
169,03-4-20,Barca could offer Griezmann to get Neymar back,"Spanish football giants FC Barcelona could part ways with Antoine Griezmann in order to bring back Neymar from PSG, according to a Sky Sports report.

Barelona have long wanted to bring Brazil forward back into their fold after he left them to join French side in 2018.

PSG value Neymar at €150m while Barca value Griezmann at €100m, says report quoted by ESPNFC.

France World Cup winner Griezmann has not been at his best form in his first season in Spain and selling him could aid the Lionel Messi-led side fund their summer spending.

Barca seem determined to sell Griezmann even if PSG don’t agree to the deal, though the current market might prevent such hefty deals from happening, given how many clubs are struggling financially as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, the report further said.

Meanwhile, Brazilian midfielder Willian has revealed that he is likely to leave Chelsea this summer after seven years with the PL club.

Willian, whose contract with the Blues expires in June, said he is open to offers from other clubs after talks about a new deal broke down.

“I have a beautiful story at Chelsea. I have a great relationship with the fans and everybody at the club. But my contract is ending and it’s going to be difficult,” the 31-year-old was quoted as saying by Brazilian news service Uol.

“Chelsea offered me (a contract of) two years. I asked for three and they said it was impossible. I don’t know if they can change their mind but, with the end of my current contract, I’m free to negotiate with any team.”

Willian has made 329 first-team appearances for Chelsea since joining them from Anzhi Makhachkala in August 2013.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/barca-could-offer-griezmann-to-get-neymar-back.html
170,03-4-20,Belgian league agrees to declare season finished,"The Belgian football league has recommended that the current season be declared finished early due to the coronavirus pandemic with the present table accepted as final, it said on Thursday, becoming the first European league to take such a measure.

The decision is set to be formally validated at a General Assembly on April 15, meaning that Club Brugge would be declared champions as they currently sit 15 points clear of Gent at the top of the table.

In a statement, the Belgian Pro League said it was “very unlikely” to be able to hold matches in front of crowds before June 30 and that it had “unanimously decided that it was not desirable...to continue the competition” after that date.

Matches behind closed doors were “theoretically possible”, but the league said it preferred not to put more pressure on health services and police in the circumstances. It therefore agreed not to restart the season and “accept the current league table as final”.

Belgium — whose national team top the FIFA world rankings — would become the first European league to take such a measure due to the ongoing health crisis, which saw football across the continent grind to a complete halt in the middle of March.

The Belgian season stopped with one round of games remaining in the 30-match regular season.

After that the league usually splits up, with the top six having their points totals halved and going on to play each other home and away to decide the title winners.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/belgian-league-agrees-to-declare-season-finished.html
171,03-4-20,Rohit roasts Pant over biggest six challenge,"Ace India cricketer Rohit Sharma on Wednesday roasted Rishabh Pant after he came to know that the young wicketkeeper-batsman wants to challenge him in hitting the biggest six.

During an Instagram Live session, Jasprit Bumrah told Rohit that Pant wants to challenge him to see who can hit the biggest six between the two.

In reply, the Indian opener played down the challenge in hilarious manner, saying: “Mere sath usko karna hai? ek saal hua nahi usko cricket khelke, chhakke ka competition kar rha hai (He wants to compete against me? He has played cricket for hardly a year and wants to have a competition).”

Rohit has so far hit 423 sixes in international cricket in 346 matches whereas Pant has hit 47 maximums in 56 games he has played for India so far.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/rohit-roasts-pant-over-biggest-six-challenge.html
172,03-4-20,Test cricket has made me better person: Kohli,"India captain Virat Kohli on Thursday said he became a better person by playing Test cricket, calling the format a representation of life where one doesn’t have the option of quitting when the going gets tough.

Speaking to former England batsman and IPL teammate Kevin Pietersen during an Instagram Live, Kohli touched upon his passion for Test cricket, the worst phase of his career, how he turned into a vegan and how much he is filled with gratitude for being able to live a comfortable life during a global crisis like COVID-19.

Asked which is his favourite format, the Indian skipper emphatically replied: “Test cricket, Test cricket, Test cricket, Test cricket and Test cricket. I have said it five times.”

“Because it is the representation of life. Whether you get runs or not, you have to clap when others are batting. You have to go back to your room, get up and come the next day.

“You have to follow the routine whether you like it or not. It’s like life where you don’t have the option of not competing. Test cricket has made me a better person,” said world’s premier batsman, who has 27 hundreds and 7240 runs in 86 games.

Pietersen, a superb Test batsman himself, lauded Kohli for trashing the idea of four-day Tests which the ICC has floated to pull in more crowds.

“I was called for a debate and I told them that if Virat Kohli doesn’t want four day Tests, it’s not happening,” the former England captain said as Kohli had a hearty laugh.

His aggressive on-field demeanour has polarised opinions but the Indian skipper feels that for him, aggression is a form of enjoyment and then comes thinking about strategy.

“I don’t think I need to behave myself just because I am the captain. I need to be abe to enjoy and then comes strategy.”

But there is one guy he will never sledge in his life and that is AB de Villiers, for the simple reason that there is just too much of respect.

“IPL has done a lot in terms of respecting each other. I would never ever be able to do it (seldging) with AB. There is a friendship that lasts much longer than all these things.”

In fact, asked to choose two batsmen he enjoys batting with most, De Villiers is one of them along with former skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

“I enjoy batting with those who understand my running between the wickets. You have to understand my calls. I have enjoyed batting with MS and with AB, we don’t even need to call as we look at each other and we know.”

Kohli also spoke about the Indian cricket team being one of the best fielding sides in the world and how he got that culture in the side.

“I was lucky to be in the centre of transition. I got to see what we were lacking and what the world was doing and we needed to catch up. So I was lucky to play with players who were on same page,” Kohli said.

The pair also went down memory lane to talk about their days playing together for Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in 2009 and 2010.

“Right from 2009-10 we had amazing fun at RCB. We hit off well from Day 1. You came in as the big KP a star. We had a gun team with Kallis, Boucher, Anil Kumble, Rahul Dravid,” Kohli said.

RCB have reached three finals but have never won an IPL. Kohli, as captain of the side, said he feels they deserved a title but added he is not obsessed to win one with the franchise.

“We have reached three finals but haven’t won. We deserve to win a title. At RCB, we get talked about so much as we had stars. The more you think (about winning the IPL), the more it keeps running away from you. There have been added pressure lately but we need to just enjoy and not take pressure.”

As he had said earlier, he would like to play all formats till 2023 and then take a call, he reiterated that the 2014 tour of England was the lowest point of his career when he felt that failure was inevitable.

“It was a phase where I felt that there was no chance of me getting any runs. I would get up and go to a match knowing that I will not get runs. To go through that feeling that you will fail demolished me.

“I promised never to let that happen to me again,” he said with a message for all youngsters who want to be the next Virat Kohli.

The reason for the disaster in England was putting himself ahead of the team and being “obsessed about his own game and success” and not being able to shut out the voices who spoke about success in England being the ultimate Test of a cricketer.

“Don’t be self centred,” was his message to the youngsters.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/test-cricket-has-made-me-better-person--kohli-2020-04-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/test-cricket-has-made-me-better-person--kohli.html
173,03-4-20,"PM discusses COVID-19 with top sportspersons, seeks support for awareness campaigns","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday discussed the the rapidly-growing threat of the COVID-19 pandemic with India's top athletes, including cricket icon Virat Kohli and star shuttler P V Sindhu, urging them to support awareness campaigns on social distancing.

More than 40 athletes, along with sports minister Kiren Rijiju, participated in nearly an hour-long video call which started at 11am. The country is in a 21-day lockdown to contain the spread of the virus.

The Prime Minister sought the athletes' support to raise awareness about the need for social distancing and personal hygiene at a time when the total number of COVID-19 positive cases in India has crossed 2,000.

""Your suggestions will be taken note of. We are fighting this pandemic like Team India. I am confident that India will be rejuvenated by the inspiration provided by you,"" the Prime Minister can be seen telling athletes in a clip shared by shuttler B Sai Praneeth, a world championship bronze-medallist, who also attended the call.

All sporting activities are currently shut in the country and it is still not clear when normalcy will resume. The much-anticipated Indian Premier League is among the big-ticket Indian events suspended till April 15.

When Ganguly was asked about the development this morning, he said, ""Yes, I will be joining our Honourable via video call."" But he refused to go into the details.

Cricketers formed a major chunk of the participating list.

Apart from Tendulkar, Ganguly and Kohli, others in the call included top batsman Rohit Sharma, former pacer Zaheer Khan, Yuvraj Singh. The names of World Cup-winning former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and K L Rahul were in the list of participants but it is learnt that they could not attend the call.

Olympic silver-medallist shuttler Sindhu, javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, chess wizard Viswanathan Anand, sprinter Hima Das, boxing stars M C Mary Kom and Amit Panghal, wrestler Vinesh Phogat, and teenage shooting sensation Manu Bhaker were among the other accomplished athletes who took part in the video call.

""Of these, 12 have been given three minutes each to speak and present their view,"" a ministry source told PTI without revealing the names of the chosen athletes.

It was later learnt that Tendulkar, Ganguly, Mary Kom and Kohli were among those who spoke during the interaction.

Former world champion weightlifter Mirabai Chanu said the urged everyone to be united in the fight to combat the pandemic.

""The asked us to spread awareness on social distancing and hygiene. He spoke about how we need Virat's (Kohli) fighting spirit to win this battle,"" added veteran table tennis player Sharath Kamal.

The Prime Minister felt ability to face challenges, self-discipline, positivity and self-belief, which are essential to sports, are crucial tools to combat the spread of the virus as well.

Sporting action has come to a halt the world over with all major events either cancelled or postponed.

The list of postponed events includes the Tokyo Olympics and the European football championships, while among the biggest to be cancelled this year is the Wimbledon championship.

The deadly outbreak has caused more than 50 deaths in India. The global death toll has crossed 50,000.

India's 21-day lockdown ends on April 14.

174,03-4-20,Everyone is keen for IPL to go ahead: Cummins on fate of IPL,"The costliest foreign player in Indian Premier League, Pat Cummins says everyone, including his team Kolkata Knight Riders, is still hopeful of the 13th edition of the T20 event to go ahead sometime later.

The Australian, however, conceded that the priority now is to minimise the risk of spreading the coronavirus.

The IPL was originally scheduled to start on March 29 in Mumbai but it was postponed to April 15 due to the worsening COVID-19 pandemic which has killed more than 53,000 people worldwide.

""Everyone is still really keen for it (IPL) to go ahead, but the priority is to minimise risk of it spreading,"" Cummins was quoted as saying by the Australian Associated Press.

India is currently under a nation-wide lockdown until April 14, which has cast serious doubts over the future of the cash-rich event's 13th edition.

The 26-year-old Australian has been in constant contact with the Kolkata Knight Riders team which bought him for a whopping Rs 15.5 crore last December at the auction, as everyone waits for the league's fate.

""It's a holding pattern ... the last I spoke to them, they were still really confident and hopeful it'll be on at some stage,"" he said.

Australia were forced to cancel their home limited-overs series against New Zealand after just one match and their Test tour to Bangladesh in June also looks uncertain at present.

""This year's going to look very different to what we've seen before ... there are so many scenarios. Unless things improve, I can't really see many tournaments going on anywhere in the world for a little while.""

The deadly coronavirus has infected over a million people worldwide. Australia has reported more than 5,000 cases including 26 deaths.

European nations like Italy, Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom alongside the United States of America have become the hotspots of the outbreak, which started from the Chinese city of Wuhan.

""It's awful seeing things like - Italy and Spain, but now America and the UK in recent days - it's just crazy how quickly it's developed. Obviously got a lot of family over in England at the moment and speaking to them regularly,"" Cummins said.

""Speaking to a few close mates who play county cricket over there, they've gone through the whole pre-season and geared up for the start of their summer. They're now staring down the barrel of potentially their whole summer of cricket being over ... the health risk is a big one, but those guys basically have to put their careers on hold.""

Earlier this week Test skipper Tim Paine said the nation's cricketers were aware that the delay to their central contract for next season may lead to pay cuts, and they are willing to do their bit to preserve the game amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Cummins reiterated the view of his skipper saying players were ready to ""take some of that pain"".

The sporting fraternity has been forced to a standstill as governments all across the globe called for social-distancing. To keep themselves fit, the players as well as Australia coach Justin Langer are turning to home workouts.

""JL sends through the odd video message just gloating about the 16km run he's done that day,"" Cummins said.

175,03-4-20,What’s for dinner?,"While you are cooking food at home, the menu combination should be easy to prepare and satisfying

Just about now, you might be tired of cooking and eating what’s in your refrigerator. We are all used to asking what’s for dinner? What are we in the mood for — pizza, sushi, Mexican? And then going to a restaurant to get it.

Now, with the Coronavirus forcing many of us to stay home more, it’s time to look at mealtime and cooking at home a little differently. Instead of asking, ‘What I am in the mood for?’ I am looking more closely in my pantry and my refrigerator and letting my ingredients dictate what I make.

For example, a few months ago, I was lured to purchase a big bag of mixed unsalted nuts because they were labeled “Omega-3 Nut Mix.” I thought I would eat a handful of “anti-oxidants” a day for my health but they have gone largely uneaten. So, this week, I mixed up my favourite sweet and savory spices with both brown and white sugar and made my baked Sugar and Spice Candied Nuts. Sure, the sugar adds a few more calories but now they are a delicious and welcome nibble instead of sitting unused in the pantry.

Likewise, I had a head of broccoli in the refrigerator that needed cooking. I couldn’t bear the thought of steamed broccoli so I decided to roast it simply with olive oil and kosher salt at 400 degrees Fahrenheit until the tips were deeply caramelised. Broccoli is addictive roasted this way, as is cauliflower, and any leftovers are delicious the next day with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar and good olive oil. If you have a pork tenderloin and a package of bacon in your fridge or freezer, you can make a simple two-ingredient main dish. A bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin dresses up your pork preparation with few ingredients and only a little more effort. If the bacon is room temperature, it will stick to itself as you overlap each piece and wrap the tenderloin. I do this with beef tenderloin as well. The smoky flavour and fat of the centre-cut bacon both protects and bastes the lean meat as it roasts. I grill mine indirectly but you can roast it in an 350 degree Fahrenheit oven set on a rack in a sheet pan. When the bacon-wrapped tenderloin is done, sprinkle it with your finishing salt and carve into thick slices to enjoy the benefit of the bacon crust.

Finally, while you are cooking dinner at home, think about each meal in simple terms: a main (usually an animal protein, or a bean or hearty vegetable dish), a green or other non-starchy vegetable, and a starch. That menu combination is easy enough to prepare and still very satisfying. During this time of uncertainty, ease and comfort are equally important. If you are making a stew or a pot of gumbo that has vegetables and protein in it, all you need to add is a starch like rice or fresh, hot cornbread.

And enjoy the cooking. A friend of mine at Traeger Wood Fired Grills sent an email this week and reminded me that “good food equals good mood.” Pass it along!",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/what---s-for-dinner--2020-04-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/what---s-for-dinner--what---s-for-dinner-.html
176,03-4-20,"WC was won by India, obsession over one six should stop: Gambhir","Former India opener Gautam Gambhir on Thursday lashed out at those only celebrating MS Dhoni’s six to win the 2011 World Cup, saying it was won by the entire team and not just one hit. India lifted the World Cup on April 2 nine years ago.

“Dhoni finishes off in style. A magnificent strike into the crowd! India lift the World Cup after 28 years!” these were Ravi Shastri’s words after Dhoni led India to a win in the 2011 World Cup final at the Wankhede Stadium with a humongous six off Sri Lanka pacer Nuwan Kulasekara.

With that six, Dhoni had fulfilled the long-cherished dreams of batting legend Sachin Tendulkar, who had all the batting records to his name in international cricket except his hands at the World Cup trophy. The Master Blaster had waited 22 years to lift the trophy and on April 2, 2011, his dream was finally fulfilled.

ESPNCricinfo, therefore, tweeted “the shot that sent millions of Indians into jubilation” with a photo of the moment.

Gambhir, in his reply, said: “Just a reminder @ESPNcricinfo: #worldcup2011 was won by entire India, entire Indian team & all support staff. High time you hit your obsession for a SIX.”

The stylish left-hander had scored 97 while Dhoni, who had promoted himself to No 4, smashed an unbeaten 91 as India won by six wickets.

“A World Cup won by Indians, for India & with India!” Gambhir later tweeted.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/wc-was-won-by-india--obsession-over-one-six-should-stop--gambhir.html
177,03-4-20,Vaughan calls for five-week IPL in Sept,"Former England captain Michael Vaughan feels a shortened five-week Indian Premier League leading up to the ICC World T20 in October and November could be a feasible solution if the current situation, in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, is brought under control by then.

While IPL has been postponed till April 15, there is very little chance of a shortened tournament in May as it might take months for normalcy to return.

“Here’s a thought .. The IPL is played for the 5 weeks leading up to the T20 World Cup in Oz .. All players use it as the great warm up for the WC .. Then the WC happens .. So important for the game that the IPL takes place but also the WC,” Vaughan tweeted.

However if one goes by Vaughan’s suggestion, it would mean that he is expecting IPL in the September window in the lead upto the World T20 which begins in Australia on October 18.

In September, India are supposed to play Asia Cup in the UAE which is going to be hosted by the Pakistan Cricket Board. After the Asia Cup, England are supposed to come to India to play three ODIs and three T20Is.

“September is the time when there is monsoon in India. Mumbai will be under water, there could be steady rain in Chennai. It is a decision that can’t be taken that lightly,” a senior BCCI official said.

There is a suggestion to do away with the ICC World T20 in October-November and hand that slot to the BCCI for conducting of IPL but sources in ICC as well as BCCI feels that it’s too premature to comment at the moment.

“You don’t know the situation tomorrow. Let there be a sign that the curve is flattening and normalcy can return. That’s when you start discussing options,” the BCCI source said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/vaughan-calls-for-five-week-ipl-in-sept.html
178,03-4-20,Umar Akmal needs to show commitment to be a regular in Pak team: Misbah,"Pakistan head coach and chief selector Misbah-ul-Haq has advised Umar Akmal to change his attitude and said the senior batsman needs to show commitment towards the game to become a regular member of the national team.

Misbah said while there was no doubt about Umar’s potential and talent as a batsman but he needs to reassess his priorities as a professional cricketer.

“If Umar thinks he can play in the same mode as he is today, it will be difficult for him. He needs to show total commitment and focus to become a regular member of the side,” he told reporters via video conference.

Umar, 29, earlier this week submitted his reply to a show cause notice issued to him by the Pakistan Cricket Board for breaching clauses of the Anti-Corruption code which pertains to not reporting an approach to spot fix during the Pakistan Super League 5 in February.

The PCB Security and Vigilance wing suspended Umar on the first day of the PSL on February 20 for beaching the Anti-Corruption Code and last month issued him a show cause notice. Umar apparently submitted his reply by the deadline of March 31 and had reportedly admitted he made a mistake by not reporting the approach.

Misbah made it clear that Umar could still give some years to Pakistan cricket but for that he would need to show more commitment and discipline.

“He also has to work very hard on his fitness and show everyone he is very much interested in playing for a long time for Pakistan,” Misbah said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/umar-akmal-needs-to-show-commitment-to-be-a-regular-in-pak-team--misbah.html

Biles, who turned 23 last month, told the Today show on US Olympic telecaster NBC that she expects coaches will have her in top condition, but getting her mind in top shape in July a year later than planned will be difficult.

“Physically I have no doubt that my coaches will get me back in shape,” Biles said. “But mentally going another year, I think that’s what’s going to take a toll on me and all of us, most of the athletes.

“So we have to stay in shape mentally as much as physically, and that will play a big factor moving forward, listening to your body and your mind.”

Biles told the Wall Street Journal she was planning to retire after the Tokyo Olympics this year and is playing next year’s Games “by ear.”

180,03-4-20,NRAI under pressure to cancel New Delhi WC,"Pressure is building up on the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) to call off the upcoming shooting World Cup in New Delhi after the cancellation of the Munich edition owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Delhi World Cup, originally scheduled to be held from March 15-26, was postponed barely four days before the start of the event.

It was then decided to hold the tournament in two parts — Rifle and Pistol competitions from May 5-12, while Shotgun competitions from June 2-9.

However, with the Munich World Cup being cancelled, sources close to the NRAI said the sport’s apex body in India is also under pressure to follow suit, considering the uncertainty arising out of the unprecedented health crisis.

“There is pressure, especially after the cancellation in Munich, which was to be held after Delhi. Given that lockdowns are being enforced not just in India, how will the shooters prepare for an event like a World Cup now,” a source said.

“Going by the views of many associated with the sport in India, the writing is on the wall and the NRAI would do well to announce it now rather than doing it much later,” another source added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/nrai-under-pressure-to-cancel-new-delhi-wc.html

“With every crisis comes an opportunity,” Rummenigge noted in Bayern’s own club magazine. “For a long time we have seen unhealthy amounts of money paid in wages and transfer fees. The coronavirus and the crisis it is causing will at least put an end to this idea of ‘always more, everything more expensive and quicker than before’.”

He added: “Supply and demand will regulate the market and help establish a new equilibrium”.

The reigning German champions are one of the world’s richest clubs although they have been reluctant to splash out on the kind of transfer fees paid by other top sides in Europe.

Their record transfer fee is the 80 million euros ($87.3m) spent on France defender Lucas Hernandez from Atletico Madrid last year, some way short of the world record 222 million euros paid by Paris Saint-Germain to Barcelona for Neymar in 2017.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/corona-crisis-to-end----unhealthy----spending-in-football.html
182,03-4-20,IPL can surely wait as life is more important now: Suresh Raina,"The IPL can wait till millions of lives, which are in line due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic are saved, said veteran India batsman Suresh Raina.

Raina has already done his bit in this fight against the deadly virus by donating Rs 52 lakh, one of the highest donations among elite sportsperson.

While spreading awareness on the importance of staying home during the ongoing 21-day lockdown in the country through social media, the 33-year-old is trying to be the perfect homemaker as his wife recovers from the birth of their second child, son Rio, last week.

In the normal circumstances, Raina, who last played for India in 2018, would be playing in the IPL but instead he is enjoying cooking for his family as well as the domestic help in the house.

Ask him about the World Cup triumph nine years ago, he remembers the minutest of details that helped India lift the coveted trophy after 28 years. Ask him about the IPL, which has been postponed to April 15 but is unlikely to take place in the near future, Raina says ""it is all about life"" at the moment.

""Life is most important at this point of time. IPL can surely wait. We all need to follow the government guidelines on lockdown else we all face the consequences. When life gets better, we can think about the IPL. So many people are dying at the moment, we need to save lives,"" Raina told PTI.

Raina was always a ""family man"" but says the current crisis has shown why ""we need to appreciate life much more more than we do"".

""I am relaxing in the lockdown, cooking and spending time with the kids. There is so much more to life than cricket, moments like these make you realise that. With this lockdown, people should realise the importance of being down to earth.

""At this time, three meals a day matter much more than the size of your house and car, what you wear doesn't matter. What you and your workers in the house are doing is the same. You are eating and feeding them at the same time.

""I am used to cooking since my hostel days, so I enjoy doing that. Wife (who gave birth to a boy last week) and kid are still recovering, so happy to contribute with the household work.""

Raina, whose last competitive game was the IPL final last year, was busy preparing for the 2020 edition in Chennai before the nationwide lockdown was announced. The tournament was also supposed to be M S Dhoni's comeback event.

""It was a nice camp. I was there for two months but then this happened. Got to spend some time with Dhoni. He was batting so well in the nets, he had the hunger of a younsgter. In one session, he batted for three hours at a stretch,"" recalled Raina.

Talk to Raina about the 2011 World Cup, he surprises you with his razor sharp memory.

""Every year, we celebrate. Like the way we celebrate Holi and diwali,"" said Raina.

For someone who also part of India's 2015 World Cup squad, the southpaw said the team atmosphere in 2011 was something he never experienced again. Three out of the four opportunities he got in the tournament came in the knock-outs. His unbeaten 34 and 36 against Australia and Pakistan in the quarterfinal and semifinal, respectively, helped his team make the final.

""Whatever decision we were taking, it was all going in our favour. Zaheer bhai led the bowling attack. Everyone was talking about our strong batting line up but I would say he was the Sachin Tendulkar of the bowling department, getting us the breakthrough every time. Then the biggest contribution came from Yuvraj, who took wickets and finished games,"" Raina fondly recollected.

India were chasing 275 in the all important final at Wankhede but Raina said pressure was much more in the previous game against Pakistan at Mohali, where Prime Ministers of both countries turned up to add to the spectacle.

Wahab Riaz's sensational spell of reverse swing had reduced India to 187 for 5 but Raina batted with the tail to take the team to 260, which proved to be enough.

""There was so much happening on the outside. The we had the collapse with Wahab bowling brilliantly but even then we remained calm and helped each other.""

Even in the final, India were in a spot of bother at 31 for two with Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tenduklar back in the hut. However, Raina said not for once that the team felt it could lose the game.

""Even though Sri Lanka put up a challenging total, everyone was calm in the dressing room. Someone was in the shower, someone was taking ice bath, someone was eating, yet everyone was thinking about the trophy, everyone in their zone and no one was talking to each other.

""There was just one goal and that was to win the trophy. There was pin drop silence when Sachin paaji got out but we remained calm. You should have seen the way Gautam Gambhir (who made 97) entered the field after Sehwag's dismissal. He was so confident

""Seeing his body language, I thought he would win us the World Cup. Dhoni (who made 91) came ahead of an in-form Yuvraj, that was a big call but Dhoni told Gary Kirsten (coach) that he could play Muralitharan well so he went in.

""I still remember everything so vividly,"" he concluded.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ipl-can-surely-wait-as-life-is-more-important-now--suresh-raina-2020-04-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ipl-can-surely-wait-as-life-is-more-important-now--suresh-raina.html
183,03-4-20,"Common staggered lockdown exit, PM tells CMs","Modi asks States to brainstorm phase-wise normalcy plan; but testing, tracing, isolation, quarantine should remain focus areas

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday asked the States to prepare a common exit strategy for phase-wise return of normalcy after the lockdown period suggesting that “testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine” should remain “focus areas in next few weeks”.

In a video interaction with Chief Ministers to discuss ways to contain Covid-19, Modi asked States not to abruptly end lockdown from April 15, but to do it in a phase-wise manner as per the situation in respective States. He also asked CMs to reach out to community leaders and social welfare organisations, adopt community-approach. He asked the States to brainstorm and send suggestions for the exit strategy.

The Prime Minister said considering that this is the time to harvest crops, the Government has given some relaxation from lockdown but it is necessary to continuously monitor and maintain social distancing as much as possible.

The Prime Minister thanked the States for supporting the decision of lockdown due to which India has achieved some success in limiting the spread of COVID-19. He praised all the States saying they worked together as a team to check the spread of the virus. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee skipped the event and was represented by the State Chief Secretary.

“Samuhikta hamari shakti hai”, the PM told Chief Ministers saying along with the front-line health workers, paramedical staff, NCC, NSS, NGOs and public spirited people should make a force together to win the battle against coronavirus which he hinted is not going to end soon.

He forewarned that the global situation remained far from satisfactory and informed about speculation of a possible second wave of spread of the virus in some countries. Modi sought all States to maintain “peace and harmony” in their respective areas and appealed to all men of “faith and religion” to be together and follow the norm of “social distancing” to shut the virus out.

“Priority should be to break the chain of transmission”, Modi told the CMs.

The Prime Minister said in the next few weeks, testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine should remain focus areas. He highlighted the necessity of maintaining the supply of essential medical products, availability of raw material for the manufacture of medicines and medical equipment.

This was for the second time the Prime Minister held a video conference with the Chief Ministers after the spread of coronavirus, and the first after the 21-day lockdown came into force. On March 20 also he had interacted with the CMs. The lockdown was enforced on March 24.

The Chief Ministers said they have enhanced surveillance, stepped up contact tracing, set up dedicated Covid19 hospitals, ICUs, relief and food camps for migrant workers and provided psychological support system to those affected by the virus.

The Chief Ministers also mentioned their efforts of identifying and quarantining suspect cases arising from Nizamuddin Markaz and containing community transmission.

The Prime Minister outlined that the common goal for the country is to ensure minimum loss of life.

Highlighting the necessity of maintaining supply of essential medical products, availability of raw material for manufacture of medicines and medical equipment, Modi said it is necessary to ensure availability of separate, dedicated hospital facilities for COVID-19 patients.

Underscoring the importance of coordinated action and the need to avoid overlaps in efforts of stakeholders, the Prime Minister talked about the need of setting up crisis management groups at district level and appointment of District Surveillance Officers.

The Prime Minister said data must be taken from the accredited labs for testing —this will ensure congruence in data of district, State and Centre. He said it is necessary to ensure staggered release of funds to the beneficiaries under PM Garib Kalyan Yojana to avoid crowding at banks.

He asked States to think of other platforms for procuring grains apart from APMC, and explore the possibility of creating pooling platforms for rural areas, like that in ride sharing apps, which can be used for this purpose.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah who was present along with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh talked about the need to implement lockdown more strictly in some States and the importance of effective district level implementation of the guidelines issued by the Centre.

The Union Health Secretary apprised the dignitaries of the rise in number of cases in India, spread of cases from Nizamuddin Markaz, preparations to tackle medical cases arising out of further spread of the virus and need to break transmission chain in the districts with high number of confirmed cases.

The Defence Minister, the Health Minister, the Principal Secretary, the Cabinet Secretary, the Home Secretary and the DG ICMR also participated in the interaction. Along with the Chief Ministers, the Health Minister, the Chief Secretary, the Home Secretary and the Health Secretary of the respective States also attended the video conference.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/common-staggered-lockdown-exit--pm-tells-cms-2020-04-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/common-staggered-lockdown-exit--pm-tells-cms.html

The containment measures to break the cycle of transmission and clinical management of those affected would require large human resources.”

The Ministry said that enhanced deployment of human resources is required in clinical management, surveillance, psycho-social care, management of quarantine after, isolation facilities, logistics and supply chain.

It said that human resources pooled from various sources will be assigned for such roles. “Such identified HR needs to be trained online using online training programmes developed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW),” it stated.

Each State has been directed to identify and designate a nodal officer for training. The officer will coordinate all training activities in the State.

For COVID-19 management, the district administration will also pool-in the requisite human resources.

“Such pooled human resources would stay in the containment zone till the containment operations are over,” the Minister further added in the document.

The advisory added, “For isolation areas, in addition to training all hospital staff, dentists and AYUSH practitioners available should also be trained. Retired doctors and other healthcare professionals should be identified to work in non-Covid areas.”

It stated quarantine facilities are meant to house asymptomatic cases and the number identified and trained manpower should be equal to the number of COVID-19 warriors.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/govt-zeroes-in-on-42-hotspots-2020-04-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/govt-zeroes-in-on-42-hotspots.html

Regarding resumption of domestic flights, Puri said he is optimistic that the lockdown would not be extended.

Puri also said Indians who are stranded in several foreign countries will have to wait till April 15 to return to India, suggesting that flights taking foreign nationals to their countries from India will not bring back any passengers. India has allowed countries like the US, the UK and Germany to conduct special flights during the lockdown to take their citizens back home. Air India has also extended its services to countries such as Germany, the UK and France to facilitate return of their citizens.

International flights to India were banned from March 23 and domestic flights were also suspended from March 25 after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day lockdown for India until April 14. As per a DGCA order, the Government had barred all scheduled international passenger aircraft to depart for India after 5.30 am of March 22 and had given them travel time of 20 hours.

The fifth corona positive patient succumbed to the deadly virus on the day the State recorded another COVID-19 case from Hoshiarpur. With this, the total positive cases have reached 47, out of which 41 are active cases while one patient has recovered.

""Singh died of sudden cardiac arrest at Amritsar's Government Medical College during the ambrosial moments of Amrit Vela on Thursday…His risk factor increased due to his bronchial asthma. He had tested positive for Covid-19,"" tweeted the State Special Chief Secretary, Punjab Disaster Management (COVID-19), KBS Sidhu, while confirming the news of Singh's death.

The Health Department officials maintained that he was put on ventilator late on Wednesday after his condition worsened.

The ""Gurbani"" exponent, who was awarded the Padma Shri in 2009, had recently returned from abroad and was admitted to Guru Nanak Dev Hospital after he complained of breathlessness and dizziness on March 30.

Meanwhile, police have sealed the area around Singh's residence to check the spread of the infection.

The GMC test reports have cleared that six out of nine persons - family and members of a jatha, the immediate contacts of Singh have tested negative for coronavirus. However, they would be kept under observation.

The Administration has also sealed Shaheed Udham Singh Nagar and Tej chowk areas in Sultanwind area where Khalsa resided. The Health Department has also home quarantined four doctors who attended to Khalsa while reports were awaited.

On his return, Singh had attended many religious events, including accompanying renowned table maestro Zakir Hussain to Golden Temple on February 29, performing a kirtan at a private house at Chandigarh's Sector 27 on March 19, besides a large religious gathering in Delhi, and some other places.

Further details regarding Singh's travel history and events that he was part of are being ascertained by the authorities.

Later, the villagers refused to carry out the last rites at common crematorium, and later the cremation was held at shamlat land.

Taking strong notice of not allowing the mortal remains of Singh to be consigned to flames at the cremation ground at Verka, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday said the mortal remains of the renowned Gurmat Sangeet exponent had been insulted by this act.

Sukhbir asked Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to intervene and ensure such incidents were not allowed to occur in the State. ""Such acts are against the spirit of humanity and communal brotherhood and have the capacity to spiral out of control and result in serious consequences for society. Those responsible for locking the Verka cremation ground must be taken to task and proceeded against,"" he demanded.

He said a clear directive should also be issued by the Government that no COVID-19 victim will be discriminated and denied last rites in this manner.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/golden-temple-ex-hazuri-raagi-dies-of-covid.html

A few days ago also when doctors in Delhi were threatened by landlords they had sought similar protection from the Home Minister.

Two women doctors were injured in Indore when a 5-member team of health officials was pelted with stones in Taatpatti Bakhal area on Wednesday while they were trying to trace a person who had come into contact with a COVID-19 patient, police said.

A case has been registered and seven people were arrested, police said, as Indore collector Manish Singh warned that the district administration will not tolerate such incidents and misbehaviour.

Relatives of a 49-year-old coronavirus patient who died at a Government hospital in Hyderabad assaulted the duty doctor and the staff alleging negligence, police said.

Telangana Director General of Police M Mahendar Reddy asserted that strong action will be taken against the culprits and necessary measures will be put in place to provide protection to all the doctors and paramedics treating COVID-19 patients.

In Bihar, police and medical personnel were attacked by locals in Munger town when they visited a locality to collect samples from people suspected to have contracted coronavirus.

Stones were thrown at the quick response team (QRT), comprising policemen and an ambulance carrying medical personnel, when they visited the Hazratganj locality late on Wednesday, said the SHO of Qasim Bazar police station Shailesh Kumar.

The stone-pelting left a police jeep badly damaged and the situation was brought under control by use of force, he added.

Female social workers in Bengaluru and a man in Mumbai were gheraoed and assaulted in separate incidents linked to the survey of people who attended the recent Nizamuddin Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi, the biggest COVID-19 hotspot in India, said police officials from the two cities.

According to reports from State capitals, there also have been cases of policemen being attacked while trying to enforce the 21-day lockdown which entered the ninth day on Thursday and while keeping surveillance on people under home quarantine.

In Bengaluru, community health workers engaged in conducting coronavirus survey in certain minority dominated areas were allegedly manhandled on Thursday, prompting the Karnataka Government to issue a stern warning to the offenders.

The workers under the aegis of Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) along with health officials were conducting a door-to-door survey in the minority dominated areas in view of the virus spreading through those who returned to Karnataka after attending the Tablighi event.

A visibly upset Asha worker, Krishnaveni in a video message which has gone viral, alleged that a group of health workers who had gone to Hegde Nagar in the city were 'gheraoed' by some residents, their mobile phones snatched and all of them abused.

""They snatched our bags and mobile phones. They did not let us make a phone call. I have been working for the past five years but never ever faced a situation like this,"" she said.

Condemning the incident, Health Minister B Sriramulu shared the video on his Twitter handle and said, ""The doctors, nurses and health workers who toil day and night are like Gods. Respect them. Will not sit idle if they are attacked? Beware!""

In Maharashtra, a man was assaulted by a group in Solapur district for allegedly informing a village official about those who attended the Tablighi gathering in Delhi.

The 56-year-old man had informed the 'gramsevak' of Pimpri village about seven locals who attended the Tablighi meet and also insisted that they be tested for coronavirus, police said.

In Uttar Pradesh, jawan Shailendra along with three others stormed into the house in Alipur village of one Vinay Yadav, who had included his name and that of his family in the list of people who had returned from Kolkata recently.

As the jawan started assaulting Yadav, his brother Dinesh and sister-in law Sandhya rushed to his rescue. Shailendra opened fire killing the 36-year-old Sandhya on the spot, police said. In Delhi, Resident Doctors Association of AIIMS, wrote a letter to the Home Minister, over the attacks on doctors in Hyderabad and other places.

The RDA has demanded filing of criminal cases against the perpetrators according to the law besides deployment of CRPF to ensure doctors are able to work safely.

Further, the doctors have also sought provision of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) to all health care providers.

The Association also sought assurance from the Home Minister/Chief Minister on this issue and address the issue on an emergency basis and revert back at the earliest.

""We appreciate your efforts to allay the anxiety when approached on the issue of ostracisation of doctors. We would like to bring to your kind notice the recent assault on doctors treating COVID-19 patients at Gandhi Hospital, Hyderabad on Thursday. It is extremely disheartening to know that such events continue unabated even when this country is going through this massive. Such actions would destroy the morale of frontline healthcare workersdeployed in suchtesting situation,"" reads the letter of the RDA, AIIMS.

The president of Telangana junior doctors association (T-JUDA) Dr KUN Vishnu has written a letter regarding the same with these demands including registration of cases against the culprits, deployment of CRPF and provision of PPE.

""Kindly address the issue. This would be appropriate to reconsider the Health Services Personnel and Clinical Establishment (Prohibition of Violence and Damage to Property Bill, 2019 as demanded previously by us and other medical bodies in the country,"" added the letter.

Shah has reiterated about the need to implement lockdown measures more strictly in some states and the importance of effective district level implementation of guidelines issued by the Centre.

Special Judge Munish Markan extended Singh's custody after the Delhi Police said that he was required to be further confronted with three other accused persons -- Javed Iqbal, Syed Naveed Mushtaq and Imran Shafi Mir -- arrested in the case to unearth their respective roles.

The court also extended the custody of Iqbal, Mushtaq and Mir till April 10 on a plea by the police.

The Delhi Police said that the accused were required to be interrogated further to identify the other persons involved.

The custody was required to ascertain the identity of other handlers, the police told the court.

The police said that further interrogation was required to unearth the larger conspiracy and role of the accused, to trace the details of financial transactions, verify and trace other offenders.

Defence advocate Prashant Prakash opposed remand on the ground that there were no fresh and adequate reasons for the remand demanded.

He further said that the grounds of remand were the same as the previous ones, hence police could not be allowed to interrogate the accused further.

The court directed the police to conduct Singh's medical examination after every 48 hours.

Singh was suspended from the Jammu and Kashmir Police in January this year.

The Delhi Police's Special Cell had brought Singh to the national capital from Hira Nagar Jail in Jammu and Kashmir.

Earlier, the court had sent Syed Naveed Mushtaq and others to police custody till April 3 after police said that he and other co-accused were planning to execute terror attacks in Delhi and other parts of the country and targeted killings of protected persons.

The police said that Mushtaq, the commander of Shopian district of Hizbul Mujahideen, used to chat with other co-accused and militants through various internet platforms, including darknet chat.

Mushtaq, along with other militants of Hizbul Mujahideen, were planning to execute a terror attack in Delhi and other parts of the country and targeted killings of protected persons, police told the court.

195,03-4-20,"Relief to NDTV, SC quashes I-T notice","In a relief to NDTV Ltd, the Supreme Court Friday quashed the notice of the Income Tax department seeking to re-assess the income of the media house for financial year 2007-08.

A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Deepak Gupta set aside the August 10, 2017 order of the Delhi High Court which had dismissed the petition of NDTV Ltd against the I-T re-assessment notice.

“We, accordingly, allow the appeal by holding that the notice issued to the assessee (NDTV) shows sufficient reasons to believe on the part of the assessing officer to re-open the assessment but since the revenue has failed to show non-disclosure of facts the notice having been issued after a period of 4 years is required to be quashed,” the bench said.

The I-T department had issued re-assessment notice in March 2015 to the media group after noting that Rs 642 crore has allegedly not been computed for the tax assessment purposes of NDTV for financial year 2007-2008.

It was alleged that media group's UK based subsidiary, NDTV Network PLC, had issued a step-up coupon bonds for amount of USD 100 million in July 2007, through a bank of New York for a period of five years.

Without going into the merits of the case, the top court framed three questions related to the dispute for its consideration which included whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, it can be said that the revenue had a valid reason to believe that undisclosed income had escaped assessment.

It also framed questions on whether the assessee did not disclose fully and truly all material facts during the course of original assessment which led to the finalisation of assessment order and undisclosed income escaping detection.

While answering one of the issues framed, the bench said, “At the stage of issuance of notice, the assessing officer is to only form a prima facie view. In our opinion the material disclosed in assessment proceedings for subsequent years was sufficient to form such a view. We accordingly hold that there were reasons to believe that income had escaped assessment in this case”.

Dealing with the issue of alleged disclosure of material facts by NDTV, the bench said though the I-T department had argued before it that the media group has suppressed the facts, the revenue department had taken an opposite stand before the high court.

“We are clearly of the view that the revenue, in view of its counter-affidavit before the High Court that it was not relying upon the non-disclosure of facts by the assessee, could not have been permitted to orally urge the same,” the bench said.

It said, “Even otherwise we find that the assessee had fully and truly disclosed all material facts necessary for its assessment and, therefore, the revenue cannot take benefit of the extended period of limitation of 16 years”.

The bench noted the proviso two of section 147 of the I-T Act says that limitation period would be 16 years if the revenue is derived from a foreign entity.

It said that if the revenue is to rely upon the second proviso and wanted to urge that limitation of 16 years would apply, then in our opinion in the notice or at least in the reasons in support of the notice, the assessee should have been put to notice that the revenue relies upon the second proviso.

“The assessee could not be taken by surprise at the stage of rejection of its objections or at the stage of proceedings before the High Court that the notice is to be treated as a notice invoking provisions of the second proviso of Section 147 of the Act,” the bench said.

The top court made it clear that it has not expressed any opinion on whether the Income Tax department could take benefit of the second proviso in the facts of the case.

“Therefore, the revenue may issue fresh notice taking benefit of the second proviso if otherwise permissible under law,” the bench said, adding that both the parties shall be at liberty to raise all contentions with regard to the validity of such notice.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/relief-to-ndtv--sc-quashes-i-t-notice-2020-04-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/relief-to-ndtv--sc-quashes-i-t-notice.html

202,03-4-20,"France reports 471 more coronavirus hospital deaths, toll tops 4,500","France reported 471 more deaths in hospital from COVID-19 on Thursday, bringing the country's official toll from the coronavirus epidemic to 4,503.

The French figures include only those who died in hospital and not those who died at home or in old people's homes.

However top health official Jerome Salomon told reporters for the first time that an initial count had shown 884 people had died in old people's homes since the epidemic began.

If combined with the hospital toll, this would mean at least 5,387 people have died from COVID-19 in France since the outbreak began.

The daily death toll from hospitals was slightly down from the 509 deaths reported on Wednesday.

Some 26,000 people are hospitalised in France with 6,399 in intensive care, 382 more than the day earlier but an increase that has also slowed over this week.

France has been in lockdown since March 17 in a bid to slow the spread of the epidemic, with only essential trips allowed outside that have to be justified with a signed piece of paper.

Asked to comment on the slightly less grim data and also reports from some regional hospitals that they were under less pressure, Salomon said it was too early to say if the confinement was having an effect.

""I would be very careful, there is an incubation phase of a week and delay in severe cases appearing,"" he said.

""The evaluation of the impact of the confinement can take place at the end of the week or over the weekend. We should start to have an impact on admissions to hospital and intensive care in particular.""

Large's son, Ryan McGinnis, shared the news on Facebook, saying his father had been suffering with heart failure and contracted the virus in hospital.

It is with great sadness that Mum and I need to announce that my dad passed away in the early hours of this morning. He had been suffering with heart failure and unfortunately, whilst in hospital, contracted the coronavirus, which his heart was sadly not strong enough to fight.

Dad had fought bravely for so long. Due to this horrible disease we had been unable to visit him at the hospital but all of the family and close friends spoke to him every day, the post read.

The Glasgow-born artiste, whose real name was Edward McGinnis, found fame alongside comedian Syd Little in the 1970s and 80s.

The duo performed initially in pubs and clubs in the north-west of England and gained recognition in the mainstream after appearing on the ITV talent show Opportunity Knocks . Post the show they also landed their own series, The Little and Large Telly show, in 1976. The show moved to BBC in 1978 and aired on the network for over 13 years.

Many from the entertainment industry took to social media to pay tributes to the comedy icon.

Eddie Large died. Midnight Matinee Great Yarmouth 1978. They finished part one. I'd never heard laughter like it. Rude, raucous and rollicking.Dunno how they did it, but Eddies energy and electricity and impressions and props and improv were hugely impressive. R.I.P, Lenny Henry posted on Twitter.

Jason Manford tweeted, So sorry to hearabout Eddie Large passing away. Came to every comedy and musical show I did whenever I hit Bristol and was always around for a chat about comedy and Man City afterwards. Such a gentle, funny man. RIP Eddie.

206,03-4-20,50 medics +ve as warriors bear brunt of corona,"Overworked medical professionals and paramedics across the country are bearing the brunt of Covid-19 as they wage frontline battle against the deadly virus.

According to sources in the Government, around 50 members of medical staff, including doctors, nurse and paramedics, across the country have tested positive for coronavirus.

Some had contracted the virus while treating the patients, a few of them had travelled abroad where they got the disease.

“The infected medical staff have been isolated and getting requisite treatment,” said the sources while raising concern that, “If the doctors are going to fall sick, the entire effort of preventing spreading of COVID-19 will fail in the country.”

On Thursday, a resident doctor from AIIMS, Delhi tested positive for the disease, said sources in the hospital.

Though the source of his infection is not yet known, the doctor does not have any foreign travel history. The medic from the Physiology Department is the seventh doctor in Delhi to get COVID-19.

Just a day ago, two resident doctors of Safdarjung Hospital in the national Capital tested positive for COVID-19.

One of them, who is part of the team treating COVID-19 patients at the hospital, is believed to have contracted the disease during the course of duty. The female resident doctor, a third-year post-graduate student of the biochemistry department, who has tested positive for the novel coronavirus, had recently travelled abroad.

Doctors at Safdarjung Hospital also questioned the Government’s move to set up the Covid-19 ward within the premises of the hospital itself.

“Other patients are also coming at the emergency, leaving them exposed to those having Covid-19,” a doctors said on the condition of anonymity.

In Jammu & Kashmir, two doctors have been put under home quarantine.

It adds to the worries when healthcare professionals including doctors catch the virus while performing their duties, said Dr GS Grewal, former Punjab Medical Council President.

In Uttar Pradesh’s Lucknow too, a 25-year-old junior resident doctor tested positive for Covid-19. In Rajasthan, too, a doctor at a private hospital tested positive for the virus. In Kerala, 25 doctors were quarantined after one of their colleagues tested positive.

The Covid-19 is showing no sign of decline, posing an unprecedented medical challenge for the health workers - that of keeping the patients infection free - and struggling with traditionally and limited personnel protection equipments such as masks, PPEs, sanitisers and gloves.

There has been numerous complaints of the shortage as well the poor quality of the medical gear being made available to the doctors in some States.

A doctor said that personal protection equipment (PPE) was indispensable when isolation wards are activated with COVID-19 positive cases.

“We need to have double protection all over the body. Hands should have double gloves and eyes with goggles. “A protective shield is must to cover the portion between neck and shoulder which is available with PPE. We need at least five PPEs a day at every isolation ward,” he said.

There have been reports of doctors and health workers in Kolkata being forced to use raincoats in the absence of protective gowns, gloves. Doctors from across the country had a few days ago had taken to social media to highlight the lack of protective gear such as masks, overalls.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) had early last month highlighted the growing shortage of PPEs across the world, which it said endangered doctors and frontline healthcare workers. It has asked the Governments to step up the manufacturing of essential gear.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/50-medics--ve-as-warriors-bear-brunt-of-corona.html
207,03-4-20,"'It's horrible', says Indian-American doctor on COVID-19 frontlines","""It's horrible, horrible, people are dying in the emergency room (ER),"" said an Indian-American doctor on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic describing the grim conditions at hospitals here where patients are lined up in the hallways, freezer trucks are parked outside to store bodies and the ambulance crews received orders to not bring in cardiac arrest cases they couldn't revive.

On Thursday night as the confirmed coronavirus cases in New York City reached 51,809 and death toll 1,562, doctor Krishan Kumar told IANS that the hospitals were not prepared for the magnitude of the pandemic and were running out of beds and even basic supplies like masks.

Kumar, who works in the ERs of two hospitals, in the city's Brooklyn and Queens boroughs that are hard-hit by the pandemic, said: ""People are staying in the ER for hours together. Many times people are dying in the ER. There is no floor space upstairs (to move them). There are no beds open.""

The starkest reminder of the crisis is the order issued on Thursday by the city to Emergency Medical Service (EMS) ambulance staff to not bring in people suffering cardiac arrest if they cannot resuscitate them in the field.

""When the EMS brings the patients to the ER, they are either dying or nearly so there is no more CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) in the ER,"" Kumar said

For the younger doctors it is very traumatic to see this and they are deeply affected, he said.

A professor of emergency medicine in the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine, who was formerly the medical director of the Fire, Police, Emergency Medical Services Academy and trained the city's first-line responders, Kumar is bringing his expertise on health emergencies to city hospital ERs in the time of crisis.

He is also the president of the New York chapter of Association of American Physicians of Indian-Origin.

The number of infected people in the city, the epicentre of the pandemic in the US, has been increasing alarmingly; it was up by 4,373 since Wednesday.

The city has been scrambling to increase the bed capacity ahead of what Mayor Bill de Blasio called the ""demarcation"" or ""D-Day"" on Sunday when the numbers of people requiring hospitalisation is to shoot up even more dramatically.

Kumar, who has been an emergency doctor for 48 years, 36 of them in the New York City area, said the city was clearly not prepared for it.

Already ""people are lying in the hallways, we are lining people there"", he said.

Field hospitals are being set up on the lawns of the Central Park, in a convention centre and the Billie Jean Tennis Centre where the US Open is played.

In addition, a Navy hospital ship has been brought to the city and 20 hotels are to be taken over for hospital use.

In the Brooklyn hospital where Kumar works, he said: ""By next week we will have a tent outside the hospital (and) we will start seeing patients in the tent. It is coming to that stage now.""

Given the conditions inside the hospital, he said the tent would be ""much safer. Inside the hospital the same air is being re-circulated. The tent will have good air flow, make things much better"".

Hospitals lack personal protection equipment (PPE) and medical staff have held protests at some hospitals.

""There are not enough masks, and if you are given one, you have to keep it for a week,"" Kumar said.

Other vital equipments like respirators are in short supply, with Governor Andrew Cuomo demanding 30,000 of them from the federal government, which had only 20,000 in emergency stock.

Kumar blamed city and state leaders for the debacle.

""Ventilators are a basic necessity and they should have had spares - it's common sense, it is like when you drive a car, you keep a spare wheel; it is basic.

""You have 10 million people in the city (metro area). People are living on top of each other"" that could lead to a health crisis like this and because of this there should have been emergency preparedness by the Mayor or the Governor. They knew all this,"" he added.

The lessons of the last big tragedy to strike the city, the 9/11 terrorist attack, happened not long and ""they did not learn any lessons from that"", he said.

208,03-4-20,Non-smokers with COPD at higher risk of lung cancer: Study,"Researchers have found that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is linked to a heightened risk of lung cancer in people who have never smoked.

The findings from Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea, published in the journal Thorax, indicate that the risk is on a par with that of smokers without chronic lung disease.

COPD is an umbrella term for respiratory conditions that narrow the airways, such as bronchitis and emphysema. Smoking is the main risk factor for COPD, which itself is associated with a heightened risk of developing lung cancer.

According to the researchers, but up to 39 per cent of people who develop COPD have never smoked, and it's not clear what their risk of lung cancer is, because most of the studies looking at this have included too few participants.

For the findings, the researchers included 338,548 Korean men (146,996) and women (191,552) between the ages of 40 and 84, with no history of lung cancer, who had had at least one health check provided by National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) between 2002 and 2013.

Their health was tracked for an average of seven years, based on inpatient and outpatient treatment and prescriptions issued.During this monitoring period, 1834 participants developed lung cancer. In 290 cases, the person had COPD, but in 1544 cases, the person didn't.

Among current and former smokers, those without COPD were around twice as likely to develop lung cancer while those with COPD were six times as likely to do so, compared with people who had never smoked and didn't have COPD.But after taking account of potentially influential factors, among those who had never smoked, people with COPD were more than 2.5 times as likely to develop lung cancer as those without COPD, the data analysis showed.

What's more, the risk of lung cancer in those with COPD, but who had never smoked, was on a par with that of smokers without COPD, the study said.""Given that poor lung function in COPD is often a barrier to optimal lung cancer treatment due to increased risk of treatment-related morbidities, our study suggests that early detection of lung cancer in COPD patients may reduce the risk of treatment complications,"" the researchers said.

The researchers suggest their findings indicate that COPD is a strong independent risk factor for lung cancer.

""Future studies should evaluate whether COPD patients are candidates for lung cancer screening, irrespective of smoking status,"" they concluded.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/non-smokers-with-copd-at-higher-risk-of-lung-cancer--study-2020-04-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/non-smokers-with-copd-at-higher-risk-of-lung-cancer--study.html

213,03-4-20,Challenge is to get audiences back to theatres post lockdown period: Aditya Dhar,"Filmmaker Aditya Dhar believes that in the post-coronavirus world, it will be a challenge to ensure the survival of cinema houses as the audiences have got more used to the streaming services.

The coronavirus pandemic has put the industry under heavy stress as release of many movies have been delayed due to the closure of cinema houses, while production on various projects has been put on hold.

Aditya, who broke out in the Bollywood scene with his blockbuster debut film Uri: The Surgical Strike , said the nationwide lockdown has altered the viewing experience.

In the kind of situation we are in, I believe when everything gets normal it will be a little bit of a challenge to get the audience back to theatre because they are used to digital content, web series, films just by sitting at home, Aditya told PTI in an interview.

According to Aditya, the key to lure audiences back in to the cinema halls would be ""big event films"".

The best way is to make big event films and that is the natural progression that is happening everywhere around the world, including the US and China. All the major markets are getting into big event films. It is high time we give Indian audience event films, which brings them to theatres.

While in the lockdown, Aditya has started prep work on his next Ashwatthama , which will feature Uri... actor Vicky Kaushal in the lead.

I was kind of prepared for isolation because I'm used to it. It is not something which is affecting me quite a lot. But it is very unfortunate, the reason why the isolation has happened. I am busy writing my next Ashwatthama' and it is going pretty well.

When things were not going right for me, writing was the only thing that kept my equilibrium right, it has always been a do-it thing when I feel sad or lonely or low, he said.

The filmmaker said writing has always been his saviour whenever thing didn't go his way.

In the last 10 to 12 years when things were not going my way, I was just writing scripts. I have a bank of ten to 12 scripts for web-series, films and short films. Right now all my focus is on my Ashwatthama'.

Aditya hopes that someone someday makes a film that will underline the heroic efforts of the medical fraternity during the coronavirus pandemic.

I hope the kind of situation we are in will inspire some writers to write more about things that are going to affect our children, our future and our next generation.

I am hoping everyone understands what the medical professionals are doing, like a story from their perspective, how they are fighting and trying to save lives. I hope we understand the value of these people, who are standing in front line to save all of us, he said.

The writer-director said he hopes the current scenario is an eye opener for everyone around the world.

This was something that was inevitable. Unfortunately it shouldn't have been this way. We need to get our act right and sort this out.

""This is not just restricted to a particular industry. It's a global pandemic and we all need to be responsible citizens and help the government and medical bodies to fight this battle and come out undefeated.

While working with him, I was surprised because he comes off as such a serious and brooding actor, but he was the opposite on the set of this love story.

Lee, during a live televised speech to 5.6 million Singaporeans, said that he was worried that unless ""we take further steps, things will gradually get worse or another big cluster may push things over the edge"".

""We have decided that instead of tightening incrementally over the next few weeks, we should make a decisive move now to pre-empt escalating infections,"" he said.

Singapore reported 65 new cases on Friday, taking the total number of cases to 1,114. So far, five persons have died of coronavirus with three of them in a week.

Singapore will apply these ""circuit breakers"" for one month in first instance, Lee said.

Restrictions on movements and gatherings of people will be tightened amid the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore.

""We will therefore impose significantly stricter measures. This is like a circuit breaker,"" the prime minister said.

Most workplaces, with the exception of essential services and key economic sectors, will be closed.

Food establishments, markets and supermarkets, clinics, hospitals, utilities, transport and key banking services will remain open.

""We also should not disrupt economic sectors that are strategic or form part of a global supply chain. People working in these industries can continue to go to work, with safe-distancing measures in place. But most other work premises must close,"" Lee said, adding that the move will ensure that most of Singapore's workforce stays at home and limits their physical interaction to as few people as possible.

In addition, Singapore will also move to full home-based learning in schools and institutes of higher learning (IHLs) from next Wednesday.

All pre-school and student care centres will also be closed but will provide limited services for children of parents who have to continue working and are unable to make alternative care arrangements.

Singaporeans should stay home as much as possible, avoid socialising with others outside of their households and only go out to do essential things, he said.

Gatherings should be confined to a household and Singaporeans should avoid visiting extended family members who do not live with them, especially if they are elderly or vulnerable, the prime minister added.

""The spirit of these measures is to get all of us to minimise physical contact. If we don't go out, if we avoid contact with others, then the virus won't be able to spread. It is as simple as that.

""We now think there are some cases out there in the community going undetected, though probably still not that many. We also now have evidence that an infected person can show no symptoms and yet still pass on the virus to others,"" he said.

Other measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 have been in effect which include the tightening of border restrictions to not allow short-term visitors to enter or transit through the country, limiting of gatherings outside school and work to a maximum of 10 people as well as the closure of all entertainment venues such as night clubs, discos, karaoke outlets, cinemas and theatres.

All religious services and congregations have also been suspended.

Stressing that the next few weeks will be ""pivotal"", Lee said the number of COVID-19 cases will likely to continue to increase over the next few days.

""But if we keep our efforts up, within a few weeks we should be able to bring the numbers down and get into a more sustainable position.

""It will be a long fight. But if any country can see this through, it is Singapore. We have the resources. We have the determination. We are united. By helping one another through this, we will prevail and emerge stronger,"" Lee assured.

224,03-4-20,Food shortage staring world in face,"The coronavirus outbreak could disrupt global food supply chains and send prices soaring. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO), there is a serious risk of food shortages globally in April and May due to large-scale lockdowns, shortage of agricultural labourers during harvest season and disruption in food supply chain due to measures taken by Governments to stem the spread of coronavirus.

India has enough stock to tide over the coronavirus outbreak while the Ministry of Agriculture has asked farmers to delay the harvest till April 20 due to the lockdown.

Expressing concerns in a joint statement, the WTO, FAO and WHO said uncertainty about food availability can spark a wave of export restrictions, creating a shortage in the global market. The FAO said disruptions to food supply could occur during April and May if authorities fail to manage the continuing coronavirus outbreak properly.

“As the world is witnessing a lockdown in most parts of it, the food supply chain has suffered a severe disruption. This is also aggravated by panic buying and hoarding of essentials, which has demonstrated the fragility of supply chains in many countries,” the FAO said.

The FAO said the world risks a “looming food crisis” unless measures are taken fast to protect the most vulnerable, keep global food supply chains alive and mitigate the pandemic’s impacts across the food system.

“Harvests have been good and staple crops remain in demand, but a shortage of field workers brought on by the pandemic and a move towards protectionism — tariffs and export bans — could lead to problems in the coming weeks. Food processors, who handle the vast majority of agricultural products, could also be prevented from processing the farm products,” it said.

Panic-buying by people has already demonstrated the fragility of supply chains as supermarket shelves have been emptied in many countries. If agriculture workers are legally unable to harvest crops, it could cause a lapse in food flow.

“As of now, disruptions are minimal as food supplies have been adequate. But price spikes are more likely for higher value products like meat and perishable commodities rather than for major staples which are still in adequate supply,” said the FAO.

Kazakhstan, for instance, according to a report from Bloomberg, has banned exports of wheat flour, of which it is one of the world’s biggest sources, as well as restrictions on buckwheat and vegetables including onions, carrots and potatoes.

Vietnam, the world’s third biggest rice exporter, has temporarily suspended rice export contracts. Russia, the world’s biggest wheat exporter, may also threaten to restrict exports, as it has done before, and the position of the US is in doubt given Donald Trump’s eagerness for a trade war in other commodities.

Australia, which is a net food exporter, is already facing difficulty keeping food on store shelves, as panic buying in the face of the pandemic has increased demand, social research house McCrindle said.

India already has a buffer stock of 30 lakh tonnes of sugar, which the Government is planning to raise to 40 lakh tonnes this fiscal. In the cases of pulses, the Ministry of Food and Consumer Affairs has been trying since December to offload 8.47 lakh tonnes from its buffer stock of pulses.

The UN Committee on World Food Security sounded an even stronger warning that “disruptions at borders and in supply chains may cause an echo in the food system with potentially disastrous effects”.

In another report the “World Economic Situation and Prospects: April 2020”, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), said the global economy could shrink by almost one per cent in 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the update, the COVID-19 pandemic could cause global Gross Domestic Product to shrink by 0.9 per cent in 2020, instead of growing 2.5 per cent as originally projected.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/food-shortage-staring-world-in-face-2020-04-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/food-shortage-staring-world-in-face.html
