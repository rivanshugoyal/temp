0,02-1-20,India's manufacturing sector activity rises in Dec; cos cautious on 2020 outlook,"The country's manufacturing sector activity improved in December driven by new orders that rose at the fastest pace since July as companies ramped up production and resumed hiring efforts, a monthly survey said on Thursday.

Notwithstanding the improvement in operating conditions during December, companies were cautious regarding the annual outlook of 2020 and this could have an impact on job creation and investment in the year, the survey said.

The IHS Markit India Manufacturing PMI rose from 51.2 in November to 52.7 in December, registering the ""joint-strongest"" improvement in 10 months.

""Factories benefited from a rebound in demand, and responded by scaling up production to the greatest extent since May. There were also renewed increases in input purchasing and employment during December,"" said Pollyanna de Lima, Principal Economist at IHS Markit.

As per the survey, new work orders witnessed marked improvement, with the pace of expansion picking up to the fastest since July.

Moreover, the uptick in total sales was supported by higher demand from overseas. New export orders expanded for the 26th month in a row, albeit modestly, the survey said.

This is the 29th consecutive month that the manufacturing PMI has remained above the 50-point mark. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.

Lima, however, said ""a note of caution is evident from the survey's measure of business confidence. The degree of optimism signalled at the end of 2019 was the weakest in just under three years, reflecting concerns over market conditions, which could restrict job creation and investment in the early part of 2020"".

According to the survey, production is expected to expand in the coming 12 months, but the degree of optimism weakened to a 34-month low.

On the inflation front, the overall rate of inflation reached a 13-month high.

""At the same time, price indicators showed accelerated rates of inflation for both input costs and output charges. The latter reflected a combination of improved pricing power, given the favourable demand environment, and efforts to protect margins from cost rises,"" Lima said.

At a meeting with some 13 Air India unions in Delhi, Puri also said that the government was trying to address the concerns of the employees regarding issues such as job protection post privatisation, a union representative said.

""The minister said that Air India has a debt of Rs 80,000 crore and no expert has solution to that. In this situation, privatisation is the only choice left for the government,"" one of the union representatives told PTI after the meeting, which lasted for an hour.

He also said that Puri sought cooperation from all airline unions in carrying out the disinvestment process of the national carrier.

Last week, a senior Air India official said the airline might have to go out of business in the manner similar to the now-defunct Jet Airways if a new investor does not come on board by June.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ai-needs-to-be-privatised--cooperation-of-employees-important--puri-2020-01-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/ai-needs-to-be-privatised--cooperation-of-employees-important--puri.html
2,02-1-20,India can explore USD 82 bn export potential in 20 products in China: Report,"India can explore an annual USD 82-billion export potential in twenty products, including electrical equipment and ferro alloys, in the world's second largest economy China, according to a report.

Indian exporters have a competitive advantage as far as these twenty goods are concerned.

Currently, India meets only 3.3 per cent or USD 2.7 billion of the total annual import demands of USD 82 billion for these 20 products in China.

India's exports of these 20 products are worth around USD 15 billion to the world, which is 4.5 per cent of the country's annual outward shipments.

These goods constituted about 17 per cent of India's exports to China in 2018, according to the report by MVIRDC World Trade Centre Mumbai.

India can substantially reduce its trade deficit with China, which stood at USD 53.56 billion in 2018-19, by enhancing its market share for these products in that country, the report added.

Electrical equipment, tobacco, iron and steel, ferro alloys, parts of aircraft, engines and other auto-components, benzene, frozen boneless bovine meat are some of the product segment out of the 20 in the list.

""In order to realise this untapped export potential, India and China must exchange trade delegation with members from these identified sectors. We must also create awareness on this opportunity among India's micro, small and medium enterprises producing these identified products,"" MVIRDC World Trade Centre Mumbai Senior Director Rupa Naik said.

Increasing India's market share for these products in China will add further momentum to the growing exports of India in this country, she added.

India's overall exports to China grew 5.39 per cent to USD 11.57 billion in April-November 2019, even as our total exports to the world declined 2 per cent during this period.

The country's overall trade deficit with China declined 5 per cent to USD 35.3 billion in the first eight months of the current financial year, compared to USD 37.3 billion in the year-ago period, the report added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/india-can-explore-usd-82-bn-export-potential-in-20-products-in-china--report.html
3,02-1-20,Dimitrov to ease his way back after injury-hit 2019,"Former world number three Grigor Dimitrov saw his ranking slump last year as he struggled with a shoulder injury, but the Bulgarian Thursday said he won't push himself too hard, too fast to return to the top of tennis.

The 28-year-old was laid low early in the season and was far from his best after he returned to action, although he did reach the US Open and Paris Masters semi-finals.

Dimitrov said 2019, where he failed to win a title, had been ""quite a journey"".

""It's going to be a year that I remember for the rest of my life,"" he said in Sydney ahead of the inaugural ATP Cup team event, his warm-up for the Australian Open Grand Slam.

""Yeah, the body checks out pretty good right now. I'm still monitoring a lot of my work, a lot that I'm going through.

""I kind of pace myself in the right way. I'm not in a rush, which is also a good thing."" The shoulder problem was Dimitrov's first major injury and he said he plans to limit the number of tournaments he plays, particularly early in the season.

""I'm not going to force myself to play too many tournaments early on and really look after the body. That's the number one thing,"" said Dimitrov, now ranked 20.

""Clearly I haven't competed for almost the past four months of the year, and so that itself brought a lot of doubts, and dropping a lot in the ranking and so on.

""But at the same time, I was able to kind of recover as quick as possible, and hopefully now I'm at a place that can only get better. I'm really going to focus on that."" He is not only playing for Bulgaria at the ATP Cup, but captaining the team, a new experience that he is relishing.

""It's challenging, no doubt about it,"" he said.

""It's always been a dream of mine to always be kind of on the other end, and I think to be a coach is never easy.

""I don't know if I'm going to be a good coach. I can only share my experience, my thoughts with the guys.""

4,02-1-20,Ish Sodhi returns to Royals as spin consultant,"Rajasthan Royals on Thursday appointed New Zealand leg-spinner Ish Sodhi as their spin consultant for the 2020 edition of the Indian Premier League.

The 27-year-old was part of the Royals squad in the 2018 and 2019 before being released ahead of last month's IPL auction.

As part of his new role with the franchise, Sodhi will be working closely with bowling coach Sairaj Bahutule and Chief Operating Officer Jake Lush McCrum.

Sodhi has represented Royals in eight IPL matches, taking nine wickets at an economy rate of 6.69.

""Having played for two seasons for the Royals, I have formed a great level of understanding with all the people involved with the franchise, and they have always been very supportive of me. Therefore, I did not have to think twice when this opportunity was offered to me by the Royals' management,"" said Sodhi in a statement.

""It is a fascinating opportunity for me, to be involved in the coaching staff at such a young age, while also supporting and learning about the operations of the business,"" said Sodhi, who has picked up 47 wickets in 40 T20 Internationals for New Zealand.

He has also played 17 Tests and 31 ODIs.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ish-sodhi-returns-to-royals-as-spin-consultant-2020-01-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ish-sodhi-returns-to-royals-as-spin-consultant.html
5,02-1-20,Mirabai Chanu ranked eighth in latest Olympic qualification rankings,"On course to seal a berth for the Tokyo Games, former world champion Mirabai Chanu maintained her eighth spot in the Olympic qualifiers ranking list released by the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) on Thursday.

In the race for Olympic qualification, the 25-year-old, who competes in the 49kg category, has gathered 2966.6406 ranking points till now.

To qualify for Tokyo, a weightlifter must compete in at least one event in each of the three periods of six months (spread over November 2018 to April 2020), at least six events overall and in at least one gold and silver level event.

""The ranking points are based on the number of events a lifter participates in and Mirabai has missed a few competitions, including the World Championship in 2018, due to her back injury,"" National coach Vijay Sharma told PTI.

""But being eighth now is not a problem as after the final rankings list is made in April and the best results will be taken into account,"" he added.

After recovering from a back injury, which marred her progress in 2018, Chanu has constantly improved her performance in 2019. She lifted 86kg in snatch and a personal best of 113kg in clean and jerk for a total of 199kg at the Asian Championships in April last year to miss the bronze medal by a whisker.

Her best performance came at the World championship in September, when the Manipuri breached the much anticipated 200kg mark by lifting her personal best in all three sections. In snatch, she lifted 87kg, followed by 114kg in clean and jerk for a total of 201kg.

However, Chanu ended the year on a bittersweet note as she won gold at the Qatar International Cup - an Olympic qualifying silver level event -- but her effort of 194kg was way below her personal best.

The latest qualifying rankings feature three Chinese weightlifters in the top five. Reigning World Champion and world record holder Hou Zhihui (4703.1982) heads the list while Jiang Huihua (4667.8878) and Zhang Rong (3837.8294) occupy the second and fourth spots respectively.

However, only one of the three Chinese lifters will compete at the Olympics as a nation can send no more than one athlete each per weight category.

Ri Song Gum of North Korea is placed third with 4209.4909 points.

The fifth, sixth and seventh spots are occupied by USA's Delacruz Jourdan Elizabeth (184kg), Indonesia's Aisah Windy Cantika (190kg) and Segura Ana Iris (188kg) of Colombia. All three of them alongside Rong (199kg) have personal bests lower than that of Chanu's (201kg).

In the men's 67kg category, Youth Olympics gold medallist Jeremy Lalrinnunga is placed 32nd with 2,310.9653 points.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mirabai-chanu-ranked-eighth-in-latest-olympic-qualification-rankings-2020-01-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mirabai-chanu-ranked-eighth-in-latest-olympic-qualification-rankings.html
6,02-1-20,"You win sometimes, other times you learn: Vijender Singh on boxing, politics and fatherhood","He hasn't lost a bout in close to five years and Vijender Singh is determined to keep the record with a world title to boot as he enters the new decade donning multiple hats, including the one of an active politician ""with strong opinions"".

The 34-year-old trailblazing boxer, who delivered India's first Olympic and men's world championship medals in boxing back in 2008 and 2009, has logged an enviable 12-0 record in the professional circuit, which he entered in 2015.

""All the talk with my promoters is focussed on the world title. In all, I expect to compete in three-four fights this year with the world title being the big one. We are trying to ensure that this marquee fight happens in India,"" Vijender told PTI in an interview.

Vijender is handled by Hall of Famer Bob Arum's Top Rank Promotions in the USA and has Infinity Optimal Solution (IOS) Boxing Promotions to handle him in India. He last fought in November 2019, beating Ghana's former Commonwealth champion Charles Adamu in a lopsided bout.

""I will continue to train with Lee Beard and move to Manchester in a next few weeks to begin my training there. While I am here, I train at a gym in Gurugram,"" he said.

Beard, who has trained professional stars like Ricky Hatton, has been Vijender's trainer since 2015. Under his tutelage, the Haryana-lad clinched the WBO Asia Pacific and Oriental super middle-weight titles.

The only time Vijender tasted defeat in the last five years was when he decided to take the political plunge ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. He lost the election from South Delhi while contesting on a Congress ticket.

Does he regret the move?

""Not one bit. I fully stand by it and I intend to be an active politician. I have strong opinions on issues and I like to be vocal. Being a politician gives you a platform to be the change,"" he asserted.

""Kai baar aap seekhte hain, kai baar aap jitate hain (sometimes you learn, other times you win). That's how I would describe my decision to join politics. It is a wonderful way to stay connected with realities of life. Why should I have regrets just because I lost one election?"" he asked.

So, does that mean he will be campaigning during the upcoming Delhi assembly elections in February?

""I don't know for now. If I am asked to campaign, I will. It is up to the party high command. As of now, there hasn't been any communication on this,"" he answered.

The belief that politics and sport do not mix has been replaced by an intense clamour for athletes' opinions on what are perceived to be the burning issues of the current times.

Vijender said there is nothing wrong if people demand their heroes to voice opinion in public.

""I believe athletes should speak. At one level, we are also representatives and our voices matter. It shouldn't be that we are saying stuff only when being paid to do so. Views rakhne chahiye, generally (we should present our views).

""It helps the youngsters of this country in finding a voice. For instance, I don't understand why we should spend so much time outraging on what Pakistan is doing. We should move away from that and focus on ourselves.

""That's how we will progress. That's the way forward, in my opinion,"" he said.

Speaking of going forward, the strapping six-footer welcomed his second son in May last year and he says he has lost track of time ever since.

""I don't know when the day starts and when it ends. Right now, I am on daddy duty as well. I am a boxer, father, and politician. I hope I am at least decent in all these roles,"" he laughed.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/you-win-sometimes--other-times-you-learn--vijender-singh-on-boxing--politics-and-fatherhood-2020-01-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/you-win-sometimes--other-times-you-learn--vijender-singh-on-boxing--politics-and-fatherhood.html
7,02-1-20,Tata Sons move SC challenging NCLAT decision restoring Cyrus Mistry as executive chairman,"Tata Sons on Thursday moved the Supreme Court challenging the December 18 decision of the NCLAT restoring Cyrus Mistry as the executive chairman of the group.

The Tata Group sought stay of the verdict by which the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) ruled as ""illegal"" the appointment of N Chandrasekaran as head of the holding company of over USD 110 billion salt-to-software conglomerate.

""We have challenged the NCLAT decision in its entirety,"" a lawyer associated with the matter said.

The petition has sought a direction from the apex court to set aside or quash the findings of the tribunal which held that the group's chairman emeritus Ratan Tata's actions against Mistry were oppressive.

The NCLAT had stayed the operation of the judgement with respect to reinstatement of Mistry for four weeks to allow the Tatas to appeal.

The NCLAT had also quashed the conversion of Tata Sons into a private company from a public firm.

It also directed Tata Sons not to take any action against Mistry, whose family owns some 18 per cent interest in Tata Sons.

The remaining 81 per cent is held by Tata Trusts and Tata Group companies along with Tata family members.

Mistry, scion of the wealthy Shapoorji Pallonji family, had in December 2012 succeeded Ratan Tata as the Executive Chairman of Tata Sons, a post that also made him the head of all Tata group listed firms such as Tata Power and Tata Motors.

In an overnight coup, he was removed as the Chairman of Tata Sons in October 2016. Along with him, the entire senior management too was purged and Ratan Tata was back at the helms of affairs four years after he took retirement.

Mistry challenged the removal before the Mumbai bench of National Company Law Tribunal but lost and then went in for appeal at the NCLAT.

Tatas had cited alleged failure of Mistry to ""deliver on the promises that he had made at the time of his selection as the Chairman"" and inability to lead the group in a cohesive manner and failure in providing proper guidance and support to the group as the reasons for his sacking.

Mistry had contended that he was removed because of his ""efforts to remedy past acts of mismanagement"", for resisting interference of Ratan Tata and for instituting a formal governance framework to regulate the role of Tata Trusts.

The ""legacy hotspots"" included shutting down the small car Nano project; cutting losses with expensive decisions in firms such as Indian Hotels Company Ltd (IHCL) and Tata Teleservices Ltd; and Air Asia fraud.

The NCLAT ordered Ratan N Tata and the nominee of the Tata Trusts to ""desist from taking any decision in advance which requires majority decision of the Board of Directors or in the Annual General Meeting"".

Also, the company, its Board of Directors and shareholders were ordered not to exercise power under Article 75 against Mistry.

Powers under Article 75 had not been exercised since inception and ""can be exercised only in exceptional circumstances and in the interest of the company, but before exercising such power, reasons should be recorded in writing and intimated to the concerned shareholders whose right will be affected, it said.

Mistry was the sixth chairman of Tata Sons and had a tenure up to March 2017. The NCLAT order gives him five more months at the helm of Tata Sons if the said order is not stayed or overturned by the Supreme Court.

Declaring the decision of the Registrar of Companies to change character of Tata Sons from public company to private one as ""illegal"", NCLAT asked the RoC to correct records to show the company as public company.

The court also stated that some observations in the July 9, 2018 judgment passed by the NCLT were ""inappropriate and avoidable"".

These included appreciating activities of Tata Sons and highlighting its products, which had no bearing on merits of the case, it said, adding certain observations against Mistry were ""undesirable and based on extraneously sourced material not on record"".

Stating that such observations cast ""impact on the reputation"" of Mistry, the NCLAT expunged those remarks while setting aside the July 9, 2018 Judgment of NCLT, Mumbai.

After the judgment was pronounced, Tata Sons counsel had prayed for suspension of part of the judgment reinstating Mistry.

""With a view to ensure smooth functioning of the company, while we are not inclined to suspend the judgment pronounced today in its totality, but suspend the part of the judgment so far as it relates to replacement of the present Executive Chairman and reinstatement of Mistry for a period of four weeks,"" the NCLAT said.

""Rest of the judgement and directions including the direction to reinstate Cyrus Pallonji Mistry as director of the company and directors of three Tata companies shall be complied forthwith,"" it said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tata-sons-move-sc-challenging-nclat-decision-restoring-cyrus-mistry-as-executive-chairman-2020-01-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/tata-sons-move-sc-challenging-nclat-decision-restoring-cyrus-mistry-as-executive-chairman.html

11,02-1-20,"At 67,385, India records highest number of babies born globally on New Year's Day: UNICEF","India recorded the highest number of babies born worldwide on New Year's Day with the world's second most populous country registering an estimated 67,385 births out of the nearly 400,000 babies born globally on that day, the UN children's agency said.

Nearly 400,000 babies were born around the world on New Year's Day with India recording the highest number of these births worldwide at 67,385, the UN children's agency said.

An estimated 392,078 babies were born around the world on New Year's Day, according to UNICEF. Of this, an estimated 67,385 babies were born in India, the most globally. China comes in second with 46,299 births.

“The beginning of a new year and a new decade is an opportunity to reflect on our hopes and aspirations not only for our future, but the future of those who will come after us,” UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said.

“As the calendar flips each January, we are reminded of all the possibility and potential of each child embarking on her or his life's journey-if they are just given that chance.”

Fiji in the Pacific most likely delivered 2020's first baby, while the US, the last of the New Year's Day. Globally, over half of these births were estimated to have taken place in eight countries - India (67,385), China (46,299), Nigeria (26,039), Pakistan (16,787), Indonesia (13,020), United States of America (10,452), Democratic Republic of Congo (10,247) and Ethiopia (8,493).

Each January, UNICEF celebrates babies born on New Year's Day, an auspicious day for child birth around the world, it said. However, for millions of newborns around the world, the day of their birth is far less auspicious.

In 2018, 2.5 million newborns died in just their first month of life; about a third of them on the first day of life. Among those children, most died from preventable causes such as premature birth, complications during delivery, and infections like sepsis. In addition, more than 2.5 million babies are born dead each year.

UNICEF said over the past three decades, the world has seen remarkable progress in child survival, cutting the number of children worldwide who die before their fifth birthday by more than half. But there has been slower progress for newborns. Babies dying in the first month accounted for 47 per cent of all deaths among children under five in 2018, up from 40 per cent in 1990.

UNICEF's Every Child Alive campaign calls for immediate investment in health workers with the right training, who are equipped with the right medicines to ensure every mother and newborn is cared for by a safe pair of hands to prevent and treat complications during pregnancy, delivery and birth.

“Too many mothers and newborns are not being cared for by a trained and equipped midwife or nurse, and the results are devastating,” said Fore. “We can ensure that millions of babies survive their first day and live into this decade and beyond if every one of them is born into a safe pair of hands.”

India is projected to surpass China as the world's most populous country around 2027. According to UN estimates, India is expected to add nearly 273 million people between 2019 and 2050, while the population of Nigeria is projected to grow by 200 million. Together, these two countries could account for 23 per cent of the global population increase to 2050.

China, with 1.43 billion people in 2019, and India, with 1.37 billion, have long been the two most populous countries of the world, comprising 19 and 18 per cent, respectively, of the global total in 2019. Through the end of the century, India is estimated to remain the world's most populous country with nearly 1.5 billion inhabitants, followed by China with just under 1.1 billion, Nigeria with 733 million, the US with 434 million, and Pakistan with 403 million inhabitants.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/at-67-385--india-records-highest-number-of-babies-born-globally-on-new-year-s-day--unicef-2020-01-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/at-67-385--india-records-highest-number-of-babies-born-globally-on-new-year-s-day--unicef.html

The weight of the new borns was too less and also their relatives did not follow proper instructions during delivery due to which the pregnant mothers came to the hospital in serious condition, said Bairwa.

The JK Lon Hospital registered 963 deaths in 2019. The committee formed after much furore, in its report concluded that the deaths were reported due to lack of oxygen pipeline in the hospital and extreme cold conditions.

Dulara further said: ""As compared to other government hospitals, this number stands quite low. Also, one death a day means that death rate is falling down in this hospital, which witnessed 91 deaths in December last year.""

21,02-1-20,"Protest against Pak's atrocities on minorities, Modi tells Anti-CAA protesters","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday slammed the Congress and its allies opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act, saying they are against giving relief to those who have been brutalised and victimised in Pakistan.

""Pakistan was founded on religious grounds due to which atrocities on minorities such as Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Christians have increased. But Congress and its allies don't speak against Pakistan,"" he said at a function here.

He also said the Congress and its allies take out rallies and stage demonstrations against the efforts to prevent atrocities on religious lines and save women from sexual assaults.

Modi wondered why those opposed to the CAA were not speaking out against Pakistan's atrocities and asked what stopped them from doing so.

Strongly defending the CAA, he said it was adopted by Parliament in a historic move, but that the Congress and its allies and the ecosystem created by his party's rival were now against the very institution.

He said India cannot leave the Hindus, Christians and Sikhs apparently fleeing Pakistan to ""their fate"" and added it was the country's responsibility to protect them.

Modi pointed out that the efforts are especially to protect the Dalits and tribals in Pakistan.

22,02-1-20,"North Korea ends test moratoriums, threatens 'new' weapon","North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has declared an end to moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests and threatened a demonstration of a ""new strategic weapon"" soon.

Analysts said the announcement, reported by state media on Wednesday, amounted to Kim putting a missile ""to Donald Trump's head"" -- but warned that escalation by Pyongyang would probably backfire.

Washington was swift to respond, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging Kim to ""take a different course"" and stressing that the US wanted ""peace not confrontation"" with the North, while Trump played down the development.

Pyongyang has previously fired missiles capable of reaching the entire US mainland, and has carried out six nuclear tests, the last of them 16 times more powerful than the Hiroshima blast, according to the highest estimates.

A self-imposed ban on such tests -- Kim declared they were no longer needed -- has been a centrepiece of the nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington over the past two years, which has seen three meetings between Kim and the US president, but little tangible progress.

Any actual test is likely to infuriate Trump, who has repeatedly referred to Kim's ""promise"" to him not to carry them out, and has downplayed launches of shorter-range weapons.

Negotiations between the two sides have been largely deadlocked since the breakup of their Hanoi summit in February. The North set the US an end-of-2019 deadline for it to offer fresh concessions on sanctions relief, or it would adopt a ""new way"".

""There is no ground for us to get unilaterally bound to the commitment any longer,"" the official KCNA news agency cited Kim as telling top ruling party officials.

""The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future,"" he added, referring to the North by its official name.

The full meeting of the central committee of the ruling Workers' Party was an indication of a major policy shift.

State television showed veteran newsreader Ri Chun Hee reading out the KCNA dispatch over footage of Kim addressing the officials and general imagery of the country.

The broadcast appeared to stand in place of Kim's usual New Year speech -- normally a key moment in the North Korean political calendar.

Kim acknowledged the impact of international sanctions imposed on Pyongyang over its weapons programmes, but made clear that the North was willing to pay the price to preserve its nuclear capability.

""The US is raising demands contrary to the fundamental interests of our state and is adopting brigandish attitude,"" KCNA cited him as saying.

Washington had ""conducted tens of big and small joint military drills which its president personally promised to stop"" and sent high-tech military equipment to the South, he said.

For months, Pyongyang has been demanding the easing of international sanctions imposed over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, while Washington has insisted it take more tangible steps towards giving them up.

""North Korea has, in effect, put an ICBM to Donald Trump's head in order to gain the two concessions it wants most: sanctions relief and some sort of security guarantee,"" said Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest in Washington.

""Kim Jong-un is playing a dangerous game of geopolitical chicken,"" he added.

The strategy was risky, he said, as Washington was likely to respond with ""more sanctions, an increased military presence in East Asia and more fire and fury style threats coming from Donald Trump's Twitter account"".

Kim's moratorium comments were ""ominous"", said Leif-Eric Easley of Ewha University in Seoul, but added that he could be looking to ""elicit concessions by approaching Trump's red line without crossing it"".

The US has already indicated that it will react if the North carries out a long-range missile test.

Speaking to Fox News and CBS after Kim's announcement, Pompeo said a resumption of nuclear and missile tests would be ""deeply disappointing"".

""We hope that Chairman Kim will take a different course... That he'll choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war,"" Pompeo said.

""We want peace, not confrontation,"" he added, with Seoul's unification ministry adding that a strategic weapon test ""would not help denuclearisation negotiations"".

Trump himself was emollient, saying that he thought Kim was ""a man of his word"" and that at their Singapore summit, ""we did sign a contract, talking about denuclearisation"".

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed deep concern over North Korea's announcement and ""very much hopes that the tests will not resume,"" his spokesman said.

""Non-proliferation remains a fundamental pillar of global nuclear security,"" he added.

An ICBM launch would be likely to frustrate China, the North's key diplomatic backer and provider of trade and aid, which always stresses stability in a region it regards as its own back yard.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/north-korea-ends-test-moratoriums--threatens--new--weapon-2020-01-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/north-korea-ends-test-moratoriums--threatens--new--weapon.html
23,02-1-20,Syria regime fire kills nine in school turned shelter,"Land-to-land missiles fired by Syrian regime forces killed nine civilians including five children in a school in northwestern Syria on Wednesday, a war monitor said.

Part of the building in the town of Sarmeen had been turned into a shelter for the displaced, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

Fifteen people were wounded, Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said.

An AFP correspondent in Sarmeen saw the remains of a missile several metres long in a nearby olive grove.

In the latest round of violence in Syria's nearly nine-year-old war, regime forces have upped their deadly bombardment of the northwestern opposition bastion of Idlib in recent weeks.

In December alone, the violence pushed some 284,000 from their homes in the jihadist-run region of some three million people, the United Nations says.

The mass movement of people has seen public buildings such as mosques, garages, wedding halls and schools turned into shelters, UN humanitarian agency OCHA says.

Regime ally Russia announced a ceasefire for Idlib in late August after months of deadly Russian and regime bombardment that killed around 1,000 civilians.

But sporadic clashes and bombardment persisted throughout the autumn before a spike in violence in the past month, the Observatory says.

Syria's civil war has killed more than 370,000 people since it started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.

In total 11,215 people including more than 1,000 children were killed during the war last year, although it was the least deadly year on record since the beginning of the conflict.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/syria-regime-fire-kills-nine-in-school-turned-shelter-2020-01-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/syria-regime-fire-kills-nine-in-school-turned-shelter.html
24,02-1-20,Mexico president says,"Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador closed out 2019 with a parting shot at his predecessors, saying imprisoned drug kingpin Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán Loera had had the same power as the country's president.

In a video message from the southern city of Palenque on Wednesday, López Obrador recounted his administration's successes in its first year and highlighted its challenges — foremost surging violence. He said he had already done away with the high-level corruption that was rampant in previous governments, but said it was crucial to draw a bright line between criminal elements and authorities so that the two sides do not mingle as they had in the past.

""There was a time when Guzmán had the same power or had the influence that the then president had ... Because there had been a conspiracy and that made it difficult to punish those who committed crimes. That has already become history, gone to the garbage dump of history,"" López Obrador said.

It appeared to be a reference to the indictment and arrest last month of Mexico's former public safety secretary Genaro García Luna. García Luna was public safety secretary in President Felipe Calderon's Cabinet from 2006 to 2012. Before joining Calderon's government, García Luna led Mexico's equivalent of the FBI, the Federal Investigative Agency, under President Vicente Fox.

He was charged in federal court in New York with three counts of trafficking cocaine and one count of making false statements. He had been living in Florida and was arrested in Texas.

US prosecutors allege he accepted millions of dollars in bribes from Guzmán's Sinaloa cartel and in exchange allowed it to operate without interference.

Guzmán was convicted on drug conspiracy charges in New York. He was sentenced last year to life in prison.

López Obrador's public safety secretary Alfonso Durazo on Wednesday echoed the president's comments about rooting out corruption in the security forces.

In a series of posts on Twitter, Durazo also said the government would recruit 21,170 people in 2020 to join the newly formed National Guard and continue to expand its presence in the country. López Obrador has bet big that the new federal security force will be able to wrangle violence that generated a record-setting number of murders in 2019.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mexico-president-says--el-chapo--had-same-power-as-president-2020-01-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/mexico-president-says--el-chapo--had-same-power-as-president.html
25,02-1-20,"Indonesia floods leave two dozen dead, several missing: official","Indonesia's disaster agency warned Thursday of more deaths after torrential rains pounded the Jakarta region, triggering floods and landslides that killed at least 23 and left vast swaths of the megalopolis underwater.

Tens of thousands of residents have been evacuated to temporary shelters in the area, home to some 30 million, with scores of homes damaged.

Images from across the region showed waterlogged homes and cars covered in muddy floodwaters, while some people took to paddling in small rubber lifeboats or tyre inner-tubes to get around.

At least 21 people died in greater Jakarta, while two more were killed by flash floods in neighbouring Lebak regency at the south end of Java island.

""The latest toll is 21 dead,"" Social Affairs Minister Juliari Peter Batubara told reporters on Thursday.

""We hope the toll won't keep going up,"" he added.

In Lebak, the local disaster agency said it had confirmed two residents died and it was investigating reports that three more people perished.

Police in Lebak said that they were searching for as many as eight people who could still be missing from the area.

Around Jakarta, an eight-year-old boy killed in a landslide and an 82-year-old pensioner were among the confirmed victims.

Those killed died from drowning, hypothermia and being covered by landslides, while one 16-year-old boy was electrocuted by a power line.

""The floods hit without warning,"" Munarsih, who goes by one name, said from her waterlogged neighbourhood in Jakarta's western outskirts where dozens of local families fled to safety.

""The water came very fast and it rose quickly. We couldn't manage to get our stuff out, including my car,"" she added.

On Wednesday, electricity was switched off in many Jakarta districts to prevent more electrocutions, with some train lines and one of the city's airports also shut. The torrential downpour triggered landslides on the city's outskirts.

The disaster marked Jakarta's worst flooding since 2013 when dozens were killed after the city was inundated by monsoon rains.

The city is regularly hit by floods during Indonesia's rainy season, which started in late November.

Authorities said Thursday that some 31,000 people had been evacuated, but that figure did not include residents in Jakarta's satellite cities.

Service at Halim Perdanakusuma airport, which handles commercial and military planes, was temporarily shut due to severe flooding on its runways, according to the transport ministry. It was reopened Thursday.

Some flights were transferred to Jakarta's main Soekarno-Hatta International Airport.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/16-dead--thousands-caught-in-flooding-in-indonesia-s-capital-2020-01-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/indonesia-floods-leave-two-dozen-dead--several-missing--official.html

In a series of tweets, the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister also slammed the Rajasthan government for the death of infants.

""The death of 100 children in Rajasthan's Kota district is very sad and painful. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and his government are still insensitive, disinterested and irresponsible, which is highly condemnable,"" she charged in a tweet.

In an exclusive interview to PTI barely hours after taking charge of the 1.3-million strong force, Army Chief Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane on Tuesday said India reserves the right to ""preemptively strike"" at sources of terror. He asserted that a ""new normal"" in the country's response mechanism to acts of cross-border terrorism has already been ""emphatically"" displayed.

""If Pakistan does not stop its policy of state-sponsored terrorism, we reserve the right to preemptively strike at the sources of terror threat and this intent has adequately been demonstrated in our response during surgical strikes and Balakot operation,"" the Army Chief said in New Delhi, in a stern warning to Islamabad.

Reacting to Gen Naravane's remarks, the Pakistan Foreign Office in a statement said, ""We reject the new Indian Army Chief's irresponsible statement regarding 'pre-emptive strikes' across the LoC"" inside Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).

There should be no doubt about Pakistan's resolve and readiness to thwart any aggressive Indian move, inside its territory or PoK, the statement said.

""No one should forget Pakistan's befitting response to India's Balakot misadventure,"" it added.

Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed killed 40 CRPF personnel in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14.

India launched a counter-terror operation against a JeM training camp in Balakot on February 26. The next day, the Pakistan Air Force retaliated and downed a MiG-21 in an aerial combat and captured its pilot, who was handed over to India on March 1.

""Despite India's provocations, Pakistan would continue contributing to all efforts of promoting peace, security and stability in the region and beyond,"" the statement said.

The Foreign Office also said it will continue to highlight the issue of Kashmir on international forums.

""Pakistan reaffirmed its unflinching support and solidarity with the Kashmiri people as the inhuman lockdown"" in Jammu and Kashmir reaches 150 days, it said.

""As part of our unstinted moral, political and diplomatic support for the Kashmir cause, Pakistan will continue to raise at all international forums the plight of over eight million innocent Kashmiris under the brutal occupation of 900,000 Indian security personnel,"" the statement said.

The Foreign Office also said India must immediately lift the continuing communication restrictions in Kashmir.

Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for withdrawing Jammu and Kashmir's special status on August 5 and bifurcating it into two union territories.

Reacting sharply to India's decision, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled India's ambassador in Islamabad.

India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was its internal matter. It also advised Pakistan to accept the reality and stop all anti-India propaganda.

Following the abrogation of Article 370, the Indian government imposed restrictions, including ban on mobile phones and Internet, in Jammu and Kashmir to maintain law and order. The restrictions are being gradually lifted in a phased manner.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/indian-army-chief-s-remark-of--preemptively-strike--right--irresponsible---says-pakistan-2020-01-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/indian-army-chief-s-remark-of--preemptively-strike--right--irresponsible---says-pakistan.html

MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar made the assertion while responding to a question on whether the Kalapani border issue was discussed between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Nepalese Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli during their telephonic conversation on Wednesday.

Prime Minister Modi on Wednesday held telephonic conversations with top leaders of Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal and The Maldives, conveying New Year greetings and emphasising India's commitment to regional peace and security as well as the 'neighbourhood first' policy.

Nepal had in November said the Kalapani area situated in the country's far-West lies within the Nepalese boundary, after India issued new political maps reportedly showing the region as part of its territory.

33,02-1-20,"Study strengthens link between vitamin E, vaping illness","New research have strengthen prior findings on the link between vitamin E acetate and EVALI (E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury).

For the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analysed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from 51 EVALI patients from 16 states and compared it to BAL fluid from 99 healthy individuals.

Vitamin E acetate, also found in product samples tested by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and state laboratories, was identified in BAL fluid from 48 of 51 EVALI patients but was not found in any BAL fluid from healthy people.

In both groups, no other toxicants except coconut oil and limonene were found in BAL fluid.

""These findings support the conclusion that vitamin E acetate is a potential causative agent of EVALI, and that is an important discovery as decisions are made about how to best regulate the rapidly evolving e-cig industry,"" said researcher Peter Shields from Ohio State University in the US.

According to the researchers, BAL samples were collected by the CDC from public health laboratories and health departments across the US.

These samples were received from hospital clinical teams that had collected the samples to guide clinical management decisions.

According to the study, the research team provided BAL fluid samples from 99 healthy comparison subjects collected between 2015 and 2019 as part of a tobacco product study unrelated to the ongoing CDC investigation of EVALI.

In October 2019, the research team reported the first evidence that even short-term vaping causes concerning inflammation in the lungs in the medical journal Cancer Prevention Research.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/study-strengthens-link-between-vitamin-e--vaping-illness-2020-01-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/study-strengthens-link-between-vitamin-e--vaping-illness.html
34,02-1-20,Australia orders mass evacuation of fire-ravaged towns before heatwave,"Thousands of tourists have been given less than 48 hours to evacuate fire-ravaged coastal communities as Australia braces for a heatwave Saturday expected to fan deadly bushfires.

Catastrophic blazes ripped through swathes of the continent's south-east on New Year's Eve, killing at least eight people and stranding holidaymakers as seaside towns were ringed by flames.

The New South Wales (NSW) Rural Fire Service on Thursday morning declared a ""tourist leave zone"" stretching about 200 kilometres (124 miles) from the popular holiday spot of Bateman's Bay along the usually picturesque south-east coast to neighbouring Victoria state, where people are also being urged to evacuate fire-threatened areas.

Visitors are being warned to leave before Saturday, which is forecast to bring gusting winds and temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).

That weather will create dangerous fire conditions that officials say will be as bad -- if not worse -- than Tuesday, Australia's deadliest day of fires in a months-long bushfire crisis.

Many tourists and residents spent two nights isolated with no electricity or telecommunications, and dwindling food supplies, before authorities on Thursday deemed some roads out of the region temporarily safe to use.

NSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance told public broadcaster ABC it would be the ""largest evacuation of people out of the region ever"", with thousands preparing to leave ahead of another ""terrible"" day of fires.

NSW Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner Rob Rogers said firefighters were unable to extinguish or even control the raging blazes.

""The message is we've got so much fire in that area, we have no capacity to contain these fires,"" he told ABC.

""We just need to make sure that people are not in front of them."" But with food and fuel supplies reportedly running short in many centres, there were concerns some would remain trapped.

Authorities still have not been able to reach some rural communities, such as the town of Genoa in Victoria.

There are also mounting fears for five people still missing after the most recent blazes while the number of homes confirmed destroyed has topped 400, with that number expected to rise as firefighters reach devastated communities still isolated by flames.

Navy ships and military aircraft have been deployed alongside emergency crews to provide humanitarian relief and assess the damage.

This season's blazes have killed at least 18 people, destroyed more than 1,000 homes and scorched about 5.5 million hectares (13.5 million acres) -- an area bigger than Denmark or the Netherlands.

The unprecedented crisis has sparked street protests calling on the government to immediately act on climate change, which scientists say is creating a longer and more intense bushfire season.

Conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison has come under increasing pressure for his actions, which included holidaying in Hawaii as the disaster unfolded and reiterating his support for Australia's lucrative -- but heavily polluting -- coal mining industry.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/australia-orders-mass-evacuation-of-fire-ravaged-towns-before-heatwave-2020-01-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/australia-orders-mass-evacuation-of-fire-ravaged-towns-before-heatwave.html
35,02-1-20,Pompeo postpones Ukraine trip after attack on US embassy in Iraq,"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday postponed a trip to Ukraine, the country at the heart of impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, after an attack on the American embassy in Iraq, the State Department announced.

Pompeo had been due to travel at week's end to Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Cyprus.

But on Tuesday, a mob of pro-Iran demonstrators stormed the US embassy in Baghdad over American airstrikes that killed two dozen paramilitary fighters.

Pompeo's travel was pushed back ""due to the need for the secretary to be in Washington, DC to continue monitoring the ongoing situation in Iraq and ensure the safety and security of Americans in the Middle East,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus announced.

""Secretary Pompeo's trip will be rescheduled in the near future and he looks forward to the visit at that time,"" she added.

The trip would have made Pompeo the most senior US official to visit Kiev since a scandal erupted in 2019 over a controversial phone call in which Trump allegedly tried to pressure his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky to find dirt on Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden.

Pompeo, a staunch Trump defender, was set to meet with Zelensky and other top Ukrainian officials, Ortagus said Monday when the trip was first announced.

But the following day, the embassy in Baghdad was besieged. Demonstrators finally left on Wednesday.

No US personnel were injured in the attack and US officials said they had no plans to evacuate.

Trump was impeached by the US House of Representatives for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress on December 18 and faces trial in the Senate, possibly later this month, though top Democratic and Republican lawmakers are still sparring over how it will be conducted.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pompeo-postpones-ukraine-trip-after-attack-on-us-embassy-in-iraq-2020-01-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/pompeo-postpones-ukraine-trip-after-attack-on-us-embassy-in-iraq.html
