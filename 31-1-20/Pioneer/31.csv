0,31-1-20,Learn from the world,"Countering illicit trade not only requires cooperation between global institutions but also the designing of effective strategies and improving regulatory frameworks between countries

The sobering fact that India does not rank high in the Global Illicit Trade Environment Index (GITEI), an annual study brought out by The Economist Intelligence Unit, and needs to take corrective action to bring down the risks of illicit trade raise troubling concerns for policymakers. According to the index based on four parameters — Government policy; supply and demand; customs environment and transparency and trade — India ranks 49 globally and nine, in the Asia Pacific-rankings which we can most certainly improve.

In the context of the growing menace of illicit trade worldwide, the World Economic Forum (WEF) estimates the global market of illicit trade to be about $3 trillion by 2022. It has been pointed out by the WEF that while everybody does express concern, the response to this problem has been disorganised and leaves a lot to be desired.

The need of the hour today, as brought out at the sixth edition of MASCRADE (Movement Against Smuggled and Counterfeit Trade), conducted under the aegis of FICCI’s Committee Against Smuggling and Counterfeiting Activities Destroying the Economy (CASCADE), is to proactively and conscientiously address the many issues exacerbating the state of the global problem of illicit trade and understand its visible outcome and measurable impacts. There is also an immediate need for harnessing the potential of multilateralism through inter-governmental actions and of an effective monitoring and inspection of Free Trade Zones (FTZs) to ensure legitimate trade flows so that FTZs do not become “hotspots”’ for illicit trade and organised crime.

Countering the beast of illicit trade not only requires an understanding of and cooperation between institutions globally but also the designing of effective global strategies and improving the regulatory framework. Unfortunately, no country can claim to have eliminated the problem. Everybody has had varying degrees of success and all countries have paid a price. Trade in smuggling, contraband, counterfeit and pirated goods has risen steadily in the last few years and now stands at 3.3 per cent of global business. Hence, its existence and operation are broad in scope and large in value, impacting not only the global economy, causing losses to the industry, Government and society but also adversely affecting the health and safety of consumers. Additionally, it is facilitating an underground economy and organised crime. Tragically, illicit operators display greater cooperation between each other across nations than what governmental institutions do, both within a country and across borders. It is imperative for countries to share experiences in order to understand the global dimensions of the illicit trade challenge so that a possible framework may be set up to tackle it.

Highlighting the challenges of tackling the problem of tobacco smuggling, Tim Sheppard, Counsellor (Australian Border Force), Australian High Commission, emphasises that if the risks are minimised upfront there will be less work for law enforcement officers to do. According to him, high tax rates on tobacco have actually incentivised tobacco smuggling. On a moderate investment, importing a container of illicit cigarettes could provide a 5,000 per cent return on investment without the same kind of fines or penal provision such as in narcotics. The Australian Government was cognisant of the problem and consequently increased the fines and prison terms for tobacco smuggling to 10 years of imprisonment and penalty to the tune of five times of duty avoided. Also, the close cooperation between the Australian Border Force and Department of Home Affairs, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the Australian Taxation Office has led to good results. More than 600 tonnes of illicit tobacco, estimated to be about AUD 600 million in evaded duty, has been seized in the last one year.

Vincenzo Tuzi, Guardia di Finanza Attaché, Embassy of Italy says that the number of unusual products seized in recent times indicate the presence of large criminal organisations who have kept a tab on markets and economics before starting production of market-specific counterfeit goods. To tackle such a scenario, Tuzi emphasises the need for every country to have the same penalties for certain kinds of fraud. This would facilitate cooperation in investigation.

Italy has an anti-counterfeiting MIS in place which at an operational level allows Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) holders to work actively with the law-enforcement agencies by sharing information about their products that could be a target for fraud. The system provides reports for the IPR holders on fraud and other information useful for the protection of their rights. This database also provides useful feedback through data and risk analysis for various statistical purposes and has proven to be a starting point for further investigation projects on a tactical and strategic level.

In their report, Huw Watkins, Head of Asia Policy, IPR, UK and Julian Saldanha, First Secretary, Revenue and Customs, British High Commission, say that 2.5 per cent of exports worldwide were counterfeit goods as were 6.5 per cent items used in IT and communication. India ranked sixth in the world in counterfeit production. Given this background, enforcement agencies need to look at the entire chain in the life cycle of counterfeit goods —from the placing of orders, to manufacturing, to shipping, to importation, to retail sale to wholesale and reworking and transportation. This needs to be followed by an identification of areas in the chain where disruption of the illegal activity could be done. As per Watkins, while FTZs have been beneficial for trade, they have also been very vulnerable to exploitation by criminals.

Outlining some of the challenges that the US faces while dealing with the SAARC countries and with India, Shilpi Jha, Senior Legal Counsel for Intellectual Property-South Asia, Embassy of the USA, says there is a major lack of awareness, right from the consumers up to the Government level, on not just IPR issues but also on industry and Government initiatives in this area. There is also a lack of coordination among agencies especially given India’s federal polity, the fear of losing/lack of trust as industries always fear that sharing too much data with custom/police will cause information to leak out and counter-wise the enforcement machinery feels that by doing too much work on behalf of the industry, the latter’s responsibility will diminish.

Such insights on stemming and addressing the challenges of illicit trade are very instructive for India in its fight against this debilitating malaise. The Australian experience in tackling tobacco smuggling could be useful for the country as it is facing a similar challenge today. The possibility of developing an anti-counterfeiting information system in India on the lines of the Italian experience could be definitely explored. The strategy of examining each link in the counterfeit chain and tackling the weaker link to disrupt the chain, an approach adopted by the UKIPO could also be usefully examined by the authorities. These authorities could also examine the role of SEZs and find out whether there exist similar instances of such misuse in the country. India could also consider MOUs with online trading platforms to educate them about the possibility of their being misused for the sale of counterfeit goods. The authorities could relook at the present efforts at publicising the ill-effects of buying smuggled and counterfeit goods and develop a more robust publicity strategy to this effect. Finally, issues such as a lack of trust, lack of cooperation among agencies and lack of appreciation of the nefarious impact of counterfeiting are common to India. An institutional mechanism to address these challenges could also be explored.

If India develops a greater communication flow between nations and between various enforcement agencies in the country, modifies the many best practices according to the needs and situations prevalent here and equips enforcement agencies with the latest technological tools that keep them ahead of the curve, then we will be able to weaken this adversary, which has been damaging economies and societies and compromising the safety and security of nations the world over.

1,31-1-20,AMU V-C makes fresh appeal to students to appear in exams,"The Aligarh Muslim University authorities were considering to close the university for indefinite period after repeated attempts to persuade students to end their stir and appear for examinations failed.

Students’ groups are seeking the withdrawal of “false cases” against those who participated in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on December 15. Heavy security, including Rapid Action Force, have been deployed to tackle any untoward incident on the campus.

AMU Vice-Chancellor Tariq Mansoor issued an appeal to students on Thursday to appear for exams and asked them not to fall prey to rumours.

“I appeal to the students, whose future is foremost on my mind, to not fall prey to rumours, propaganda spread by vested interests and to appear in examinations and attend classes,” Mansoor said.

The vice-chancellor also termed his appeal as “final” and said that if academic activities were not back to normal, keeping the university open would be of no use.

“If the examinations and classes are prevented from being held by some misguided elements, there will be no justification of keeping the university open and allowing 23,000 students to sit idle on the campus. This is my last appeal to all, to maintain peace and tranquillity on the campus and appear in the exams and attend classes from January 30, 2020. Already 18 days have gone by without any academic activity,” Mansoor said.

Meanwhile, AMU Students Union’s former president Abdul Hafiz Gandhi also appealed to the protesting students not to boycott classes and exams.

Speaking to media persons, Gandhi said, “I appeal to AMU students that the struggle against CAA-NPR-NRC seems to be long drawn. People are fighting it on the streets. This struggle will continue till these anti-constitutional steps are withdrawn. But for student of AMU and Jamia Millia Islamia, my humble request is that allow classes and exams in the morning and continue organising protests/meetings democratically in the afternoon or evening. This will save huge academic loss. We, as your elders, vow to continue fighting for a better future.”

The AMU students are protesting against the police crackdown on students on the campus on December 15 last year and demanding resignation of the vice-chancellor and registrar.

On Wednesday, a key meeting of administrative officers was called and the vice-chancellor along with various head of departments and Superintendent of Police Akash Kulhary and District Magistrate Chandra Bhushan Singh decided that a direct dialogue be established between the HoDs and students. In case the efforts failed, the last option would be to announce a sine die closure of AMU.

Meanwhile, women protesting against the CAA sat on an indefinite dharna at Eidgah in Aligarh with the police booking 250 of them for unlawful assembly on Thursday.

Nine of them were named in the FIR.

The women have been charged under IPC sections pertaining to unlawful assembly (145), rioting (147) and disobedience to order issued by a public servant (188).

The protest began on Wednesday afternoon and by the evening, a large number of people joined it, despite the police trying to deter them from violating Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code that prohibits public gatherings.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/amu-v-c-makes-fresh-appeal-to---students-to-appear-in-exams.html
2,31-1-20,UP minister sparks row with ‘kutte ki maut’ remark,"In the continuing spate of controversial remarks by politicians, Uttar Pradesh’s minister Raghuraj Singh sparked another controversy by saying that anti-nationals should be given “kutte ki maut” (dog’s death).

Addressing a rally in Aligarh, Singh also said that if he had his way he would change the name of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) to ‘Hindustan University’.

‘“I want to say it to mullahs of Aligarh Muslim University that whenever we want, we will change its name to Hindustan university,” he said.

“Whoever is involved in anti-national activities will be given ‘kutte ki maut’ (dog’s death). The police have been commanded to kill such people immediately in encounters,” the minister was quoted as saying by the local media.

Singh’s controversial statement came weeks after he threatened to “bury alive” those raising slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.

Referring to the protests held by students of AMU, Singh had said, “You will take tax payers’ money for your university and raise slogans against Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi? I will bury you alive.”

Earlier, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya was slammed by the twitterati for making objectionable remarks on Bangladeshis. Vijayvargiya had said at a pro-CAA seminar that while he was getting a new room to his house constructed, he noticed that some workers had “strange eating habits” and were eating ‘poha’ which was why they were most likely Bangladeshis.

Vijayvargiya also claimed that Bangladeshis were keeping a watch and following him when he went out.

Karnataka BJP legislator MP Renukacharya also courted controversy by making some objectionable remarks on Muslims.

“Instead of offering prayers (namaz), Muslims are storing weapons in mosques and their priests (qazis) are giving fatwas instead of sermons. Also the Muslims are not participating in pro-CAA rallies,” Renukacharya had said at a pro-CAA rally at Honnalli in Davenagere district recently.

The Bharatiya Janata Party however distanced itself from the remarks.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-minister-sparks-row-with----kutte-ki-maut----remark.html
3,31-1-20,Dr Kafeel Khan held for ‘provocative' speech at AMU,"In a surprise move, the sleuths of UP Special Task Force arrested Dr Kafeel Khan in Mumbai in a late night operation on Wednesday.

The doctor was earlier jailed after the death of over 60 children at BRD Medical College hospital in Gorakhpur in 2017.

Khan was arrested after a case was registered against him for making provocative speech on Citizenship (Amendment) Act during a talk at Aligarh Muslim University more than a month back.

The STF brass confirmed that they had arrested Khan with assistance from Mumbai Police at the airport when he arrived to attend anti-CAA protests.

“Khan was arrested in a case which was registered at Civil Lines police station in Aligarh under Section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups) of the Indian Penal Code,” IG (STF) Amitabh Yash said.

The FIR, lodged on December 13, says Khan made an attempt to vitiate the peaceful atmosphere at the AMU and disturb communal harmony. Two days after the case was registered against Khan, there was large-scale violence at AMU, where the police were accused of high-handedness on the campus.

The Aligarh police entered the campus after seeking permission from the university authorities but were later accused of barging into hostels, randomly assaulting students and indulging in vandalism.

There was a face-off between the police and AMU students when the students tried to take out an anti-CAA march outside the campus and were prevented from going out of the main gate.

Sources said that Dr Kafeel Khan was scheduled to participate in an anti-CAA protest in Mumbai on Thursday hence the STF dropped the net on him.

Khan, who was produced in a metropolitan magistrate court in Bandra on Thursday afternoon, said in the court that the UP Police would kill him in a fake encounter.

He also alleged that he was not being given a lawyer and then appealed to lawyers to help him. However, no lawyer volunteered to represent him and a group even said ‘no’ loudly in the court. But after some time, lawyer Alka Sharma agreed to represent Khan.

Khan further told the court that he had not said anything provocative and if the case had to be pursued, he be kept in Mumbai.

His lawyer also submitted that sedition charges were not applicable on him as he only gave his opinion on how the CAA would impact Muslims.

DGP OP Singh, however denied Khan’s apprehension and said, “This is wrong that we will fabricate any false case against him. As far as encounter is concerned, we believe in the rule of law and our aim is to arrest people and not to kill them. His apprehension is unfounded. ‘He will be prosecuted in the court as per law. We have nothing to do with his past and he has been charged for his present case.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/dr-kafeel-khan-held-for----provocative--speech-at-amu.html
4,31-1-20,Will DGP OP Singh get an extension?,"While the stage is set to bid farewell to Director General of Police OP Singh on his retirement on Friday (January 31), the state government is yet to decide his successor, giving rise to the possibility of the state police chief getting extension for three months.

Interestingly, Singh has scotched rumours about his extension, saying that he would retire by the month-end.

However, sources said that for the rare achievement of putting in place the police commissionerate system in UP, Singh could be rewarded with a 3-month extension by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.

The sources also said that Yogi may also accept Singh’s other proposal of posting a senior IPS officer as principal secretary (home).

An IPS officer is already serving as a secretary (home) but after the introduction of police commissionerate system, Yogi is likely to post an IPS officer as principal secretary (home).

However, the Home department would still be headed by an IAS officer serving as additional chief secretary (home).

The possibility of Singh’s extension was still alive as earlier during Samajwadi Party’s regime, then DGP Arvind Jain had attended the ceremonial farewell parade at the Reserve Police Lines on his retirement in the morning of his last working day but by the evening, before the traditional tea party at DGP’s residence, he was given a three-month extension.

Meanwhile, the UP government, which earlier sent a panel of five IPS officers to UPSC for selecting Singh’s successor, has now sent the names of all DG-rank officers posted in the state or on Central deputation.

Not only this, the names of three officers, who will be promoted to DG rank after retirement of Singh and DG (Intelligence) Bhawesh Kumar Singh, DG (Special Enquiry) Mahendra Modi, were also sent to the UPSC.

The move to send all the names was taken by the government after DG Jawaharlal Tripathi filed a writ challenging non-inclusion of his name in the list despite him being one of the top three senior-most IPS officers posted in the state.

While speculations are rife on Singh’s successor, the outgoing DGP is likely to be appointed as the new chief information commissioner of UP post retirement.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/will-dgp-op-singh-get-an-extension-.html
5,31-1-20,Oppn parties backing anti-nationals: Irani,"



|



Union Textiles and Women, Children Welfare Minister Smriti Irani hit out at the opposition parties, especially the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party, for doing politics over Shaheen Bagh protests and supporting anti-nationals.

“The anti-CAA protesters are demanding ‘Jinnah’s azadi’ and this has annoyed the masses. AAP leader Manish Sisodia has openly extended his party’s support to Shaheen Bagh protesters who are raising anti-national slogans,” Irani said.

Talking to media persons during her visit to Amethi on Thursday, the Union minister said that after their drubbing in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the opposition parties were trying to take revenge from the country and its people by supporting devisive forces.

“The protesters are indulging in anti-national activities by raising slogans against the country and it is unfortunate that a couple of political parties are supporting them,” she said.

During her day-long visit to her parliamentary constituency, Irani laid the foundation stones and dedicated to the people 20 projects worth over Rs 5 crore, including a farmers seed centre and a solar power centre, at a function held in Bhetua block. She said that solar lights which were earlier installed at the houses of leaders would now be provided to common people.

Irani also visited Bhareta village to meet the families of the victims of a road accident on January 20 that left six people dead.

Later, addressing a meeting at Kalakankar in Pratapgarh during the Ganga Yatra on Thursday, Irani said that it could not be the character of a true Indian to sit in Shaheen Bagh and talk of breaking the country.

“I will pray to Ganga Maiya to let better sense prevail among the people who depend on this land for survival, but praise others. In India, the Ganga river is addressed as Maa and the land is called motherland. These people at Shaheen Bagh are talking of breaking our motherland into pieces,” she said.

Attacking the Congress, Irani said, “The intention of the Congress is to break the nation. Ask the people of Amethi, they are the victims as development was stalled there. Today, I am proud to be an MP from Amethi.”

The Union minister said that it was a matter of pride that the Ganga Yatra had reached Pratapgarh and she would like to thank Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for taking the initiative for overall development of villages along the river Ganga and cleaning the Ganga.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/oppn-parties-backing-anti-nationals--irani.html
6,31-1-20,Comprehensive Cityscape Makeover in MP,"Restructuring urban policy, the Madhya Pradesh Government, led by Chief Minister Kamal Nath, is bringing sweeping changes to cityscapes across the State.

Identifying urban development as a thrust area, the State Government has launched various schemes to upgrade cities into inclusive living spaces meeting global benchmarks in terms of envisioning and planning for the future.

Going beyond the development of urban infrastructure such as roads and transport facilities, the new schemes will ensure public welfare and address the issues of efficiency, sanitation and protection of the environment.

In a bid to keep cities inclusive in face of spiraling real estate prices, the Kamal Nath Government has launched a housing mission for the urban poor.

As part of the mission the state government is allotting land lease (Patta) to landless city dwellers. The government has also given its ascent for the development of nearly 1.16 lakh housing units for the urban poor at a cost of 1,770 crores.

Under the scheme to boost urban infrastructure the government has cleared projects worth Rs 67.99 crores for six urban bodies while another 13 have earned clearances for projects amounting to Rs 79.38 crores. And 40 civic bodies have received authorisation for plans worth Rs 98.71 crores.

A dozen municipalities have also been invested with a grant of Rs 13.13 crores. Budget allocations of Rs 50 cores have been made for the mini smart city project at Chhindwara.

Experts describe urban development as an inter-disciplinary activity which draws on social sciences, engineering and design sciences to create human settlements with a positive impact on social and economic activity.

With a vision to curb urban unemployment, the State Government has launched a scheme to impart skill development training to youth with a guarantee of hundred days of employment and a proportionate stipend to the beneficiaries.

Nearly 4.25 lakh youngsters have registered under the scheme being offered through 166 urban bodies which are responsible for conducting these trainings in 38 trades.

Currently nearly 20,000 youngsters are undergoing training while Rs 1,210 crore has already been disbursed as stipend to 18,396 beneficiaries.

Financial assistance and grants are also being provided to urban youth in order to help generate self employment opportunities and promote entrepreneurship abilities.

Under the Swachh Bharat Mission improvements have been brought by decentralising the solid waste management system and financial assistance to the tune of Rs 50.76 crores has been provided to urban bodies for the acquisition of 850 vehicles for doorstep collection of waste.

An expenditure of over Rs 14 crore has been incurred for the establishment of 83 material recovery centers. Municipal bodies have also been provided with additional assistance for the establishment and upkeep of transfer centers.

The establishment of smart cities too received a shot in the arm with the issuance of work orders for 89 projects at a cost of nearly Rs 1,799 crores.

During the last one year 39 projects have been completed while another 50 projects amounting to Rs 2,473.78 crorers are currently in the tender process.

Substantial investments have also been made in water supply and waste water management projects in several cities. The Madhya Pradesh Urban Development Company has provided financial assistance for some of these projects.

A work order for the Rs 90 crore sewerage plan has been issued for Shajapur while sewerage systems have been strengthened in eight cities under the Narmada Sewa Mission.

Drinking water systems are also being strengthened across the State. During the last year potable water schemes worth Rs 980 lakhs were approved by the State Government while schemes worth 29,190 lakhs were completed in 26 urban centers.

Water projects worth Rs 51,418.46 lakhs were completed under the Urban Infrastructure Development for Small and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT) scheme and financial approvals worth Rs 7,282.59 lakhs were provided for drinking water projects at 10 urban centers.

Significant improvements have also been brought to public transport services across the State.

A swank new bus stop is coming up at Chhindwara under the Public Private Partnership model at a cost of Rs 7.5 crores.

Attempting to curtail vehicular pollution the Kamal Nath Government has formulated the Madhya Pradesh Electric Vehicle Policy-2019. In the first phase of the scheme 40 electric buses are plying in Indore, the financial nerve-center of the state. An additional 340 electric buses are proposed to be launched in the near future.

With Chief Minister Kamal Nath placing a strong impetus on time efficient result oriented efforts, bustling yet inclusive and healthy urban spaces are on the fast approaching horizon for Madhya Pradesh.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/comprehensive-cityscape-makeover-in-mp.html
7,31-1-20,Yoga School inaugurated at Sanchi Buddhist University,"The Yoga School set up by the students of Yoga Department of Sanchi Buddhist University was inaugurated on Thursday.

The Yoga School is located at Sanchi Buddhist-Indian University of Knowledge Studies. The special thing about this yoga school is that it has been made from natural things. All the students of the Yoga Department built the terrace with the grass, the floor with cow dung and mud and preparing Buddhist platforms.

The doors of the yoga school are made of bamboo and wood, the four walls of the campus with coconut rope and dates (chhind) leaves. The walls of the Buddhist Yoga Centre have been made with bullets and its roof is also made of grass. Do not disturb mosquito-fly during meditation and yoga activities.

Assistant Professor of Yoga Department, Upendra Babu Khatri said that after the construction of this Yoga School, the students have prepared this action plan that they will go to every village to teach yoga to the villagers.

According to Khatri, such efforts are made to create a laboratory with a natural environment with the least expense and natural resources.

In this programme organised on the occasion of the death anniversary of Vasant Panchami and Gandhi, Assistant Professor of the Hindi Department, Rahul Siddharth explained how Vasant is mentioned in Hindi literature. He told that Hindi literature started from 1000 AD.

Since then, the mention of spring has been found in Hindi literature.

He said that in 16th century, the author of Padmavat, Malik Mohammad Jaisi also mentioned Vasant in his writing done in Awadhi. In the same way Bharatendu, Nazir Akbarabadi, Subhadra Kumari Chauhan, Sumitranandan Pant, Hazari Prasad Dwivedi and Vidya Niwas Mishra have mentioned Vasant in their poems.

Assistant Professor of Yoga Department, Upendra Babu Khatri said that Gandhi used to do yoga as well.

He said that Gandhi was believed in karma yoga. Khatri said that Acharya Shriram Sharma had gone to Mahatma Gandhi to learn yoga.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/yoga-school-inaugurated-at-sanchi-buddhist-university.html
8,31-1-20,Sops needed to boost spending,"To revive economic growth the 2020-21 Budget should focus on expenditure while compromising on fiscal ratios

Ever since the Modi Government came to power for the second term, it has implemented various strategies to overcome the fiscal deficit and keep inflation in check. The slowing economy needed Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to resolve issues like the agrarian troughs, slump in the real estate, aviation and infrastructure sectors and the Public Sector Bank (PSB) crisis. The most ambitious promise of the NDA-led Government in their election manifesto of 2019 was to support the marginalised farmers by providing Rs 6,000 per year directly into their bank accounts under the Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme. To combat the issues related to real estate, Sitharaman announced building 19.5 million rural homes by 2022. A continued focus was maintained on connectivity development under the national highways and rural road programmes. To provide support to PSBs, Rs 70,000 crore was infused to improve their deteriorating lending capabilities. As per the announcement made by the FM, corporate taxes would be reduced and foreign direct investment (FDI) would be further opened in the aviation sector. However, even with strong Budget plans, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) slipped to five per cent in the second quarter of 2019 from nearly eight per cent in 2018-19 which further slipped to 4.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2019. Deteriorating domestic consumption was a major reason for the slow growth rate as the private consumption rate declined from 11 per cent to a mere three per cent in the first half of 2019. The largest employer in the country, the automobile sector, also faced a severe setback due to the lack in consumption and overproduction. The Government decided to cut corporate taxes from 30 per cent to 22 per cent to fuel the economy and attract more investments.

Despite all these efforts, the economic slowdown is still continuing and the lack of liquidity is another area of concern. The fiscal deficit for the period April-October rose to 3.3 per cent of the GDP, which is a major pain point. Despite policy rate cuts, there has been no substantial credit growth. The high Government expenditure is a burden, which further increases the fiscal deficit. Another major roadblock is the ease of doing business in India. There should be structural reforms to deal with challenges such as land acquisition and labour, environmental and other regulatory clearances. With all these challenges looming large, Sitharaman’s Budget announcements on February 1 are keenly awaited and the masses are expecting some sops.

Tax relief to individual tax payers: In the previous year corporate tax rates were slashed to boost the economy. Likewise, individual tax payers are looking for a relief in tax rates. The exemption limit should be increased to Rs 3 lakh and to Rs 3.5 lakh for senior citizens respectively. This would mean more disposable income with each tax payer, which would help in boosting private consumption. Also, recommendation has been made by the committee constituted to draft new tax laws to introduce five tax brackets of five per cent,10 per cent, 20 per cent, 30 per cent and 35 per cent. The expectation from the Government is an increase of the exemption limit under Section 80C from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh as it was last revised in 2014.

Higher interest deduction for housing loans: The FM should focus on increasing the deduction of interest on housing loan. It should also increase the limit of one self-occupied property to Rs 250,000 and two self-occupied properties to Rs 300,000.

Abrogation of LTCG: To cheer up the stock market, the Government should consider giving relief on Long Term Capital Gains tax. This would increase the liquidity in the market and directly increase consumption. An increase in private consumption would lead to healthier market condition thus in turn increasing the overall demand for goods.

Strategic disinvestment: The Government should achieve its disinvestments goals by March 31, so that it can overcome its revenue shortfall from tax collection. A distinctive strategy should be announced for disinvestments in Air India.

Increase in defence spending: There has been little to no change in the Defence Budget for a long time. A major focus should be incentives for defence sector MSMEs under the ‘Make in India’ programme.

Infrastructure development: As India currently has infrastructure projects worth Rs 102 lakh crore in the pipeline, which will rise to Rs 300 lakh crore eventually, there is a strong demand to provide a draft for Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) to address the funding crisis.

The predicament of the Government now would be whether to increase its expenditure or not. However, this spending is required for the economy to recover. The Government has set a fiscal deficit target of 3.3 per cent of the GDP. According to economists, which include the likes of Abhijit Banerjee, fiscal deficit should not be an area of concern when demand and investments are slowing down. To revive economic growth, the 2020-21 Budget should focus on more expenditure while compromising on the fiscal ratios. For now, we can count on the fact that this fiscal gap would help in the long run to pave the way for economic recovery of India.

9,31-1-20,Enable the new education policy,"The Budget must make provisions that encourage modularity with multiple pathways of vertical and horizontal connectivity between various formats of certification and help create a future-proof workforce

India’s demographic dividend —the average age of the population is 46 years in the US, 42 years in Europe, 48 years in Japan and 27 years in India — is a mammoth opportunity for the country. With the right education and skills, the country can harness its true potential and bring massive improvements to the economy.

The Union Budget is an important milestone to set the pathway and take the right steps in that direction. The new national education policy proposed by the Government has raised hopes of all stakeholders but the Budget needs to send the right signals and make provisions for the policy to bloom.

Increase allocation for education: A spending of three to 3.5 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on education does not augur well for a country like India. Most developed nations (and several of the developing ones) have already moved their education budgets closer to the six per cent mark.

India should also provision for such improvements as this shall help bridge some part of the inequality and poverty in the country and pave the way for inter-generational social and economic mobility.

India will need to aggressively invest in improving the physical infrastructure in primary schools, take radical steps to improve student retention, make provisions for the specially-abled, spend higher amounts on teachers’ training and improve the pay structure for the educators so as to attract the best talents to the profession and bring better governance and performance management by inculcating a hope of rising and a fear of falling.

GST exemption for five years for education and education service providers: The Union Government’s target to double the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) from the current 25 per cent to 50 per cent shall require a consolidated and comprehensive effort by the Government, the institutions, the service providers and all other stakeholders, who will have to play their respective roles in governance, products, infrastructure (both physical and technology) and service delivery.

Exempting the input services from the Goods and Service Tax (GST) shall help reduce the fee charged by the institutions and make the courses more affordable. The country will also benefit from the entry of many more education providers who would be able to provide several modular, multi-modal, technology-enabled and relevant skill training programmes to the learners. They will also help improve the overall skills in emerging areas. Hence, making these courses exempt from GST would bring down their prices and make them more affordable.

Recognition for online programmes: In today’s online world, e-learning and online courses complement the education already provided by the traditional classrooms and help personalise learning through the use of various machine learning technologies. The Government must now go aggressive with online learning courses and make provisions for recognising and legitimising them. The Government should allow many more universities to launch their online offerings. This will enable institutions to innovate on their product and offer modular, contemporary and multi-modal education to the learners in all the three areas, namely preparation, repair and upgradation. This shall go a long way in improving the GER for the country, fill the skill gap and create a resilient and productive workforce.

Subsidy for apprenticeships: Learning-by-doing and earning-while-learning are powerful tools to make education more engaging, purposeful and employable. The huge dropout rate of students — of the about 23 million students taking the Class 10 Board examinations in India, only 80 lakh reach the altar of universities — primarily due to financial constraints and archaic pedagogy, can be partially arrested by degree-linked apprenticeships that combine the benefits of a modular degree (diploma in the first year, advanced diploma in the second that can roll up to a degree in the third year) with employability skills.

The Government must create a separate provision to provide higher incentives to the employers for hiring trainees and apprentices. This shall help improve the industry-academia connect and help create more employable students.

RUSA funds for providing skill training to students: So as to attract a larger section of the students to the innovative formats of learning and making them employable, the country would benefit from higher allocation in student scholarships and free-ships. The Union Budget should create provisions to use Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) funds by the higher educational institutes for subsidising the upskilling costs of the students to make them employable. This shall help institutions take new steps, partner with the industry and organise outcome-linked training programmes for their students.

Education loan availability: Categorising the lending to the education sector as a “priority sector lending” shall improve the uptake of loans by the students and improve affordability for many middle-class scholars. Granting infrastructure-class status to educational institutions shall reduce the rate of interest for the education sector, promote innovation and make education affordable and accessible to many more.

The Government must make provisions to subsidise the education loans availed by students (currently, education loans are more expensive than car loans). This shall help in making education affordable and improve the return on investment for the scholars and their parents.

Use of technology to improve governance and learning outcomes: The Budget must make provisions to incentivise the use of technology to improve the equity and quality of education. Special incentives must be given by the Government for investment in technology in the sector.

The industry shall benefit from tax incentives in capital purchases; GST exemptions in purchase of software and services by educational institutions and provisioning of smart devices for teachers and students. Subsidies for investment in emerging technologies like big-data, data analytics, machine learning and Artificial Intelligence shall set the momentum for many institutions to become role models.

Skill gaps and looming unemployment pose a great risk and challenge for the Indian economy. As it is, the future of jobs is uncertain as disruptive technologies are playing havoc with it. Hence, with the objective of creating an employable and resilient workforce, the country will need to look at investing in University 4.0 — keep the students at the centre, rebalance the trinity of cost, quality and scale and think harder about the purpose of learning. The Budget must make provisions that encourage modularity with multiple pathways of vertical and horizontal connectivity between various formats of certification and help create a future-proof workforce.

10,31-1-20,Police academy lessons,"While dispersing crowds or unlawful assemblies, men in uniform have to bear in mind that their charter is limited to restoration of normalcy, not teaching the crowd a lesson

Undoubtedly, internal security along with law and order are integral to our domestic affairs. But sometimes, their handling by various State police forces leaves much to be desired. Several pictures of police handling of the students in the recent anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) agitation have not only stained the uniform but also the reputation of the police as a well-trained unit. Reports of women protesting at night in the open, being forcibly deprived of their blankets by policemen, hardly give them any credit. Senior officers being in a denial mode, even as the death toll in firings continued to rise — which appeared to be quite disproportionate to the level of protest, besides, usage of a particular phraseology — all point towards an unprofessional conduct. Similarly, the alleged police action inside the library of a university and inaction at another university remain inexplicable.

In the context of the agitation against CAA-NRC-NPR, section 144 of the Code of Criminal procedure and its prohibitory powers with the executive have been much in the news. In fact, this law is a legacy of the pre-independence days. There is a history behind this provision, which goes back to the administration of one of the Princely States, way back in the 1860s. When the Code of Criminal Procedure was being finalised before its publication in 1898, the utility of this law was recognised and it was incorporated as section 144. In the Code, the colonial masters had used the provisions of this law as unbridled executive power over the freedom fighters. After the Britishers left, the Government of India has retained the Code as inherited, along with Section 144. The difference is that after independence, in the Constitution of India, in the chapter on fundamental rights, we have Article 19, which protects the rights of an individual for freedom of speech and expression along with right to assemble peacefully and without arms, besides other similar rights.

Immediately after the promulgation of the Constitution in 1950, there arose a need to balance the provisions of Article 19. At that time, the Constituent Assembly had converted itself into a provisional Parliament as the General Elections for the first Lok Sabha were still quite far in the future. Also, at that time there was no Rajya Sabha. On the question of amending the Constitution, it was accepted that the provisional Parliament was fully empowered for amending the Constitution. The need for the 1st Amendment in 1951 by the provisional Parliament had arisen because the right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) was interpreted to be so liberal that “it would not render a person culpable even if he directly incited violence and abused his freedom.” In the background is the case of Romesh Thappar (1950), where a view was taken by the Supreme Court that local breaches of public order were no grounds for restricting the freedom of speech. Later, this was revised after Dr Ram Manohar Lohia’s case (1966), where it was held that an activity which affects “law and order” may not necessarily affect “public order” and an activity prejudicial to “public order” may not necessarily affect “security of the State.” At the same time an act which merely affects the security of others may not constitute a breach of “public order.”

Over the years, there have been several celebrated cases where the applicability of Section 144 has been adjudicated at various levels. An order under 144 CrPC restricts the fundamental rights of the citizen and can adversely affect the interest of parties but is subject to judicial review. It has been held that the order must be in writing, stating the reasons for imposition of restrictions. In Dr Praveen Bhai Togadia’s case, the Supreme Court had taken the view that “it would interfere only if the order was patently illegal or without jurisdiction or with ulterior motive and on extraneous consideration of political victimisation by those in power. Normally, interference should be the exception and not the rule.”

In Baba Ramdev’s case, at Ramlila Maidan (June, 2011), the Supreme Court had observed certain contradictions in the affidavits of Union Home Secretary and the Police Commissioner. It was also mentioned that most of the gathering was asleep around 1.30 am and as such could not have posed any imminent threat. The justification for use of force at that hour of the night was also found inadequate. The impact of Section 144 is remedial and of a preventive nature, which must adhere to the test of proportionality. Further, freedom of expression being integral to democracy, the Supreme Court has held that in case those, who hold elected offices, felt that it was their duty to criticise any law promulgated as unconstitutional and against public interest and discuss that in public, it was protected by Article 19(1) (a) of the Constitution. Laying down the basic conditions for use of Section 144, it has been held that disturbances of public tranquility, riots and affray lead to subversion of public order and they need to be prevented in time. At the same time nuisances dangerous to human life, health and safety have to be abated and prevented, keeping in mind always that orders have to be in writing and are justiciable.

Even if on paper, adequate justification for promulgation of 144 CrPC exists, the core of the problem lies at the use of force while dispersing an unlawful assembly. One of the centralities of police training throughout the country is minimal use of force. In case its use becomes essential, then it has to be appropriately moderated and calibrated. A certain extent of sensitivity while facing a crowd of women and children, or students, needs to be observed. Unfortunately, at times, in the heat of the moment and in a developing situation, one loses patience and all the “mantras” learnt during training and refresher courses are lost sight of.

The situation can, however, be rectified by separation of law and order from investigation and having dedicated police personnel to handle such situations. The police forces, while dispersing the crowds or unlawful assemblies, have to bear in mind that their charter is limited to restoration of normalcy in the area by use of force or otherwise. Becoming violent and trying to teach the crowd a lesson by unbridled use of force should not even be thought of. To maintain a degree of restraint in spite of provocations requires a very tough mental training, which may be possible only if there are specialised units for handling such situations. This takes us back to separation of forces dealing with enforcement of law and order from crime-related police functions.

11,31-1-20,A ban too late,"The BJP’s tinder-box speeches have had a bigoted youth shooting at protesters. Delhi polls are no more local

The Election Commission (EC) may have banned Union Minister Anurag Thakur and MP Parvesh Verma as star campaigners and even set a curfew for their public speeches but that isn’t enough to counter the hate propaganda the BJP has unleashed. One that is manifesting itself as misplaced warriors and jeopardising the Delhi polls. For while the EC has been proactive enough to ban them for their incendiary remarks branding all disagreeing citizens as traitors or terrorists, the bottle has been uncorked. It doesn’t take rocket science to understand that when there is open exhortation to “shoot the traitors” and a mass frenzy worked up over having identified the “real enemy” from the entrails of a nation divided, there will be consequences. One that saw some delinquent firing at a protester in Jamia with a crusade-like zeal and mischievously justifying it in the name of Lord Rama. May be he was a sympathiser, who has indulged in theatrics simply to effect a plot twist. But let’s not forget, daredevilry thrives in an atmosphere that emboldens it. So far, divisive politics was confined to the game of numbers and electoral compulsions. Even the voter could sense that. Now, in the new regime that wants to overturn the civilisational idea of India into a militaristic trap of Hinduism, it is an opium that has dulled people’s minds into submission and a willing suspension of belief. They now have internalised the politician’s logic as their own. Therein lies the problem that no Election Commission diktat can tame. Perhaps, it could have halted the adventurism last year itself, when most BJP bigwigs, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, unleashed inflammatory campaigns prior to the Lok Sabha elections. But it let them off without so much as a censure, raising the first questions of institutional propriety. Once a threshold has been crossed, be it by an inch or a mile, it really doesn’t matter; the transgression has been all but sanctioned. And now that the BJP has a monolithic charge of governance, there is really no fear of crossing the line, leave alone civility. Which is why a new stricture won’t stop these motormouths from door to door canvassing. So apart from being a disincentive, there is no stopping their propagandist run, just that it won’t be overt but insidious.

The BJP has nothing to lose in its no-holds barred campaign, desperate as it is to get a hold of Delhi’s heart though it has got all the Lok Sabha seats in its kitty. The only way it can forge a change is to replicate the national agenda at the locality level, rather make the national local. This tinder-box politics has so far served it good and if indeed it manages to harden the faultlines and inflame passions, it might be able to make inroads. So it has consciously crafted its campaign for the Delhi polls, mainly on the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) to consolidate Hindu votes among communities from the Hindi heartland where the issue has found positive resonance, namely the Purvanchalis and the Pahadis. Besides, now that the abrogation of Article 370 and the Ram temple are on the “work done” list, the BJP will be using every opportunity to push its citizenship law. Why this becomes significant as a voter’s choice is because a citizenship document becomes a qualifier of sorts for future Government largesse and benefits. Also, the party is betting big on momentary aggression, knowing full well that any punitive action, backlash and outrage can only come after the remarks have had their intended effect. That’s why Thakur lashed out at the Aam Aadmi Party(AAP), the Congress and anti-CAA protesters as traitors. Verma raised the spectre of Shaheen Bagh’s anti-CAA protesters “entering homes to rape and kill women” and vowed to raze mosques in the Muslim-majority colony. Perhaps, the BJP has got it wrong on the women of Shaheen Bagh, who have pioneered this movement without seeking endorsement and refused to become a subset of the politics of the day. Also, the party, which has been championing the protection of Muslim women by going to town with the Triple Talaq Act, certainly isn’t concerned about their other issues like the impact of citizenship and identity politics on their homes and lives. Or would it want to devalue the women of Shaheen Bagh as an aberration or worse, misguided and fielded by “urban Naxals?” Or may be, just may be, the party has given up its pretence of tokenism. That perhaps explains the mass resignations of Muslim members from the BJP’s unit in Madhya Pradesh. The gloves are off, the fangs are out. And when lives are at stake, seldom does anybody want to talk about improving them.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-ban-too-late-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/a-ban-too-late.html
12,31-1-20,Exciting little discovery,"Compact Sedans are not meant to be exciting. Or are they?

It has become rather fashionable to blame former Finance Minister P Chidambaram for a lot of things. But one thing that those of us who write about cars can rightly accuse Chidambaram of is having inadvertently given birth to the Compact Sedan segment. By keeping cars below four metres in length in a lower excise category in a budget about a decade ago, Chidambaram thought he was promoting small hatchbacks. But Tata Motors developed the Indigo CS, a sedan with a boot that came in at under 4,000 millimetres in length, enough to get some excise benefits. This spurred several manufacturers to come up with something similar. Maruti Suzuki first made a sedan out of the Swift, the Dzire, and in the second-generation of the Dzire, it created what is by far one of the most successful cars ever made in India. The second-generation Dzire became the small taxi of choice across the length and breadth of the country. And other manufacturers cottoned onto this as well, which gave us the Hyundai Xcent, Honda Amaze and Ford Aspire.

But let me be honest, early design attempts at Compact Sedans were, well, pretty terrible. Designers stuck inside a tightly confined box, which just took a meat cleaver to the back-end of the car. Either that or they just added a little ‘third box’ to the hatchbacks, making you scratch your head when looking at the cars. To call them aesthetically pleasing would mean that one’s sense of aesthetics have gone awry. However, as they got more used to the restrictions and managed to work around the entire vehicle, they became better. The third-generation Dzire and second-generation Amaze along with the Tata Tiago and Ford Aspire are smart-looking cars. Yes, there is that sense that they’re trying to fit into a shirt, one size too small, but compared to previous iterations, they are clearly way better.

Then there is Hyundai and the new Aura. While I was never a fan of the original Santro’s look, and Hyundai has had some strange cars after that, I am looking at Eon as contemporary Hyundai cars are extremely attractive. From the Venue to the Verna, the forthcoming Tucson and the third-generation i20, which will be showcased at the Auto Expo 2020, Hyundai’s design language has evolved to a nice place. My long-term car right now is the refreshed Hyundai Elantra as it stands out with its very sharp looks. But this is about the Aura, and I am afraid to say that the rear-end of the car is well, strange! I don’t understand the need for the blacked-out C-pillar and the reflector strip through the boot. While I would not be so extreme as to call this an aesthetic assault, let us just leave this here by saying that I am not a fan. Which is a pity because I really do like the i10 Nios hatchback that the Aura is based on.

But when you drive the Aura, specifically the one with 1.0 litre Turbo, you forget the way the car looks because it suddenly proves that Compact Sedans can move. Sure, there have been 100 horsepower compact sedans before but those have been diesel. And while I do not want to get into a debate on the merits of diesel and petrol right now, it suffices to say that petrol engines are more responsive that diesel ones. I have driven the Venue with the same turbo engine and just like in the Aura, Hyundai’s powertrain engineers have managed to work out the kinks leaving almost no perceptible turbo-lag.

This is a properly nice engine and when it is coupled to a car with great ride and superb handling, you forget about the rear-end. On the roads that lead to the Jam Gate outside Mhow, which is the entrance through the pass onto the fertile plains of Malwa, you begin to have some fun. And this was with three people and a lot of equipment in the car, which cannot be called a light load. It took all the corners with aplomb and while you do need to mash the gears in the lower end of the powerband, once you hit the sweet spot, it is a very rewarding powerband. Despite the ‘fun’, non-economical, I had driven the Aura, which still delivered a quite surprising 13 kilometres to the litre. The lightweight and good road handling qualities helped in delivering a decent fuel economy even when you want to have some fun.

Compact Sedans were born out of a lacunae in the rules. They have become a practical solution for those who wanted the convenience of a boot and there is a reason the taxi segment adopted it en masse. But Compact Sedans were never ‘fun’ and I never thought that I would see the day when I could describe one of them as fun. But the Aura Turbo is actually a fun car that is not just nice to drive but practical as well. And there are variants with a 1.2 BS6 diesel and a 1.2 BS6 petrol, which, though not as peppy as the turbo, share the great ride and handling characteristics. Having said that, the managing director of Hyundai India, SS Kim told me that almost a third of Venue sales have been of the car equipped with the same Turbo engine. We also know that Hyundai is fitting the same engine in the Nios and that the i20 could come up with an even more powerful power unit. And to deliver power and fun at a decent ex-showroom price — Rs 8.54 lakh — the Aura Turbo could be a game changer. Personally, I’d stick to a hatchback and can’t wait for the Turbo Nios.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/exciting-little-discovery-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/exciting-little-discovery.html
13,31-1-20,What a start?,"India has had a great beginning to the game calendar. Let’s hope the boys can keep it up

It would take a very mean-spirited person to not feel bad for New Zealand cricket captain Kane Williamson. Losing by a hair’s breadth at the World Cup, possibly with some serious questions asked of the umpiring, he has taken a lot on his shoulders. And recently at home, where New Zealand lost to India thanks to Mumbai ace Rohit Sharma hitting two maximums in the last two balls of a super over to win India a T20 match and a series, he will be asked questions. The manner in which India won the third match has some great portents for the Indian cricket team in 2020. Say what you will about Virat Kohli but India’s cricket captain has brought in a new attitude, belief and confidence. That ignores how he has inspired a new level of fitness and diets among his teammates. His winning spree has also inspired a level of fanatical loyalty in his team and their most ardent followers, a level of loyalty that even Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not command despite an attendant PR machinery at his service. Kohli gets his team to win and do so consistently. Not even Kohli’s predecessor MS Dhoni has managed such a feat.

Can Kohli, Sharma and their teammates carry on this winning formula to the T20 World Cup later this year? After all, while Kohli has been a team member in a couple of World Cup wins, he has yet to lead India to a title and that remains an empty space in his tremendous resume. His winning mentality should now bring us a World Cup. As Rohit said in a post-match interview, it was important for team members to step up given the enormity of the occasion. This team spirit was also evident in the manner Rohit acknowledged Mohammad Shami’s contribution to the big day. Shami got rid of Kane Williamson in the final over and followed it up with the wicket of Ross Taylor in the final delivery of the 20th over. And through those taut moments, Shami held his nerves to execute a picture-perfect yorker to get rid of Taylor off the final ball where New Zealand required one run to win. Perfect grace under pressure. Of course, there is no taking away the limelight from Rohit. He is just 32 and has already scored over 8,000 runs in ODIs. He is the only batsman in history to smash three double hundreds in ODI cricket, a feat difficult to replicate. If his fitness holds, Rohit can blast several records and hold the top order with Shikhar Dhawan and Kohli and give our bowlers the pitch to clean up the rest.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/what-a-start--2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/what-a-start-.html
14,31-1-20,Yogi: Anti-CAA protesters speaking Pak’s language,"



|

Firing a fresh salvo at the anti-CAA protesters, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath accused them of “speaking the language of Pakistan” and warned that such acts would not be tolerated.

Speaking at the convocation of a nursing college in Gorakhpur on Thursday, Yogi said, “Those staging protests at several places are directly or indirectly speaking Pakistan’s language. The country is being cheated in the name of protests. Such acts won’t be tolerated or accepted.”

Without taking names of any party or leaders, the chief minister criticised “distinguished personalities” who had extended their support to the protests.

“Some self-proclaimed intellectuals are misleading people about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens to create unrest in the country,” he said.

“When reporters at India Gate asked protesters the reason for the protest or about the law they were against, surprisingly they did not know anything about it. This proves that they are misled and we need to come forward to stop them as such people are a hindrance to development,” Yogi said.

Comparing the minorities in India and Pakistan, the chief minister said, “Muslims in India became presidents of the country and judges of Supreme Court while in Pakistan, it is difficult to find any Hindu, Sikh, Christian or Jain holding top posts,” he said.

Yogi advised the students to always treat patients with compassion and humanity.

Earlier. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath took a holy dip in the Sangam in Prayagraj on the auspicious occasion of Basant Panchami on Thursday morning along with some of his Cabinet colleagues and performed Ganga Pujan.

He also enjoyed kite flying and released balloons with cleanliness messages.

The Ganga Yatra which arrived here on Wednesday from Mirzapur, was flagged off for Kaushambi.

To ensure that the crowd of bathers was not disturbed, the chief minister was taken to Arail Ghat from where he took a boat to reach the Sangam where he took a dip and then performed Ganga Pujan.

Bharatiya Janata Party state chief Swatantra Dev Singh accompanied the chief minister along with ministers Mahendra Singh, Sidharth Nath Singh, and Nand Gopal Gupta Nandi.

The chief minister also went to the selfie point to get snapped there in the Mela area.

After taking a holy dip at the Sangam the ministers reached the Circuit House from where the Ganga Yatra was flagged off for Kaushambi.

Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma, Mahendra Singh, Rajendra Pratap Singh alias Moti Singh accompanied the Ganga Yatra for Kaushambi.

The Ganga Yatra will conclude at the Ganga Barrage in Kanpur on Friday.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/yogi--anti-caa-protesters-speaking-pak---s-language.html

19,31-1-20,Sapre Museum should be developed as tourist centre: Nath,"Chief Minister Kamal Nath has said that the Sapre Museum is a historical place which has not only covered the history of the newspaper world but also has all the features for being developed as a better tourist centre. Therefore, it should also be developed as a tourist centre.

Nath was addressing the closing ceremony of the seminar held on the completion of 100 years of Karmaveer magazine, edited by Pandit Makhanlal Chaturvedi, a well-known national freedom fighter. On this occasion, the Chief Minister dedicated the reference book ‘Karmaveer Ke Sau Saal’. At the onset, the Chief Minister garlanded the portrait of Pandit Makhanlal Chaturvedi on his death anniversary and paid tributes.

The Chief Minister said that it is a coincidence that today is the death anniversary of the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi and national poet Pandit Makhanlal Chaturvedi both. He said that Mahatma Gandhi is an ideology which shows the way of becoming the whole world a better nation and a peaceful life for its citizens. He said that he compelled the world’s biggest imperial power to leave India through truth and non-violence. He said that national poet Pt Makhanlalji created new zeal in the freedom struggle through his patriotic poems and his forceful writing. He was the pride and glory of our State.

Kamal Nath said that while on the one hand Mahatma Gandhi gave the message of peace to the whole world, on the other hand Ambedkar paved the way for the world through an egalitarian constitution.

Recalling his Africa visit, the Chief Minister said that when he visited the President of a country, he happened to see pictures of Mahatma Gandhi and Bhimrao Ambedkar Baba Saheb in his room. “I thought perhaps the pictures were put up because of my visit, but this was not so”.

Not mentioning the country and President’s name due to political reasons, he said that the President told him that the egalitarian outlook adopted by India in the formation of the Constitution is a source of inspiration for our country’s Constitution. “Referring to Gandhiji, the President told that their country had adopted the path of non-violence of Gandhiji to establish peace and free the country from violence”.

He said that it is the biggest need today to follow the Gandhian way taking into the account the challenges and unrest in the entire world.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sapre-museum-should-be-developed-as-tourist-centre--nath.html

Elaborating on the manual, he said that it would be given to the applicants of learner’s license alongwith the application. It would be mandatory to buy the manual, which would serve as one stop source information and soft skills required for safe road-use.

It has been developed as a source that allows novice road users to gain knowledge, he said.For instance, the rules of ‘Right of Way’ i.e. who has the right to go first in any situation is not explained to the road users. Such rules have also been included in it, he further said.

“A picture is worth a thousand words” and the handbook has been drafted in such a way so that even a less educated person can understand it easily, Sidhu added.

Besides introducing a road safety manual, the Administration has also decided to include road safety education in the school curriculum from next academic session in the city.

As per the data with UT Traffic Police, a total of 316 road accidents were reported in 2018, out of which 294 were due to rash driving, 12 were caused due to drunken driving and 10 due to red light jumping.

The police nabbed Shahrukh and Mohsin alias Chotu who killed Aslam who was found dead after he went to transport goods in his auto rickshaw.

The reason behind the murder was Shahrukh’s one- sided love towards Aslam’s wife when he used to live as a tenant at his house but when he found that without removing Aslam, he could not win his wife, he planned to kill and took the help of his friend, Mohsin.

Shahrukh asked to transport goods and accompanied him in his auto rickshaw from Karond square while Mohsin, who was on his bike, gave paan sedated with drug (Bhang) and when Asalam went dizzy, they overpowered him and strangulated him to death and slit his throat and escaped from the spot.

25,31-1-20,"A number of personalities raise voices against NRC, CAA and NPR","During the mega protest organised in Bhopal against the NRC, CAA and NPR at historical Iqbal Maidan, a number of personalities raised their voices against contentious citizenship legislations on Thursday.

Around 30 personalities addressed a huge gathering on the occasion. They included Narmada Bachao Andolan founder Medha Patkar, senior journalist Arfa Khanum, JNU Students’ Union president, Aishe Ghosh, Jamia students –Zaqir Riyaz and Chanda.

Addressing the protest attended by a few thousand locals from Old city Bhopal, JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh said, “I would take with me the spark ignited by the Bhopal people to JNU. We are prepared to hold a long march to make the rulers of this country bow down, she added. She remembered late dalit student Rohith Vemula on his birthday saying if we don’t understand education now, we won’t be able to understand the history ever.”

She likened JNU spirit to that carried by the legendary freedom fighter Bhagat Singh claiming that the revolutionary had the courage to confront the British at the time when many used to sing their tunes.

Whenever there is any election around, they (BJP) raise JNU issues and brand them as their enemies, she added alleging the BJP Government introduced demonetisation to fight black money and eradicate Maoism but nothing happened. “We would study and fight as well.” JNU would continue to voice dissent against this draconian law and would force the government to bow down, affirmed Ghosh who was recently attacked by armed youths inside JNU campus.

A spokesperson of Bureau of Investigation said that Vijay Kumar, Location Manager Investigation, Risk Intelligence and Control Unit, HDFC Bank submitted an application on alleging a fraud of around Rs. 2 crore from a bank account of the HDFC Bank in a tech savvy manner.

The spokesman said all the money withdrawals were done by the fraudsters through ATM cards and cheques thereby leaving no trail for the Police to follow. Moreover, the Mobile used were made functional only during the operation and remained non-accessible thereafter.

During the course of investigation, it was found that the racket was operating from Ludhiana and consisted of at least 3 persons. One of the gang members was identified as Rajeev Kumar of New Shimlapauri, Ludhiana.

The spokesman said on the basis of the physical verification and emerging details, 3 accused were nominated in this Case and out of them, two accused namely Rajeev Kumar and Deepak Kumar Gupta of Shimlapuri were arrested from Ludhiana. However one accused managed to escape.

32,31-1-20,"MLAs raise corruption issue, thorough probe needed: Hooda","Leader of Opposition in Haryana Assembly and former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda termed three month old coalition Government of BJP-JJP as non-functional and said, he has been wondering when this Government would start working?

He says, he has been raising the issue of corruption since long and had stated on several occasions about rampant corruption in various departments of the State Government. As MLAs of coalition partner too are raising corruption issue, it should be investigated thoroughly.

Hooda who won in the 2019 Haryana Assembly election from the Garhi Sampla-Kiloi seat, said there has been dissatisfaction among the MLAs of coalition partner and independent MLAs since the formation of the coalition Government in the State. He said the mandate given by the people was against the BJP Government but the coalition Government was formed against public sentiments.

In an interview with The Pioneer, Hooda assesses the coalition Government, Delhi Assembly election and the issues to be raised in the upcoming budget session.

Excerpts from the interview:

JJP MLAs say there is a corruption in various departments of the State government. How do you see this?

I have been raising the issue of corruption since long. Now MLAs of JJP and independent MLA too are raising it. This is a serious matter which the government should take seriously and conduct a thorough investigation promptly. Those who are involved in corruption should be punished. The allegations leveled against former minister Manish Grover by Independent MLA Balraj Kundu of Meham are also serious and needs to be investigated.

JJP MLAs say that people’s concerns are not redressed in their constituency. How are Congress MLAs placed?

We are in politics for the people. Whosoever wins the election and form the Government, public should not suffer. As JJP MLAs have raised this issue, government should take it seriously.

Three MLAs supporting government--Ram Kumar Gautam and Devendra Babli of JJP and Independent Balraj Kundu have posed a threat to the coalition government. Do you think BJP-JJP government will complete its five year tenure?

It is well-known to all how MLAs of coalition partners are coming out openly against the government and their leadership. A coalition has been formed by rejecting the mandate, which has nothing to do with the common people. Such a Government would soon fall under its own weight and there is no need to topple it.

Congress leaders have accused the then BJP government of its failure to tackle the Jat reservation agitation-2016. 54 accused who set fire to the house of former Haryana Finance Minister Captain Abhimanyu in Rohtak have been reported to be forgiven. What’s your comment?

We welcome all the moves taken by the Jat leaders for the betterment of the people.

How do you assess three months of this coalition Government?

Instead of public interest, the government is taking decisions that is of no use to the people. Till now the Government has neither set its direction nor taken any major steps to improve the condition of the people. This Government has no work to show in three months.

How do you see the role of Congress in Delhi Assembly elections?

Many Haryana Congress leaders including me would start campaigning for the party candidates in Delhi from February 2.

People of Haryana origin in Delhi will support Congress party candidates. People are fed up with BJP as it fails to meet the expectation of the common people. I am sure that people would support Congress and it will form the government in Delhi.

Recently senior leaders of various political parties made controversial and communal statements during their rallies. Being a former chief minister and senior politicians of the country, what would you say to these leaders?

I would only say election should be fought on issues. No one should make statements which divide people on the basis of caste and religion. Bitterness was being spread among people by the particular party leaders to divert attention from these issues. Voters should be cautious while exercising their votes.

What are the issues which Congress will raise in the forthcoming Budget session of Haryana Assembly?

Government has no industrial policy to attract investors and generate employment. There has been economic slowdown over the past many months. Besides, poverty and unemployment are increasing with each passing day and farmers were suffering. Issues related to farmers, traders, employees, dearness, unemployment among others will be raised during the session.

State government has planned to shutdown around 1025 schools where numbers of students are not as per set guidelines. Your comment.

It is against the interest of the people, especially poor. The children of poor section of the society study in government schools. In such a situation, the government should not close these schools.

Why do you often ask when will the BJP-JJP led coalition government start working?

Around a month ago, there was hailstorm in many places and government’s presence among the farmers was invisible. The cost for growing sugarcane increased but the rate has not yet been raised. The situation is such that the government is selling the land of the mill to meet the losses of the Palwal sugar mill. This government has become direction less. The government is engaged only in the transfer of officers, they do not take care in solving the problem. Moreover, the coalition government has been in power for almost three months, but till date Common Minimum Programme (CMP) has not been decided. This government is directionless, it has no minimum common programme, but just talks about it.

Government claims law and order are under control and they have succeeded in putting check on crime. How do you see their claims?

As per data of various departments including NCRB, the state which was number one in terms of development earlier, is now number one in the case of crime. As per reports, murders, rapes and kidnapping cases are reported daily in the State. Everyday incidents of some kind harassment with women are increasing. Large numbers of Vehicles are stolen daily. There is an increase in incidents of theft, robbery, robbery and extortion. Haryana leads the country in kidnapping of children. Haryana also ranks third in the country in terms of riots.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mlas-raise-corruption-issue--thorough-probe-needed--hooda.html

35,31-1-20,MCD adding Rs 15-20 lakh property tax to its kitty daily,"About Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh are being deposited per day in the Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) by citizens depositing property tax. The MCD tax superintendent Dharmesh Painuly said that the arrival of property taxpayers has dropped following extension of the period for the rebate on the property tax by one month.

While talking to The Pioneer, Dharmesh Painuly said, ""The collection of property tax keeps fluctuating regularly. Sometimes it's rupees 30 lakh in a day and sometimes it's just 12 lakh but on an average, the collection remains around 15 to 20 lakh per day.""

He further added that people generally deposit tax during the proximity of the last date for the granted rebate.

Since the rebate on the residential tax has been extended till February 15, most of the people will deposit the tax near or on this date.

According to Deputy Municipal Commissioner Rohitash Sharma, various factors have an effect on the submission of the tax on day to day basis like weather, change in traffic plan, and protesting traders.

Informing about the online process for new taxpayers Painuly said, “For the first time registration of non-residential properties, a taxpayer would have to fill the form and submit the documents personally in MCD but after getting the bill through the counter, the tax can be paid online as well as offline.""

However according to Rohitash Sharma even though the facility of submitting tax is provided online, people still prefer to submit the tax in MCD by getting in the line rather than the comfort of their home.

when asked about the people complaining that the online site is showing wrong figures of taxes, Painuly said, "" It is in the case of hardly one or two per cent people as the rate of taxes have been revised and moreover some people did not fill the right and mandatory details of their property, so sometimes our system is showing the different amount.

Therefore, if somebody finds the tax amount shown on the website wrong, it can be corrected in any of the counter here after they mention all the mandatory details."" Regarding the commercial tax, Painuly said that so far the amount of rupees 18 crore has been collected by MCD and since the last date of the rebate on commercial tax is January 31, people will submit it in the last few days. About extending the period for the rebate in the commercial tax he said that no decision has been taken for now by MCD.

It is pertinent to mention here that the last date of submission of property tax with a rebate of 20 per cent was extended by Dehradun mayor Sunil Uniyal 'Gama' from January 15 to February 15. Besides, the rebate of 20 per cent is also given to commercial taxpayers whereas five per cent additional rebate is set for the taxpayers of the new wards.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mcd-adding-rs-15-20-lakh-property-tax-to-its-kitty-daily.html

37,31-1-20,Tributes paid to Mahatma Gandhi on death anniversary,"Glowing tributes were paid to the Father of Nation, Mahatma Gandhi on his death anniversary on Thursday. The day was celebrated as ‘ Ekta Diwas’ by the Congress party.

Addressing a programme organised by the party at the state headquarters of the Congress party, the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president, Pritam Singh said that the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi on peace and non violence should be spread and every Indian should be made aware about them.

He said that it is unfortunate that people who supported the polices of Nathuram Godse, the murderer of Gandhi, sitting in power and are now murdering the ideas of the father of the nation. Singh said that the Congress party has always supported the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi and have believed in the progress of every section of the society.

He said that Mahatma Gandhi resolved to throw the English out of the country and gave the slogan of ‘ Quit India’. Lakhs of men and women followed Gandhi and chanted the slogan of Quit India which filled the British rulers with fear and they started suppressing the freedom struggle with brute force.

“The freedom fighters were cane-charged and even bullets were sprayed over them, many were imprisoned but all this failed to deter the freedom fighters from their path. Their steely resolve paved the way for the liberation of the country,’’ he said.

The PCC president that the thoughts and ideas of the Mahatma Gandhi are still relevant today and the whole world wants to follow the path shown by him. He said that we should always remember the role played by the freedom fighters in achieving the freedom and all the members of the Congress party pay tribute to them.

Singh said that the all the Congressmen take pride in being the flag bearers of the tradition of Gandhi and his ideas. He said that inspiration from life and ideas of Mahatma Gandhi should be used in nation building and this would be the biggest tribute to the father of nation. The PCC president felicitated senior members of the party on the occasion. Former ministers Dinesh Agarwal, Matbar Singh Kandari, Vice President Surya Kant Dhasmana, Sanjay Paliwal, former MLA Vijay Pal Sajwan, Aryendra Sharma, B S Negi, Mahanagar President Lal Chand Sharma, Navin Payal, Pranita Badoni, R P Raturi, Garima Dasauni and large number of party leaders and workers were present on the occasion.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/tributes-paid-to-mahatma-gandhi-on-death-anniversary.html

40,31-1-20,SAD campaign for BJP in Delhi,"Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday lashed out at the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) for bartering away the constitutional principles to promote their political interest, with their latest U-turn over supporting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Delhi assembly polls.

Capt Amarinder, reacting to SAD president Sukhbir Badal’s latest statement that the party had thrown its weight behind the BJP in Delhi, said that these flip-flops had nailed the Akali lies on their stand on the unconstitutional and divisive Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Referring to Sukhbir’s explanation for the U-turn that the ‘miscommunications’ between the two parties had been sorted out, Capt Amarinder demanded to know whether the BJP had

agreed to amending the CAA in line with SAD’s earlier stand, or the Akalis had once again surrendered themselves to the BJP at the cost of the nation’s interest.

“You owe an explanation to the people,” he told Sukhbir, castigating him for SAD’s “unprincipled” stand on the issue of grave concern, which had been getting exposed every second day, since they openly and wholeheartedly supported CAA in the Parliament.

SAD’s decision to backtrack on its earlier stand to extend its support to BJP in Delhi just a week before the scheduled polls indicated that they had used CAA as a bargaining chip to secure some political gains, said the Chief Minister.

This development, he said, clearly exposed the Akalis’ selfish intentions and the Badal family’s desperation to hold on to power as part of the ruling alliance at the Centre.

Capt Amarinder said that Sukhbir’s shameless face-about on the issue showed that the Badals had no longer had any qualms about abandoning even the pretense of the SAD being a principled party. It was sad that a party formed to uphold certain principles no longer care about political ethics, nor did it seem concerned about following the ideology of the great Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak Dev, who had propagated the oneness of all beings, irrespective of their religion, he added.

Rather than quitting the ruling NDA, which would have been the right thing to do after claiming not to support CAA without inclusion of Muslims, Sukhbir had chosen to stay with the BJP, whatever the cost for the people of India, the Chief Minister quipped.

“SAD U-turn in Delhi had also further accentuated the divide within the Akalis, which appeared to be on the verge of another split,” said Capt Amarinder, adding that the party was clearly a divided House and no longer capable of giving a political fight on its own, which had become evident in Haryana.

“Obviously, they need the BJP to hand-hold them on the political ladder, especially in view of the fact that elections in Punjab are just two years away and they have no political leg to stand on,” he said adding that no wonder Sukhbir had been constrained to clarify, just two days ago, that the SAD-BJP alliance in Punjab was intact.

HITTING BACK, SAD SAYS CAPT’S STATEMENT PROVES CONG’s ANXIETY IN DELHI

Reacting to Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s about SAD-BJP unity, SAD on Thursday said that tone and tenor of the statement itself reflects Congress’ anxiety and nervousness and proved that the alliance has severely affected the prospects of Congress party in Delhi polls.

Before asking SAD that why it supported its old and time tested ally BJP, the Chief Minister should have offered his explanation that why he is going to support the same Congress party which has massacred thousands of innocent Sikhs in the streets of Delhi and other parts of the country, said SAD senior vice president and spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema.

SAD also questioned the Chief Minister that had he perused the contents of latest Justice Dhingra report on 1984 Sikh massacre which clearly states that not only the Sikhs were massacred by goons led by Congress leaders, but the Congress party went to the extent of hushing up their cases and misused the police and judiciary.

Cheema urged the Chief Minister that if he is so much against the CAA, he should dare visit 30,000 Afghanistani Sikh families who were settled in Delhi after migrating from their motherland because of religious persecution.

He said that it will give Capt Amarinder a reason that why the SAD supported the CAA.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad-campaign-for-bjp-in-delhi.html
41,31-1-20,Capt asks PWD not to disturb baring college building’s heritage status,"Days after Congress’ Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa raised the issue of road cutting through Batala’s minority institute, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday directed the State Public Works Department (PWD) to find an alternate route for the proposed new road in Batala instead of cutting through the heritage Baring Union Christian College building. Taking note of the protests by the students and local residents over the PWD proposal to construct a road through the playground of the institution, set up more than 140 years ago as Baring School, on April 1, 1878, the Chief Minister made it clear that the heritage building would not be allowed to be spoilt in any manner.

The building, which had also served as the summer palace of Maharaja Sher Singh, was an iconic structure, with the minority institution continuing to groom many important personalities over the decades, Capt Amarinder pointed out.“It was not in the interest of the people of the region to allow a road to run through the college playground,” he said, adding that the purpose of having a new road to serve the region could easily be met by constructing it along an alternate route.

The Chief Minister said that the State Government was totally committed to protecting the interests of all the people, including the minorities, and would not undertake any initiative that would damage those interests.He directed the PWD to take into account the historic importance of buildings etc before initiating any infrastructural development plans in future.

It may be noted that the Batala Boys Boarding School had started classes in the palace of late Maharaja Sher Singh, called the Anarkali. Recorded history shows that the palace gradually transformed into a school, with dormitories, classrooms and Chapel. This marked the beginning of the establishment of western education in Batala town and tehsil, making the institution’s building an important landmark not just Batala but for Punjab.

The transition in the development of Baring High School to Baring Union Christian College was made during 1934-1948. The college officially came into existence on June 29, 1944, with about 75 students predominantly from Hindu, Muslim and Sikh background.

At the time of India’s partition, Baring College, which was then the only Christian college in East Punjab, came to Punjab.

Only days before, Bajwa had shot a letter to the Chief Minister alleging that minority institutions were being targeted under the Congress regime which could bring a bad name to the secular party.At the same time, the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee’s former president has also “requested” the Chief Minister to get the role of “such mischievous elements” probed and their sinister designs nipped in the bud.

Bajwa had alleged that some people in our State “intentionally” and with ulterior motive were trying to target minority institutions by damaging their property. “It seems that someone highly placed in political echelons, wants to malign the Congress party government in the state,” he had said.He had urged the Chief Minister to stall the plan of building a road that cuts through the playground of Baring Union Christian College, a minority institution in Batala.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/capt-asks-pwd-not-to-disturb-baring-college-building---s-heritage-status.html

48,31-1-20,BJP seeks clarification over cement price hike,"Chhattisgarh Leader of Opposition Dharamlal Kaushik has sought clarification from the state government over proposal to hike the cement prices by Rs 25 to Rs 50, alleging that the government is conniving with cement companies.

BJP leader said as per reports the cement companies are putting pressure on the state government to hike prices while the state government is sitting quite raising doubt about its intention.

He alleged “the silence of the state government is baffling as to why it is feeling the heat. Or is it a mode to receive election fund by hitting the pocket of common man.”

He questioned as to why without any valid reason the prices are being hiked as it will directly affect common man's dream to build house as his budget will overshoot. It will also badly hit the real estate industry.

The real estate industry feels that when cement companies are not at loss then why such a hike is proposed is beyond comprehension. Additional to it the steel and iron industries have not recorded any growth nor have any additional fees imposed on the limestone for the cement industry, he said. “Then why such rise is being initiated raises several doubts which state government should clarify,” the BJP leader demanded.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-seeks-clarification-over-cement-price-hike.html
49,31-1-20,Festival for classical tag for Odishi music from February 1,"As part of the ongoing initiatives for winning the elusive classical tag for Odishi music, city-based Sanskruttim cultural organisation headed by well-known Odishi dance exponent Kasturi Pattanaik would host a two-day event commencing on February 1 at the Rabindra Mandap here that includes an important seminar and a festival.

The seminar and festival are named after legendary poet, artist and arts promoter Kabichandra Kalicharan Patnaik, who is known to have named the dance form that emerged from Odisha as Odishi.

“It is an irony that while Odishi dance won classical status decades ago, Odishi music, an integral part of Odishi dance, is still struggling for the ‘classical’ tag despite Odishi being a distinct music tradition of India like the Hindustani and the Carnatic,” said Kasturi Pattanaik at a Press meet.

“The Department of Culture of Odisha and some other cultural institutions have been hosting seminars and performances from time to time to highlight Odishi music’s claim to classical fame. Kabichandra Kalicharan Patnaik Odishi music seminar and festival are one such effort,” stated Pattanaik who is an Odishi dance exponent also having grip over Odishi music.

“What Tagore means to Bengal, Kabichandra means that to Odisha. He has immensely influenced Odisha’s dance, music, theatre and cinema. Hence, we felt it befitting to name the festival and seminar after him as a tribute to the stalwart,” she explained.

The seminar on February 1 titled “Classical components of Odishi music” and scheduled to start at 10 am, would feature Sanskrit scholars Prof Prafulla Kumar Mishra and Prof Raghunath Panda as chairpersons for the two sessions. While musicologist Kirtan Narayan Padhi would deliver the keynote address, Odishi music researcher Tirthananda Mohanty would be the co-chairperson for the second session.

The speakers for the seminar include Odisha’s former Chief Secretary Subas Pani, who is known as a noted scholar on Jayadev’s Gita Gobinda; Odissi music Gurus Gopal Chandra Panda and Keshab Chandra Rout; well-known Odishi vocalists Bijay Kumar Jena, Sudha Mishra, Mitali Chinara, Sangita Gosain and Sangita Panda; mardal exponents Sachidananda Das and Jagannath Kuanr and flute exponent Mohini Mohan Patnaik.

“We have specially invited six eminent personalities for the seminar as guests and observers who matter most to Odishi music and dance. They are Prafulla Kar, Shantanu Mohapatra, Priyambada Mohanty-Hejmadi, Haramohan Khuntia, Shyamamani Debi and Kumkum Mohanty,” informed the hosts.

The festival on February 2 will feature, among others, solo recital by Guru Ramahari Das, Bijay Kumar Jena, duet by Mitali Chinara-Sangita Panda, trio by bandita Ray-Nazia Alam-Chandi Bhusan Mishra, group mardal recital led by Sachidananda Das and instrumental symphony by the Odishi Research Centre.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/festival-for-classical-tag-for-odishi-music-from-february-1.html

According to Negi,"" The locals of the area regularly complain about the foul smell and disease causing conditions of the environment near the waste management plant due to which children are bound to remain inside the four walls of their house and have to go to school or study in nearby schools by wearing masks.

Therefore we issued a notice to UEPPCB asking about what are they doing concerning the damage done to the environment in the area which has started to affect children.’’

She added, “If No Objection Certificate (NOC) has not been issued to MCD up till now then what is the reason behind it? If MCD is not working according to UEPPCB’s norms then they should make sure they do.

MCD's work is to dump the garbage but to check whether there are proper pieces of equipment for the disposal of garbage without any damage to the environment is the duty of Pollution Control Board.

The garbage of the whole city is dumped there, the improper treatment will unquestionably cause a foul smell and it's like inviting the diseases.

It is causing air pollution and degradation of the quality of water in the area too which is hazardous for children and everybody. I don’t understand whether the job of the Pollution Control Board is to control the pollution or alleviate it.”

On the statement of Dehradun municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey that there is no smell and the enzymes are regularly sprayed to sterilise the plant, she said, "" Municipal commissioner should rent a room in that location and stay there for a few days then he will know about the real situation. I have my office in the same location so I know the situation here.

Are the locals mad for protesting against it for so long? Furthermore, it is the duty of UEPPCB to monitor the plant and its disposal system so that it won't cause any trouble to locals, or causes any kind of damage to the environment.”

She added that if there will not be a satisfactory response from the board then further action will be taken by the department.

It is pertinent to mention here that locals of Sheeshambada are protesting against the operation of the solid waste management and recycling plant which is functioning without NOC for last from UEPPCB.

They have allegedly said that improper treatment of garbage in the plant is leading to various health problems like skin allergies and sickness among the residents of the area specially children.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/scprc-chairperson-warns-action-against-ueppcb.html

55,31-1-20,Anganwadi worker’s protest continues,"On the notice issued by the department to Anganwadi workers, state president of Anganwadi workers association Rekha Negi said that it is completely unfair to give them such notices repeatedly by the department.

According to the state president of Anganwadi Association, Rekha Negi, “We have been issued notices several times but we are not going anywhere without any settlement with the government.

The rumours of terminating other Anganwadi workers are spread across the state so that our protest can be weakened and then ultimately we give up and return to our work with a lousy allowance. The department cannot fire any women from Anganwadi from any district.” One of the Anganwadi workers Deepa Chaudhary said, “When we have already informed weeks ago that we are going on an indefinite strike to fight for our rights, how they can send us the notice with the warning of terminating us from our jobs.

Isn’t it a violation of human rights? Don’t we have the right to even raise our voices in this country? I don’t hear men get termination notice when they go on a strike, do they have permission to fight for their rights and we don’t.

Government says “Beti Padao Beti Bachao” but they don’t even care enough to communicate to the “beti” of their state for more than 55 days.”

Another Anganwadi worker Pinky Thapliyal added, “We thought that watching the women of their state going on a fast unto death strike, the government will at least initiate the conversation to know what we expect from them but it’s like we just do not exist.”

“We have taken out rallies, we have done candle march, we have been on protest for around two months and doing fast unto death for more than two weeks but there is no initiation of any talk from the government and they expect us to return to our job with their issued notice.

According to our State Women Empowerment and Child Development minister Rekha Arya, we work just for three hours whereas we have at least six working hours.

Therefore if the department will assure us that we'll not have to work just for three hours, will we ask for raise in our allowance nor will we do a single job after those three hours”, said the protesting Anganwadi worker Sarojini Anthwal.

On terminating the services of Anganwadi workers, the District Program Officer (DPO) Akhilesh Mishra had recently said that it is the duty of the department to ask them to return to their jobs but for terminating the service of any Anganwadi worker, a standard procedure will be followed by the department.

It is pertinent to mention here that for the past three days Anaganwadi workers Basanta Rawat and Madhurvadni Tiwari are on fast unto death while many protestors have been admitted to hospital by the police.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/anganwadi-worker---s-protest-continues.html

Union Mines Secretary Sushil Kumar has requested the State Governments in this regard as they are empowered to facilitate ease of doing business for the new leases.

The issue of pre-embedded statutory clearances is also one of the action points in Vision-2024 being finalised in the Government of India Committee chaired by the Prime Minister.

As per the rules, for execution of a mining lease, a successful bidder is required to obtain 20 clearances and approvals. Out of these approvals, the Union Government will provide nine while rest 11 will be extended by the State Governments.

Time required to obtain the clearances takes two to three years and the successful bidder will not be in a position to go for commencement of mining operations as soon as it gets the permission.

As the State Governments are the owners of the minerals, the entire process can be streamlined by making the State Governments as applicant for Central Government clearances.

Environment and forest clearances are the two major statutory requirements for commencement of mining operations, officials said. They said the State Governments paying requisite fees for such clearances would apply so that the process is expedited. The fees required for clearances can be built into the auction fees, said the officials.

In fact, the State Governments have agreed to this in the Coordination Committee Meeting held recently to put mineral blocks into auction with pre-embedded clearances. This would make the auction process more attractive and pave the way for higher investment, especially Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).

Secondly, as the lease period of 46 non-captive working mines are expiring on March 31, 2020 under Section 8A(6) of the MMDR Act, these mines are to be reallocated after auction under provisions of the MMDR Act.

The Ministry of Mines has requested the other concerned Ministries to expedite the process of providing clearances to successful bidders for these mines to ensure uninterrupted supply of raw material to the industries.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/centre-urges-state-to-make-mines-auction-attractive.html

74,31-1-20,Police avert clash over ‘Maha Dharna’,"Police averted a major clash with timely intervention here on Thursday. A dispute started after a section of CAA NRC protesters tried to hold a ""Maha Dharna"" at Aam Bagan ground in Sakchi. The clash started after local administration had refused permission for the programme.

The CAA-NRC protesters under the Samvidhan Bachao Sangharsh Samiti (SBSS) had erected structures for setting up a massive tent at the ground since last night.

As SBSS activists, including women had already started gathering at the ground to participate in dharna, more than 200 CAA-NRC supporters also reached at the ground and started protesting against the dharna.

Despite deployment of police force, SBSS activists started organising the Maha Dharna programme despite being denied permission, the CAA-NRC supporters demanded the Dhalbhum, sub-divisional officer, Chandan Kumar to vacate the ground and declare Section 144 for restricting anyone to hold any meeting there.

As the police tried to pacify both the groups, some of the SBSS activists started shouting slogans against CAA-NRC, triggering anger from the opponent side.

The situation became tensed when, one of the SBSS supporters went over to the spot where the CAA-NRC supporters were gathered and asked them to leave the place immediately. But as soon as the SBSS activist said so, the rival group surrounded him and thrashed, causing uproar at the ground. Instantly, a police party which was already stationed at the ground picked up the youth and removed him away, apprehending trouble. Subsequently, the SDO, Dhalbhum called in more police and increased security at the ground, forcing all, including the SBSS activists to vacate the ground.

Superintendent of police (city) Subhash Chandra Jat said that the administration had refused permission for it a day ago but a section of people claiming to be SBSS activists had tried to hold Maha Dharna.

"" The situation came close to clash when a section of SBSS activists opposing the CAA-NRC had started gathering at the Aam Bagan ground, the CAA-NRC supporters also started assembling there to foil the programme which was being held without orders. As there was arrangement of police, we did not allow the face-off between the pro and anti CAA-NRC to take an ugly turn. We tried to pacify both the groups,"" said Jat.

The City SP said they are looking into the whole affair and are contemplating to register cases under Section 107 of the CrPC against both the SBSS activists as well as the CAA-NRC supporters for creating a chaotic situation at the Aam Bagan ground.

Sakchi police station OC, Kunal Kumar said activists of both SBSS and CAA-NRC supporters have lodged complaints against each other with the police station. He said they have deployed security personnel at the ground.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/police-avert-clash-over----maha-dharna---.html
75,31-1-20,Travesty of 5T in Athagarh Forest Divn,"The much-hyped Mo Sarkar and 5T initiatives of the State Government look completely useless for the Athagarh Forest Division at present.

Here, the authorities run the office at their whim and pleasure. As per allegations, most of the staff members, including some officers, do not halt at the headquarters. Rather, they come regularly from Bhubaneswar in office vehicles.

Some employees of the division, requesting anonymity, say that these officers have very good rapport with Commissioners of allied departments, PCCF, 5T Commissioner VK Pandian, several pro-Government journalists and thereby the members of Bhubaneswar Club for which all allegations against them on negligence of duties go to dustbins.

These officers divert the attention of the people and the administration by giving superfluous information to the media of their choice. Recently, a rare leopard was killed in Tigiria jungle. The authority here burnt its body to hide the incident.

In the case for a token of action, the DFO suspended a Forester and a Guard for a very little period. Then to divert the attention of the media, the authority here published some paid news on pangolin smuggling in a south India based national English daily in Bhubaneswar dateline and also in a Cuttack based Odia daily.

In the pangolin smuggling case, the Athagarh DFO swung into action and grilled about 20 smugglers engaged in the case and took the case for probe by WCCB but forgot to hand over the leopard death case to the later.

The Athagarh DFO does not entertain media personnel. All Forest Range Officers and Foresters have been warned by the DFO not to share any information regarding the department at any cost to the media, which hampers the transparency of the public office.

Now, it is observed that there is no team work, rather the command of the DFO is final. Man-elephant is on the rise in Athagarh. But the Gaja-Bandhu and Hati-Sathi personnel work not at the sites but at the office of the DFO and her residence for the beautification of the premises.

All the suspected pangolin smugglers whom the DFO had arrested have been given bail by the courts due to lack of adequate proof. Some say that to get rid of tiger death case, the department here is diverting everybody’s attention.

The behaviour of officers in this office is not good for which, victims of crop loss by wild animals do not wish to rush the office. However, where there is restriction for the mediapersons to this public office, one can observe its implications. In this juncture, the safety of the jungle and wildlife is at a stake.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/travesty-of-5t-in-athagarh-forest-divn.html

88,31-1-20,Govt set to roll back school merger decision,"The Jharkhand Government has decided to withdraw the decisions of merger of schools with low enrolment ratio of students. Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) legislator from Dumri Jagarnath Mahto, who has been appointed as new Minister of School Education and Literacy department, has said that the Government will take back the previous government’s decision to merge schools. Mahto is yet to assume charge as Minister.

The Raghubar Das Government in 2018 had taken a decision to merge schools with low enrolment an exercise undertaken by Rajasthan and Jharkhand in the country with the support of the Union Government and NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog. In two phases the Jharkhand government merged 1200 and 4600 schools, but brakes were applied in third phase of merger of 6466 schools due to protest of opposition as well ruling parties.

The minister’s remark on withdrawing Raghubar Das government decision assumes importance as JMM has been strongly critical on merger of schools. The then Opposition parties comprising JMM and Congress had opposed the Raghubar Das Government’s decision terming the decision to destroy education in State. The JMM and Congress at that time had organized demonstration across the state. As general election was approaching the BJP MPs too were against Das decision, leading to all 12 members of Parliament belonging to the ruling BJP representing Jharkhand in the Lok Sabha opposed the Government’s merging primary and middle schools in the State. The MPs, in a combined letter in 2018 addressed to Chief Minister Raghubar Das, spelt out several reasons in the support of their demand.

The Jharkhand government has put the merger of proposed 6,466 middle schools (classes 6 to 8) on hold, till the impact assessment of the already merged 4,600 primary schools gets completed.

Meanwhile, School Education and Literacy department, Principal Secretary AK Singh said, “The Government can take back its decision taken by the earlier government if the Cabinet gives its consent to withdraw the decision.”

Moreover, Minister Mahto also announced to look into the matter of Para teachers which includes hike in their salaries and regularization of service. Chief Minister Raghubar Das in his entire tenure had to face stir of Para teachers. The Para teachers went on 63-day long strike from November ending on January 2, 2019 after Government promised to set up a committee to consider their demands.

The committee was set up and it also visited several states to study the para-teachers’ regularisation model, but the BJP Government failed to act on their demands. With JMM government taking shape in State the Para teachers is once again to intensify their demands.

However, Singh said that Government can take decision of Para teachers’ demand as per draft committee prepared by earlier government. Also as the matter is subjudice in Jharkhand High Court, Court’s views is also important in Para teachers demand.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-set-to-roll-back-school-merger-decision.html

91,31-1-20,Curfew enters 7th day in Lohardaga,"The curfew imposed in Lohardaga district entered its seventh day on Thursday. All educational institutions, businesses and banks remained closed during the week. However, no incidents of clashes were reported from the district since January 23, when stone pelting on a rally taken out in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and subsequent arson led to the enforcement of curfew, police said.

The district administration on Thursday gave six hours of relaxation to Lohardaga residents from the restrictions under the curfew, said Inspector General (Operations), Saket Kumar Singh.

“The situation is under control in the district, but we are taking preventive measures to ensure no clashes happen here on,” Singh added.

Later in the day, he said that all block level Government offices may open soon. A call on resuming classes at schools and colleges will be taken on Saturday, he added.

The police have made at least 97 residents of the district sign bonds admitting that they will never resort to violence. Besides, at least 26 people have been detained in connection with the violence.

The police was yet to take a call on the arrangements for Saraswati idol immersion by the time this report was filed.

Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Sajid Zafar deployed on special duty in the curfew-clamped district said that the situation was still tensed in some parts of the district.

“Sufficient number of security personnel has been deployed across the district since the imposition of curfew here. The situation was tensed after the clashes and we had to stretch the curfew period in order to avoid a snowballing effect,” he said.

The police also organised meetings of peace committees on Thursday and urged representatives of different communities to spread the message of harmony and peace. On Thursday, the curfew was relieved for three hours twice – from 9am to 12pm and from 2pm to 5pm, the DSP, who refused to be named, said. “We will gradually increase the relaxation period and eventually the curfew will be lifted,” he added.

During the relaxation on Thursday, residents were allowed to move out of their houses and purchase food and other necessary items, police said.

The shops were allowed to open only during the relaxation hours. However, Government as well as private schools have remained closed in the districts since January 24.

Various right wing organizations, including the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and some wings of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), had taken out the rally in support of the CAA last week in Lohardaga town, about 80 Kilometers west of capital Ranchi. The peaceful rally reportedly turned hostile after stones were pelted by anti-CAA protestors and some locals at Amlatoli Chowk, police said.

Lohardaga is the first district in Jharkhand where clashes over the nationwide unrest related to the CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC) have been reported. According to the official website of the Government of Jharkhand, Lohardaga is one of the poorest districts of Jharkhand. It is predominantly rural, with heavy dependence on agriculture and low industrial investments.

101,31-1-20,Social organisation strives to eradicate poverty,"Food which is waste for someone, must be made best for someone’ is the motto with which the NGO- Helping India Feeding India (HI-FI) is working and bringing a change in the lives of the underprivileged since its inception in December 2016.

Started in Hazaribagh, the organisation now works in eight cities across Jharkhand- Ranchi, Chatra, Chaibasa, Deoghar, Latehar, Dhanbad and Koderma with about 350 volunteers. In the next few months it will have its wings in Jamshedpur and Tilaiya as well.

“While the entire world was celebrating Christmas in December 2016, they were some children who were trying to satiate their hunger from a heap of garbage in Hazaribagh. The sight not only disheartened me but also turned out to be the stepping stone for my project,” said the founder of the organisation Abhijeet Kumar.

The primary objective of HI-FI is to collect leftover food from hotels, restaurants and banquet halls, do a quality check, identify slums in a particular city and distribute it there.

HI-FI has managed to salvage about 1000 Kgs of rice, 750 Kgs of pulses and more than 600 Kgs of vegetables from being thrown and used it for feeding the poor. Till date the organisation has fed about 1,50,000 people.

The Ranchi chapter of the organisation was started in December 2019. Presently it has about 30 active members and 60 volunteers working across the city.

“At present we have a tie up with the hotel Capitol Residency from where food is acquired on a regular basis and distributed in the slum of Nivaranpur. It is our endeavour that at least one proper meal a day reaches such people. During the winter months, we have also distributed old clothes, shoes, and shawls amongst the needy,” said Tanushka Singh, a city based volunteer.

The NGO got registered under the Trust Act of India in Hazaribagh in September 2018 while it became a partner with the Food Safety and Standard Authority of India (FSSAI) - the apex body for food protection in August 2019.

“The initiative started with feeding two children at home on a regular basis. With the neighbours also pitching in to support, the number of people being fed daily soon went up to 15 and now we are proud to be present in eight cities across Jharkhand,” added the budding entrepreneur.

Kumar is also all set to be part of the International Global Network in Jakrata, Indonesia in February to discuss how the model of HI-FI can be implemented across India and also globally.

“Our motto is to make not just Ranchi or Jharkhand but the entire country hunger free. This will only be possible when there is no wastage of food. In just a few months time, the Ranchi chapter has managed to feed about 1500 people across the city,” said Sukant Roy, an active member of the Ranchi chapter.

The NGO is also creating awareness about practicing basic hygiene like washing hands before and after a meal. Efforts to create employment opportunities like tea shacks, pani puri stalls, making paper plates, bowls and glasses are also in the pipeline.

“When we adopt a locality, we also try to make sure that the people living there not only get a proper meal every day but also live in clean and hygienic surroundings.

For this, two people from the neighbourhood are appointed to ensure that that the area is clean with no garbage littered around.

This is not only them responsible but is also providing them with an employment,” added Roy.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/social-organisation-strives-to-eradicate-poverty.html

""Two forces are face to face in the Assembly elections in Delhi. On one side is Prime Minister Narendra Modi who eliminated terrorists through air and surgical strikes inside Pakistan and on the other hand are those supporting Shaheen Bagh.

The vote of Delhi people on February 8 will not only replace the Kejriwal government but also ensure victory of those who worship mother India, he asserted.

""It will not only change the Kejriwal government, it will also defeat an ideology. Formation of the BJP government in Delhi will preserve the ideology of worshipping Bharat Mata,"" he said.

Shah also credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi with finding solutions to issues like Ram temple and Article 370 and accused the AAP and the Congress of opposing the BJP, fearing backlash from their vote bank.

121,31-1-20,Doctors’ body warns of possible spread to Kashmir Valley,"A doctors’ body on Thursday warned that there was a potential threat of novel coronavirus spreading to Kashmir as tourists from around the world visit the valley.

President of the Doctors Association of Kashmir (DAK) Suhail Naik said China is located near India and there were chances of coronavirus reaching the valley as it is a tourist destination.

“Following the recent outbreak of coronavirus in China, there is a potential threat of the novel virus in Kashmir as people from different parts of the world come here as tourists,” he said in a statement.

“Many countries have direct air travel with Kashmir. So the coronavirus may come to Kashmir by that way and we have to take care before it is too late,” he said.

Naik said although no case of coronavirus has been reported in the valley yet, the government particularly the health department needs to be prepared for any emergency.

Novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory syndromes. The virus is a novel strain and not seen before, he said.

The chief of DAK said the virus can be passed between humans through close contact.

“It is imperative that the government and specifically the health department should be prepared for handling the situation,” he said.

Naik said the virus does not seem to pass easily from person to person unless there is close contact, such as occurs when providing unprotected care to patients.

The common symptoms of the novel coronavirus include respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.

122,31-1-20,Will continue to engage with EU on CAA: MEA,"A day after the European Parliament deferred voting on a resolution on the Citizenship Amendment Act(CAA), India on Thursday said it has noted the decision not to vote and said it will continue to engage with the European Union on the issue. New Delhi also expressed concern over anti-India protests outside its embassy in London and urged the UK to take suitable action to prevent a repeat of such demonstrations.

Asserting that the CAA is an internal matter of India and it has noted the deferment of voting, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said it also noted India has noted European Commission’s clarification that the EU Parliament’s views don’t reflect the official position of the grouping. Voting was to take place on Thursday.

“As I have mentioned earlier, CAA is an internal matter of India. It has been adopted though due process and democratic means,” Kumar said. “We will continue to engage with the MEPs, the European Parliament and other stakeholders in this matter,” he said.

Kumar also said India has taken up with the British Government the issue of anti-India protests in connection with the CAA outside the Indian High Commission in London on Sunday. These incidents create difficulties in functioning of our High Commission in London, he said adding that India hopes anti-India protests in London are not repeated in future.

Meanwhile, the European Parliament met on Wednesday in Brussels to debate the two resolutions including a sharply worded condemnation of the CAA but decided too postpone voting on them till March. The European Parliament will now take up voting during the plenary session between March 30 and April 2.

The voting, if it takes place then, will come after the India-European Union summit scheduled on March 13, which is likely to be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A resolution slamming the Indian government on CAA could have jeopardised the summit, sources said.

Indian diplomats in Brussels led by the country’s envoy to Belgium, Gaitri Issar Kumar, were for the last few days reaching out to the groups of Members of European Parliament (MEPs).

Sources in the Indian government termed the postponement of voting as a “diplomatic victory” for India adding “Friends of India prevailed over the Friends of Pakistan in the European Parliament today.”

They said efforts of outgoing British MEP, Shaffaq Mohammad, to have a resolution passed by the European Parliament against India on the penultimate day before Brexit were defeated.

Shaffaq Ahmed, a Pakistan-origin British MEP, was considered one of the architects of the resolutions, although it had the support of 559 MEPs in the 751-member European Parliament.

The CAA is a matter internal to India and has been adopted through a due process through democratic means. New Delhi expects that our perspectives in this matter will be understood by all objective and fair-minded MEPs” sources said.

Distancing itself from the MEPs’ move, the EU had on Monday stated that opinions expressed by the European Parliament and its members do not represent the official position of the EU.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/will-continue-to-engage-with-eu-on-caa--mea.html
123,31-1-20,"Govt ready to discuss all issues in Budget Session, says Modi","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday asserted his Government is open to discuss all matters in Parliament’s Budget Session beginning on Friday after the Opposition parties raised concerns over “worsening” economic situation and accused his dispensation of “arrogance” and not reaching out to the anti-CAA protesters.

While the Opposition members raised a host of issues including the nationwide protests against the CAA, “worsening” economic situation and “rising” unemployment at the all-party meeting ahead of the Budget Session, the Prime Minister called for a “greater focus” on economic issues in the session. Political sources said the Opposition leaders also demanded the release of detained political figures in Jammu and Kashmir.

Taking to media after the meeting, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said that opposition parties sought immediate release of former state chief minister Farooq Abdullah so that he could attend the session from Friday.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters after the meeting, attended by 26 parties, that the prime minister conveyed to the leaders that parties should not confine themselves to mere “charcha” (debate) but should have rich and structured discussion on every issue.

In his concluding remarks, Modi welcomed the suggestions of most members that the session should focus on the prevailing economic situation in the country, an official statement later said.

“Most of the members have asked for discussion on the economic situation concerning the country. I welcome this and we need to discuss the economic issues as suggested by you all. We should focus on how we can turn the global scenario in favour of India and how India can gain in the prevailing global situation,” said Joshi.

“In this budget session and in the beginning of the new year, if we can give a proper direction to the country’s economy, it would be in the best interest of the country,” he said, according to the statement. The budget session will conclude on April 3 with a recess in between. The budget will be presented on Saturday.

Referring to various other issues raised by opposition parties, Modi said there should be an open discussion on all. He asked the leaders at the meeting to see to it that they contribute to increasing the productivity of the session and Parliament.

“This is about the productivity of the session and the Parliament. In the last two sessions, we saw the increased productivity and the great public response in favour of it. As people’s representatives, it is our responsibility to increase the productivity of the House, while we discuss all issues with an open mind,” he said.

Asked about the opposition’s charge that the government is being arrogant in not reaching out to anti-CAA protestors, Joshi noted that the bill was passed by Parliament following a long discussion and asked rival parties to introspect their role in these protests.

The BJP has accused the Congress and other opposition parties of inciting protests and violence against the law which, the ruling party has asserted, does not affect the citizenship of any Indian. In his remarks, Azad said Parliament’s sessions have been shortened gradually by the Government.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/govt-ready-to-discuss-all-issues-in-budget-session--says-modi.html

State Health Minister Rajesh Tope assured that no confirmed case of coronavirus infection has been found in Maharashtra so far.

Twenty-seven persons are under observation in the State and as a precautionary measure 10 of them have been quarantined — six at Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai, three at Pune’s Naidu Hospital and another at a hospital in Nanded.

“A team of Centre’s health department is likely to visit Mumbai in coming days as more and more cases of suspected novel coronavirus are surfacing,” a senior state official told PTI. “All the suspected coronavirus patients will continue to be kept under observation for at least 28 days,” the official said, adding that the number is likely to go up.

When asked about the purpose of the central team’s visit, the official said, “It is aimed at taking a review of the preparedness for prevention and management of the disease. The team will also give some critical inputs.”

Speaking to reporters in Aurangabad, Health Minister Tope said 4,790 people had been screened for symptoms of the infection at the Mumbai airport as of Wednesday.

125,31-1-20,J’khand Govt trying to cover up killings of tribals for opposing Pathalgarhi: BJP,"The BJP on Thursday accused the JMM-led Government in Jharkhand of trying to cover up the killings of seven villagers in West Singhbhum district for allegedly opposing ‘Pathalgarhi’, a self-rule movement and defending the perpetrators of the crime.

Those supporting the movement had allegedly kidnapped seven villagers of Burugulikera in Guddi block on January 21 and killed them for opposing their stir. The mutilated bodies were recovered from a forest around 4 kilometres from the village the next day.

The killings that took place days after the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha-Congress-Rashtriya Janata Dal coalition government assumed power in the state on December 29, triggered widespread outrage and CM Soren ordered an investigation by a special investigation team (SIT).

Sixteen people have been arrested in connection with the killings, according to the police.

After the alleged killings, BJP president JP Nadda formed a party delegation to visit the West Singhbhum district. The delegation comprised Jaswant Singh Bhabhor (MP from Gujarat), Samir Oraon (MP from Jharkhand), Bharati Pawar (parliamentarian from Maharashtra), Gomti Saai (Chhattisgarh Lok Sabha member), Joan Barla (LS member from West Bengal) and former Jharkhand minister and MLA Nilkanth Singh Munda.

The delegation on Wednesday met Nadda and Home Minister Amit Shah and submitted the report on the incident. Talking to newspersons at the BJP headquarters here, Oraon said the JMM-led Jharkhand government, of which the Congress is a part, “is trying to cover up the incident.”

“The state government got into action two days after the incident and is now trying to cover up the incident to safeguard the perpetrators of this heinous crime in which innocent tribals were killed,” he said.

Oraon said the incident took place after Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren announced that all cases against ‘Pathalgarhi’ activists will be taken back.

The Pathalgarhi movement is a name given to a tribal protest for autonomy to Gramsabha (village council). Its proponents want no laws of the land be applicable to the tribal people in the area and refuse to accept government’s rights over forests and rivers.

Its supporters carve their diktat on rocks in their areas of influence. The name ‘Pathalgarhi’ is derived from the practice of carving the edicts of the leaders of the movement on large stones called ‘pathal’ in local language, while garhi means carving.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/j---khand-govt-trying-to-cover-up-killings-of-tribals-for-opposing-pathalgarhi--bjp.html

India has 60 per cent of the total global cases.

“India has a huge population and I recognise that its efforts to reach some population groups, like those in the mountains or say the tribal population, are probably not sufficient.

“A leprosy eradication programme should be included in the school curriculum to ensure widespread awareness about the stigmatic disease,” said Sasakawa, recipient of the Gandhi Peace Prize 2019 for his fight against leprosy, especially in India.

“But relatively speaking I think the measures India is taking against the disease today are the most advanced in the world,” said Sasakawa who is on India visit to attend an event to mark the anti-leprosy Day on Thursday. The event was organised by the Sasakawa-India Leprosy Foundation(S-ILF), an organisation engaged in social and economic upliftment of persons affected by leprosy and their families.

Sasakawa, Chairman, Nippon Foundation, said that his organisation, Sasakawa India Leprosy Foundation, is working hard to meet the government’’s target of making India leprosy-free by 2030.

Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Health Minister too expressed his concerns that the disease continue to exist despite so many years. “I have already written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the abolishment of more than 100 discriminatory laws and I assure the patients and the foundation that these laws will be completely eradicated in the very near future,” the minister added.

According to the World Health Organisation, India has the highest number of new cases of leprosy in the world annually, followed by Brazil and Indonesia. Though India officially eliminated leprosy in 2005 by bringing the prevalence rate below 1/10,000 at the national level, it has not been able to eradicate the disease despite having it as a national target.

New cases have been reported from several parts of India, especially the rural belts of Bihar, Lakshadweep, Dadra and Nagar Haveli. All the cases were attributed to late diagnosis.

With an aim to sensitise the India Inc towards people affected by leprosy and their families, S-ILF on Thursday joined hands with Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). “CII, in partnership with S-ILF, will drive proactive initiatives towards awareness, advocacy, and economic integration of the leprosy affected community,” said Tarun Das, Chairman, S-ILF and formed head of the CII.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/india-needs-better-awareness-on-leprosy--says-who-ambassador.html

She also alleged that the intention of the Congress was to ‘break the country’.

“There is anger in the entire country that in Shaheen Bagh, AAP and other political parties which had failed to win the 2019 Lok Sabha elections are supporting the talk of dividing the country,” the Union Minister said here.

She alleged that “anti-national slogans are being raised at Shaheen Bagh”, where protests are going on against the Citizenship Amendment Act since the law was passed in Parliament last month.

“Today, on the death anniversary of Bapu, I will only say that even Mahatma Gandhi is being cursed from the platform of Shaheen Bagh. AAP leader Manish Sisodia has given his support to the protesters of Shaheen Bagh,” she claimed.

The Union Minister said she would ask political leaders has their ‘standard of politics touched so low’ that after the defeat in the Lok Sabha polls, they are not able to accept it and “speaking of dividing the country from these platforms”.

“They are talking about ‘Jinnah wali azadi’. Countrymen are looking at these things,” she added.

To a question on the ongoing ‘Ganga Yatra’ in the state, she said, “It will be my fortune that I will be taking part in it in Rae Bareli and Pratapgarh.”

She, however, evaded questions on the visit of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi to the state earlier this month.

The women have been charged under IPC sections 145, 147 and 188, SP City Abhishek Kumar said. Section 145 relates to unlawful assembly, 147 to rioting and 188 to disobedience to order issued by a public servant.

The protest began late Wednesday afternoon and by evening a large number of people joined it, despite the police administration trying to deter them from violating Section 144 of the CrPC that prohibits public gatherings.

The protestors spent the night at Eidgah and Thursday morning they were joined by other women from neighbouring localities.

Last week, hundreds of women held a similar protest at the same place after the district authorities gave permission for a two-day dharna.

The protest ended after two days.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/women-start-indefinite-dharna-at-aligarh-eidgah.html
140,31-1-20,"Sena endorses Shah, says Sharjeel’s words dangerous","The Shiv Sena on Thursday endorsed Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s view that alleged inflammatory statements made by Sharjeel Imam, an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) activist, were dangerous.

No politics should be done on the issue, and such ‘pest’ afflicting the country should be finished off, it said.

Imam was arrested on Tuesday in connection with his speeches at Jamia Millia Islamia University in Delhi and in Aligarh during anti-CAA protests.

He has been booked for sedition, among other offences.

In an editorial published in its mouthpiece Rs Saamana’, the Sena, a former ally of the BJP, said, “We agree with union home minister’s comments that Sharjeel Imam’s alleged words of separation are more dangerous than that of Kanhaiya Kumar.”

Kumar, former student leader from Jawaharlal Nehru University, had been arrested over alleged separatist slogans shouted during a protest on varsity campus.

The Sena, which has formed alliance with the Congress and NCP to come to power in Maharashtra, is often seen walking a tightrope to preserve its credentials as a pro-Hindutva party.

“The Union Home Ministry, while initiating action against Imam, should not indulge in politics and try to finish off this pest that is afflicting our country,” the editorial said.

“One must find out why such language of breaking up this country into pieces is being used by the educated youth of this country more and more frequently. Who is spewing such venom into the mind of Sharjeel who did his graduation from IIT-B and now pursuing PhD from JNU?” the Sena asked.

“Even people involved in Elgar Parishad at Pune are facing sedition charges and these people have been known as intellectuals and are well-known personalities,” said the party.

“A conspiracy to bring about a conflict between Hindus and Muslims and ensure continuance of anarchy and civil war as in Iraq and Afghanistan exists. The boost for such activities is coming from a ‘political laboratory’,” the editorial said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sena-endorses-shah--says-sharjeel---s-words-dangerous.html
141,31-1-20,Cong-led UDF forms human maps of India in Kerala,"Thousands of people came together to form human maps of India, organised by the Congress-led UDF, across Kerala as a mark of protest against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act on Thursday.

Intensifying its protest against the CAA, the Congress- led UDF organised the formation of human map in 12 of the 14 districts barring Wayanad and Kozhikode.

The programme was cancelled in Kozhikode due to the demise of veteran Congress leader M Kamalam this morning.

At Wayanad, MP and Congressleader Rahul Gandhi took out a protest rally against the CAA.

The Congress in Kerala has been organising protest marches under the leadership of MPs and MLAs and local leaders since the past few days.

142,31-1-20,"Protests intensify at AMU, VC issues video appeal to students","Protests at Aligarh Muslim University’s women college against the new citizenship law intensified on Thursday with hundreds of students blocking its entry points, as the exam boycott at the AMU’s engineering college continued for the fourth successive day.

The protesters, including schoolgirls, locked the gates from inside and formed a human chain to prevent teaching staff from entering the campus on Marris Road.

A university official said police had been posted at the college gates as a precautionary measure. He added, “While a section of the girls are ready to end the deadlock and resume attending classes, some others are still refusing.”

Later Thursday, Vice-Chancellor Tariq Mansoor tried to reassure students in a video appeal that all their issues from now on will be dealt without involving any “external agency”. Students had been concerned that the university could once again call the police force into the campus to quell their protest against the amended citizenship law, as done on December 15.

The students wanted the VC to assure them that all “false cases” registered against their colleagues during the past six weeks would be withdrawn and there will be “no further police action or harassment” against them for protesting peacefully.

In the video message, the vice chancellor said he “deeply regretted” the incidents on December 15 and the booking of students by police. “I want to assure students I will take up these matters with police and no innocent student will be framed.”

The VC said peaceful dissent “is the right of every student” and every educational institution can debate any issue which disturbs the student community. He said the university administration was empowering the proctorial team, members of the teaching community and pro-proctors to tackle all situations pertaining to law and order issues within the campus.

However, the boycott of examinations at the varsity’s Zakir Husain College of Engineering and Technology continued for the fourth consecutive day.

AMU spokesman Omar Peerzada said some classes were held for the first time to end the impasse after Prof Sufiyan Beg, principal of the engineering college, assured the students that their demands raised during Wednesday’s meeting with the VC would be considered favourably.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/protests-intensify-at-amu--vc-issues-video-appeal-to-students.html

147,31-1-20,MVA Govt removes BJP appointed administrators in sugar factories,"In a major decision aimed at reducing the influence of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the crucial co-operative sector, the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Agadhi (MVA) Government has removed the administrators and all the directors appointed by the previous BJP Government in 19 co-operative sugar factories in various parts of the State.

The successive Congress (and NCP since 1999) Governments had over the years derived their political clout from the co-operative bodies, including sugar factories and banks. However, after the saffron alliance Government replaced the previous Congress-led Democratic Front (DF) Governmnet in the state in 2014, the BJP had taken control of the cooperative sector by appointing its administrators and directors on various co-operative sugar factories.

During its tenure, the BJP-led Government had suffocated several big sugar co-operative societies managed by the NCP and Congress leaders, by reducing quantum of loans extended to them from time to time through co-operative banks.

With several of these sugar cooperative factories incurring huge losses, some of the NCP and Congress leaders running these sugar cooperative factories had switched over to the BJP in the run up to the Lok Sabha and State Assembly polls held last year.

However, after the advent of the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress grand alliance’s MVA dispensation took over the reins of the State last month, the Uddhav Thackeray Government has initiated the process to regain the control of the co-operative sector once again. The NCP, which has over the years built a strong base in western Maharashtra through sugar-cooperatives, holds the crucial Cooperation ministry in the Uddhav Thackeray government. Its senior leader Balasaheb Patil is the Co-operation Minister in the MVA government.

Official sources said that the Uddhav Thackeray, through the Pune-based State Sugar Commissionerate has issued an order annulling the appointments of administrators and directors made by the previous BJP government in 19 co-operative sugar factories in various parts of the State.

The 19 sugar co-operative sugar factories, in which the state government has removed the BJP-appointed administrators and directors, include Ajinkyatara Cooperative Sugar factory, Satara, Dr Patangrao co-op sugar factory, Kadegaon-Sangli, Someshwar cooperative sugar factory, Baramati, Purna Co-op sugar factory, Hingoli, Adinath coop sugar factory, Solapur, Chhatrapati Co-op sugar factory, Indapur, Raobahadur co-operative sugar factory, Shirol, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar co-op sugar factory, Osmanabad, AAjara co-op sugar factory, Kolhapur, Vithalrao Shinde co-op sugar factory, Madha, Rena Co-op sugar factory, Latur and Bhima coop sugar factory, Phatas-Daund.

Sources said that the state government would soon appoint its nominees as the administrators and directors in these 19 sugar co-operative factories.

In another measure, the MVA Government has initiated steps to show the door to the BJP-appointed directors in district co-operative banks, market committees and cooperative societies (coming under the purview of sugar factories) and replace them with the nominees belonging to the three parties in the current Government in the State.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mva-govt-removes-bjp-appointed-administrators-in-sugar-factories.html
148,31-1-20,Agri Ministry seeks 20% less funds for PM-KISAN Yojana,"The Agriculture Ministry has sought Rs 60,000 crore for the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana ( PM KISAN ) for the next fiscal year, a 20 per cent less than the previous year allocation of Rs 75,000 crore. The Ministry has been able to disburse only Rs 44,000 crore so far this fiscal under the scheme.

The Centre had allocated Rs 75,000 crore in the Budget Estimate (BE) for 2019-20 to implement the PM-KISAN scheme, under which Rs 6,000 is being provided to farmers per year in three equal instalments.

Sources said the allocation is estimated to have come down to Rs 61,000 crore in the Revised Estimate (RE) for the current fiscal as some States, including West Bengal, have not rolled out this scheme and many others do not have proper data of the farmers.

The projection of the number of beneficiary farmers has also been pegged lower at 14 crore from the earlier 14.5 crore.

“The Government is expected to allocate around Rs 61,000 crore for 2020-21 fiscal, almost same amount that was provided in the revised estimate for the 2019-20 fiscal,” source added.

The allocation in revised budget estimate has been lowered as the Central Government has so far distributed funds under the PM-KISAN scheme to 8.35 crore farmers, source added.

In the interim Budget presented in February 2019, the government had launched the PM-KISAN. That apart, the Government may increase farm credit target by 10 per cent from Rs 13.5 lakh crore targeted for this fiscal, source said. The target for agriculture credit for this fiscal has already been achieved.

Source also said the government may allocate Rs 15,000 crore for farm insurance scheme, up from Rs 14,000 crore in the current year. Already, the government has disbursed Rs 12,135 crore towards premium till December 2019.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/agri-ministry-seeks-20--less-funds-for-pm-kisan-yojana.html
149,31-1-20,BJP corporator kisses Cong member on cheek at meet,"A BJP corporator caused a flutter in the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) in western Maharashtra, by kissing a fellow male Congress corporator sitting next to him on his cheek at a special general meeting held on Thursday.

Amid a special general meeting of the KMC called to consider Mayor Surmanjari Latkar’s resignation, the House was taken aback to see BJP corporator Kamalkar Bhople planting a deep kiss on one of the cheeks of Congress corporator Sharangadhar Deshmukh of the ruling Congress-NCP alliance, sitting next to him.

Before long, a video clip of the incident went viral in the media. As could be seen from the video clip, the members of both the treasury and Opposition benches broke into peals of laughter, as a straight-faced Bhople all of a sudden pulled Deshmukh closer to him with both of his hands and planted a kiss. Deshmukh took Bhople’s act in his stride and was all smiles.

Incidentally, Deshmukh is the leader of the House and chairman of the civic standing committee. Though the actual reason behind Bhople’s act was not immediately known, one could gather from the the chain of events that led to the incident was that the BJP corporator was more comfortable being with the ruling Congress-NCP alliance corporators than with his own party corporators. The BJP and Tararani Aghadi combine are an Opposition alliance in the KMC.

Soon after the special general meeting started, Bhople walked across from the Opposition benches to the treasury benches and sat next to Deshmukh.

An hour and a half later, Bhople planted a kiss on Deshmukh’s check. Before doing so, Bhople was heard saying: “I do not get as much of respect in my own party as much as I do in the ruling Congress-NCP alliance. I am very happy being with the ruling alliance corporators”.

It remains to be seen if Bhople, who seems to be very unhappy being within th4e BJP, will switch sides and join the Congress in the coming days. Or will the BJP initiate disciplinary action against Bhople and expel him from the party for his questionable act?",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-corporator-kisses-cong-member-on-cheek-at-meet.html

It further said, “Though the near-term market situation is fluid, we are optimistic on the medium term as we launch our exciting BS-VI range of products with our system inventory at a multi-year low. We remain focused on driving our turnaround strategy and transitioning seamlessly to BS-VI.”

154,31-1-20,Niti V-C: Alternate measures needed to boost economy,"The Government should focus on alternate measures to stimulate economy as it is not possible to give fiscal stimulus, Niti Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Kumar said ahead of the Budget.

Kumar also said growth-enhancing measures are the need of the hour to achieve India’s potential growth rate of 7-8 per cent per annum.

He attributed the current slowdown to low investment, muted consumption expenditure and lagging exports. Experts are divided over whether the Government should provide stimulus to boost slowing economy without bothering too much about fiscal deficit.

“Growth-enhancing measures are the need of the hour to achieve India’s potential growth rate of 7-8 per cent per annum. “However, the Government’s ability to finance a large stimulus is admittedly constrained. Therefore, attention will have to be on alternate measures to stimulate a recovery,” Kumar said in a newsletter ‘arthNITI’.

The Niti Aayog’s vice-chairman noted that some green shoots of recovery are now visible with the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for both manufacturing and services showing a smart rise to above 52, which signifies expansion.

He also said there have already been plenty of measures taken by the Government in the recent past, including the decision to lower corporate tax rates in September 2019.

“The equity markets have responded positively and strongly to these measures and recorded all-time highs. Still, all eyes are now on Budget 2020 for further growth-enhancing measures,” Kumar said.

Noting that growth, equity and sustainability can no longer be viewed as mutually exclusive, he said, “We cannot achieve one goal while neglecting the other two.”

Our policy design should, Kumar said, always have these three principle goals that are also enshrined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or the Global Agenda 2030, for the achievement of which, all UN members have given their unequivocal commitment.

The Indian economy, which till recently was hailed as the fastest-growing major economy, has seen growth rate decline in each of the past five quarters, falling to over six-year low of 4.5 per cent in July-September 2019.

The National Statistical Office (NSO) has estimated the gross domestic product (GDP) in the current financial year at 5 per cent, which is 11-year low.

During the current year ending March 2020, the fiscal deficit target has been pegged at 3.3 per cent of the GDP.

However, there are apprehensions the Government may miss the target in view of the slower economic growth and likely shortfall in revenue collection, mainly because of massive cut in the corporate tax rate.

After world health officials have expressed “great concern” that the disease is starting to spread between people outside of China, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index sank 1.7 per cent to 22,977.75, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index skidded 2.6 per cent to 26,449.13. In Australia, the S&P ASX/200 declined 0.3 per cent to 7,008.40. South Korea’s Kospi lost 1.7 per cent to 2,148.00.

Shares also retreated in India and Southeast Asia. Mainland Chinese markets remained closed for the Lunar New Year holiday.

“With equity markets pumped to juicy levels by the relentless flow of cheap central bank money around the world, unexpected Wuhan-like events leave them acutely vulnerable to potentially aggressive corrections,” Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a commentary.

The World Health Organization was due to meet Thursday in Geneva to consider whether to issue a global alarm that might prompt more controls on movement inside and to and from China, resulting in greater disruptions to businesses and markets. In other news, South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. Said its operating profit for the last quarter fell 33.7 per cent from a year earlier.

But it predicted earnings will improve in 2020, driven by a gradually stabilising computer chip market and increasing 5G smartphone sales.

Samsung, the world’s biggest producer of smartphones and semiconductors, has suffered a sharp drop in profit over the past year with an industry-wide glut forcing chip-makers to slash prices to clear out inventory.

The Bank of England was expected to issue a decision on interest rates later on Thursday.

Overnight, stocks lost momentum on Wall Street as investors tuned in to a news conference by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Speaking to reporters Wednesday afternoon, Powell acknowledged that there’s a risk the outbreak could slow the global economy. But stocks barely budged after the Fed announced would leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a low level. The move, which was widely expected, reflects the central bank’s mostly positive view of the US economy.

Last year, the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate three times after having raised it four times in 2018. Powell credits those rate cuts with revitalising the housing market, which had stumbled early last year, and offsetting some of the drag from President Donald Trump’s trade war with China.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/world-markets-tumble-as-coronavirus-fear-spreads.html

160,31-1-20,WB Guv reprimands IPS officer publicly,"In a rare occurrence that indicated the deteriorating chemistry between the Bengal Government and Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, the latter on Thursday publicly reprimanded a senior IPS officer of the rank of a Commissioner of Police for reading newspaper while sitting in the front row during a programme organised to offer tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.

Not only the Governor chided Manoj Verma the CP but also reminded him about the deteriorating law and order situation of the State.

Sources said while the Governor was on the stage at Gandhi Ghat at Barrackpore where he was attending a programme in memory of the Father of the Nation on his death anniversary the senior police officer was reading newspaper sitting on the first row.

At the end of the programme Dhankhar not only rebuked the senior officer but also told him how the law and situation in the State was deteriorating by the day.

Later he said that “on the solemn occasion of paying tribute to Father of the Nation at Barrackpore,” he was “appalled” seeing how “amidst chanting of religious mantras senior police personnel in uniform in front row kept on casually and freely reading newspapers.”

He wondered as to how “this indecorous act” could be perpetrated by men in uniform.”

The incident comes close on the heels of the Governor being blockaded by the Calcutta University students who refused to let him attend the convocation programme of the university.

The Governor who was invited in the programme and was scheduled to give away awards including the D’Litt degree to Nobel Laureate Abhijeet Vinayak Banerjee was finally forced to leave the venue.

Reacting to the Thursday’s incident State Minister and Trinamool Congress leader Partho Chatterjee said “he is acting out of frustration,” adding “even if a senior IPS officer has to be reminded of his duty there are procedures for that and he should not be humiliated in public.

If such things are done by the Governor then how the officer will be able to mind the law and order situation in the district.”

Another senior leader and Minister Subroto Mukhjerjee said “if I were to get such indecorous behaviour from a person of that stature

I would return the same treatment only four timesstronger.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/wb-guv-reprimands-ips-officer-publicly.html

“Vote for Arvind Kejriwal and all AAP candidates... “Vote for Aam Aadmi Party, Vote for the candidate from Rajendra Nagar constituency Raghav Chadha,” O’ Brien tweeted.

While Bengal BJP president pooh-pooed the TMC for throwing its weight behind the AAP, even as he said “Delhi is not Bengal and the TMC is not even known in the national Capital.”

Reacting to his statement TMC leader Partho Chatterjee said “if TMC really has no presence in Delhi then why Dilip Ghosh has to react. He may easily ignore TMC’s appeal... It seems that he is nervous about TMC’s support to AAP because Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has huge fan following in other parts of the country including Delhi.”

Chatterjee would not however say whether Banerjee would personally go down to Delhi for campaigning. Apparently the TMC target of appeal are the sizeable number of Bengali-speaking population in the national capital.

Hira Devi and Shakuntala Kumari, wives of Gope — chief of People's Liberation Front of India (PLFI), a proscribed Naxal organisation of Jharkhand — were arrested in connection with the terror funding of the outlawed organisation in Ranchi, an official of the premier investigation agency said.

The NIA also conducted search at the women's houses in Kolkata and seized incriminating documents, the official said, adding that efforts were being made to arrest Gope.

The case pertains to the seizure of Rs 25.38 lakh cash which was being deposited in an SBI account in Ranchi on November 10, 2016, according to the official.

163,31-1-20,We do not endorse any political ideology: IIT-B,"A day after it came in for severe criticism for its latest 15-point “Code of Conduct” for its students in which it has banned “anti-social activities” and imposed other restrictions on the Powai campus, the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-Bombay) on Thursday went on the defensive, by saying that it is “not against any peaceful expression of opinion in individual capacity”.

In a statement issued here in the evening, the IIT-B said: “Indian Institute of Technology Bombay wishes to clarify that the Institute is not against any peaceful expression of opinion in individual capacity”.

“The Institute is strictly apolitical in its views and does not endorse any political ideology. However, any student is free to express his/ her opinion in the individual capacity as per rights and responsibilities enshrined in our constitution,” the IIT-B stated in its clarification.

“With regard to recent circular sent to students, we wish to reiterate that these are standard and existing rules for hostels assimilated from all IITs and were sent to all students to remind them to abide by the hostel rules and not disturb the peaceful academic atmosphere within the hostels and academic areas. This circular was sent in consultation with the student council, which comprises of elected student representatives,” the IIT-B said in its statement.

“The Institute is recognized as one of the top centres of academic excellence in the country. At present, 11,000 students study at this residential campus having 17 hostels. The purpose of IIT Bombay is to produce high-quality research and manpower for the benefit of all citizens of our country,” the IIT-B said

“The students sign the code of conduct at the time of joining the Institute,” the Institute said in its statement, giving e-link showing a document where the students have signed after the admission in the institute, saying that they would adhere to the code of conduct.

In a 15-point “Code of Conduct Rules” mailed to the IIT-B students on Tuesday, the institute's Associate Dean of Student Affairs stated: “This mail is to reiterate and highlight some of the hostel rules which need to be strictly implemented from January 28, 2020”.

Among the 15 points, the rule number 10 stands out: “Residents shall not participate in any anti-national, anti-social and/or any other undesirable activities”. Significantly enough, the Code of Conduct has not defined as to what are “anti-national activities”.

The second such significant restriction mentioned in the code of conduct reads thus: “No Posters or leaflets/pamphlets distribution allowed in the hostel without the permission of the respective hostel council or Dean of Students Affairs (DoSA)”.

Another equally stringent restriction reads thus: “Speeches/plays/music or any other activities that disturb the peace of hostel environment are strictly prohibited. Not allowed even if faculty is part of the gathering. Only matters that are approved by the DoSA office will be permitted”.

The gag order issued to the IIT-B students had come in the wake of a peaceful protest march that the students had organised on December 15 inside the campus, against violence meted out to Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) students. They carried torches, placards and banners saying ‘In Solidarity With Jamia’.

The gag order was seen in the light of the fact that a section of students belonging to four different groups at IIT-B (Ambedkar Periyar Phule Study Circle, North-East Collective, Ambedkar Students’ Collective and Charchavedi) that are part of a collective called ‘IIT-Bombay for Justice’ has joined the anti-CAA and NRC protest organised by the Joint Action Committee (JAC) for Social Justice on December 27.

Many of the students of IIT-B feel that the Code of Conduct is the direct fallout of protests against CAA and NRC being witnessed on the campuses of educational institutions across the country. They feel that the latest restrictions are a violation of Article 19 of the Constitution which provides freedom of speech. Another section of students have even gone to extent dubbing the Institute's move is tantamount to internal emergency with the IIT-B. Most of the students who are opposing the new hostel rules owe allegiance to the outfit ‘IIT-Bombay for Justice’.

However, IIT-B’s official spokesperson has disassociated the institute from the ‘IIT-Bombay for Justice’, by saying: “IIT-Bombay for Justice is not an officially recognised body of the Institute”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/we-do-not-endorse-any-political-ideology--iit-b.html

168,31-1-20,China coronavirus death toll rises to 170,"The deadly coronavirus has hit all provinces in China, including the remote region of Tibet, mostly due to travellers from Wuhan city, the ground zero of the epidemic, as the virus claimed 170 lives, infected 7,736 others and spread to 20 countries, including India.

Chinese health officials on Thursday announced 38 more fatalities mainly from the worst-affected central Hubei province, taking the death toll to 170.

Tibet, which till now remained the only Chinese province untouched by the virus, reported its first case on Thursday, with a resident from Wuhan who travelled to the Himalayan region reporting sick.

As the spread of the virus intensified, many countries, including India, started preparation to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province.

The virus is causing concern all over the world as the number of cases abroad has gone up to 75, with India and the Philippines reporting their first cases. The condition of the Indian patient, a woman medical student from Wuhan university, was “stable” and she was kept in an isolation ward at a hospital in Thrissur.

In a big relief for Indians - mostly students and professionals - stranded in Wuhan, the Indian Embassy in Beijing in a note circulated through social media on Thursday said that preparations are on to evacuate them from the virus-hit region on Friday.

“We are preparing for air evacuation from Wuhan tomorrow in the evening. This flight will carry those Indian nationals who are in and around Wuhan and have conveyed consent for their evacuation,” the note said. “There will be another flight subsequently which will carry those who are from other parts of Hubei province.”

Besides India, several other countries including the US, France, Japan, South Korea, are airlifting their nationals from Wuhan.

A large number of people from Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh from the neighbourhood besides African countries were also reportedly stranded in Hubei province.

So far, four Pakistani nationals and two Australians were reported to have been undergoing treatment for the virus in China.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation (WHO) will meet in Geneva on Thursday to again consider whether the virus constitutes a global health emergency.

“In the last few days the progress of the virus, especially in some countries, especially human-to-human transmission, worries us,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday.

He named Germany, Vietnam and Japan, where there have been cases of people catching the virus from others who returned from China.

“Although the numbers outside China are still relatively small, they hold the potential for a much larger outbreak,” BBC quoted the WHO chief as saying.

Michael Ryan, head of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, told the media that “the whole world needs to be on alert now. The whole world needs to take action.”

Chinese President Xi Jinping, who on Tuesday called the virus a “demon” which should be brought under control, has ordered the military to throw open army hospitals to treat the coronavirus cases.

It is important for the military to step up its organising and leadership functions, enable closer coordination with local authorities, adhere to the principles of scientific treatment and ensure self-protection, Xi was quoted as saying by state-run China Daily.

“Military hospitals must make all-out efforts to accept and treat patients, and research institutions should press ahead with their research and development to contribute to victory against the outbreak,” he said.

Also as it battled to stem the spiralling coronavirus which is causing devastating impact, China on Thursday allocated nearly USD four billion funding to support efforts to contain the dreaded disease across the country.

Separately, Alibaba’s Jack Ma Foundation and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have announced grants for the research to develop a vaccine to counter the deadly virus.

As the virus brought the country to a standstill, concerns are also being raised about its impact on the economy.

China is still in an emergency control mode dealing with the virus threat and not yet started counting the costs and the impact it would have on its already slowing down economy.

The world’s second largest economy grew by 6.1 per cent last year, the lowest annual growth rate in 29 years, amid the bruising 18-month long trade war with the US. The government is hoping to halt the slowdown this year after reaching the phase one trade deal with Washington.

The analysis of 10 gene sequences of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from nine patients in the central Chinese city of Wuhan found that the virus is most closely related to two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses.

The researchers, including those from the Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences in China, said that their analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of the virus.

However, an animal sold at the Huanan seafood market might represent an intermediate host that enables the emergence of the virus in humans, they said.

For this reason, the researchers noted, future evolution, adaptation and spread of this virus requires urgent investigation.

Cell and secretion samples were taken from the lungs of the patients who were diagnosed with viral pneumonia of unidentified cause.

The harvested samples of the 2019-nCoV virus were then analysed to determine the origin of the virus, and how it enters human cells.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/---hidden----animal-spreading-deadly-chinese-coronavirus--lancet-study.html

175,31-1-20,Employees of PSU banks to go on 2-day strike from today,"Operations of public sector banks are expected to be hit beginning Friday as unions will go on a two-day nationwide strike following the failure of wage revision talks with managements.

However, private sector lenders like ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank would be operational. Many banks, including SBI, have informed customers that operations may be impacted to some extent due to the strike. Cash deposit, withdrawal, cheque clearances, instrument issuance and loan disbursement operations would be affected.

With this strike, banks would be closed for three days including Sunday. Banks will open only on Monday, February 3. The three-day break in banking operations could also lead to drying up of ATMs.

The strike will coincide with the beginning of the Budget session of parliament and presentation of the union Budget 2020-21 (on February 1). The strike call has been given by the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), an umbrella body of nine bank unions, including All India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC), All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) and National Organisation of Bank Workers (NOBW).

Earlier this week, a meeting with the Chief Labour Commissioner remained inconclusive, AIBOC President Sunil Kumar said.

176,31-1-20,UK-EU divorce today; India on target list for post-Brexit UK trade campaign,"India is among the countries on the UK Government’s target list for a new post-Brexit trade campaign from Saturday, a day after the country formally leaves the European Union, as it seeks to strike new ties with partners around the globe at the end of 47 years of EU membership.

Mumbai is among 18 cities across 13 countries to be part of the drive, designed to push the message that Britain is now free to do its own new trade deals with countries around the world as a non-member of the soon-to-be 27-member economic bloc, after 47 years of UK membership ends on Friday.

“On 1 February, the new GREAT ‘Ready to Trade’ campaign will launch in 18 cities across 13 countries outside the EU, as the UK seeks to deepen our relationships with future global partners,” Downing Street said in a statement on the eve of Brexit.

The campaign will initially feature digital outdoor advertising in signature locations across the chosen cities and later expand to other activities. Besides India, the others on the list include Australia (Perth, Melbourne, Sydney), Brazil (Sao Paulo), Canada (Toronto), China (Shanghai, Hong Kong), Japan (Tokyo), Mexico (Mexico City), Singapore (Singapore), South Africa (Johannesburg), South Korea (Seoul), Turkey (Istanbul), UAE (Dubai) and USA (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago).

The UK’s Department for International Trade, leading the new drive, says its “GREAT” brand has already proved successful around the world, with surveys indicating those who recognise it are almost twice as likely to say they would trade with the UK in the next three years than those who don’t.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged a “new and improved” trading relationship as part of a “truly special UK-India relationship” on the election campaign trail last year. But as a member of the EU, the UK was not permitted to open up any separate negotiations with other countries. With the EU Withdrawal Agreement, the so-called divorce bill costing the UK around GBP 30 billion, now having been formally passed by the European Parliament on Wednesday evening 621 votes to 49, UK’s exit on Friday at 2300 GMT (04:30 IST on Saturday) remains a mere formality.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/uk-eu-divorce-today--india-on-target-list-for-post-brexit-uk-trade-campaign.html
177,31-1-20,Sensex skids 285 pts on F&O expiry; RIL slumps over 2%,"Equities resumed their downward spiral on Thursday as concerns over the China coronavirus outbreak sapped risk appetite amid expiry of January derivatives contracts.

India on Thursday reported its first case of the novel coronavirus, with a student testing positive in Kerala.

After swinging over 550 points during the day, the 30-share BSE Sensex settled 284.84 points, or 0.69 per cent, lower at 40,913.82. It hit an intra-day low of 40,829.91 and a high of 41,380.14.

Likewise, the broader NSE Nifty closed 93.70 points, or 0.77 per cent, down at 12,035.80. Index heavyweight Reliance Industries was the biggest loser in the Sensex pack, falling 2.62 per cent, followed by Nestle India, IndusInd Bank, UltraTech Cement, M&M and SBI.

On the other hand, Bajaj Auto, PowerGrid, ICICI Bank, Asian Paints, NTPC, HDFC, L&T and Maruti ended with gains. According to analysts, benchmark indices turned highly volatile ahead of the expiry of January futures and options (F&O) contracts.

During afternoon session, markets continued to trade lower led by selling in large-cap stocks which added to the already skittish sentiment ahead of the Budget, they said.

Further, weakness in other Asian bourses as rising concerns over the impact of China’s coronavirus on the world economy also affected domestic sentiment, traders said.

“Fears of economic slowdown as the coronavirus spreads to other nations has dampened the mood of investors across the globe. A slew of results announced so far failed to provide a picture of economic revival with banks disappointing due to weak asset quality that triggered profit booking.

“With expectations high, the market to stay focused on the upcoming Budget for further green shoots in the economy,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

All BSE sectoral indices ended with losses, with energy, oil and gas, FMCG, healthcare, metal and IT falling up to 2.29 per cent. Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices lost up to 1.26 per cent. Bourses in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea ended with steep losses. Markets in China remained closed. Stock exchanges in Europe too opened on a negative note. Brent crude oil futures fell 1.63 per cent to USD 57.97 per barrel.

On the currency front, the Indian rupee depreciated by 23 paise to 71.51 per US dollar (intra-day).",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sensex-skids-285-pts-on-f-o-expiry--ril-slumps-over-2--2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/sensex-skids-285-pts-on-f-o-expiry--ril-slumps-over-2-.html
178,31-1-20,Airtel says its name removed from DGFT blacklist,"Bharti Airtel on Friday said its name has now been removed from the denied entry list for non-fulfilment of export obligation under an export promotion scheme.

The removal of Bharti Airtel's name from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) blacklist is expected to come as a relief to the telecom operator which is otherwise staring at billions of dollars in past statutory dues.

The company, in a statement on Friday, said its has now been removed from the denied entry list after it highlighted the relevant details and documents submitted to the DGFT.

""We are actively engaged with the authorities to complete the formalities and provide additional documents for closure of the remaining cases,"" the company said.

Earlier this week, the firm said it was working to get its name removed from the list, and had asserted that DGFT's latest action does not limit its ability to undertake future imports or exports.

The DGFT, which is under the Commerce Ministry, had put the company under the list, commonly known as blacklist, for non-fulfilment of export obligation in respect of certain Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) authorisation issued to it.

Under the EPCG, an export promotion scheme, import of capital goods is allowed at zero customs duty. Capital goods imported at zero duty must fulfil EPCG export obligation equivalent to six times of duty saved, as per the scheme.

The telecom industry is in the midst of a major crisis and as many as 15 entities owe the government Rs 92,642 crore in unpaid licence fee and another Rs 55,054 crore in outstanding spectrum usage charges.

These liabilities arose after the Supreme Court in October last year held that non-core revenues have to be considered for calculating statutory dues from adjusted gross revenue (AGR).

In the case of Bharti Airtel, the liabilities added up to nearly Rs 35,586 crore, of which Rs 21,682 crore is licence fee and another Rs 13,904.01 crore is the spectrum usage charge dues (not including the dues of Telenor and Tata Teleservices).

Vodafone Idea -- which is staring at unpaid statutory dues of Rs 53,038 crore, including Rs 24,729 crore of spectrum dues and Rs 28,309 crore in licence fee -- has already warned of shutdown if no relief is given.

Most of the remaining liability is with state-owned BSNL/MTNL and some of the shut/bankrupt telecom companies.

Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea, and Tata Teleservices have, meanwhile, jointly filed a modification application in the Supreme Court seeking more time to pay the statutory dues.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/airtel-says-its-name-removed-from-dgft-blacklist-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/airtel-says-its-name-removed-from-dgft-blacklist.html
179,31-1-20,Economic growth to rebound to 6 to 6.5% in next fiscal: Economic Survey,"The Economic Survey on Friday projected India's economic growth at 6 per cent to 6.5 per cent in the next financial year starting April 1, saying growth has bottomed out.

The growth in 2020-21 compares to a projected 5 per cent expansion in 2019-20.

Weak global growth impacting India as well as investment slowdown due to financial sector issues had led to growth dropping to a decade low in current fiscal, it said, adding 5 per cent growth projected for 2019-20 is the lowest it could fall for now.

Growth slipped to 4.5 per cent in the July-September quarter.

The Survey this year has been printed in lavender colour - the same as the colour of the new 100 rupee currency note, the oldest currency note in circulation in the country.

The pre-Budget Survey said for wealth to be distributed, it first has to be created and called for looking at wealth creators with respect.

The Survey said government interventions seem to be ineffective in stabilising prices of commodities such as onions.

For boosting growth, it called for new ideas for manufacturing such as 'assemble in India for the world' which will create jobs.

To further make it easier to do business, the Survey called for removing the red tape at ports to promote exports as well as measures for easing the start of business, register property, pay taxes and enforcing contracts.

It also called for improving governance in public sector banks and the need for more disclosure of information to build trust. It also talks about dwarfism in the banking sector.

180,31-1-20,White House bars Bolton book release over ‘top secret’ material,"The White House told former national security advisor John Bolton that a book reportedly containing damaging evidence for President Donald Trump cannot be published because it breaks secrecy laws.

The warning was made in a letter to Bolton’s lawyer dated January 23 but only made public on Wednesday as Trump’s impeachment trial intensified in the Senate.

The National Security Council said after preliminary review of the manuscript — a vetting process applied to any White House employees writing books — that it contained “significant amounts of classified information.”

“Some of this information is at the TOP SECRET level,” the NSC said in a letter to Bolton’s lawyer Charles Cooper, adding that “the manuscript may not be published or otherwise disclosed without the deletion of this classified information.”

Democrats are pressing for the Senate to subpoena Bolton after reports that his White House memoir “The Room Where it Happened” corroborates the abuse-of-power impeachment charge against Trump. Bolton reportedly writes that the president personally told him in August a freeze in military aid to Ukraine was directly linked to Trump’s demand that Kiev announce investigations into Joe Biden, the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Several hours before the NSC letter went public, Trump lashed out at Bolton on Twitter, saying he had written a “nasty & untrue book. All Classified National Security.”

Despite the formal review process of Bolton’s book, drafts have already circulated around Washington, where the passages describing Trump’s relationship with Ukraine caused a sensation.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/white-house-bars-bolton-book-release-over----top-secret----material.html
181,31-1-20,A tropical substitute,"Now with many people looking for plant-based alternatives to meat, jackfruit’s trajectory is up

If you’ve never heard of jackfruit, keep your eyes open: You’ll start noticing it everywhere. Jackfruit is a very large tropical fruit often used as a meat substitute. It packs some nutritional wallop, and the fact that you can cook, chunk or shred it like chicken or pork, makes it a go-to main ingredient in many vegetarian and vegan dishes.

Its flavour is neutral and it takes to all kinds of seasonings. Jackfruit is native to India, and also grows in Southeast Asia, Mexico, the Caribbean and South America. It ranges from 15 pounds to a whopping 70.

For cooking, freshly picked, non-ripe jackfruit generally is used. Once ripe, jackfruit can be used in sweeter dessert preparations. It’s available whole or sliced into more manageable pieces. Unripe, it’s green and unyielding; as it ripens, it softens, turns yellow, gets some brown spots and starts to smell fruity.

It’s also sold canned, sometimes in brine or syrup, and you can find various types in specialty and Asian food stores and, increasingly, traditional supermarkets. Now with many people looking for plant-based alternatives to meat, jackfruit’s trajectory is up, up, up.

Robert Schueller, head of marketing at Melissa’s Produce, a specialty produce company, has noted that upward trend for several years. “It was about five years ago that the fruit started to really take off. Vegetarians and vegans found out how this fruit could be used as a ‘meat substitute’ for pulled pork sandwiches and as a taco meat,’’ he says.

As word spread in the US about jackfruit’s versatility, Schueller says, Melissa’s went from selling a few cases a week to thousands of cases a week. Melissa’s also offers plastic containers of jackfruit pods containing just one or two servings. Jackfruit also is popping up on menus across the country, at vegan and vegetarian restaurants, yes, but also in dishes at more mainstream establishments. Tomatillo, a Mexican restaurant in Dobbs Ferry, New York, has a quesadilla and taco made with jackfruit nestled in alongside other meaty and vegetarian offerings. In Chicago, Alulu Brewpub serves up Vegan Sicilian Jackfruit Flatbread on a menu alongside in-house cured pork belly.

Angela Means, owner of the vegan Jackfruit Café in Los Angeles, says that people are turning to a vegan diet for many reasons, including environmental, health and animal-rights concerns.

“We eat meat because of the texture and the spices. Jackfruit is a great substitute,’’ Means says. “It’s one of the best choices for us because we can mimic meat, Jackfruit grows in abundance and it has potassium, fiber, magnesium, lots of nutrients. We put it in tacos and we make sandwiches, like a barbecue pulled pork,” adds she.

Jackfruit Café also serves a fish patty made of jackfruit combined with seaweed. “You wouldn’t miss anything — we could give you our taco and you wouldn’t even know it’s vegan,” Means says. Jackfruit Café tries to educate people in its community about jackfruit and alternatives to a meat-eating diet, she says, predicting, “in seven to 10 years, jackfruit will be as popular as beef.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-tropical-substitute-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-tropical-substitute.html

183,31-1-20,"Winner, once again","Novak dominates 50th Federer clash in straight sets to book place for record 8th Australian title

Novak Djokovic shattered the hopes of ailing rival Roger Federer on Thursday to sweep into a record eighth Australian Open final and move closer to his 17th Grand Slam crown.

In the 50th instalment of one of sport’s greatest rivalries, the Serb shrugged off a tentative start to reinforce his recent dominance, showing no mercy to the Swiss maestro in a 7-6 (7/1), 6-4, 6-3 win.

He will play either fifth seed Dominic Thiem or seventh-ranked German Alexander Zverev in Sunday’s final, but it will take a monumental effort to prize another title from the 32-year-old.

Of the seven Melbourne finals Djokovic has made, he has won them all.

If any extra motivation was needed, winning on Sunday will see the Serb reclaim the number one ranking after Rafael Nadal was sent packing in the last eight.

“Respect to Roger for coming out tonight when he was obviously hurt and not even close to his best in terms of movement,” said defending champion Djokovic, who is into his 26th Grand Slam final.

“He started well at the beginning and I was pretty nervous. It was very important for me to win that first set. Mentally I relaxed after that.”

It was the fourth time Djokovic had beaten Federer at the semi-final stage in Melbourne after doing the same in 2008, 2011 and 2016.

Federer, the 2018 champion, came into the match carrying a groin injury that he picked up in his five-set, come-from-behind quarter-final win against Tennys Sandgren.

He was seen around Melbourne Park before the match with tape on his upper right leg and there were even rumours that he might pull out.

But that is not in the 38-year-old’s nature — he has only ever given up four walkovers in his long career — and the show was on.

Djokovic was clear favourite after beating the third seed in every Grand Slam meeting since Wimbledon 2012, but in their 50th career clash it was Federer who initially set Rod Laver Arena alight.

Federer had three break points to make it 5-1 in the opening set, but Djokovic dug deep to fend them off as he clawed back, breaking again and again as the Swiss was serving for the set.

It went to a tiebreaker which the second seed dominated to pull off a remarkable turnaround in a set that Federer threw away.

Federer took a medical time at the end of it, apparently for a back issue, and he wasn’t moving as freely in the second set.

But he clung on until he fluffed an easy shot at the net to hand Djokovic set point at 4-5 and the Serb cracked a top-quality crosscourt volley to go two sets to one in front.

Djokovic was pumped and Federer rapidly running out of steam.

When the Swiss star was broken to go 4-2 behind in the third, there was no way back as his rival extended his winning record over him to 27-23.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/winner--once-again.html
184,31-1-20,"New decade, new finalists","Upsets roll as Muguruza, Kenin reach women’s decider

Unseeded Garbine Muguruza fought back from behind in both sets to defeat racquet-smashing fourth seed Simona Halep on Thursday and set up an Australian Open final with surprise-package Sofia Kenin.

The Spaniard, a two-time Grand Slam champion, reached her first Melbourne final with a tough 7-6 (10/8), 7-5 victory at a steamy Rod Laver Arena.

The 26-year-old, who suffered a calamitous drop in form last season, is the first unseeded player to reach the women’s final since Belgium’s Justine Henin in 2010.

“Very excited to be in the final, it’s a long way to go and I have one more match on Saturday,” said Muguruza, the former world number one who is now ranked 32.

“I wasn’t thinking that I was down, I was thinking keep going and at some stage you’re going to have an opportunity.

“Luckily I have 48 hours now to recover and get ready for the last match. We train all of our career to be able to play on this court and in (front of) this crowd.”

Kenin the Barty pooper

Kenin, the feisty American 14th seed, earlier stunned world number one and home hope Ashleigh Barty 7-6 (8/6), 7-5 to reach her first Grand Slam final.

Moscow-born Kenin, 21, the last American left in Melbourne, was the party pooper once more.

She had already brought the fairytale run of 15-year-old Coco Gauff to an end in the fourth round with the aggressive style of play that has become her trademark over the past fortnight.

Kenin looked shell-shocked in the immediate aftermath of her surprise defeat of home hope Barty, saying: “She’s such a tough player, she’s playing really amazing. I knew I had to really find a way to win.

“I’m just speechless, I honestly can’t believe this. I’ve dreamed about this moment since I was five years old.” “I’ve worked so hard to get here,” added Kenin. “I really had to fight out here. There’s a reason she’s number one.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/new-decade--new-finalists.html
185,31-1-20,Jurgenaut rolls on,"Klopp doesn’t care about records as Liverpool close in on title

Jurgen Klopp insisted Liverpool are not motivated by making history after the runaway leaders took another step towards the Premier League title with a 2-0 win at West Ham on Wednesday.

Klopp’s side have turned the title race into a procession and they moved 19 points clear at the top with their 23rd victory from 24 league games this season.

Mohamed Salah opened the scoring with a first half penalty at the London Stadium and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain wrapped up Liverpool’s 15th successive league win after the interval.

Second placed Manchester City are now so far behind Liverpool that the question is not if but when the Reds clinch their first English league title since 1990.

The Reds have won 31 of their past 32 league fixtures, only dropping points in a 1-1 draw at Manchester United in October.

With 14 games left, Liverpool’s incredible run has given historic overtones to their impending title coronation.

But Klopp is only concerned about getting Liverpool over the finish line, with any landmarks set on the way merely the icing on the cake. “In a season you have to dig in, you don’t breathe pretty much, then after 38 games you come out of the water and see how you did,” Klopp said.

“I’m not too much concerned about records. We had a record at Dortmund and Bayern beat it the next season.

“I don’t want to be boring. We just don’t feel like that.”

The European and World champions are now 41 games unbeaten in the league — just eight away from the 49-match English top-flight record set by Arsenal’s ‘Invincibles’ across 2003 and 2004.

Matching that Arsenal team’s achievement in going an entire league season without defeat is within Liverpool’s reach, as is Manchester City’s Premier League record of 100 points.

Liverpool’s latest success on a chilly night in east London will be just a footnote when the full story of their likely title triumph is written, but they still managed to record another small piece of history.

They have now beaten all 19 of the other teams in the league at least once this season — the first time the club have achieved that feat in the top-flight.

West Ham manager David Moyes admitted Liverpool deserve their place among the Premier League’s all-time great teams.

187,31-1-20,Inter pass,"Eriksen enjoys winning debut as Inter reach Italian Cup semis

New signing Christian Eriksen enjoyed a memorable debut as Inter Milan defeated Fiorentina 2-1 on Wednesday to reach the Italian Cup semi-finals. After three successive draws in Serie A, Antonio Conte’s Inter were far from their best but still had enough to set up a last-four clash against Napoli.

Inter edged ahead just before the break when Antonio Candreva scored from close range after a pass from Lautaro Martinez who had made the most of a mix-up between Fiorentina’s Federico Ceccherini and goalkeeper Pietro Terracciano.

Martin Caceres headed the visitors level on the hour before Nicolo Barella settled the tie with a blistering volley seven minutes later.

Danish star Eriksen, signed on Tuesday from Tottenham, was brought on as a substitute for Alexis Sanchez just before Barella’s strike.

“We did not intend to use Eriksen so soon, as he only started training with us yesterday, but Matias Vecino and Barella were the only available midfielders,” said Conte. “Eriksen has character and raises the quality level.”

Fellow new recruit Victor Moses, signed on loan from Chelsea, also made second half appearance for Inter.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/inter-pass.html
188,31-1-20,Netanyahu tells Putin Mideast deal a ‘new opportunity’,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday hailed US President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace plan as a new opportunity after flying to Moscow to discuss it with President Vladimir Putin.

“I think there’s a new and perhaps unique opportunity here,” said the Israeli premier, who stood alongside Trump at the White House when the plan was announced Tuesday and called it a victory for Israel.

Trump’s plan angered Palestinians by proposing Israel retain control over Jerusalem as its “undivided capital” and giving the green light to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank.

“I’d like to speak to you and hear your insights and see how we can combine all our forces for security and peace,” Netanyahu told Putin at the start of their Kremlin meeting.

“You’re actually the first leader I’m speaking with after my visit to Washington about President Trump’s Deal of the Century,” he added.

The Russian leader did not mention the peace plan in his public remarks. Netanyahu, facing graft charges, is contesting March elections and hoping the proposal will boost his re-election chances.

The March 2 vote is Israel’s third in less than a year, with polls suggesting the Prime Minister’s rightwing Likud is again neck-and-neck with the centrist Blue and White party led by ex-military chief Benny Gantz.

Netanyahu was visiting Russia on the same day that it released a young US-Israeli woman jailed for drug trafficking over a small amount of cannabis found in her luggage as she transited a Moscow airport.

Her case caused an outcry in Israel and her release came after Netanyahu pleaded her case with Putin, who issued a pardon.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/netanyahu-tells-putin-mideast-deal-a----new-opportunity---.html

190,31-1-20,Australia heatwave renews bushfire worries,"Australia was bracing for a heatwave to sweep across the country’s fire-ravaged southeast in the coming days, with the forecast stoking fears the soaring temperatures could inflame bushfires.

Temperatures reached above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) on Thursday in South Australia state, where dangerous fire weather warnings were issued in several bushfire-prone areas.

The heatwave is then expected to hit Melbourne and Canberra on Friday before parts of Sydney reach 45 degrees Celsius on the weekend.

Authorities say the searing heat, accompanied by dry winds, would bring severe bushfire conditions to parts of New South Wales and Victoria -- where more than 80 fires are still burning across the two states.

“We’ve had the benefit of some suppressed, benign conditions over the last few days. However, as we’ve heard, it’s going to be hot and dry,” Victoria Emergency Services Commissioner Andrew Crisp said, urging residents to be prepared for bushfires to flare.

“If you’re gonna wait until you see the smoke or the fire at your doorstep, it’s far too late. You’ve gotta get out early,” he said.

Storms are forecast to follow the heatwave, bringing rain that could help dampen fires but also the potential for wild weather, including flash flooding.

Extreme weather has battered parts of Australia in recent weeks, bringing giant hail, floods and landslides.

The renewed fire threat came as worst-hit New South Wales announced an inquiry into the catastrophic bushfire season, which has left at least 32 people dead and devastated vast swathes of the country since September.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/australia-heatwave-renews-bushfire-worries.html
191,31-1-20,Art has its own moods,"From asking questions about contemporary art to reminiscing childhood, artists at the India Art Fair depict how they consciously engage themselves with historic traditions, says Uma Nair

Showcasing modern-day sensibilities and international signatures which have transcended time, India Art Fair unveiled its 12th edition to Delhi. Among the many booths to explore, two Mumbai-based galleries, Jhaveri Contemporary and Chemould Prescott, stood out for their multifaceted materials and media and compositional character.

Jitish Kallat’s Anagram

Mumbai-based Jitish Kallat’s works will make you feel inquisitive. His Anagram at Chemould Presscot is the kind of work that will draw you to it for its doodled, sensitive riddle-like texture. At its heart lies a confusion — the artist perpetually brings us to the question of what is contemporary and how did it process itself out of the roots of modernism. Recently, someone said, “In art, it has fragmented and metamorphosed; in architecture and design, it has consolidated into an aesthetic that is ubiquitous and monolithic. Its new and experimental ideas long in the past, the utopian movement has become a classic style,” and this juncture makes us believe that contemporary art has its own moods. Created out of acrylic, gesso, lacquer, charcoal and aquarelle pencil on linen, Kallat’s works echo harmony and intricate soliloquies.

Mathew Krishanu’s Crowd

Jhaveri Contemporary created a rivetting booth with Mathew Krishanu’s Crowd, an oil and acrylic on canvas, as well as Monika Correa’s Mood Indigo, a warp and an unbleached weft. Krishanu’s painting had a short-lived elegance in terms of its perspective. Born in Bradford, the younger son of an English Christian Minister and an Indian theologian mother, Krishanu spent part of his early childhood in Bangladesh. In an interview, he recalled how he felt caught between two disparate worlds during his visits to his maternal family in India.

The experience left him with a sense of being “somewhat outside both the cultures.” We detect this duality in his paintings where we see people with their sense of a spectacle but we don’t know what it is.

Krishanu has spoken of the bright lights in his childhood — how the sun would reflect both on his windows and life in a glassy way. He also shared about childhood memories and long, endless summer holidays.

The neatly laid out vertical figures of each person in the crowd certainly leave a deep impact because the painting is built on the moods of nostalgia. They also hinge on quasi-autobiographical narrative, in which memory and art history appear to fix a moment in time — the collective recall of a childhood where the sun never sets.

Monika Correa’s Mood Indigo

Monika Correa, wife of the late Charles Correa, comes through as the mistress of the weave. Her Mood Indigo has become one of the most soothing creations of the fair for its tranquil essence. Monika is an Indian artist who began working with fibre in the 1960s. “It was in 1962, when I was in Boston that I learnt the fundamentals of weaving from Marianna Strengell. Upon returning to Bombay, I started taking classes at the Weavers’ Service Centre, which was run by the Government of India for three months. Here I had the opportunity to interact with KG Subramanyan (Manida) who was working on his own “fibre sculptures” at the time. It was his approach that left a deep impact on my mind,” said she.

The art is also an example of her early experiments as a fibre artist and how she consciously engaged with historic traditions and techniques of weaving and reinterpreted them with a deep sensibility.

Mood Indigo stands apart for its duality in weft and weave. In weaving, Monika uses cotton for the warp and hand spun wool for the weft. “I was introduced to this rough and textured wool (recalling the rija rugs) by John Bissel, whose partner Madhukar Khera, would send large bundles to her from Panipat. She would have the wool dyed in Mumbai to the colours she favoured,” said she.

The thick, handspun wool was of “decisive importance to the development of her work. It has the grit and substantiality which gives a backbone to the weaving.” It is this quality of the wool that allowed her to experiment and arrive at seminal weavings. In the weavings, the reed is removed and the process goes from structured order of conventional weaving to unheeded aesthetic of improvisation. The beauty of this work is the solace that meets the eyes of the viewer and you walk away thinking that textile has become such an integral and important medium in art. Of course, when you think of the great textile artists of the world, you can’t help feeling that Jhaveri Contemporary had a certain sophistication as they embodied Leonardo da Vinci’s adage: Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

Actor Neha Dhupia, who has appeared in Hindi, Punjabi, Telugu and Malayalam films over the past two decades, has said that she never thought she would last in the film and entertainment industry for so long.

Neha, who is currently shooting for the MTV reality show Roadies, said: “I have completed two decades not in Bollywood but in front of the camera. It feels amazing. When I started, I didn’t thought that I was going to last this long but I am glad I did.”

Neha made her acting debut as a child artist in a Malayalam film named Minnaram, which released in 1994.

‘I am not much into celebrating my birthday but every year makes me feel grateful. I usually spend this day with my family and close friends but I couldn’t pick a better way to celebrate this year than working on something that makes me excited. And seeing that it is with talented director Prakash Jha and the entire cast, it makes it even more special.’

Filmmaker Subhash Ghai says that his forthcoming short film Gandhi: A Perspective is an unbiased effort.

“People, including some youngsters, have doubts about the successful journey of Gandhi ji. We have tried to give them answers through this film. I haven’t tried to make commercial film on his (Mahatma Gandhi) life. We did not put any “masala” in the film, it is entirely based on research,” said Ghai.

193,31-1-20,Shikara not just a film but a movement: Vidhu,"Filmmaker Vidhu Vinod Chopra believes that his forthcoming film Shikara, on the Kashmiri Pandit exodus of 1989 and 1990 from the Kashmir Valley, is not just a film but a movement. He added that the film is a tribute to Kashmiri Pandits and their mothers.

“Real refugees have worked in this film. This is not happening just in India but all around the world where people who have gone through a certain tragedy, have been associated with a film based on their life. I feel it will not happen ever again. The film is a tribute to the Pandit community — to us and to our mothers. And I want you the media to tell the world to come and see what happened to us. It’s been 30 years but no one made a film on this subject. It was like someone tried to hide our story. I feel this film is not a movie but a movement,” said Chopra, who is a Kashmiri pandit.

The Kashmiri Pandit exodus happened as a result of the community being targeted by Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) and Islamist insurgents in late 1989 and early 1990.

Chopra was interacting with the media at a special screening of his film, where he was present with the film’s lead actors Aadil Khan and Sadia, besides writer Abhijat Joshi, and lyricist Irshad Kamil. It was his mother who told Chopra to make a film on the subject, the filmmaker revealed. “I feel it’s the story of all of us (Kashmiri Pandits). Our homes were snatched but we stood on our feet with courage. I feel this story is not a story of just one mother. My mother inspired me to make this film. Before she died, she told me that if possible, make a film on Kashmir. She passed away in 2007 and in 2008, I completed first draft of this film,” he said.

The director, who made Mission Kashmir in 2000 on the subject of terrorism in the state, said: “It’s been 11 years since then and (scriptwriter) Abhijat Joshi has worked with me on this film for five to six years. We did a lot of hard work for this film and we are proud of the film. We wanted to show people what happened with us and how, despite that, we are standing on our feet. There is hope in our lives and we are settled here. We are not beggars and we are not asking for any help from the government, and that’s really a big thing.”

194,31-1-20,A labour of love,"Author Jyotsana Shahane shares how Narayani Nayak’s out of print cookbooks inspired her to make necessary additions and changes in The Classic Konkan Cookbook with a view to open the cuisine’s secrets to a range of food lovers. An edited excerpt

When Narayani Nayak brought out her book, Cookery Craft in 1952, very few cookbooks were available in India. Most housewives gleaned information from handwritten notes passed down from mother to daughter. Some books were written by Britishers stationed in India, giving Anglo- Indian recipes for Cofta ka Carree, Quorema’s, Country Captain, Doopiajas, Hindustanee and Hussenee curries recorded from conversations with their khansamas, along with several more pages of household and housekeeping tips and advice.

It was only in the late 1950s that women’s magazines started getting published, and soon recipes printed in them were prized, cut out and preserved.

When Cookery Craft received such ‘a good reception from the public’, Nayak resolved to revise and rewrite it ‘to serve as a convenient kitchen companion to every housewife, who is receptive to new ideas and is interested in good cooking, and particularly to the new bride about to start her home’.

In 1964, she published 500 Easy Recipes that incorporated her two earlier books (Cookery Craft and 200 Recipes). This book was extremely popular among Konkani-speaking people in India, predating all other cookbooks by a good 15 years.

What makes the book stand out, even today, is Nayak’s ability to give exact weights and measures. Up until then, cookbooks were quite vague about amounts, mentioning only ingredients and a technique of cooking that was not always logical or easy to follow.

In Konkani food, unlike other cuisines in India, each preparation is named according to the ingredients used and the degree of density. Nayak followed a cogent method, which she detailed in each recipe, and gave an indication of the consistency of each preparation (thick, solid, soupy, gravy and more).

To think that Nayak was educated only up to Class V is amazing. She was born in Karkala in Udupi district and learnt to write only after her marriage. She also taught herself English, among other languages, for the sake of her children. Her grandson recalls her carrying her ‘quaint notebooks everywhere, recording each and everything when in the kitchen. When the pages of many such notebooks were filled, her husband encouraged her to publish them’. These became Cookery Craft and, later, 500 Easy Recipes. She calls ‘the countless hours spent... first and last a labour of love’.

The book was a huge success and was reprinted in 1965, 1966, 1979 and 1986 before it went out of print.

It did, indeed, become the go-to book for Konkani brides, in much the same way as The Joy of Cooking by Irma Rombauer or Mastering the Art of French Cooking by Julia Child, Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck was for brides in the US. One of my friends, Jyoti Prabhu, recalls leaving Indian shores to join her doctor husband as a newly-married woman of 19. Her suitcase was full of her trousseau of glittering sarees, jewellery, slippers and this cookbook. ‘The sarees and jewellery were all put away in a cupboard, hardly ever to be used again, but the cookbook was utilised every single day, till I knew it all by heart. It fell apart when I photocopied it for the sixth time, for my daughter.’

My own introduction to authentic Konkani food was at the table of Nalini Karnad in Bombay in the 1970s. The lunch-time meal was created by her and her 99-year-old mother and herself, with ingredients bought fresh every day from the neighbourhood vegetable market.

Every meal, for me, was a journey of discovery. Of ingredients unknown, of exotic tastes and surprising textures. The lunch thali was dotted with all kinds of vegetarian preparations. Two types of lentils, four vegetables, chutneys, pickles, salads, rice, rotis, buttermilk and homemade curds were part of the daily meal.

Forty-odd years of sharing such meals have given me a fondness for the taste of Konkani food, a liking that led me to learn and reproduce the preparations at my own table for my family and in my blog on Indian food, The Cooks Cottage, which I began writing in 2004.

A few characteristics that struck me were the freshness and simplicity of the food. Then there was the use of all kinds of vegetables, some quite unknown to me at the time. Lastly, the fact that nothing was wasted. Every part of vegetable or fruit was used. Stalks, leaves, and peels were used to great effect in curries, chutneys, and pickles. In a country where many people do not have enough to eat, this resonated with me.

When Nayak wrote the book, the average housewife in India spent almost the whole day in the kitchen, cooking food from morning to night, for her husband and family. With an average of four to six children per household, large amounts were cooked. The day began with a cooked breakfast, carried on to a hot lunch and ended with a large dinner, interspersed with helpings of snacks and sweets as well. A meal, served on a thali or a banana leaf, consisted of a couple of vegetables, a lentil dish, a fried snack, two chutneys and a salad besides a sweet dish and buttermilk to wash it all down.

Ways of cooking and eating have changed today. Most people have time to cook just one or two main dishes and these must provide all the nutrients necessary for a healthy living. Besides changing from the old measures of tola and seers to grams and cups, I have rewritten most of the recipes to increase or decrease the amount where necessary, suggested substitutions if the main ingredient is not easily available, shortened the preparation time by using modern appliances, and given alternatives to those who do not have the time or energy to start from scratch.

The recipes were tested by me over a period of two years and then retested by my many Konkani friends, who gave insights into spicing and traditions and names in each corner of the region. Some were rigorously tested by my friends from the US, who were totally new to the cuisine, to check for ease of use, clarity, method and measures. One was vastly overqualified for the job, being an auditor of NASA reports.

The addition of red and green chillies in most recipes has been reduced as many recipes were overpoweringly pungent. They can, in fact, be made optional, so the flavour of the main ingredient comes through. I have added more popular meat and seafood recipes from the region as the original book had very few, surprisingly so, since seafood is available in abundance on the Konkan coast.

All these changes have been made with a view to making this cuisine more accessible and reproducible by interested cooks around the world. As with the original book, this has been a labour of love.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-labour-of-love-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-labour-of-love.html

197,31-1-20,Pune 7 Aces end Superstarz winning streak,"Chirag Shetty beat Satwiksairaj Rankireddy in a highly-anticipated clash as Pune 7 Aces ended the winning streak of Chennai Superstarz with a 5-2 scoreline in the first double header of the Star Sports Premier Badminton League at the GMC Balayogi Sats Indoor Stadium in Hyderabad on Thursday.

With this third consecutive win Pune climb up to the second spot right behind Chennai Superstarz in the league standings as they accumulated 14 points.

The biggest highlight of the day was the showdown between Rankireddy and Shetty, who partnered each other to a historic Thailand Open title win last year. With Rankireddy pairing up with Sumeeth Reddy for Chennai and Shetty appearing with world champion Hendra Setiawan for the Aces, it was a clash that none of the Indian badminton fans wanted to miss.

What gave the match an extra edge was the fact that it was the fourth rubber of the tie and happened when the two teams were locked at 2-2. Playing the Trump for Pune was a huge responsibility for Shetty and Setiawan and right from the first point, they showed they were up for the challenge.

Shetty showed exceptional alertness at the net. Chirag, who had previously admitted that his partnership with Setiawan was helping sharpen his net play, remained a wall to take the opener 15-12 for his team.

The second game witnessed a little bit more of firepower from Satwik as the score remained level till 6-6. With Pune once more upping the ante to go up to 10-7 Rankireddy briefly raised hopes of a comeback to make it 10-10. Satwik’s trademark smashes finally made their appearance as he kept it level till 13-13. Under pressure, Sumeeth Reddy took the initiative to save a match point at 13-14 before Hendra’s mastery finished the 15-12, 15-14 Trump win to seal the tie for Pune.

“It was a completely different experience for me. We have played against each other many times in practice but this was the first time we faced each other in a competitive match,” said Shetty on seeing his regular partner on the opposite side of the net.

In the other matches of the day, Commonwealth Games Gold medalists Chris and Gabrielle Adcock continue to remain unbeaten with yet another commendable performance. The Pune pair beat Chennai’s Rankireddy and Jessica Pugh 15-10, 15-12.

2019 Thailand Masters champion Loh Kean Yew inflicted Lakshya Sen his first PBL defeat of the season with a gritty 15-13, 10-15, 15-8 win that tested the nerves and tenacity of both the players. Pune also won the other men’s singles match of the day with Kazumasa Sakai notching up a 15-10, 15-12 win over Sathish Kumar Karunakaran, who impressed on his PBL debut.

The only match that did not go Pune’s way was the women’s singles.

With Tai and Sindhu orchestrating two of the most enthralling matches on the BWF World Tour last year, excitement for this encounter was high ever since the auction for the fifth edition of the league was held and both have termed the encounter as the toughest match.

“Tai is always fun to play against. It’s not going to be easy. But we’ll be playing in front of our home crowd. Yesterday (Wednesday) we had a few losses, but overall we won the tie. It’s going to be a good fight tomorrow (Friday). I am really looking forward to it,” said the world champion.

With the defending champions Raptors suffering a loss in each of their three ties so far, the former World No 1 knows the importance of a win against the World No 6. A win against Sindhu would be crucial to help turn around the fortunes of last year’s champions.

199,31-1-20,"Series sealed, India look for experimentation","Rishabh, Samson & Saini can get chance in playing XI as Men in Blue eye T20 whitewash

An unassailable lead has opened up the window for experimentation but there will be no letup in India’s intensity when they face a heartbroken New Zealand team in the fourth T20I here today.

Mohammed Shami and Rohit Sharma combined to pull off a thrilling win via a Super Over in the third game for a 3-0 lead and a maiden T20I series win on New Zealand soil.

There is only a short turnaround time for the last two matches, back-to-back in Wellington and Mt Maunganui today and on Sunday, respectively.

Both teams spent Thursday travelling from Hamilton to Wellington, and with a similar tight schedule for the final game of the series as well, there seems to be little chance of nets.

While a five-match T20I series is a rarity, India’s early victory means both sides can contemplate various permutations in light of the T20 World Cup later in the year.

From an Indian perspective, need of the hour is to find a balance between experimentation and the winning desire.

Both skipper Virat Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri pride themselves on a win-at-all-times mentality, and they have a rare chance to blank out a 5-0 sweep in this T20I series, thus etching out a slice of history.

Kohli even mentioned the same in the post-match presentation at Seddon Park on Wednesday night.

India wouldn’t need to change too much to retain a near full-strength playing eleven. There are obvious contenders for certain spots in both batting and bowling department should experimentation kick in.

Sanju Samson and Rishabh Pant are waiting for opportunities, with the former expected to get a look-in. Pant’s call-up would depend on which batsman is left out, and whether KL Rahul will continue to keep wickets.

While the top trio is assured of places, Shreyas Iyer has been in superb touch and can claim to pin down a spot on his own as well. Both Manish Pandey and Shivam Dube need more game time as well.

Any of the top four can be rested over the next two games. Indeed it wouldn’t be a stretch of imagination if one of Kohli and Rohit Sharma were alternately rested in Wellington and Mt Maunganui. Such a move would allow the youngsters to keep their spots whilst maintaining the experience in the side too.

More changes are to be expected in the bowling department. Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav and Navdeep Saini are waiting in the wings. All three may not get a look-in immediately. Rest assured though, the team management is sure to rotate a spinner and pacer each.

Sundar is part of Kohli’s new-ball strategy on the big Australian grounds, so he can expect a run-in over the next two games. Saini could replace Shardul Thakur, especially if Sundar adds his batting depth to the lower order.

The final question would be over Jasprit Bumrah’s inclusion. While he had an off night in Hamilton, there ought to be thoughts about his workload. He is part of both the ODI and Test squads, and is a shoe-in for the T20 World Cup later on as well.

While there have been no concerns about any injury issues, the management needs to be wary of overplaying him in non-consequential bilateral matches.

For New Zealand, there is a straightforward change coming up. Colin de Grandhomme is no longer with the squad, giving up his spot for batsman Tom Bruce.

This could be an easy swap for the hosts given that they have been light in the middle order during the past three matches.

There is also a school of thought that Kane Williamson should move up top. Given his batting master class in the Hamilton T20I, there is potential for him to open the innings with Martin Guptill with Colin Munro sliding down.

Mitchell Santner was promoted on Wednesday night to add more momentum to the innings, and it remains to be seen if it was a one-off ploy or something the Black Caps could consider experimenting with.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/series-sealed--india-look-for-experimentation-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/series-sealed--india-look-for-experimentation.html

201,31-1-20,"Three terrorists killed in encounter in Jammu, cop injured","Three terrorists were killed in a gunbattle that broke out after a group of militants, travelling in a truck, opened fire at a police team at a toll plaza on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway here on Friday, officials said.

Police said the terrorist group is suspected to have infiltrated from along the International Border (IB) in Kathua district to carry out an attack.

The group of three-four terrorists was on their way to Srinagar when the police team intercepted it at the Bann toll plaza, Jammu and Kashmir Director General of Police Dilbag Singh told PTI.

Bann toll plaza in Nagrota is about 28 kilometers from the Jammu city.

One of the terrorists was killed in the ensuing gunfight while the rest managed to escape to the adjacent forest area, Singh said, adding that a policeman was injured and has been hospitalised.

They are suspected to be a newly infiltrated group and were on their way to Srinagar, the DGP said. ""It is suspected that they infiltrated from Hiranagar border (of Kathua district),"" he added.

The Jammu-Srinagar highway was closed and traffic halted and entire forest belt was cordoned off and terrorists were intercepted, resulting in a fierce gunbattle, the officials said.

The terrorists also fired grenades, they said.

Two more terrorists were killed in the gunbattle, taking the toll to three, the DGP said, adding that one more is probably in trap.

Four weapons and large quantity of ammunition and explosives have been recovered, the DGP said. He said the terrorists might be foreigners.

IGP Jammu Zone, Mukesh Singh told reporters that the truck on its way to Kashmir was intercepted at the toll post at 5 am by a joint team of police and CRPF.

There was firing from the truck resulting in injuries to one policeman, he said.

Police and CRPF jawans retaliated, killing a terrorist while the rest managed to escape towards the forest area, IGP said.

The truck driver, Maqbool, who is an over ground worker, has been arrested and is being questioned, the IGP said.

The truck was carrying polyvinyl and a cavity was created inside it to hide the terrorists, officials said.

The terrorists were armed with bullet-proof jackets, they said.

The officials suspect the terrorists might have planned to carry out attack at vital installations as well as security camps along the nearly 300-km highway.

Senior police officials were at the spot to oversee the combing operations.

All schools and colleges have been closed in Udhampur districts as a precautionary measure.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/three-terrorists-killed-in-encounter-in-jammu--cop-injured-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/three-terrorists-killed-in-encounter-in-jammu--cop-injured.html

203,31-1-20,Win not enough,"Pep Guardiola called on Manchester City to learn the lessons of a 1-0 home defeat to Manchester United despite progressing to a third successive League Cup final 3-2 on aggregate.

The holders enjoyed the vast majority of the chances but could not find a way past the inspired David de Gea and went behind to United’s first attempt on goal 10 minutes before half-time when Nemanja Matic fired home.

United’s hopes of completing a miraculous comeback were extinguished when Matic was then sent-off 15 minutes from time and City held on to face Aston Villa at Wembley on March 1.

“In 180 minutes we were better than United,” said Guardiola. “We created chances to score a lot of goals and didn’t convert.

204,31-1-20,Black Caps include Jamieson for ODIs,"Injuries to frontline fast bowlers have forced New Zealand to opt for fresh blood in their pace attack, including the country’s tallest cricketer Kyle Jamieson, for the upcoming three-match ODI series against India.

The 6’8” tall uncapped Jamieson could be in for a potential debut in the series starting February 5 in Hamilton, while Scott Kuggeleijn and Hamish Bennett return to the squad after a long absence.

Injury has meant the likes of Trent Boult, Lockie Ferguson and Matt Henry are unavailable for the series.

Nicknamed Killa, the towering Jamieson has been using his height to good effect in the domestic circuit, bouncing out batsmen.

The 25-year-od has of late sparkled for New Zealand A, including against the touring India A side recently.

The Black Caps will rely on Tim Southee’s experience, while Colin de Grandhomme returns to the squad after being left out for the last two T20Is.

Jimmy Neesham and Mitchell Santner will be the all-round options.

Meanwhile, spinner Ish Sodhi has been included in the squad for only the first ODI in Hamilton.

He will be released for the second unofficial Test between India A and New Zealand A in Christchurch on February 7.

Coach Gary Stead said his team was aware of the task at hand and looked up to his batsmen to step up.

“We’ve seen from the Twenty20 series (India) are clearly as strong as ever,” Stead said.

“While the bowling line-up has a fresh look, the batting is very settled and we’ll likely have the same top eight batsmen from the World Cup finals.

“Tim Southee has an important job leading our new look pace attack, which has a huge opportunity against some of the very best batsmen in the world.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/black-caps-include-jamieson-for-odis.html
205,31-1-20,India A all out for 216,"Shubman Gill’s run-a-ball 83 was the only high point for India A as New Zealand A grabbed the opening day honours in their first unofficial Test on Thursday.

India A were all out for 216 in their first innings and New Zealand A responded strongly, reaching 105 for two at the close of play and reducing the deficit to 111 runs with plenty of wickets in hand.

Sent in to bat after the coin landed in favour of home team captain Hamish Rutherford, India A soon found themselves in a spot of bother at 34 for three in the 17th over at the Hagley Oval.

The 20-year-old Gill, seen as one with a bright future, found an able ally in skipper Hanuma Vihari (51), and the duo added 119 runs for the fourth wicket to steady the ship.

However, off-spinner Cole McConchie (3/33), who was the second most successful home bowler behind medium pacer Michael Rae (4/54), dismissed Vihari in a bizarre manner after the batsman had done all the hard work.

After Vihari played a sweep shot directly into the shin of Rachin Ravindra at silly mid-on, the ball flew towards the wicketkeeper and Dane Cleaver calmly pouched it.

Vihari’s knock was a 79-ball effort was studded with eight hits to the fence.

Stumper Kona Bharat seemed to be settling in nicely when the visitors lost the big wicket of Gill off Rae's bowling.

From 183 for five, it did not take the New Zealand A attack to warp up the India A innings.

The home team lost skipper Rutherford for 28 but his opening partner Will Young (26) was there in the middle when stumps were pulled out.

206,31-1-20,Rain save Lanka in 2nd Test,"Heavy rain and bad light in the afternoon frustrated Zimbabwe’s push to build a match-winning position on the fourth day of the second Test against Sri Lanka in Harare on Thursday.

A downpour mid-afternoon forced the players off the field and, although they returned briefly after tea, only 54 overs were bowled in the day, restricting Zimbabwe to 241 for seven at the close, an overall lead of 354.

The Zimbabwe captain Sean Williams, who made a century in the first innings, was 47 not out when bad light forced the players off and must now decide whether to declare overnight to give his bowlers a full day to try and win the match and square the two-Test series.

Brendan Taylor set the tone for the home side during the morning session when he made his second half-century of the match. The 33-year-old struck a rapid 67 as the hosts added 117 during an extended morning session.

Taylor had picked up quickly from his run-a-ball 62 in the first innings, passing 2,000 runs in Test cricket on his way to 67 from 75 balls.

His innings, which included eight fours and a six, ended when he was on the wrong end of an lbw shout from Lahru Kumara, the ball looking certain to slide down the leg side.

Sikander Raza added 70 with Williams for the sixth wicket before also departing leg before, this time to a ball from left-arm seamer Vishwa Fernando that appeared to pitch outside leg stump.

In the brief 26-ball passage of play in the evening session Tinotenda Mutombodzi stepped too far away to off to give himself room and lost his leg stump to Suranga Lakmal.

Matches against England and hosts Australia, two of the world’s top teams, will be an ideal opportunity for India to plug the gaps as they continue their search for an ICC tournament silverware despite boasting a team full of talented players.

They came close to winning it in the 2017 ODI World Cup, only to lose by nine runs to England in the title clash.

A year later, their campaign ended in the semifinals of the World T20 in the West Indies, going down to England again.

Chief coach WV Raman, under whom the team has dished out a fearless brand of cricket over the past one year, feels playing in the tri-series will help his outfit before the T20 World Cup.

The mega-event will be played in Australia from February 21 to March 8.

India are placed alongside the hosts, Bangladesh, New Zealand and Sri Lanka in the group stage.

Bengal’s rookie batter Richa Ghosh is the only new face in the squad.

Richa has been rewarded for her exploits in the women’s Challenger Trophy, where she smashed 36 off 26 balls in one of the games with four boundaries and a six.

“I will be taking part in national and international competitions without pressure of having to qualify for Olympics. At the same time, I will focus on my training and on my technique to keep on improving my performance in the competitions leading up to the Olympics.

“I will try my best to win a medal in Olympics and this performance is giving me hope,” he said.

Chopra, who also won a Commonwealth Games Gold in 2018, said the pain in his elbow has now fully subsided.

“I did not feel any pain on my elbow during the competition. My training in South Africa is going well. I thought I will begin with some caution and avoid straining my elbow.

As soon as the president made these remarks, some opposition members shouted ""shame, shame"" slogans and also displayed banners.

Kovind also made it clear that the procedure to grant citizenship to people of all religions and those who have faith in India and keen to take Indian citizenship remains as it was.

""Debate and discussions strengthen democracy but violence during protests weaken democracy,"" he said without directly referring to the anti-CAA protests in the country some of which have witnessed violence.

In a reference to abrogation of Article 370, Kovind said there is happiness among people of India that people in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh have got rights on par with the rest of the country.

212,31-1-20,Jamia firing whips up poll fever,"Teen opens fire at anti-CAA protesters, taken into custody; student hurt

A teenager fired from a pistol at anti-CAA protesters at Jamia, injuring a Jamia Millia Islamia student, before walking away while brandishing the firearm aloft and shouting “Yeh lo aazadi” amid heavy police presence in the area on Thursday afternoon. The boy was overpowered by police and taken into custody.

Though normalcy returned to Jamia and its adjoining area by night, Opposition parties cashed in on the opportunity to corner the BJP, accusing its divisive politics for the shooting. The incident has raised political fever in poll-bound Delhi.

The incident took place when the students were heading from Jamia to Rajghat. The march was stopped at the Holy Family Hospital near the university as the police said the protesters didn’t have permission for the march. Suddenly a teenaged boy popped up with a pistol in hand and started shouting slogans against the anti-CAA protesters. He confronted the protesters and opened fire, injuring a student in the hand. The incident took place in full media glare in the presence of police. The shooting video went viral within minutes.

The gun-toting youth was overpowered by police and taken into custody. A case under section 307 IPC & 25/27 Arms Act has been registered at New Friends Colony police station, said police.

According to the shooting video which went viral within minutes, dozens of policemen in riot gear are seen behind the shooter, but none of them is seen trying to stop him. However, police said the shooting incident happened for a split second. “By the time police could react, the person had already fired the shot. Everything happened in seconds. The investigation is on. The case has been transferred to the Crime Branch. We are also probing whether he is a juvenile or not,” Special Commissioner of Police (Intelligence) Praveer Ranjan.

Massive protests erupted in the area after the firing with hundreds of agitated people gathering near the university, breaking barricades which lead to minor clashes with police personnel. Many sang the national anthem.

The gunman went live on Facebook before the brandishing the gun. Before the attack, the man also put out messages on Facebook stating “Shaheen Bagh Khel Khatam” (Shaheen Bagh game is over). Another message stated, “Please wrap me in saffron in my last journey with slogans of Jai Shri Ram.” His Facebook profile was deleted after screenshots of his posts were circulated widely on social media platforms.

The man’s Facebook profile name is “Rambhakt Gopal” (actual name withheld in case he is proved to be a minor), which has now been deleted, also said he is taking revenge for “Chandan Bhai”, referring to a Chandan Gupta, who died of gunshot during a motorcycle rally taken out to celebrate the Republic Day in 2018.

“Chandan bhai ye badla aapke liye hai (this revenge is for you),” he had posted.

The Facebook profile was deleted after screenshots of the posts were shared widely on social media.

Police said he is a resident of Jewar in Uttar Pradesh’s Greater Noida.

Jamia Chief Proctor Professor Waseem Ahmed Khan said, “The firing had left a student, Shadab Farooq, injured and he was taken to Holy Family hospital, which referred him to AIIMS. Some of teachers are with him in hospital and his condition is said to be out of danger. On evening we again talked with students following which they moved back to the university and three students who were detained were also released by police.”

Meanwhile, Praveer Ranjan, the Special Commissioner of Police, met the injured, Farooq at AIIMS. Ranjan said the incident of shooting at Jamia on Thursday happened in a split second which is why the police couldn’t react immediately.

“We have checked the injured and pellet has been removed from his arm. As per doctors he’s stable. We have apprehended the person. We are investigating whether he is a juvenile or not. The case transferred to Crime Branch,” said Ranjan.

After the incident, several students recapped how their peaceful march on Gandhi’s death anniversary met with firing. Ragibh Naushad, an LLB student at the university, said the Jamia Coordination Committee organised a march to pay homage to Gandhi on his death anniversary.

“It started at 12 am from Gate number 7, but police denied the permission and stopped the march near the Holy Family hospital. A man came there and started brandishing a weapon and later fired. He was also chanting pro-CAA slogans,” said Naushad.

“My friend Farooq, a mass communication student, was trying to calm the attacker but he shot at him injuring his left hand,” he said

Jamia alumnus Khalid Hassan said initially many were not sure whether it was a gunshot or a tyre burst.

Sit-in by students went on until 8 pm and it was called off only after intervention from the university’s senior officials, who were seen pacifying the students since afternoon.

Some of the students moved back towards gate number -7 and some stayed at the barricades installed by police near Holy Family hospital.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday asked Shah to take care of the deteriorating law and order situation in Delhi.

“What is happening in Delhi? The law and order is deteriorating. Please take care of Delhi’s law and order,” Kejriwal said in the tweet.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Southeast district, Chinmoy Biswal, said the students wanted to take out a march from Jamia to Rajghat but they were denied permission.

“They were being repeatedly told that the protest should be carried out peacefully. We had barricaded the road just before the Holy Family hospital. Meanwhile, a person was seen in the crowd who waved something which appeared to be a weapon. We have detained him and are interrogating him,” said the DCP.

Several other protests were also witnessed across the city at Delhi Gate and Police Headquarters (PHQ) where hundreds of people gathered to mark their protest against the shooting act and CAA.

The protests across the city also lead to heavy traffic snarls. Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav, activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan, CPI leaders D Raja and Kumar Anjaan were among those who said they were detained in separate demonstrations to show solidarity with the Constitution on Mahatma Gandhi’s death anniversary on Thursday.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/jamia-firing-whips-up-poll-fever-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/jamia-firing-whips-up-poll-fever.html
213,31-1-20,Opp leaders point finger at BJP,"In the season of hate speeches, a lone shooter fired at anti-CAA protesters, hurting a Jamia student on Thursday, and raising the fear of communal polarisation ahead of the Delhi Assembly election. It also gave ammunition to the Opposition parties to hold the BJP responsible for the shooting incident which took place on a road at Jamia Millia Islamia.

Soon after the firing, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari told news agency ANI, “The shooting incident proves that the people at the heart of the protest are violent in nature. They believe in bullets and bombs.” He linked it (shooting) with alleged plans to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

However, Home Minister Amit Shah was quick to tweet out an assurance that the “culprit will not be spared”.

“I have spoken to the Delhi Police Commissioner on the incident of firing in Delhi and have directed him to take stringent action,” Shah said in a tweet message.

The Home Minister also said the Central Government will not tolerate such incidents.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal asked the Home Minister to take care of the “deteriorating” law and order situation in the national Capital, “What is happening in Delhi? The law and order is deteriorating. Please take care of Delhi’s law and order,” Kejriwal said in a tweet.

The Opposition parties latched on to the provocation speech by Union Minister Anurag Thakur to accuse the BJP of creating a situation that led to the shooting.

The last week saw an all out attempt by the BJP to place Shaheen Bagh anti-CAA protest as its main poll plank. Led by Shah, the BJP leaders have unleashed massive outreach to convince the voters that the supporters of the anti-CAA protest, especially the Shaheen Bagh crowd, represented the so-called ‘tukde tukde gang”.

In the process, Thakur seemed to have crossed the “line” when he allegedly egged on the crowd to “shoot” the protesters. Thakur chanted “desh ke gaddaro ko.” To which the crowd chanted “ Goli maro saalo ko.”

When the Delhi polls were announced, the AAP was clear favourite, but the BJP leadership was not ready to give up. They obviously saw their best chance in mobilising opinion against anti-CAA protest. . The fact that no effort has been made by the police to remove the Shaheen Bagh protesters has raised several eyebrows. The major problems faced by motorists who used the Shaheen Bagh route and and closures of hundreds of shops in the areas gave the BJP perfect reasons to keep flagging this issue.

The AAP alleged that the firing incident in Jamia area was a BJP conspiracy to get the Delhi elections postponed as the “saffron party knows it is losing” the polls scheduled for February 8.

“The BJP did such a disgusting act on the Martyrdom Day of Gandhi ji. The BJP and Home Minister Amit Shah are scared of losing the upcoming polls and they are trying to get the polls postponed through the act. Amit Shah has tied the hands of the Delhi police in Jamia that is why they were mute spectators of the incident,” AAP spokesman and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh said.

Congress spokesman Manish Tewari claimed that the shooting incident was planned and was staged to polarise voters.

Congress, Left parties, PDP and others alleged the firing at Jamia on a group of anti-CAA protesters is a fallout of “hate” speeches and inflammatory comments made by Union Ministers and BJP leaders during campaigning for the February 8 Delhi Assembly polls.

Subhash Chopra, DPCC president said, “A deliberate attempt is being made to create an atmosphere of fear among the people as the BJP leaders, in a futile bid to win the Delhi Assembly elections, were using offensive language to divide the people.”

“The hate-speech and call to violence by Union Ministers and BJP leaders — along with the silence of the PM — has led to this shameful outcome. This is the kind of India this govt wants to create. #MartyrsDay,” CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury tweeted.

CPI general secretary D Raja said the incident is a “direct result” of the inflammatory comments made by BJP leaders. “The Jamia firing incident is a direct result of provocative statements made by BJP leaders during campaigning in Delhi. BJP leader Anurag Thakur should be arrested for his comments urging crowds to raise slogan of shoot the traitors,” Raja said.

While former BJP ally PDP president Mehbooba Mufti’s said the shooting incident at Jamia seems to have completed India’s transition from democracy to mobocracy. Former Union Minister Manish Tewari said the shocking incident at Jamia is a result of hatred which has been created in the country for past one month.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also took to Twitter to slam the BJP. “The incidents like this are only possible because BJP Government’s Ministers and leaders are inciting people to shoot by giving provocative speeches. The Prime Minister should answer what kind of Delhi he wants to build? Do they stand with violence or non-violence? Do they stand with development or with chaos?” Priyanka said on Twitter.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/opp-leaders-point-finger-at-bjp.html
214,31-1-20,"EC slaps 72-hr campaign banon Anurag, 96 hrs on Parvesh","Soon after the firing incident in Jamia area, the Election Commission (EC) on Thursday imposed a 72-hour campaigning ban on Union Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur and 96-hour ban on BJP MP Parvesh Verma for their provocative hate speeches against anti-CAA protesters.

In its order, the EC has stated that the ban is effective from 5 pm on January 30. The EC issued the orders after it studied their responses to the show-cause notices issued on January 28. The EC refused to consider their requests for personal hearing on the matter.

Both leaders have been barred from holding any public meetings, processions, rallies, and interviews, public utterances in media (electronic, print, social media).

“Whereas the Commission has carefully considered the matter and is of considered view that Anurag Thakur has made undesirable and objectionable statements which has the tone and tenor to aggravate existing differences or create mutual hatred between different religious communities and thus violated the provisions of Model Code of Conduct and Representatives of the People Act 1951. Now, therefore the Commission hereby condemns the impugned statements made by the Thakur,” the EC said in its order. The Commission expressed a similar view and tone in its order against Verma.

Thakur, who is Minister of State for Finance, encouraged the crowd at a BJP election rally this week to chant “desh ke gaddaron ko…” to which the crowd responded “goli maaro saalon ko”. Thakur apparently rejoiced the follow-up chant since he again repeated… “desk ke gaddaro ko…” and once the crowded response, “ goli maro saalo ko.”

Verma, who is an MP from West Delhi, said that Shaheen Bagh protesters could “enter homes and rape sisters and daughters”.

The EC also clarified that its earlier order to remove the two leaders’ names from the list of BJP star campaigners ahead of the February 8 polls with immediate effect shall also remain in force.

In his reply to EC, Thakur has stated that he has chanted only “desh ke gaddaron ko” which literally means the traitor of the country and it was the crowd that responded to his slogans. He also maintained that he had no intention to create or promote enmity between different religions, races, castes or communities nor did he do any covert or overt act in furtherance of the same and thus the same is not violative of the MCC and the Representation of the People Act. Not satisfied with the reply, the EC barred Thakur from holding public rallies, meetings, giving interviews, making utterances in print, electronic and social media for 72 hours (three days) beginning 5 pm on Thursday.

Verma has been barred from campaigning for 96 hours (four days) for his interview in which he made remarks on Shaheen Bagh and a statement on removing mosques at an election meeting in Vikas Puri on January 28.

In his reply, Verma said his remarks on Shaheen Bagh protesters were in response to a question in an interview and were misrepresented by the media. He also said his statement on removal of mosques was in context of removing illegal encroachments from Government lands. He also denied that there was any violation of MCC and the RP Act.

Like Thakur, Verma too had sought a personal hearing before the poll panel. But it was rejected.

On Wednesday, the poll body had ordered the removal of Thakur and Verma from the party’s list of star campaigners.

The voting for the Delhi Assembly is scheduled to take place on February 8 and the counting will begin on February 11.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/ec-slaps-72-hr-campaign-banon-anurag--96-hrs-on-parvesh.html
215,31-1-20,Murder accused holds 20 children hostage in UP,"A murder accused held 20 children hostage at a house in Kasaria village here since 4pm, police said. Subhash Batham, who had invited the children, aged five to seven, for a birthday party, opened fire when locals tried to open the door. One person sustained gunshot injuries in his leg. Batham even hurled a bomb from the window.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is monitoring the situation, and a NSG team has been rushed in.

The children has been held hostage for past seven to eight hours, a distraught mother said around 11 pm. “They must be thirsty and hungry by now,” she said.

Television channels have appealed to Batham to contact them in case he wanted to share his demands with the Government or authorities.

“A special team of trained personnel is on the spot and we have kept NSG commandos on standby. Our priority is to rescue children at the earliest,” said UP Police chief OP Singh.

A huge crowd has collected at the spot comprising mainly parents of the children who have been held hostage.

Late at night, the captor released a six-month-old girl even as the rescue op was on.

A top home department official has asked the electronic media not to show rescue operation live.

Police said Batham is a murder accused and he seems to be mentally unstable. Inspector General of Police, Kanpur Range, Mohit Agarwal, said, “The man called the children for a birthday party and held them hostage in the basement of the house. He fired six shots from inside the building.”

He said Batham, who appears to be mentally unstable, fired on those who attempted to speak to him. Batham wanted to talk to the local MLA, but he refused to speak to the leader when he arrived, Agarwal said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/murder-accused-holds-20-children-hostage-in-up-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/murder-accused-holds-20-children-hostage-in-up.html

217,31-1-20,Kerala girl 1st coronavirus case in India,"India on Thursday confirmed the first case of deadly novel coronavirus infection in the country. The Union Health Ministry said the patient, a woman, is a student at Wuhan University and the National Institute of Virology in Pune has confirmed about her positive status.

“She is in isolation in the hospital. She is stable and is being closely monitored,” said the Ministry.

One of 20 samples has tested positive for coronavirus, said Kerala Health Minister KK Shailaja. The results of three more samples are yet to be released. “The patient had returned from Wuhan and is now kept in isolation at General Hospital in Thrissur. She is stable,” she said, urging people travelling from China to report to the health department. Three more suspected cases are in isolation wards in Thrissur.

Over 800 people are under surveillance at their homes in Kerala for possible exposure to the virus. “We are well prepared with multi-level surveillance, support systems on the ground. A 28-day home quarantine is crucial,” the Kerala Minister added.

Meanwhile, a 23-year-old man from Tripura has died of the Wuhan coronavirus in a hospital in Malaysia, his family has claimed. “My 23-year-old grandson had gone to Malaysia around two years ago,” Manir Hossain’s grandfather Abdul Rahim told an agency on Thursday. “We got a phone call from the Malaysian authorities on Wednesday morning, informing us of Hossain’s death due to coronavirus.”

The family is from the village of Purathal Rajnagar in Madhupur police station area. Hossain reportedly used to work in a restaurant. Rahim urged the Government to make arrangements for bringing back his grandson’s body.

The Government also said that it has reached out to over 600 Indians living in China’s Hubei province, the epicentre of coronavirus, to ascertain their willingness to be brought back to India.

“We have established contact with over 600 Indians across the province and are individually ascertaining their willingness to be repatriated. Our mission in Beijing is working round-the-clock on the ground to work out the necessary logistics,” External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said at a media briefing.

“We have made a formal request to the Government of China for bringing back Indian nationals from the Hubei province in two flights. We are awaiting the necessary approval from the Chinese side. We hope this will be granted soon,” Kumar said.

Kumar said arrangements are being put in place for people to travel to the airport in Wuhan.

To keep a tab on the lethal disease and preparedness to deal with it, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Guaba again held a high-level review meeting with the concerned Ministries of Health & Family Welfare, External Affairs, Defence, Home Affairs, Civil Aviation, Information & Broadcasting, Labour & Employment, and Shipping.

It was decided that all those who have come from China after January 15, 2020 shall be tested as there in an incubation period, lab facilities will be augmented with six more labs becoming functional from Thursday. These are NIV Bengaluru Unit, Victoria Hospital Campus, KR Road, Fort, Bengaluru , AIIMS, New Delhi, NCDC, Delhi (5) Kasturba Hospital for infectious diseases, Mumbai and NIV - Kerala Unit.

Also, gram panchayats are being organised to make people more aware regarding the symptoms, precautions and measures taken by the State Governments regarding prevention and management for coronavirus in villages bordering Nepal.

The States have also been advised to open control rooms, appoint a nodal officer and popularise the control room number and IEC material is being prepared in local language by the concerned States. Nearly 30,000 passengers have been screened at various airports across the country.

As on January 30, 2020, a total of 7,711 confirmed cases were reported by 31 provinces, 1,370 serious cases, 170 deaths, 124 discharged and cured cases and 12,167 suspected cases.

218,31-1-20,"Farrukhabad hostage crisis ends after 8 hours, captor & his wife dead","The hostage crisis in Farrukhabad ended shortly after midnight on Friday after the 23 children who were held captive for about eight hours were rescued by the police and the captor was shot dead, while his wife was lynched by angry locals.

The hostage drama began at Kasaria village on Thursday evening when Subhash Batham, who is a murder accused, invited the children, aged between six months and 15 years, to his daughter's birthday party.

""The accused had invited the children for the birthday party of his daughter and held them hostage. It started about 5.45 pm on January 30 and continued for about eight hours,"" Director General of Police (DGP) O P Singh said, adding that in the entire operation they had tried to ""engage"" the accused and were successful.

He said the accused had initially released a six-month-old girl by handing her over to his neighbour from a balcony.

Police said Batham, who seemed mentally unstable, handed over the girl to his neighbour from a balcony.

The accused fired from inside the house on those who tried to speak to him, the police said, adding that a man and two policemen suffered a bullet injury.

The motive of the accused was not known immediately.

""The accused was killed and there were about 23 children who were rescued safely,"" Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi told reporters at a hurriedly called press conference at 1.20 am.

His wife died in a hospital on Thursday night. She had tried to escape from the spot when Batham opened fire, but was caught by angry locals who thrashed her and pelted stones at her, IG Kanpur Mohit Agarwal.

She sustained a head injury in the attack, but the exact cause of death would be known after post-mortem, he said.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath monitored the situation in Farrukhabad, which is nearly 200 km from state capital Lucknow.

""The CM as soon as he got to know about the incident called a meeting of crisis management group and personally monitored the situation and ensured children are rescued safely,"" Awasthi said.

""It is laudable that all the children who were held hostage in Farrukhabad were freed through the efficient strategy and planning of police,"" Union Home Minister Amit Shah said, congratulating the chief minister and UP police.

221,31-1-20,Nirbhaya case: Tihar challenges before Delhi court maintainability of plea for stay of execution,"Saying only one convict's plea is pending and the others can be hanged, Tihar Jail authorities on Friday challenged before a Delhi court the application of three condemned prisoners in the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case seeking a stay on their execution on February 1.

The convicts' lawyer disagreed with the jail authorities, who filed a status report before Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana, and said rules dictate that when one convict's plea is pending the others cannot be hanged.

Advocate A P Singh, representing three death row convicts -- Pawan Gupta, Vinay Kumar Sharma and Akshay Kumar -- urged the court to adjourn the executions ""sine die"" (with no appointed date for resumption). Vinay's mercy plea before the president is pending.

The prison authorities opposed the plea and said only one convict's mercy plea is pending and others can be hanged.

""When one convict's plea is pending, others cannot be hanged as per rules,"" Singh said.

He urged the court to adjourn the executions ""sine die"" as legal remedies of some of the convicts are yet to be availed.

The fourth person sentenced to death in the case is Mukesh Kumar, whose mercy plea was dismissed by President Ram Nath Kovind on January 17. The appeal against the rejection was thrown out by the Supreme Court on Wednesday.

The trial court on January 17 issued black warrants for the second time for the execution of all the four convicts in the case in Tihar jail at 6 am on February 1. Earlier, on January 7, the court had fixed January 22 as the hanging date.

The curative petitions of Vinay and Akshay have been rejected by the apex court. Pawan is the only one yet to file a curative plea.

Convicts have the option of moving a mercy petition before the president only after the apex court dismisses their curative plea.

On Thursday, the Delhi court issued notice to the jail authorities seeking their response on the plea of the death row convicts seeking stay on their executions.

Their victim, a 23-year-old physiotherapy intern who came to be known as ""Nirbhaya"" (the fearless one), was gangraped and savagely assaulted on the night of December 16, 2012, in a moving bus in South Delhi. She died of her injuries a fortnight later in a Singapore hospital.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nirbhaya-case--tihar-challenges-before-delhi-court-maintainability-of-plea-for-stay-of-execution-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/nirbhaya-case--tihar-challenges-before-delhi-court-maintainability-of-plea-for-stay-of-execution.html

223,31-1-20,"Economic slowdown bottomed out, uptick from here onwards: CEA","Chief Economic Adviser K V Subramanian on Friday said India's GDP is expected to grow at 6-6.5 per cent next fiscal as the economic slowdown has bottomed out.

As per the first advance estimates released by the National Statistical Organisation (NSO), the country's economic growth is likely to hit an 11-year low of 5 per cent in the current fiscal ending March 2020.

The Economic Survey 2019-20, prepared by a team lead by Subramanian, has projected the GDP to expand in the range of 6-6.5 per cent during 2020-21.

The Indian economy has hit the bottom and it will see an uptick from here, he said in a media briefing post the Economic Survey.

Amidst a weak environment for global manufacturing, trade and demand, the Indian economy slowed down with GDP growth moderating to 4.8 per cent in the first half of 2019-20, lower than 6.2 per cent in H2 of 2018-19.

Based on NSO's first advance estimates of GDP growth for 2019-20 at 5 per cent, an uptick in GDP growth is expected in the second half of the fiscal, it said.

According to it, the uptick in second half of 2019-20 would be mainly due to ten positive factors like picking up of Nifty India Consumption Index for the first time this year, an upbeat secondary market, higher FDI flows, build-up of demand pressure, positive outlook for rural consumption, rebound of industrial activity, steady improvement in manufacturing, growth in merchandise exports, higher build-up of foreign exchange reserves and positive growth rate of GST revenue collection.

The survey also emphasised that merger of public sector banks may increase the financial strength of the merged entities, lower the risk aversion and result in lowering of lending rates.

Further, as the implementation of GST further settles down, the increased unification of the domestic market may reduce business costs and facilitate fresh investment.

Reforms in land and labour market may further reduce business costs, said the survey, presented a day before Sitharaman's Union Budget 2020-21.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/economic-slowdown-bottomed-out--uptick-from-here-onwards--cea-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/economic-slowdown-bottomed-out--uptick-from-here-onwards--cea.html
224,31-1-20,Two Super Over finishes have taught me to stay calm and bounce back when chance comes: Kohli,"India captain Virat Kohli on Friday said he has learnt an important lesson in the back-to-back Super Over finishes against New Zealand: To ""stay calm till the end"" and bounce back when the opportunity arises.

A nervous New Zealand threw it away yet again as a perseverant India prevailed in the Super Over for the second successive time to take a 4-0 lead in the five-match T20 International series.

""There's something new I've learnt in the last couple of games: when the opposition is playing well, you stay calm till the end and try to come back,"" Kohli said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

Needing just 11 runs off the last two overs with seven wickets in hand, New Zealand dug a hole for themselves yet again, taking the game to a Super Over two nights after doing the same in Hamilton.

New Zealand managed 13 runs in six balls and India got there effortlessly.

The India skipper said having come out victorious in two consecutive Super Overs for the first time proves the character of the team.

""We couldn't have asked for more exciting games, we've never played Super Overs before and now we've won two. It shows the character of the team,"" Kohli said.

Although Sanju Samson didn't make any significant contribution in the match, Kohli said he initially thought of sending the Kerala batsman in the Super Over along side K L Rahul but eventually changed his mind.

""Initially we thought of opening with Samson and KL in the Super Over, but then KL told me I should bat because of the experience and the options I'll bring,"" he said.

""His (Rahul's) two strikes were crucial and then you knock the ball into the gap and take your team over the line. Sanju was fearless at the top of the order. He tried to take the momentum away, he should back himself.""

Kohli also lavished praise on young pacer Navdeep Saini, who went wicketless on Friday.

""Saini was impressive with his pace again. We were very proud with the way we went about it,"" he said.

New Zealand skipper Tim Southee, who stood in for injured regular captain Kane Williamson, said they presented India opportunities and the visitors grabbed them with both hands.

""It's very tough especially in the positions we put ourselves into. We gave them (India) a chance and they took them with both hands,"" he said.

""We have a young bowling attack and, it is tough, when you haven't won and you play against a quality opposition in India, give them a sniff and make it tough for yourselves.""

Man-of-the-match Shardul Thakur, who finished with figures of 2 for 33 and also bowled the crucial last over in which New Zealand needed just seven runs, said such nail-bitting finishes augurs well for India ahead of this year's ICC T20 World Cup.

""I'm feeling good, we play for such nail-biting finishes, we couldn't have asked for anything more in these two games,"" he said.

""After the last game we learnt that we should never lose hope. The wicket on the first ball of the last over was crucial because it made them nervous. Good contribution from me with the bat, I should have carried on and hopefully I'll get more next time,"" he added.

The fifth and final match of the series will be played at Mount Maunganui on Sunday.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/two-super-over-finishes-have-taught-me-to-stay-calm-and-bounce-back-when-chance-comes--kohli-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/two-super-over-finishes-have-taught-me-to-stay-calm-and-bounce-back-when-chance-comes--kohli.html

Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, reported 5,806 confirmed cases, including 204 deaths, official media reported.

A total of 213 people have died of the disease as of Thursday, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Chinese health authorities announced that 9,692 confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus had been reported in 31 provincial-level regions and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps by the end of Thursday.

About 20 countries, including India, have reported confirmed cases of the virus in travellers coming from China.

China said it has full confidence and capability to win the fight against the epidemic.

The WHO has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency.

The UN health agency on Friday declared an international emergency over the deadly novel coronavirus from China -- a rarely used designation that could lead to improved international co-ordination in tackling the disease.

""Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,"" World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said as he announced the virus as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

Reacting to the announcement, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying in a press statement said, ""Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus epidemic, the Chinese government has been taking the most comprehensive and rigorous prevention and control measures with a high sense of responsibility for people's health.""

Many of these measures go well beyond the requirements of the International Health Regulations, she said.

""We have full confidence and capability to win this fight against the epidemic,"" said the spokesperson.

She said that at the same time, the Chinese side informed relevant sides and shared the genome sequence of the coronavirus in a timely manner with openness, transparency and a responsible attitude.

""WHO and many countries have recognised and commended this,"" she said.

Hua said China has been in close communication and cooperation with WHO.

""WHO experts recently conducted a field trip to Wuhan. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also visited China and discussed containment and mitigation of the 2019-nCoV with the Chinese side,"" she said.

228,31-1-20,India second largest mobile manufacturing hub globally: Kovind,"India is making rapid strides in electronics production and has emerged as the second largest mobile phone manufacturing hub globally, President Ram Nath Kovind said on Friday.

Addressing a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament, Kovind said the value of electronic equipment manufactured in the country has increased to Rs 4.58 lakh crore in 2018-19 from Rs 1.90 lakh crore in 2014-15.

""In 2014, there were only two companies manufacturing mobiles in India. Today, India is the second largest mobile manufacturing hub in the world,"" he said.

He noted that the government is promoting manufacturing of mobile phones, TVs and other electronic devices, and National Policy on Electronics has been formulated in this regard.

Over the last few years, the government has been bullish on making India a manufacturing base for the world and has set a target to promote domestic manufacturing in the entire value-chain of ESDM (electronic system design and manufacturing) to achieve a turnover of USD 400 billion (Rs 26 lakh crore) by 2025.

For mobile handset segment alone, the government, under the National Policy on Electronics 2019, had set a target of making 100 crore mobile handsets indigenously by 2025, valued at about Rs 13 lakh crore.

Out of the 100-crore mobile handset manufacturing target, 60 crore units will be for exports valued at about Rs 7 lakh crore.

According to industry body Indian Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), mobile handset exports grew over eight-fold to Rs 11,200 crore in 2018-19 and exceeded imports for the first time.

The President, in his address on Friday, said technology is playing a major role in bringing cities and villages closer.

""So far, more than 1.25 lakh Gram Panchayats have been connected with high speed broadband under the BharatNet scheme,"" he said.

In 2014, there were 60,000 Common Service Centres in rural areas, a number that has now increased to more than 3.65 lakh.

""This has provided employment to more than 12 lakh villagers. Through these centres, the government is delivering more than 45 services in rural areas,"" he said.

Asserting that digital technology is the foundation of the Industrial Revolution 'Industry 4.0', he said the government has focussed on digital access, digital inclusion and digital empowerment in an ""unparalleled manner"" through the Digital India Programme.

""It is a matter of pride for the country that digital systems developed in India during the last five years have been a source of inspiration for several countries of the world,"" he said.

Kovind said more than 121 crore people in the country have Aadhaar cards and about 60 crore people possess RuPay cards.

""A record value of Rs 2 lakh crore has been transacted through UPI in December 2019,"" he said adding the government has also launched a new version of the BHIM App.

The government has linked about 450 schemes to Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) by using the `JAM Trinity' of Jan-Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile.

He said over Rs 9 lakh crore has been directly transferred to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through DBT in the last five years.

""By plugging the leakages, my Government has saved about Rs 1.70 lakh crore from going into the wrong hands,"" he added.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-second-largest-mobile-manufacturing-hub-globally--kovind-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/india-second-largest-mobile-manufacturing-hub-globally--kovind.html

231,31-1-20,People don't associate action genre with me: Aditya Roy Kapur,"Bollywood star Aditya Roy Kapur, who is reuniting with his ""Aashiqui 2"" director Mohit Suri after seven years, credits the filmmaker for breaking the mould by casting him as an action hero in ""Malang"".

The 34-year-old actor said before ""Malang"", he mostly did romantic roles but Suri, who gave him his career's biggest hit, has faith in him to pull off diverse characters.

""Mohit sees certain things in me, which other directors haven't. 'Aashiqui 2' was the first time I did a romantic lead and so he obviously saw that in me.

""Once again, this is him breaking the mould and giving me the chance to do action when I don't think people really could place me in that genre. I give him full credit for being able to have the faith in me to be able to pull it off,"" Aditya told PTI in an interview.

The actor is confident that audiences will get to see a different side of him in ""Malang"", which also stars Disha Patani, Anil Kapoor and Kunal Kemmu.

""The film that worked for me years ago was ""Aashiqui 2'. Then I ended up doing more romantic films, not in the same vein, but at the end of the day, they were all love stories. People started to think that's what you are and it is the pond that you swim in.

""Sometimes they need to be shown something before they can believe it. Maybe it was in my decision making process and that I didn't kind of sniff out something different but action is definitely not a genre that people are associating me with just by virtue of having not done it before,"" the actor said.

Besides being an action film, Aditya said ""Malang"" is also a psychological romance thriller.

""It's a genre that hasn't been attempted too many times. There is also an element of surprise. There are twists and turns the things that are not what they seem to be. And there is a certain amount of mystery that we want to maintain. Mohit has managed to create some really interesting characters.""

Aditya said it was fun and liberating to explore grey shades of his character.

""You keep reading about actors that have played villainous roles with various grey shades and say that it's a lot more fun. It is fun because you're not having to always be the right guy, the nice guy or the good guy. It frees you up.

""I actually had a great time playing this role. As an actor, you need to keep experimenting and kind of exploring different parts of your personality.""

""Malang"" is scheduled to be released on Friday.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/people-don-t-associate-action-genre-with-me--aditya-roy-kapur-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/people-don-t-associate-action-genre-with-me--aditya-roy-kapur.html
232,31-1-20,Hope more men watch female-led movies like 'Birds of Prey': Margot Robbie,"Actor-producer Margot Robbie hopes more and more men turn up to watch female-driven films, like her latest ""Birds of Prey"", as she believes they will be able to relate with such stories.

Robbie is returning as Harley Quinn in ""Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)"", on which she also serves as producer.

Directed by Cathy Yan, the DC film has been penned by ""Bumblebee"" scribe Christina Hodson.

""Birds of Prey"" also features Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress, Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Black Canary, Ella Jay Basco as Cassandra Cain and Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya.

Robbie said she watches films regardless of the protagonists gender.

""I hope that guys watch films with female leads as much as they watch ones with male leads. 'Cause I watch films despite the gender of the protagonist and find a way to relate just on human behaviour.

""I feel if more men watch female-driven content they'd find a way to relate as well,"" the 29-year-old actor told Sky News at the premiere of the movie here.

The new film is a spin-off of ""Suicide Squad"" that introduced Robbie as Harley Quinn.

Robbie said despite being a champion of women's rights, she ultimately wanted the best person for the directing job.

""It was a big priority for me to always seek opportunities for women because they categorically and historically get fewer opportunities.

""However, at the end of the day, the best person for the job should get the job and if the best person that came in was a guy we would have had a guy directing this film, but Cathy was the best person for this job,"" she added.

This award season has been a let down when it comes to a lack of female nominees in the directing categories at this year's BAFTAs and Oscars and the actor hopes next year is better.

""I hope that's not the case next year. I loved a lot of movies this year, I loved movies that were directed by phenomenal female directors as well, but yeah, what can you do?"" Robbie said.

She is nominated for best supporting actress BAFTA for ""Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood"" and ""Bombshell"". She has also earned an Oscar nod for ""Bombshell"".",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hope-more-men-watch-female-led-movies-like--birds-of-prey---margot-robbie-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/hope-more-men-watch-female-led-movies-like--birds-of-prey---margot-robbie.html
233,31-1-20,Sasi’s nephew tries to upset power balance,"The DMK, struggling to wrest the control of Tamil Nadu administration which it lost in the 2011 Assembly election to the AIADMK, got a shot in the arm on Thursday with one of the most powerful persons from the Sasikala clan endorsing MK Stalin as the next Chief Minister of the State.

TTV Dhivakaran, nephew of VK Sasikala, the close aide to late J Jayalalithaa, who is also a convict in the disproportionate assets case, declared at Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu during a marriage ceremony that there was only one person who could regain the lost status of the Dravidians. “Thalapathy MK Stalin is the leader who could do that. Only he could do it,” said Dhivakaran, popularly known as the Boss in AIADMK. Mannargudi-based Dhivakaran was reportedly the “kingmaker” because of the influence he wielded in the Government during the days of Sasikala and Jayalalithaa.

He chose the marriage ceremony of a close relation of SS Palanimanickam, the MP of Thanjavur to make the announcement. Though both the DMK and the Dhivakaran camps were tight-lipped about the future plans, it has become clear that they have succeeded in building a flyover between them and the possibilities of political alliance have brightened.

But what Dhivakaran left unsaid was the impact film actor-turned-politician Rajinikanth would create in the State. “Decades ago EV Ramasamy Naicker, a Kannadiga, came to Tamil Nadu and launched the Dravida movement. But today, can we imagine a Tamil leader would be able to do the same in Karnataka? But more and more outsiders are coming to Tamil Nadu to launch their political dreams,” said Dhivakaran indirectly hinting at Rajinikanth.

The ties between the Sasikala and Karunanidhi families date back to the 1970s. It was Karunanidhi, the then DMK president who conducted the marriage between Sasikala and Natarajan, a Dravidian who later joined the Jayalalithaa camp.

Stalin, who played the roles of match-maker as well as the priest, said that Tamil Nadu people are slowly and steadily understanding the truth and the days to come would bring in more and more leaders to the DMK. Thanjavur, dominated by the Thevar caste was a stronghold of the AIADMK. But the demise of Jayalalithaa and the disintegration of the AIADMK has made it easy for the DMK to regain the lost ground.

Govindarajan Satyamurty, Coimbatore-based political commentator, said the stance of Dhivakaran has brightened the prospects of Stalin and the DMK. “But the ultimate losers would be the AIADMK and TTV Dhinakaran, the AMMK leader. The 2021 election would be a direct fight between Stalin and Rajinikanth. Once the film actor launches his party, a section of the AIADMK would join him while another part would go over to the DMK,” said Satyamurty.

Though TTV Dhinakaran, brother of Dhivakaran, had launched a political outfit Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) after Sasikala and members of her family were eased out of the AIADMK by the faction led by Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami, the newly formed entity is yet to make any impact in the State. Adding to the woes of the Sasikala family, most of the confidants to the clan either went back to the AIADMK or rejoined the DMK.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sasi---s-nephew-tries-to-upset-power-balance.html
234,31-1-20,Brexit Day: Businesses see promising India-UK ties ahead,"The UK will officially become a non-member of the European Union (EU) from Friday night, a certainty welcomed by Indian businesses operating in the UK as well as British businesses keen to expand into the Indian market.

The official transition period from Saturday until the end of December means status quo in terms of much of the trade and business operations vis-a-vis the UK and EU, but what does change is Britain's free hand to strike new deals and partnerships around the world. Leading trade organisations and Indian entrepreneurs see this as an exciting time for the India-UK trade and economic partnership to be taken to a new level.

""There's no question that India will be a vital trading partner as the UK charts a new future outside the EU. The golden opportunities for British firms in India play to the best strengths of UK plc – from infrastructure to healthcare to FinTech,” said Lord Karan Bilimoria, founder of Cobra Beer and Vice-President of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) – the key voice of British businesses in the UK.

As someone who campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU in the June 2016 Brexit referendum, the India-born entrepreneur is now focussed on ensuring that the opportunities unleashed by Brexit are fully capitalised and that is where comes a checklist for India.

""To fully capitalise on these opportunities, British firms would like to see further progress in reducing corporate tax rates, data privacy and ease of doing business indicators. If these steps are taken, and the UK maintains an active strategy for engagement and interaction with the Indian economy at all levels, it will remain a significant partner in India's future growth story,” notes Bilimoria, who has business interests both in the UK and India.

The end of a 47-year relationship was never going to be easy and the long-drawn divorce process between the UK and EU took a toll on businesses, which operated on a kind of pause mode as Britain missed Brexit deadlines since 29 March last year.

""There was a mess in the handling of the Brexit negotiations, and everyone will just be glad that the mess is over,” said Lord Swraj Paul, who heads the London-headquartered Caparo Group with operations worldwide.

“The UK has never been entirely happy with its EU membership. But I don't think Brexit would have a very major impact on the UK's working with Europe; that relationship remains even if people voted to leave. As far as India goes, it has a relationship with the UK and the EU and both will be strengthened further,” he noted.

Boris Johnson has repeatedly singled out India in the list of countries he wishes to strike an enhanced trade agreement with, ever since he pitched his tent in favour of Brexit. As Prime Minister now with a thumping majority in Parliament, he is seen to be in a position to action some of those promises.

""Prime Minister Johnson will get along very well with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the two will strike a good rapport. Trade, investment, climate change and immigration will be on top of the agenda for an expected India visit,” said Mohan Kaul, President of the Indian Professionals Forum (IPF), who believes the technology, financial services and healthcare sectors particularly stand to benefit in a post-Brexit India-UK tie-up.

GP Hinduja, Co-Chairman of the Hinduja Group, also hails the “exciting time for relations between Britain and India” and enormous scope for both countries to reach a free trade agreement, as he welcomed the “energy and dynamism” already shown by Boris Johnson ahead of the “historic” Brexit Day.

""There are already positive moves like fast track visas to continue to attract top scientists and possible reforms to inheritance tax. Furthermore, the government should implement more investor-friendly policies to attract new and returning foreign investors and high net worth individuals (HNWI) who have departed over the past few years,” said Hinduja, whose diversified group operates across various sectors and borders.

According to fDi Markets data, between 2000 and 2016, the UK invested more than USD 24 billion into Indian industry and between January 2009 and October 2019, a total of 2.78 billion pounds was invested from Indian companies into London alone. This predominance of London is also expected to continue in a post-Brexit scenario.

“In recent years we have seen a large number of Indian businesses choosing London for international expansion and in 2018 the UK capital attracted more investment projects from India than any other global city,” said Allen Simpson, Managing Director of Strategy and Corporate Affairs at London & Partners – the Mayor of London's official promotional agency.

“With our mutual strengths in technology and innovation, cities like London, Mumbai and Bengaluru are producing game-changing companies, and as India's economy goes from strength to strength we see lots of opportunities for collaboration between these two nations,” he said.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/brexit-day--businesses-see-promising-india-uk-ties-ahead-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/brexit-day--businesses-see-promising-india-uk-ties-ahead.html
235,31-1-20,Vegetarian diet linked to lower risk of urinary tract infections,"Researchers have revealed that a vegetarian diet may be associated with a lower risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs).

UTIs are usually caused by the gut bacteria, such as E. coli, which enter the urinary tract through the urethra and affect the kidneys and bladder, said the study researchers from Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation in Taiwan.

Previous research has shown that meat is a major reservoir for E. coli strains known to cause UTIs, but it is unknown whether avoiding meat reduces the risk of UTIs.

For the findings, published in the journal Scientific Reports, the research team assessed the incidence of UTIs in 9,724 Buddhists in Taiwan, who participated in the Tzu Chi Vegetarian Study, a study investigating the role of a vegetarian diet on health outcomes in Taiwanese Buddhists.

The researchers found that the overall risk of UTIs was 16 per cent lower in vegetarians than in non-vegetarians.

According to the study, of the 3,040 vegetarians in the study, 217 developed a UTI compared to 444 UTI cases in 6,684 non-vegetarians studied.

The reduced UTI risk associated with a vegetarian diet was greater in men than women, although overall UTI risk for men was 79 per cent lower than for women, regardless of diet, the research added.

The study suggests that by not eating common sources of E. coli, such as poultry and pork, vegetarians may avoid ingesting E. coli that may cause UTIs.

The researchers also propose that the higher fibre diet of many vegetarians may prevent the growth of E. coli in the gut and decrease UTI risk by making the intestine more acidic.

Further study with identification of pathogens from urine culture is needed to clarify the relationship among UTI risk, pathogens, and vegetarian diet, the researchers said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/vegetarian-diet-linked-to-lower-risk-of-urinary-tract-infections-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/vegetarian-diet-linked-to-lower-risk-of-urinary-tract-infections.html
236,31-1-20,NASA bids farewell to Spitzer telescope after 16 years,"NASA has bid goodbye to the Spitzer space telescope after 16 years of service using infrared light to unveil otherwise invisible features of the universe, including seven planets the size of Earth around the star Trappist-1.

""It's quite amazing when you lay out everything that Spitzer has done in its lifetime, from detecting asteroids in our solar system no larger than a stretch limousine to learning about some of the most distant galaxies we know of,"" said Spitzer project scientist Michael Werner in a NASA statement on Thursday.

Spitzer, which was sent into orbit and began astronomical observations in 2003, is one of the powerful telescopes exploring things beyond the range of the human eye, examining electromagnetic radiation of various wavelengths, just like the Hubble, Compton and Chandra telescopes do, the Efe news reported.

This scope focuses on infrared light, which can reveal different characteristics of the universe from normal ""visible"" light, including objects that are too cold to emit visible light such as exoplanets, brown dwarfs - star-like bodies with insufficient mass to actually shine - or the cold material that is present between the stars.

Infrared light - which is merely what we commonly know as ""heat"" - is invisible to the human eye, but some of its waves can pass through clouds, gases and dust that are opaque to visible light.

""Spitzer has taught us about entirely new aspects of the cosmos and taken us many steps further in understanding how the universe works, addressing questions about our origins, and whether or not are we alone,"" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

""This Great Observatory has also identified some important and new questions and tantalizing objects for further study, mapping a path for future investigations to follow. Its immense impact on science certainly will last well beyond the end of its mission"".

The Tarantula Nebula was one of the first celestial objects that the Spitzer telescope observed, a region of space where one of the most-studied stars in the universe - one called 1987A - exploded as a supernova in 1987 with the brightness of 100 million Suns, although because it is located 1,68,000 light years away from Earth (about one million trillion miles) it was too faint for humans to see without a telescope.

Spitzer's original astronomical mission was extended five times, after it exhausted its store of coolant - specifically liquid helium - in 2009.

The coolant was used to chill the telescope's 33.5-inch main mirror to within five degrees of absolute zero, about minus 450 degrees Fahrenheit. The mirror needed to be that cold to be able to pick up faint infrared radiation from deep space that cannot be detected from the ground.

However, since the telescope is so far from the Sun, NASA experts were able to keep using the space-based telescope and its retirement had been planned for 2018, when the James Webb Space Telescope was to be launched, although that mission was delayed and Spitzer's service life was prolonged.

The James Webb orbiting telescope will also be used to observe space in the infrared spectrum starting in March 2021, although a recent report by the US government Accountability Office said that it is highly probable that its launch will be delayed for ""technical"" reasons.

NASA is planning to reveal the newly established launch date for the James Webb telescope in the spring of 2020, according to the report.

In 2018, NASA earmarked $9.7 billion for the construction and launch of that telescope, some $828 million more than had been budgeted in 2011 for the project.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nasa-bids-farewell-to-spitzer-telescope-after-16-years-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/nasa-bids-farewell-to-spitzer-telescope-after-16-years.html
237,31-1-20,"In boost for Trump, key Republican senator opposes calling witnesses","A key Republican senator said late Thursday that he would oppose calling new witnesses at Donald Trump's impeachment trial, paving the way for the possible acquittal of the president by the Senate as early as Friday.

Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said he would vote ""no"" when the question of calling further witnesses at the trial is considered on Friday.

Four Republican votes were needed to introduce new witnesses into the proceedings, and Alexander had been considered one of a handful of Republican senators who might support the motion.

Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine said she would support the call for witnesses, and Utah Senator Mitt Romney has said he was ""very likely"" to do so.

Another wavering Republican -- Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- has said she will announce her decision Friday morning.

Republicans hold a 53 to 47 seat edge in the Senate, and four Republicans needed to side with the Democrats for new witnesses to be introduced.

If the motion for new witnesses is rejected, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could conceivably call for a vote to convict or acquit the president as soon as Friday.

Democrats are particularly eager to hear from former national security advisor John Bolton, who reportedly claims in an upcoming book that Trump personally told him that military assistance to Ukraine was tied to Kiev investigating his Democratic rival Joe Biden.

The charge is at the heart of the December 18 impeachment of the 45th US president for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress by the Democratic-majority House of Representatives.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/in-boost-for-trump--key-republican-senator-opposes-calling-witnesses-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/in-boost-for-trump--key-republican-senator-opposes-calling-witnesses.html
238,31-1-20,Greta Thunberg nominated for Nobel Peace Prize by Swedish MPs,"Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg and the global protest movement ""Fridays for Future"" were nominated Thursday for the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize by two Swedish lawmakers.

""Greta Thunberg is a climate activist, and the main reason she deserves the Nobel Peace Prize is that despite her young age, she has worked hard to make politicians open their eyes to the climate crisis,"" Left Party parliamentarians Jens Holm and Hakan Svenneling wrote in a letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee.

""The climate crisis will produce new conflicts and ultimately wars. Action for reducing our emissions and complying with the Paris Agreement is therefore also an act of making peace,"" they said.

The pair added that without the Fridays For Future movement and Greta Thunberg, ""the climate issue would not have been on the agenda to such an extent as it is today."" Thunberg, 17, was mentioned as a possible Nobel Peace Prize winner in 2019, when the honour ultimately went to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed for his efforts to resolve a long-running conflict with neighbouring Eritrea.

In just over a year, the climate activist, who suffers from a form of autism called Asperger's, has become the voice of a generation haunted by the climate crisis.

She began her ""School Strike for the Climate"" outside the Swedish parliament in August 2018, and has since inspired and mobilised millions of young people to get involved.

Nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize must be submitted by February 1 to the Norwegian Nobel Committee.

239,31-1-20,WHO declares international emergency over novel coronavirus,"The UN health agency on Thursday declared an international emergency over the deadly novel coronavirus from China -- a rarely used designation that could lead to improved international co-ordination in tackling the disease.

""Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,"" World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said as he declared a ""public health emergency of international concern"".

""This is not a vote of no confidence in China,"" he said, emphasising repeatedly that the measure was intended to help other countries less able to cope and praising the Chinese government for taking swift action to tackle the outbreak.

""We must all act together now to limit further spread.... We can only stop it together,"" said Tedros, who travelled to China this week and met with President Xi Jinping.

Tedros also said there was ""no reason"" for any of the international travel or trade restrictions announced in recent days, such as flight suspensions, border closures and quarantine for apparently healthy travellers.

Top airlines including Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa have suspended or cut back services to China.

The WHO's Emergency Committee, an advisory body of international experts, said in a statement that evidence had shown that restricting movement of people and goods during public health emergencies ""may be ineffective and may divert resources from other interventions"".

""Further, restrictions may interrupt needed aid and technical support, may disrupt businesses, and may have negative effects on the economies of countries affected by the emergencies,"" the committee said.

But it added that ""in certain specific circumstances, measures that restrict the movement of people may prove temporarily useful"" -- a possible reference to lockdowns within China that have affected millions of people.

WHO stopped short of declaring an emergency last week because its emergency committee was divided over the issue.

More than 7,700 people have been infected with the virus -- almost all of them in China -- and 170 have died.

The WHO said there have also been 82 confirmed cases in 18 other countries, including cases of onward transmission in Germany, Japan, the United States and Vietnam.

The WHO has called a public health emergency of international concern only five times since the relevant legislation took effect in 2007 -- for swine flu, polio, Zika and twice for Ebola outbreaks in Africa.

The designation, which is reviewed every three months, allows the WHO to issue global recommendations that the international community is expected to follow.

Governments, companies and people around the world have already been escalating efforts to contain the illness, which is believed to have emerged from an animal market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

Many countries have urged their citizens not to visit China, while some have banned entry for travellers from Wuhan and Russia said it was closing its far eastern border with China over the outbreak.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/who-declares-international-emergency-over-novel-coronavirus-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/who-declares-international-emergency-over-novel-coronavirus.html
240,31-1-20,Richa Chadha speaks on pay disparity in Bollywood,"Actress Richa Chadha as spoken on pay disparity in the Hindi film industry and said that the day all actors are able to bring in equal business at the box-office, the problem will cease to exist.

""I for one have not had that kind of experience with respect to pay parity in Bollywood because I feel the industry rewards your box-office prowess. It's really the number of bums you put on the seats. I think the day people start commanding a higher box-office (they will get higher pay). The day people are able to bring business is the day it will be fine and there will be no problem. You will get what you ask for,"" Richa told IANS.

The actress was recently seen in the Kangana Ranaut-starrer ""Panga"", which has collected Rs 21.36 crore at the box-office in a week since release.

A lot has been said about Kangana being a difficult star to work with, but Richa begs to differ.

""I usually get along with everyone and if someone gets along with me, I am confident enough to believe that something is wrong with them because I literally make friends on every project. I think we shared a very professional and cordial relationship,"" she said.

241,31-1-20,"WhatsApp dangerous, Bezos must use my app: Telegram founder","Private instant messaging app Telegram's founder Pavel Durov has said Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos' data may not have been hacked if he had relied on Telegram instead of Facebook-owned WhatsApp which is full of malicious ""backdoor"" bugs.

Facebook has blamed Apple's operating system for the hacking of Bezos' phone, saying WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption is unhackable.

Investigators believe that Bezos's iPhone was compromised after he received a 4.4MB video file containing malware via WhatsApp - in the same way when phones of 1,400 select journalists and human rights activists were broken into by Pegasus software from Israel-based NSO Group last year.

""WhatsApp's 'corrupt video' vulnerability was present not only on iOS, but also on Android and even Windows Phone devices. Meaning, on all mobile devices with WhatsApp installed,"" Durov wrote in a blog post late Thursday.

""This security fault was not present in other messaging apps on iOS. Had Jeff Bezos relied on Telegram instead of WhatsApp, he wouldn't have been blackmailed by people who compromised his communications,"" he added.

According to Durov, WhatsApp uses the words ""end-to-end encryption"" as some magic incantation that alone is supposed to automatically make all communications secure. However, this technology ""is not a silver bullet that can guarantee you absolute privacy by itself"".

According to Durov, there are backdoors that are camouflaged as ""accidental"" security flaws and may lead to such instances.

""Enforcement agencies are not too happy with encryption, forcing app developers to secretly plant vulnerabilities in their apps. I know that because we've been approached by some of them -- and refused to cooperate. As a result, Telegram is banned in some countries where WhatsApp has no issues with authorities, most suspiciously in Russia and Iran,"" noted Durov.

In an interview to the BBC last week, Facebook's Vice President of Global Affairs and Communications, Nick Clegg, said it wasn't WhatsApp's fault because end-to-end encryption is unhackable and blamed Apple's operating system for Bezos' episode.

""It sounds like something on the... you know, what they call the operate, operated on the phone itself. It can't have been anything, when the message was sent, in transit, because that's end-to-end encrypted on WhatsApp,"" Clegg had told the show host.

According to a report from FTI Consulting, a firm that has investigated Bezos' phone, after that the video file was received, Bezos' phone started sending unusually large amounts of outbound data, including his intimate messages with his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez.

According to Clegg, ""something"" must have affected the phone's operating system.

""Consequently, the issue was not iOS-specific, but WhatsApp specific,"" replied Durov.

""Telegram rolled out end-to-end encryption for mass communication years before WhatsApp followed suit, and we've been mindful not only of the strengths, but also the limitations of this technology. Other aspects of a messaging app can render end-to-end encryption useless. Below are three examples of what can go wrong,"" he added.

The fact that Apple was forced by the FBI to abandon encryption plans for iCloud is telling.

""That's one of the reasons why Telegram never relies on third-party cloud backups, and Secret Chats are never backed up anywhere,"" said the Telegram founder.

WhatsApp has 1.5 billion users globally while Telegram has 200-300 million users.

""Some could say that, as a founder of a rival app, I may be biased when criticizing WhatsApp. Of course I am. Of course I consider Telegram Secret Chats to be significantly more secure than any competing means of communication – why else would I be developing and using Telegram?""",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/whatsapp-dangerous--bezos-must-use-my-app--telegram-founder-2020-01-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/whatsapp-dangerous--bezos-must-use-my-app--telegram-founder.html

Put into bat, India were struggling at 88-6 at one stage before Pandey's lonesome rescue act took them to a respectable total. KL Rahul contributed 39 runs off 26 balls, inclusive of three sixes and two fours.

This was after New Zealand won a fourth consecutive toss and opted to field. Kane Williamson didn't take part in the match owing to a shoulder niggle. Tim Southee is the stand-in skipper with the Black Caps making two changes.

India also made three changes with Rohit Sharma, Mohammed Shami and Ravindra Jadeja rested. Sanju Samson, Washington Sundar and Navdeep Saini came into the playing eleven respectively.

Samson (8) opened the innings with Rahul, but lasted only five balls before holing out. Virat Kohli (11) too was out cheaply, the ball looping up to extra cover and out caught off Hamish Bennett (2-41).

Ish Sodhi then got into the act and ran through India's batting order. First to go was Shreyas Iyer (1) and then Shivam Dube (12) was caught at mid-wicket.

India seemed intent on destroying this experimentation opportunity, while New Zealand fielded well and caught everything that came their way. The alarm bells came on when Rahul was caught off Sodhi at midwicket in the ninth over.

Sodhi finished with 3-26 while Santner dismissed Sundar for nought as the New Zealand spinners rounded up a good outing with 4-54 in eight overs.

Pandey came to India's rescue thereafter as he marshalled the innings along with Shardul Thakur (20 off 15 balls) and Navdeep Saini (11 not out).

He put on 43 runs with Thakur for the seventh wicket and then added another 22 with Saini. In doing so, Pandey brought up his half-century off 36 balls, inclusive of three fours, and helped put on a defendable score on the board.
