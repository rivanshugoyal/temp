0,17-1-20,Death of justice,"As the hanging of Nirbhaya’s rapists gets stalled, we must ask if we can get real about women’s safety or just float a bogey

All concerns and campaigns for women’s safety sound vacuous and patronising when the commitment to it, by virtue of honouring and implementing the law, falters. We lose faith in a system that is exploited routinely and remains imprisoned in a maze of technicalities to deny closure. Even if it is as gruesome and indelible a case as that of the rape of Nirbhaya, which has taken seven long years to be taken to its logical end and is still stopping short of answering to our national conscience. Worse, the system is oblivious and impervious to what this travesty means to women in general and to Nirbhaya’s family and friends in particular. Now, the hanging of the four rapists, convicted for one of the most heinous of crimes in India, has been stalled due to procedural drags, simply because all the convicts need to be given time to file mercy pleas and each of them would have to be heard following due processes. This should have been initiated earlier given the Supreme Court’s ruling and clarity on the death sentence in a case considered “rarest of rare.” So a case which ushered in special laws, a fast-track mechanism and well-intended course correction is now being denied the same privileges. Yes, due processes of law have been followed but the undue stress caused by delays in punishing the offenders is the reason that people talk about overriding the system with vigilantism. In the end, women lose confidence in society at large, whose mindset is set by precedents and examples, and predators are emboldened simply because they think they can get by. Considered a cut-and-dry case, the Nirbhaya verdict should not have been long in coming but it took four-and-a-half years for the trial court, the High Court and the Supreme Court to pass their judgments, with the lawyers of the convicts using every trick in the book to delay the inevitable. As per the law, once the apex court handed out the death sentence on May 5, 2017, the four convicts should have filed a review petition within 30 days, but the men exploited a legal provision for condonation of the delay if the convict gives a convincing reason. Hence all four filed their review petitions at different times after long, deliberate delays, in their bid to thwart the justice system. Under prison rules, if death sentence has been handed out to more than one person in a case and if even one of them moves a mercy plea, the execution of the others, too, has to be postponed till the plea is decided. Hence, as one of the four convicts, Mukesh Kumar, has a mercy petition pending before the President, all cannot be hanged. What is appalling is that these oversights have been made by responsible arms of the administration, in this case the Delhi Government and prison authorities. The Delhi High Court, therefore, slammed the Delhi Government for sitting on the case for a year and not issuing a notice on the mercy plea to convicts. The court also castigated the Delhi prison authorities for not informing the convicts that they could move mercy pleas before the President. This is not the first time that the convicts have exploited loopholes to thwart justice. Right from false alibis, to buying time by getting pages and pages of trial court proceedings translated from English to Hindi, they have done it all.

No wonder then that in a country where the conviction rates for rapes are as low as 32.2 per cent, despite laws dealing with sexual assault being made stringent in the aftermath of the incident, crimes against women have been on the rise. They have spiralled from 329,243 cases in 2015 to 338,954 in 2016 and 359,849 in 2017. From 2013 onwards, over 30,000 women/girls have been raped. That there is no seriousness about building in deterrence is revealed by a dismal 11 per cent utilisation of the Nirbhaya Fund allocated to States/Union Territories for ensuring the safety and security of women/girls. Any reform — police, judicial, infrastructural — will have no meaning till we reform the attitude towards law enforcement, implement it instead of negating it. Of course, there is the monster of politicisation even in tragedy. The BJP promptly blamed the AAP Government for delaying notices to convicts considering the Supreme Court rejected the appeal against their death sentence in 2017. AAP claimed that while the Delhi Government’s recommendation was swift, the Centre had been in hibernation mode. While the point-scoring over who pushed Nirbhaya’s rights rages on, what both forget is that each had agency and powers to do what could have been done in days, not years. Both, as representatives of people, look emaciated by the criminals who help them keep their talk points rolling. After all, there is no political capital to be made out of Nirbhaya’s deathly silence.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/death-of-justice-2020-01-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/death-of-justice.html
1,17-1-20,Putin’s Russia,"The resignation of the Russian Cabinet has paved the way for his plans to stay on in power beyond 2024

Vladimir Putin has now become the longest serving Russian leader since Joseph Stalin. No matter what opinion one may have of the current Russian leader with regard to the way he has ridden roughshod over any and all opposition, prima facie he is a lot nicer than Stalin, a man revered by the Communists in India, who was also one of the greatest mass murderers in history. Unlike Stalin, Putin also has to worry about a small thing called a Constitution. But after a shock decision by the Russian Cabinet to resign on Wednesday, it is clear that Putin will remain in charge well beyond 2024 when his second eight-year stint as Russian President will come to a close. And to do so, he will need to reform the Constitution. It’s worth noting that his Cabinet resigned not in a manner of protest but to make his life easier. After all, his long-time aide, former President and newly-resigned Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, was not expected to do anything but that. How Putin will structure his continued reign remains to be seen. Will he become the head of the State Council or amend the Constitution to ensure he remains President indefinitely?

However, unlike Chinese President Xi Jinping, who, too, made a power grab and changed the rules in the People’s Republic of China, Putin’s task is far tougher. First, unlike China, Russia is at least a quasi-democracy. The past three years have seen constant protests against Putin as Western sanctions against Russia have begun to bite. His claims that he is hearing the clamour for reforms within the country and that is what is prompting these “reforms” is, therefore, debatable. But more Putin also means that he will remain a major figure on the global stage. His intervention in Syria and Iran are of grave concern to the US and other Western nations. At the same time, he has made it very clear that he wants to see a revival of Russia’s international power, wants it to be a nation with the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world and one that continues to develop new weapons technology. Russia punches well above its economic heft in the world. With Putin in charge, it possibly punches a weight category even higher. While many in Washington DC, London and other Western capitals would be glad to see the back of the man, these new reforms mean that he is not going away anytime soon unless the Russians want him to.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/putin---s-russia-2020-01-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/putin---s-russia.html
2,17-1-20,Budget a litmus test,"Sitharaman would be presenting her second Budget at a time when the middle class and the industry’s expectations from it would be high given the economic turmoil in the country

The economic turmoil that India is currently going through is unprecedented. The performance of Modi 2.0 has been below par on various fiscal indicators. Rising unemployment, industry-specific pangs, reduced demand, falling industrial output, higher inflation and lower-than-expected tax collections are a few areas of concern. As Finance Minister (FM) Nirmala Sitharaman gears up to present the Union Budget 2020 on February 1, it is expected that she would try her best to accelerate the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth which is estimated at five per cent for 2019-20, the lowest of the decade. Sitharaman would be presenting her second Union Budget at a time when the industry’s expectations from it would be somewhat high considering the slowdown in various sectors, though the Government took necessary steps last year to shore up the economy through stimulus packages, including the slashing of the corporate tax. However, the Government’s move to slash corporate tax has raised the hopes and expectations of the salaried class for a similar relief in income tax. While the middle class wants the Modi Government to provide income tax relief, the FM has very little fiscal room to dole out such largesse and this makes the Union Budget 2020 very interesting. The general expectations for the Union Budget 2020 are as follows.

Reduction in individual income tax rates: In the Interim Budget, presented in February 2019, income tax relief was provided that primarily benefitted individuals with an annual income below Rs 5 lakh. In another sop for the salaried class, the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, which was introduced in the Union Budget 2018, was raised by Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000 per year. But last year we had the economic slowdown brought on by the weakness in demand. Therefore, to create demand the Government may reduce income tax rates and may create some more sub-slabs in the current slabs. For example, the current tax rate is 20 per cent for a slab of Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh. This could be reduced to 10 per cent and a further new slab, say for example Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh, could be created with a 20 per cent tax rate.

Increase in deduction under Section 80C: At present, the deduction under Section 80C is available up to Rs 1,50,000 and eligible investments include life insurance policies, Public Provident Fund (PPF), National Savings Certificate (NSC), five-year notified tax-saving bank deposits, three-year Equity Linked Saving Schemes (ELSS) mutual funds, repayment of housing loan, tuition fee and many more. One can put the entire Rs 1,50,000 in one investment or in more than one instrument. Practically, the overall limit of Rs 1,50,000 does not offer any major benefit in real terms, as various investments are clubbed under one single provision. With an increase in the inflation rate, there is a need for an increase in the threshold limit of the Section 80C deduction, too. It is recommended that this deduction should be increased to a minimum of Rs 2 lakh or even Rs 2.5 lakh. Thus, if the threshold limit of Section 80C is increased by the FM in the Budget, this will not only boost investments, but also provide a majority of taxpayers the much-needed relief.

Infrastructure Bonds: The Government is tight on funds and needs money to finance the country’s infrastructure, so it may consider reintroduction of Infrastructure Bonds. These bonds were good for people who need a fixed income. This investment was over and above the investment limit under Section 80C. They offered a decent rate of interest and tax benefits. The maturity of these bonds is often between 10 to 15 years with an option to buy back after a lock-in of five years.

Debt-linked saving schemes: The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) had last year requested for introduction of debt-linked tax saving schemes or DLSS similar to Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS). The basic argument for introduction of DLSS is that many conservative people do not invest in ELSS to claim tax deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act because they are scared of putting money in stocks. The industry believes that these people would happily invest in a debt scheme like DLSS to save taxes under Section 80C. The mandatory lock-in period in these schemes can be five years like tax saving bank deposits.

Direct Tax Amnesty Scheme: The Government, which is hard-pressed for revenue, may come up with a Direct Tax Amnesty Scheme (DTAS) in this Budget. Last year they announced Sabka Vishwas (Legacy Dispute Resolution) Scheme, 2019 for Indirect Taxes through which the Government collected more than Rs 35,000 crore. Direct tax collection is facing a severe shortfall in the current fiscal year. After refunds, it saw a growth rate of 0.7 per cent till December 15, 2019 against the Budget target of 17.3 per cent. Advance tax collection after the third instalment stood at Rs 2.51 trillion, compared with Rs 2.47 trillion in the corresponding period last year, posing a 1.6 per cent growth.

DTAS may allow assessees to declare the additional income of the previous five-six years without penalty or prosecution. The proposal, being examined, will allow assessees to revise declared income with no fear of past cases being opened up, or prosecution. It will help improve compliance, besides raking in revenues for the Government. People who want to declare more income from the previous year do not do so because the moment they do, they are taken up for scrutiny, investigation and prosecution and penalties are imposed upon them. This scheme will also help in prevention of litigation. In August last year, the Government increased thresholds for tax litigation, below which the I-T Department was directed not to file appeals and withdraw cases that related to the ones under those. The limits were revised from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 50 lakh for appeals before the tribunal, from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore for appeals before High Courts and from Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore for appeals before the Supreme Court. A large number of pending appeals have been withdrawn/dismissed following the order.

Setting up of a Development Finance Institution: The Government may announce the setting up of a Development Finance Institution (DFI) in this Budget. This could be created to cater to core sector project financing. India is going through the rarest of rare economic conditions where economists — who often call for fiscal prudence over anything else during the Budget season — have become more realistic, conceding that there is a need to breach the fiscal deficit target. The DFI could be one of the triggers where the FM would take a decision, even breaching the fiscal deficit target. To improve sentiments and growth, India is in dire need of infrastructure spending. But for the Government, which is in the process of generating revenues through disinvestment of various PSUs including Air India, BPCL, CONCOR, the SCI and so on, any commitment to such projects would be considered to be an audacious act.

Infrastructure push: The Government may announce a massive push for all forms of physical connectivity through the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, industrial corridors, dedicated freight corridors, Jal Marg Vikas and UDAN schemes. Major commitment for ambitious projects like Bharatmala and Sagarmala is also expected. The Bharatmala project would help develop national road corridors and highways, while Sagarmala would enhance port connectivity, modernisation and port-linked industrialisation.

Micro irrigation funds: In 2017, then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced a dedicated Micro Irrigation Fund with NABARD under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana. The objective of the fund was to achieve the goal of “per drop more crop.” A whopping Rs 5,000 crore was sanctioned for this in 2018. Considering climate change, which has led to drought in some areas and floods in others, a new corpus would be allocated to this scheme in the forthcoming Budget.

This year’s Union Budget comes with more expectations than ever because of socio-economic conditions. For the first time the FM has the leeway to breach fiscal deficits and come up with real reforms, both for taxation and the economy, but the challenge is whether the Government is ready for such action.

3,17-1-20,A crippled campaign,"Accessible India intended to take measures to secure the right to an accessible environment for people with disabilities. But it failed

The enactment of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 has ensured the domestic transition of the social model adopted under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities adopted in 2006 and ratified by the Government in 2007. The principles stated to be implemented for empowerment of persons with disabilities (PWD) are respect for inherent dignity, individual autonomy, including the freedom to make one’s own choices and independence of persons. The Act lays stress on non-discrimination, full and effective participation and inclusion in society, respect for difference and acceptance of disabilities as part of human diversity and humanity, equality of opportunity, accessibility, equality between men and women, respect for the evolving capacities of children with disabilities and respect for the right of children with disabilities to preserve their identities. The principle reflects a paradigm shift in thinking about disability from a social welfare concern to a human rights issue. However, the rights-based vision of the Act has not been translated into reality as yet. This is because of the lack of the Government’s efforts to ensure that measures are taken for which it has been made responsible under the Act. Accessible India has been one of the most visible campaigns of the Narendra Modi Government which intends to take measures securing the right to an accessible environment for PWDs in the country. Launched before the enactment of the 2016 Act, it seeks to ensure a Built Environment Accessibility, Transportation System Accessibility and Information and Communication Eco-System Accessibility in India, the three of its basic components. It is a matter of great misfortune that India’s biggest campaign has failed miserably in its effort. The failure can be basically attributed to the ingenuity shown in its vision, as ambiguous and over-ambitious targets were made without any measure of accountability. The campaign thus serves more in rhetoric than in action.

Ambiguous and over-ambitious targets: The campaign under Built Environment Accessibility targetted 50 most important buildings in Tier-1 cities and 25 most important Government buildings in Tier-2 cities, to be made fully accessible within a period of six months by July 2016. The revised guidelines have extended the deadline to March 2020. The numbers and time period were too ambitious for the reach of the Department of Persons with Disability. The deadlines were missed and extended consecutively and targets under it are yet not achieved even as three years have passed since the campaign was launched. Moreover, there was no study done on the number of Government websites or the quantum of public documents, which makes it impossible to assess the Government on the targets it envisaged as they were mostly made in percentage terms i.e. to make 50 per cent of all Government websites and public documents accessible by March 2018 . Such ambiguous targets make it easier to extend the deadline as it becomes impossible to measure the true progress of the work done.

Lack of accountability framework: The department has only released partial information in terms of the total number of buildings and websites that were made accessible but greater details about these buildings have not been provided. This information is not only necessary for awareness but also necessary for accountability purposes. No verification study has been conducted or is currently under process by technically qualified Government or non-government agencies to assess the progress made in built environment or Information and communications technology in terms of accessibility. With respect to public buildings under the State Government, the department issues utilisation funds under the campaign. Data can be easily found on the huge amount of funds disbursed under the scheme. However, no accountability is ensued on the State Government as no post-verification study is done to check the proper use of funds. No training or workshop has been conducted to train engineers in the task of retrofitting. Untrained professionals are unable to understand the reports provided to them post accessibility audits.

Social audit: The campaign did include a component of “social audit” to ensure implementation in the form of a website, a mobile-based application where one could report inaccessible buildings and action could be taken on it. However, the objective completely failed because of sluggish implementation of this measure as both the website and the application have been unmanned and thereby lying defunct since 2016.

The failure of the campaign to properly formulate its target and include accountability in its practice has reduced it to a utopian status without any real ground-level impact. This failure is for the lack of technical experts on the subject of accessibility involved in the formulation process. There is a sincere need for the Department for Persons with Disability to diverge from this erring process and hire a permanent officer trained in universal design and accessibility so that proper measures can be taken to address the issues of PWDs.

4,17-1-20,The joys and perils of the gig economy,"The nature and quality of jobs generated for women in the freelance workforce need to be examined so that appropriate policy suggestions can be put forward for policymakers to make informed decisions

The participation of women in the workforce in India is one of the lowest in the world at around 21 per cent compared to the global average of 48 per cent. And it has been declining steadily over the last two decades mostly on account of the agricultural sector. Some of the key reasons for low work participation of women in the country are a disproportionate burden of care-giving and domestic duties, rising income of households, absence of suitable jobs, patriarchal social norms and poor working conditions. In fact, women’s participation in care-giving and domestic duties in the country is highest among all the nations across the world.

The labour force participation rate (LFPR) of women declined more in rural areas, while it was almost stable or marginally up in urban areas in the last few years. Over the years, the rural and urban gap in the LFPR of women narrowed and then converged in 2018. Agriculture distress, low payment in unorganised sector jobs and rising participation of women in higher education are leading to increasing migration to urban areas in pursuit of better jobs and opportunities. These trends could have significant implications in the Indian context as women in urban areas are increasingly participating in new-age jobs, particularly those that are technology-based such as flexible work on information technology and other digital platforms called the gig economy.

This is helping women maintain a work-life balance and accommodate disproportionate care activities by reducing reliance on physical space and presence and giving them the option to choose their own working hours and tasks.

This phenomenon has been brought about by technological innovation. The ownership and access to computers, tablets with internet and smartphones — some of the prerequisites for active participation of people in the gig economy — has increased manifold in India in recent years. This has encouraged more women to participate in the gig economy, particularly from urban and peri-urban areas.

According to the Employment Outlook Report, by staffing platform TeamLease, women gig workers accounted for about 68,000 jobs in the country in 2019 and the gig economy is expected to generate more jobs in the future. It is estimated that it will comprise half of the urban workforce by 2025 and as much as 80 per cent by 2030.

The increasing participation of women in the gig economy will not only empower them financially but also steer the economic growth of the country. As reported by the McKinsey Global Institute, if India increased the workforce participation rate of women by ten percentage points by 2025, its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) could rise by as much as 16 per cent as compared to the business-as-usual scenario. A recent report on the Future of Work Anywhere-Gig Worker by Noble House revealed that men and women have almost a 50:50 participation in the gig economy against the traditional workforce where the ratio is about 70:30.

About 86 per cent of women gig workers in India believe that this kind of arrangement gives them an opportunity to earn equal to their male counterparts. The 2019 Employment Outlook Report reflected that the new-age internet companies were seeing more women in frontline roles. It is easy to see why, given the lower attrition rates, better ratings for delivery women and improved productivity at warehouses. This has led to greater demand for women at delivery hubs and fulfilment centres.

Another study done by BetterPlace (2019) reveals that the number of women entering the gig economy is rising. Online companies such as Amazon and Flipkart that have begun to hire women in delivery roles have also seen better acceptability by customers. Besides, food-delivery apps such as Swiggy and Zomato have also employed several thousand women employees in cities like Kochi, Jaipur, Pune and other Tier 2 cities.

However, the much-debated issue in the gig economy is the growing concern regarding availability of decent work and violation of fundamental rights of workers. Under the gig economy, the demand for workers and supply of opportunities are matched online or via mobile applications. Though the gig economy provides good job opportunities and allows for flexible working schedules for women, it can also pave the way for severe commoditisation of work that forces people to choose transient work in the absence of better options. They are also vulnerable to attacks and exploitation.

Flexible work and the possibility of combining paid and unpaid work could provide opportunities to women involved in care-giving activities but could also lead to the deterioration of their working conditions and increase in working hours, given the requirement of constant availability to both duties of care-giving and paid work.

While more women are joining the gig economy, they are paid less than men for the same jobs. As much as 60 per cent of the jobs are in food technology, 30 per cent in e-commerce and courier services and 10 per cent in hyper-local delivery. Another study done by BetterPlace (2019) reveals that challenges remain when hiring them for frontline roles, especially with regard to their safety.

The Fairwork Project Initiative shows that app-based service companies such as Ola, Uber, Uber Eats and Zomato have some of the worst working conditions among Indian start-ups. These companies were ranked on five principles of fairness and score only two-four out of 10. The only positive is that they paid at least a local minimum wage including employment costs incurred by the workers. It is also argued that the new work culture within the gig economy is not activity regulated and women face the possibility of being disadvantaged all over again.

The nature and quality of jobs generated for women under the gig economy need to be examined so that appropriate policy suggestions can be put forward for policymakers to make informed decisions. It would further provide an improved understanding of the realities of flexible work arrangements in both crowd work (digital marketing, online tuitions, content writers, translators, graphic designers, freelance recruiters, software development, accounting, data analytics, legal work, medical transcription, health workers and social work) and on-demand service work (such as personal transport services offered by Uber, Ola, food delivery services provided by Zomato, Swiggy and e-commerce services of Amazon, Naukri.com that require a direct interface between workers and those requesting for gig services) to fill the critical knowledge gap.

5,17-1-20,The land of tech,"

Make no mistake, the future of car technology will be driven by the United States. Tesla has made sure of that

Many years ago, when I used to write extensively on mobile phones, I used to interact a lot with some European phone-makers, particularly the market leader from Finland. They used to pooh-pooh American mobile device makers. After all, European phones were more tech-savvy, loaded with million features and what not. Then, almost exactly 13 years ago, Steve Jobs got on stage and introduced the iPhone which changed everything as we know today. But I remember that in my previous organisation, I interviewed the chief executive of that Finnish phone-maker. And while this was before the iPhone came onto the market. After it was showcased, he quite clearly expected it to fail. After all, what did an American company know about making phones? Now, hindsight is always 20:20 that the chief executive was right that the devices that his company made were miles ahead of the first iPhone, technologically. But the iPhone had a completely intuitive touch interface, which became the game-changer and Americans loved it. It is only when you visit the United States, and in my case this yet another visit, that you realise how much larger the American market is. Its sheer size is massive. European phone-makers might have pooh-poohed Apple, but Apple broke the American market and iPhones started appearing on screens. It became the must-have device.

I am bringing this up because during my last trip to the US, I experienced the Tesla Model 3. And despite all the stories I had read about the production difficulties that Tesla is having and the Twitter tirades of “wannabe” Bond villain and Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, it is only when you experience the Model 3, you realise that some European carmakers have a serious problem. I did not take a car from Tesla, instead I drove and was driven around in my brother-in-law’s Model 3 in and around the Seattle Metropolitan Area in the Northwestern US. The excitement that he showed with his car made it obvious that he was a brand evangelist. But after driving around for a while, not just someone like me, who is plugged into the automotive industry, but anybody would understand why the Tesla Model 3 is such a game-changer.

The vehicle is the electric carmaker’s “cheap” car, priced at around $50,000-60,000 (Rs 36 lakh to Rs 45 lakh) on the road. It is a lot more affordable than the Model X Sports Utility Vehicle and the Model S large sedan, both of which cost upwards of $100,000 (Rs 75 lakh), and competes against cars like the BMW 3-series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Audi A4 in terms of size, functionality and price. And when you get into a Tesla for the first time, you realise how basic it is inside. This is nowhere near the luxury and the button-heavy nature of the current BMW 3-series. There are a couple of rotary dials on the steering wheel, power window switches and painfully small buttons to open the door and that is it. Oh yeah, there is a giant touchscreen as well, and the most intuitive voice-activated controls on any car. Sure, other cars have touchscreens as well but Tesla’s system is the smoothest and best system I have ever used, and for this I have to praise their software and user experience engineers. The user interface actually feels proper and the voice activation works. Believe me, try and use voice activation on some newly launched cars in India and you will get where I am coming from.

I drove (a bit) but the traffic in the United States is so well-behaved that I let the car drive. Tesla’s “Autopilot” genuinely has to be experienced to be believed. I have used automated lane-tracking and radar-assisted cruise control systems on BMWs, Mercedes-Benz, Audis and Volvos in Europe and the Middle-east. Nothing comes close to Tesla’s camera controlled system, which actually “sees” cars in and around you using an array of cameras mounted all over the car including the B-pillar between the front and rear doors. No other commercially available car has a system where the car decides to change to the fastest lane. And acceleration was stunning, even in the single-motor model I drove (there is a sour-wheel drive dual-motor model as well).

Yes, range is an issue. Even on the long-range version that I experienced, both, not just with my brother-in-law but also other friends in Seattle. The stated 300 miles (approximately 500 kilometers) of range is a more “real” 180 miles (300 kilometers) on a single charge, much like the electric cars available in India today that claim around 300 kilometers of range but have a more realistic 200 kilometers. But users understand that if you use features such as the autopilot, you drain the battery sooner. However, in the tech-corridor of the United States between San Francisco and Seattle, where Tesla sales have skyrocketed in the past few months (these two cities are the largest markets for Tesla) there are lots of public chargers and superchargers. The latter allow you to charge the car to 75-80 per cent in about 15-20 minutes. All the while, you can be watching your favourite show on Netflix. Sure, you can’t do a cross-country drive on a Tesla just yet but across the world most cars are used for daily commuting. And one will rarely use more than 50 percent of the battery in a single day.

I left Seattle mighty impressed with the Model 3, it might be too much for India and if import duties are not rationalised, it might never come to India, but it shows what the future of vehicles will be. The future will be driven by software and simplicity. While it might be too soon to determine whether battery-electric or hydrogen powered fuel-cells will drive the cars of the future in India, the future is already here in the United States. And more than the Model 3, I also left Seattle with a whole new impression of Elon Musk, he should stay off Twitter possibly, but as a visionary, I don’t think anyone else comes close.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-land-of-tech-2020-01-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/the-land-of-tech.html

7,17-1-20,A new air quality agenda,"An efficient traffic signal management can not only help maintain the flow of traffic but also drastically reduce air pollution levels and save fuel

Air pollution in our country, particularly in some of the urban centres, has become a major public health issue. Depending on the region and climatic conditions, there are several contributory factors that add to the pollution levels but vehicular emissions in metropolitan cities have emerged as a major source. According to official estimates, the number of vehicles in the national capital surged to over 1.20 crore, including over 80 lakh two-wheelers. The number of vehicles per thousand population, too, increased considerably — from 317 in 2006 to over 550 in 2016 — leading to visible congestion on the roads.

That vehicular emissions contain carcinogenic material needs no emphasis. But what has now come to light is that the inhalation of toxic airborne particles emitted by diesel and petrol vehicles can weaken bones and speed up the ageing process. This finding, based on a fairly large sample size taken from the vicinity of Hyderabad, quantifies on the basis of X-Rays and other studies and determines the extent of osteoporosis ie, the weakening of bones, in all age groups.

Besides, the World Health Organisation (WHO), too, concluded that each year, thousands of children succumb to acute infections in their lower respiratory system caused by polluted air. Health hazards from air pollution due to vehicular emissions are, thus, manifold. Traffic police personnel and professional drivers, who face maximum air and noise pollution exposure on the roads, have to bear the brunt of this situation.

Last autumn saw Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) shooting beyond 1000, making it one of the most polluted cities in the world. Stubble burning by farmers in some of the States adjoining Delhi, combined with vehicular emissions, were major contributors to the deteriorating quality of air. In the following months, the situation somewhat improved but with people becoming used to witnessing “hazardous” levels of air pollution, even the current “severe” category appears to be taken in stride without much hue and cry.

With the capital witnessing hazardous air quality, schemes like Odd-Even were introduced to limit the number of four-wheelers on the roads. This scheme did show a dip in pollution levels, howsoever small it might have been. Despite it being known that emissions from two-wheelers, which include benzene, are far more hazardous, the Odd-Even scheme could not be made applicable for some reason or the other. As a result, a more significant dent in pollution levels could not be achieved. After April 1, when the Bharat-VI norms come into play, the level of auto emissions is bound to show a downward trend.

But the geometry of roads in Delhi has mostly evolved as a result of unplanned organic growth and the lack of norms surrounding urban planning. This has resulted in a very large number of intersections where vehicles have to necessarily give way and accommodate other traffic streams. This has led to a situation where the number of signalised intersections is quite high and drivers have to stop their vehicles every now and then. Waiting time at a traffic signal depends on the timing of the microprocessor, which should ideally be determined after a careful study of traffic load and pattern on a particular arm of the road on an hourly basis. However, this is always not the case.

As vehicles have to often wait at signalised intersections in an idle running mode, they emit very large amounts of pollutants. It is well-known that an idle engine is far more polluting than when a vehicle is in motion. Similarly, slower moving vehicles on the streets, largely two-wheelers, are more polluting than those at a higher speed.

The accumulated traffic at intersections awaiting a green signal is a major source of pollution. This can be handled through appropriate signal management. It is known that traffic signals contribute towards orderly and well regulated movement of traffic, besides increasing the traffic handling capacity of the intersection. Under favourable conditions, they can be coordinated to provide for continuous or near continuous movement of traffic at a given speed. Such coordinated signals lead to reduced fuel consumption and bring down emissions by minimising stops and consequent delays. They can bring down the journey time, too.

In this context, it can be observed that in Delhi there are quite a large number of busy intersections where the pattern of signals has undergone a change over the last few years. The flow pattern at these intersections allows the traffic to move forward only from one carriageway, while all others are static. Such road-by-road clearances not only enhance the waiting time at intersections but also lead to more emissions as at any given time, a large number of vehicles have to wait for their turn to make the move. The delay in journey time is built in and is currently being experienced by all road users.

On the other hand, the flow pattern, which enables a straight-straight movement and which is simultaneously followed by right-right, can definitely reduce the waiting period at intersections and may even reduce the journey time. It can also impact air pollution in a positive manner. Most Delhiites would recall that such a system was indeed being followed until a few years ago.

It has also been observed that on account of a perception-reaction time loss, some time at the beginning of each green period remains underutilised, leading to building up of congestion over a period of time. The use of reverse timers at all points can help overcome this and ensure maximum flow of traffic with complete utilisation of the green phase. This would mean a reduction in journey time as well as air pollution levels.

Given the severity of the air pollution problem in Delhi, measures that can lead to a reduction in the levels of pollution must be attempted at. An appropriate scheme to manage traffic signals can make a significant contribution not only to the flow of traffic but also bring down the levels of pollution.

His statement came after Union Minister Prakash Javadekar on Thursday blamed AAP Government's ""negligence"" for the ""delay"" in the hanging of Nirbhaya gang rape case convicts, saying it took more than two and a half years for the Arvind Kejriwal dispensation to give notice to convicts after Supreme Court rejected their appeal against the death sentence in 2017.

Terming the statement of Javadekar shocking, Sisodia said the matter is very sensitive and the Minister should avoid making cheap allegation on this issue. ""The BJP has no issue to raise in the election so it is making such statement to mislead people. This is a clear attempt to instigate people,"" he said,"" adding that If you cannot handle it, give us Delhi Police for just two days, we will hang the convicts of Nirbhaya case.

""I was shocked to see that a Cabinet Minister is lying to the country. It is very sensitive matter and whole the country including the parents of Nirbhaya was waiting for the decision in this case. Delhi Government is in favour of execution of the convicts as soon as possible,"" he added.

Earlier, refuting the claim of Javadekar, senior AAP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said it is an ""insensitive and uninformative lie"" as the law and order is completely under the Centre. ""Whatever delay is taking place, the BJP is responsible and that is why instead of misleading people, the Union Minister should apologise for ignoring such a sensitive matter,"" he said.

The AAP government told the Delhi High Court on Wednesday that Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Vinay Sharma (26), Akshay Kumar Singh (31) and Pawan Gupta (25) — the four convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case — will not be hanged on January 22 as scheduled because one of them has moved a mercy plea and according to the prison rules, they cannot be executed till they exhaust all of their remedies under the law.

The four rapists were to be hanged on January 22 at 7 am in Tihar jail. A Delhi court had issued their death warrants on January 7.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aap-delaying-convicts----hanging--alleges-bjp.html

Three persons including the nephew of a former BJD Corporator were arrested and forwarded to the SDJM court. But they managed to get bail.

The BJP claimed that the attackers got bail a couple of hours after their arrest since they are supporters of the ruling party.

“I strongly condemn the incident. The attack took place in the presence of police personnel. How could the attackers secure bail despite murderous attack,” BJP leader Lekhasri Samantasinghar questioned. She also came down heavily on Bhubaneswar (Central) MLA Ananta Narayan Jena for visiting the victim’s house at late night.

“MLA Ananta Narayan Jena visited Singh’s family at around 1.30 am. Is this the hour to visit anybody’s house? The MLA terrorized the family and put pressure on them to leave Bhubaneswar,” she alleged.

Earlier in the day, the BJP leaders had visited the victim’s family here.

“Where is law? People from outside States have no right to reside here? A Sikh youth has been assaulted in Odisha. Will Odisha youth meet the same fate in Punjab? It is highly condemnable,” Congress leader Suresh Routray said.

Notably, local MLA Ananta Narayan Jena and police officer Anup Kanungo along with two other persons had visited Singh’s family very late in the night and again on Thursday morning.

BJD Rajya Sabha member Sasmit Patra said, “Opposition BJP should not politicise the issue. Action has been initiated against the wrongdoers and erring policeman,”.

The Ministry has further asked NHAI to ensure that the least possible number of the declared FASTag lane of fee plaza be converted into the hybrid lanes temporarily and further that at least 75 per cent lanes of these 65 fee plaza remain declared and operational as ‘FASTag lane of Fee Plaza’ in order to incentivize the vehicles carrying FASTag.

The Ministry has emphasised that this temporary measure is to be adopted for 30 days only for such 65 fee plazas to facilitate smooth flow of traffic so that no inconvenience is caused to the citizens.

The NHAI shall take necessary measures within this time to ensure smooth flow of traffic through the fee plazas and ensure declaring “FASTag lane of Fee Plaza” for all the lanes within this period.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/fastag-rules-relaxed-for-mangula-toll-plaza.html

Patnaik first visited the Jagannath Temple for a darshan of the deities. He then conveyed New Year wishes to people of the State.

Among the upcoming projects, Shree Setu, when completed, would provide a direct access-controlled entry to the Jagannath Ballav Pilgrim Centre (JBPC) from NH-316, thereby reducing traffic congestion.

The Jagannath Ballav Pilgrim Centre would be a six-storied building with a multi-level parking space for 1,000 cars, a commercial complex, a meditation space, a multi-modal hub and public utilities.

49,17-1-20,Steps to be taken to bring Bjiu’s Dakota to State,"The State Government has decided to initiate steps to bring the abandoned Dakota aircraft, which was once flown by late Chief Minister Biju Patnaik.

In this regard, a letter would be written to the Union Civil Aviation Ministry to hand over the aircraft to the State. Thereafter, steps would be taken to bring the plane following an expenditure estimate, informed Transport Special Secretary Manoj Mishra here on Thursday.

The proposal to bring the iconic aircraft to the State received an in-principle approval at an internal meeting chaired by Chief Secretary Asit Tripathy with the Bhubaneswar Airport authorities and stakeholders at the Lok Seva Bhawan.

A further decision would be taken to park the aircraft at a suitable location after it reaches Bhubaneswar, Mishra said.

“It was a pre-meeting to discuss ahead of a high-level meeting scheduled between the Odisha Government and the CEOs of airlines at the Hotel Mayfair on January 22 in Bhubaneswar. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik had requested the Civil Aviation Ministry for a meeting at Bhubaneswar to discuss various issues. Ahead of the meeting, an internal meeting was held to know the updates about development of airports in Bhubaneswar, Jharsuguda, Jeypore and Rourkela. We also discussed the existing and proposed air connectivity” Mishra said.

The State Government would place its demand at the January 22meeting for new air connectivity, he informed.

Notably, earlier, the State Government was planning to bring the Dakota, which is now stationed at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport in Kolkata since 1947, to Odisha and park it in front of the Anand Bhavan, the ancestral house of Biju Patnaik at Tulsipur in Cuttack, for public view.

Biju Patnaik, who was known for his daredevilry act as a pilot, had formed the Kalinga Airline in 1947. The airline had 15 Dakotas parked at its headquarters in Kolkata. The aircrafts were chiefly used by the Army for transport of jawans deployed in Kashmir. The Kalinga Airline’s DC-3s were also used to drop supplies in the north-eastern area of the country and providing services to Army personnel in this region.

Patnaik came to limelight after he rescued former Indonesian Vice-President Muhammad Hatta and Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir from their enemies on July 22, 1947. He was credited with making the landing at Srinagar on Oct 27 in the year.

Later, the Indonesia Government acknowledged Patnaik’s contribution by honouring him with that country’s ‘Bhumi Putra’ title for his chivalry.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/steps-to-be-taken-to-bring-bjiu---s-dakota-to-state.html
50,17-1-20,Cong offers 30 paise cashback on saving 1litre water if voted to power,"The Delhi Congress on Thursday said that it will give '30 paise cashback' for each litre of water saved by Delhi residents and 20,000 litres of water a month free after coming to power in the February 8 Assembly elections.

Delhi Congress president Subhash Chopra said that those households who save water from the present 20,000-litre free water per family will be benefitted from this scheme.

Chopra said that the cash-back scheme will be introduced as part of the Congress' ""Paani Bachao-Dilli Bachao"" campaign. He said that the Kejriwal Government introduced free water as a vote bank politics. ""The Congress will keep the free water scheme but it will also keep in mind the likelihood of a future 'water war' and that was the main reason for the party taking a decision to reward those who save water,"" he said.

""Almost 70 per cent ground water has depleted in Delhi in past six years. He said that the Supreme Court had warned the Delhi Jal Board in 2018, saying that if the water situation remains precarious in Delhi, then there was the possibility of a ""water war"" in future,"" he said.

Chopra also alleged that the water mafia was active with the connivance of the Kejriwal Government and was misusing the free water scheme. ""There is a steep rise of 40 per cent in the rates of water tankers. The tanker mafia was selling drinking water many times more than the DJB rates with the tacit support of the Kejriwal Government,"" he alleged.

The DJB has no data regarding how much water is being used by each consumer, he said, adding that if the Congress scheme is implemented, a family could save up to 5,000 litres of water for which they will get cash back of Rs 1,500.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-offers-30-paise-cashback-on-saving-1litre-water-if-voted-to-power.html

Of the 22 districts in Haryana, the State Excise and Taxation department has received the highest number of 122 resolutions from Bhiwani district, as per a list shared by Chautala on Twitter.

Chautala, who holds the Excise and Taxation portfolio, on Wednesday tweeted, ""704 gram panchayats (gram sabhas) passed resolution in Haryana for closure of vends in their villages.""

55,17-1-20,Govt made all efforts to fulfil promises: Guv,"Virtually coming to the rescue of the Congress-led Punjab Government facing the allegations of not fulfilling its pre-poll promises, Punjab Governor VP Singh Badnore on said that the State Government has made every possible effort to fulfill its commitments, despite constraint of resources and an “empty treasury” inherited by it.

“The government has completed almost three years since it assumed office in March 2017. During this period, it has made every possible effort to fulfill its commitments, despite constraint of resources and an empty treasury inherited by it,” said Badnore while addressing the Vidhan Sabha on the first day of the two-day special Assembly session.

The statement comes at a time when the opposition parties — including the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), and the Bharatiya Janta Party — have all along been attacking the Congress Government for its failure to fulfill all promises it made with the people in run up to 2017 elections, including complete loan waiver, eliminating drugs, mobile phones to youngsters, bringing down power tariff, unemployment allowance to unemployed youth, enhancing old age pensions and Shagun amount, among others.

During the Governor’s about 30-minute address, the opposition MLAs — from SAD-BJP combine and the AAP — staged separate walkouts alleging that Congress Government had not fulfilled its promises.

The session has been specially convened to ratify the 126th Constitutional amendment to extend reservation for those belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for another 10 years.

Reflecting the State Government's initiatives, Badnore said that it has re-established the rule of law, revived Punjab's economy and industry, maintained peace and amity at all costs, and made strenuous efforts to protect territorial and water rights of the State.

The Punjab Government also “retained, restored and protected the rights of women, Dalits and other minorities and weaker sections of the State, provided for the measures to raise farmers' income and create more jobs in the State and provided debt relief to the farmers”, he said.

He added that the Punjab Government has waived crop loans of Rs 4,736 crore of 5.83 lakh small and marginal farmers, who were indebted to various cooperative and commercial banks under the state’s Farmers Debt Waiver scheme.

“It will continue in its next phase to achieve the targeted coverage,” he said adding, “Further, it (state government) is also working on a scheme of debt waiver for landless farm labourers who have taken loans from primary agricultural service societies.”

At the same time, he congratulated the Government for successfully organizing a series of events to mark the 550th birth anniversary of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev saying that a historic landmark was achieved with the opening of the Kartarpur Corridor.

On the law and order, Badnore said that there has been a “perceptible decrease in crime” with the neutralization of 12 ‘A-category’ gangsters and arrest of 1931 members of different criminal gangs operating in the state. Besides these, the Punjab Police has busted 31 terrorist modules and arrested 151 terrorists, he added.

Badnore said that the Government is fully alert to ensure right-based action to contain drug abuse in the State and added that the Special Task Force (STF) set up in 2017 has proved to be very effective in comprehensively tackling the drug menace.

Touching upon the industry, he said that the Government has received investment proposals of Rs 57,735 crore on ground with potential to create 1.89 lakh jobs in the State.

The Government proposes to introduce a new legislation 'Right to Business Act' to enhance ease of doing business for MSMEs in the state, he said.

With Punjab predominantly being an agricultural economy, the Governor said that the Government has been giving greater thrust on measures that help increase farmers' income.

“Despite many challenges arising because of poor evacuation of food stocks from the State by the FCI, the Government has ensured hassle free procurement of food grains for the last six crop seasons consecutively.

The farmers have received an additional remuneration of Rs 44,000 crore during the last six crops procured by the Government,” he said.

“Saving water and crop diversification remains a priority of the Government and it has also requested the Centre to initiate and approve a national project to canalize state's three rivers Ravi, Beas and Sutlej,” he added.

Touching upon the steps being taken by State Government on stubble burning issue, he said that the Government is constantly looking at using more and more paddy stubble for economic use to tackle the problem.

“Presently, 10 biomass power projects of 73.50 MWs are in operation and two paddy straw based biomass power projects of 36 MW have recently been commissioned to utilize the paddy stubble. These plants are utilizing approximately 1.10 million tons of paddy straw per annum,” he said.

Adding, he said that private investment is being facilitated for setting up Bio-CNG/ Bio-ethanol projects based on paddy stubble, besides submitting a proposal to the Union Ministry of New and Renewable Energy for grant of viability gap funding for paddy-straw based Biomass power projects at the rate of Rs five crore per MW for 300 MW capacity projects.

He added that the Government also intends to provide 14,953 free EWS houses to homeless SC/BC families under the Punjab Shehri Awas Yojna and the PM Awas Yojana for which deputy commissioners have identified over 6,000 acres of land.

Saying that the “august house” is a true reflection on our secular democratic polity, the Governor appreciated the MLAs for always upholding these values as enshrined in our Constitution and never shirking in fulfilling their constitutional duties and obligations despite different political affiliations.

Concluding his speech, he said: “I am sure the deliberations in this House will further strengthen the government's resolve to take Punjab to new heights of growth and prosperity; demolishing the forces, if any who believe in divisive politics through radical thoughts and processes.”

WALKOUT’S EXTREMELY UNFORTUNATE: CAPT

Terming the Opposition walkout during the Governor’s Address as extremely unfortunate, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday lamented that such behaviour in the House had become a way of life.

“The walkout is expected,” he said while taking on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and SAD over their decision to disturb and interrupt the Governor’s address when he was speaking on the vital religious subject of the 550th prakash purb celebrations of

Guru Nanak Dev.

The walkout by the Opposition took place while the Governor was talking about the fact that Punjab was fortunate to have celebrated this historic occasion, along with the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, he pointed.

GOVERNOR'S SPEECH A BUNDLE OF LIES: AAP

AAP MLA and the Leader of Opposition in Assembly Harpal Singh Cheema termed the Governor's speech as a bundle of lies saying that the Captain Government had put words in the his (Governor’s) mouth.

“During its three-year tenure, the Captain Government has failed to fulfill even a single promise listed in the party manifesto,” he said.

While AAP MLAs, sans three rebels, chose to boycott the Governor’s address on the issue of power purchase agreements (PPAs) with private thermal plants resulting in costly power in the State, the SAD-BJP members staged a walkout after protesting in the House holding rattles and placards in their hand highlighting government’s failure to fulfill its pre-poll promises.

Soon as the Governor started his address, the SAD-BJP MLAs started raising slogans, waiving placards, and playing rattles, on the non-fulfillment of the promises made ahead 2017 elections by the Congress party.

Akali MLAs were heard asking the Governor what good his past addresses had done for the people of Punjab.

They said that the rattles symbolized the false promises made by the Congress Government led by Capt Amarinder Singh for playing with the trust of the people of the State.

AAP MLAs, who were quietly listening to the Governor’s address, decided to walk out when Badnore started speaking about the Government’s achievements in the power sector.

Later, AAP MLA and the Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema said that they staged a walkout in protest against the denial of permission to move the private member bill in the Assembly, seeking termination of the power purchase agreement (PPAs), leading to jack up the electricity tariff in the state.

SAD legislature party leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon we (SAD-BJP MLAs) had made an attempt to expose the Congress Government by ringing rattles in the Vidhan Sabha to wake it from its slumber and force it to implement the promises made to the people.

Also condemning the “unholy collusion between the Baby Congress-AAP and the Asli Congress” for denying the people their due, Dhillon said that with Leader of Opposition Harpal Cheema only interested in saving his chair and four AAP legislators – Sukhpal Khaira, Master Baldev Singh, Nirmal Manshaiya and Amarjit Sandoa only interested in saving themselves from disqualification, the people’s voice for fulfillment of the promises made to them was going unheard.

“Even though this is the fourth Governor Address, none of the promises made to the people has been fulfilled by now.

Farm suicides are at an all time high in Punjab because the Government has failed to implement the complete farm loan waiver.

Similarly the government has reneged on all the promises made to the youth be it ‘ghar ghar naukari’, providing unemployment allowance of Rs 2,500 per month or mobile phones,” said Dhillon.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aap--sad-bjp-stage-walkout-during-governor-address.html

Chandumajra clarified that too much was being needlessly read behind the fact that he left the meeting of the SAD core committee midway. “I wish to unequivocally state that I left the core committee meeting in between due to urgent pressing engagements which could not be put off. I took the consent of the SAD president before leaving the meeting and am in agreement with all the decisions taken in the meeting including suspension of MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and Parminder Singh Dhindsa for indulging in anti-party activities,” he said.

Chandumajra said that the entire party was solidly behind the party President and was proud of his achievements.

“Sukhbir Badal has taken Punjab forward during his term as Deputy Chief Minister and is known as a development man. It is because of his sagacious leadership that Punjab became power surplus and that the State witnesses the coming of the Mohali International Airport besides creation of world class road network,” he added.

Notably, the leaders of anti-SAD faction, led by the former Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee’s (DSGMC) former president Manjit Singh GK had met Chandumajra at his residence to invite him for January 18 event, organized by the taksali leaders to raised the banner of revolt against the Badals.

Chandumajra later maintained that the leaders had come to invite him for the event, which he would not attend.

It has been leant that Chandumajra had also raised objections against the “use of words” in the statement issued in his name along with the party MP Balwinder Singh Bhunder against the party’s suspended Dhindsa father-son (Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and Parminder Singh Dhindsa).",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/i-stand-firmly-with-sad-president--chandumajra.html

“We will bring the white paper to expose the fraud committed by the Akalis with regard to the controversial power purchase agreements (PPAs) with the private players,” he said while talking with the media after the Governor VP Singh Badnore’s address to the Assembly on the first day of the two-day special session.

The Chief Minister said that the ‘white paper’ will reveal “all the documents signed by the previous SAD-BJP government in the State, as well as the power plants set up by them, which had caused undue burden on the state”.

“The Akalis are slippery characters,” said Capt Amarinder, adding that after messing with the state’s economy through various destructive measures, including the PPAs, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) was trying to use the issue against his government to promote their vested political interests.

The Chief Minister pointed out that the Congress Government had won the case on the issue in the lower court but the Supreme Court decisions went against them. “The State Government is fighting the case now in the Apex Court,” he added.

He himself had sat on the dharna against India Bulls plant when in Opposition, recalled Capt Amarinder.

“The then Akali Government had got the Gidderbaha NTPC power project cancelled to sign an MoU with India Bulls for setting up the plant, going against the prevailing practice of inviting global tenders for power projects and also forcibly evicting farmers from their land in Gobindpura for the controversial project,” he said.

The shopkeepers in the area closed their establishments and came out to form a human chain. The protesters said they will again come out on road in the evening.

62,17-1-20,Punjab Govt mulling to move SC on CAA-NRC,"Even as Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday maintained that any decision on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) would be taken in the House on Friday, the State Government, at the same time, is considering to challenge the validity of the controversial Act in the Apex Court.

It has been learnt that the Chief Minister has directed the office of the state Advocate-General to see how the State can challenge the Act in the Apex Court. Sources said the State is considering to move the Supreme Court against the CAA and NRC on the similar grounds as Kerala under Article 131 of the Constitution.

Notably, the Kerala Government has, on January 14, moved the Supreme Court challenging the contentious CAA under Article 131 of the Constitution which empowers the Apex Court to hear disputes between the Government of India and one or more states.

The petition stated that the CAA violates Right to Equality under Article 14 of the Constitution of India, Right to Life under Article 21 and Freedom to Practice Religion under Article 25. It argued that CAA is discriminatory because it covers only a class of minorities from a class of countries sharing borders with India and to which and from there have been trans-border migration.

The CAA, which has evoked countrywide protests, seeks to provide citizenship to illegal migrants from Buddhist, Hindu, Sikhs, Jain, Parsi and Christian faiths, who have come to India from the neighbouring countries of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, on or before December 31, 2014.

Meanwhile, not ruling out the possibility of bringing a resolution against the amended citizenship law during the ongoing two-day assembly session, the Chief Minister asked to “wait till tomorrow”.

The Kerala Assembly had recently passed a resolution demanding the scrapping of the controversial law, becoming the first state in the country to do so.

Already, the State Government had on Tuesday made it clear that it would proceed according to the “will of the House” on the issue of CAA, NRC, and National Population Register (NPR).

However, Capt Amarinder has all along been claiming that his Government would not allow the implementation of “brazenly divisive CAA”.

After a Cabinet Meeting on Tuesday, his colleagues in the ministry had expressed concern over the implications of the “blatantly unconstitutional and divisive CAA, NRC and NPR”.

They had also expressed alarm on the violence over the issue, which they said “threatened to rip apart the secular fabric of the nation”.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-govt-mulling-to-move-sc-on-caa-nrc.html

64,17-1-20,"SGPC, Akal Takht oppose saffron touch to Amritsar railway station","The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and Akal Takht, top temporal seat of Sikhs, have opposed the manner in which the railways have proposed to renovate and facelift the railway station in the holy city.

Several Sikh outfits and personalities have apprehended that the blueprint of renovation work has a saffron touch and pays no heed to the Sikh heritage values of the holy city.

The proposal to construct a lotus-shaped pond at the main entrance of the railway station has irked the Sikh organizations.

SGPC Chief Gobind Singh Longowal vehemently rejected the revamp plan saying religious insignias on all entry and exit points of the city including the airport, bus stand and railway station should give a reflection of Sikh religious places like the Golden Temple keeping in view the sentiments of visiting pilgrims.

""Religious symbols always reflect the religious importance of a city... This city (Amritsar) is known for the pious Golden Temple,"" he said.

Renovation work of the holy city should be done while keeping in view the importance of the world renowned Golden Temple and emotions of the Sikh community, he said. ""The significance of Sikh heritage shouldn't be ignored at any cost, since hundreds of Sikh devotees around the world throng Amritsar with the motive to pay obeisance at Golden Temple through rail routes,"" he said. ""The fourth Sikh Guru Ramdas during his life time had developed the holy city Amritsar while facilitating various skilled persons to establish their business and that areas are still existing in Amritsar,"" he said.

Longowal said that he also appealed to the Indian Railways Station Development Corporation (IRSDC) to review the proposed plan as per the importance of Sikh heritage values.

Notably, under the public-private partnership (PPP) mode, the IRSDC is going to revamp the station at a cost of Rs 300 crore.Akal Takht Jathedar Harpreet Singh said that replica of the Golden Temple at the entrance of the railway station must not be removed at the cost of some other insignia,Â since religious importance of the city must remain intact.

However, state BJP president Shwait Malik said the matter was being blown out of proportion and one should not give political colour to such issues.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sgpc--akal-takht-oppose-saffron-touch-to-amritsar-railway-station.html

After being elected to the post, Bhagat said that this was a very important day in his life. He thanked the central and state leadership of the party along with the party workers for the important responsibility given to him.

79,17-1-20,BJP reposes faith in experienced Bansidhar,"Associated with politics since the days of the Jana Sangh, 69-year old six-time MLA Bansidhar Bhagat is an experienced politician who has handled various portfolios in the undivided Uttar Pradesh Government and the Uttarakhand cabinet.

His unopposed election to the post of the eighth BJP State president is being seen as a result of the party high command placing its trust on an experienced veteran. This development is also being seen as a boost for the chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat.

Inspired by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Bhagat became associated with the Jana Sangh in 1975.

Later in 1982, he was elected the head of the Kisan Sangharsh Samiti of Haldwani block and also first started the movement for construction of Jamrani dam. In 1984, he was elected the Gram Pradhan of Paniyali in the Panchayat election. From 1988 to 1991 he was the chairman of the sale purchase cooperative committee in Haldwani.

Then, in 1989 he assumed charge as the BJP’s Nainital district head. During the Ram Janmabhoomi movement he was travelling to Ayodhya when he was arrested and kept in the Almora jail for 23 days. He was first elected MLA from Nainital constituency in undivided Uttar Pradesh in 1991.

He was subsequently elected MLA from the same constituency for the second time in 1993 and for the third time in 1996.

During 1996, in undivided Uttar Pradesh, he was made the State minister for food and civil supplies, forest and hill development. Later, in 2000 after creation of Uttarakhand state, he was the cabinet minister handling portfolios including agriculture, cooperatives, dairy, animal husbandry and sugar cane.

During 2007, he was elected MLA for the fourth time from Haldwani constituency and was made the cabinet minister handling forest and wildlife, environment, watershed management, cooperatives, health, industrial development and transport. In 2012, he was elected MLA from the newly created Kaladhungi Assembly constituency and elected once again from the same constituency in 2017.

Apart from his political activities, he has also remained active in religious and cultural activities. He has been playing the role of Dashrath every year in the Ramlila organised in his area.

With his unopposed election, the BJP high command has also reposed faith in an experienced and senior leader instead of taking chance with a younger and upcoming leader. Apart from Bhagat’s capabilities, this decision is also being said to have been influenced by the assembly election results in Jharkhand and other states where the BJP did not fare as well as expected.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-reposes-faith-in-experienced-bansidhar.html
80,17-1-20,"New PCC to be constituted soon, says Pritam Singh","The Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief Pritam Singh has said that the new PCC would soon be announced. The statement of the PCC chief came at a time when the speculations were rife about the fate of the PCC, the constitution of which is pending for long.

The recent visit of Pritam Singh to Delhi had further fuelled the talks making round on the PCC. Talking to the media persons at the State headquarter of Congress party here on Thursday, the PCC president said that the picture on the PCC would soon get cleared. He however added that he would meet the party leaders in New Delhi in coming days. On the question about the expected size of the PCC, he declined to make any comment but added that the PCC would be a balanced one.

After a long wait of more than two and half years, Pritam Singh had suspended the old PCC last month. It was expected that he would declare new PCC but the internal dynamics of the Congress party has ensured delay.

It is clear that apart from maintaining regional balance in his team, Pritam would have to deal with the intense pressure of the camps headed by former chief minister Harish Rawat and former PCC chief Kishore Upadhyaya for accommodating their supporters in the new PCC. Pritam Singh has teamed up with leader of opposition Hridayesh to create his own camp in the faction ridden Congress party.

Pritam Singh was appointed as PCC chief in May 2017 after the severe drubbing the party faced at the hands of BJP in the assembly elections in the state. In these two and half years, Singh was not able to select his new team in the PCC and continued to work with the old PCC team that was chosen during the time when Kishore Upadhyaya was PCC President.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/new-pcc-to-be-constituted-soon--says-pritam-singh.html

Linda unfolding these two things said, “The first thing is when you go home find if there is any drop out lurking aimlessly in your village. The second thing is that minor girls and boys are induced and tempted and are trafficked outside the state where they lead a sub human life.”

Linda asked the students to be a model for them. He asked the modest gathering of parents and huge strength of students (1,250) to ‘keep police informed if someone induces a minor girl or boy for human trafficking. Police will rush to help.”

Linda was the chief guest in the Deepti NIketan High School’s annual sports day function where he in his speech quite warmly praised the March Past of the students, band party and energy and zeal of the students as many of them were bare footed in winter. Linda spoke against witchcraft reminding students that they should not fall in this kind of trap as there is nothing any such thing called witch.

89,17-1-20,Marandi keeps mum on JVM’s merger with BJP,"Confusion deepened over Jharkhand Vikas Morcha’s (JVM) merger with BJP after JVM chief Babulal Marandi refused to say anything concrete over his joining BJP. Marandi, the newly elected Dhanwar MLA neither denied nor confirmed about his party’s merger with BJP.

Marandi, who was away from State for past one week reached Ranchi on Thursday and had discussion about his future course of action with party leaders. Talking to media persons he said, “I have no information about media news about JVM’s merger with BJP. I came to know JVM’s merger with BJP when I reached Ranchi.”

The former Chief Minister claimed that he will visit his Assembly constituency Dhanwar spending few days there. On being asked about JVM leader Pradeep Yadav’s remark about JVM’s merger with BJP, Marandi said, “Pradeep Yadav is right person to give answer about such rumour.”

Sources said that though Marandi refused to disclose his future plans, but his softness and bonhomie with BJP was evident. Marandi during his chat with media persons for more than 30 minutes talked about his old days when his RSS Karyakarta moving across the Country spreading RSS teachings. Marandi, a former RSS leader resigned from his job as a teacher to work for the organisation. His association with RSS helped him in scaling political ladder as BJP gave him ticket to contest Lok Sabha election in 1991 and 1996, but tasted his first political victory in 1998 when he defeated Shibu Soren the stalwart of Jharkhand movement in 1998 election from Dumka Lok Sabha seat.

The victory gave an immense boost to Marandi's profile and he was included in the Union Council of Ministers.

In 2000, he became the first Chief Minister of newly created State of Jharkhand. But he had to resign in 2003 and Arjun Munda became the chief minister. In 2006, Marandi formed his own party and since then he has been trying to find a base in the State. In 2009, his party won eleven Assembly seats, which were reduced to eight in 2014. In 2019, his party managed to win only three seats.

Though Marandi refused to disclose his future plans, party insiders claim that sooner or later JVM’s merger with BJP is inevitable.

A senior JVM leader on condition of anonymity said, “JVM merger with BJP is certain. The delay is mainly due to process and formalities, which has to be taken ahead of merger. As Marandi is not single person who has join BJP but entire party is to be merged a lot of process is to be taken ahead of merger.”

Sources said that Marandi after returning in couple of days will constitute the working committee. Sources said that once party working committee decides to go with party chief Marandi’s decision to merge with BJP, merger will automatically occur even though party MLAs are opposed to working committee decision.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/marandi-keeps-mum-on-jvm---s-merger-with-bjp.html

97,17-1-20,C’garh assembly ratifies bill to extend SC,"Chhattisgarh assembly on Thursday ratified the Constitution (126th) Amendment Bill that proposed to extend quota to Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) in Lok Sabha and state assemblies by another 10 years.

A special one-day session of the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly was convened to ratify the Constitution Amendment bill, which was passed in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on December 10 and 12 respectively. The bill requires consent of 50 percent state assemblies. The last date was January 25, 2020.

Chhattisgarh Thursday also joined the league of states giving its nod to the bill.

Chhattisgarh’s law minister Mohammed Akbar moved the resolution to ratify the bill in the House. Concluding the discussion, he said it was the Congress government that returned to tribals the land acquired for Tata Steel in Bastar region. The previous BJP government did not take any initiative in the interest of tribals, he added.

Chhattisgarh Congress Committee Chief and senior legislator Mohan Markam said the Congress government had ensured reservation for ST, SC and Other backward class. The state government had ensured 32 per cent, 13 per cent and 27 per cent reservation for ST, SC and OBC. He however expressed his concern over discontinuation of quota for Anglo-Indian.

Participating in the discussion former Chief Minister Raman Singh said instead of 10 years, the members of SC and ST should be given life-long reservation. “This was necessary in the interest of social justice,” he added.

Leader of Opposition Dharamlal Kaushik recalled contribution of former BJP government and laid stress on filling the vacant posts of SC/ST community mainly in Bastar region along with creation of new posts.

JCC (J) member Devvrat Singh suggested for ensuring reservation in all private sector operating in Chhattisgarh limits.

The House later unanimously passed the resolution to ratify the bill.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/c---garh-assembly-ratifies-bill-to-extend-sc-st-quota.html
98,17-1-20,"Do not look for helpline numbers online, warn police","Do not look for helpline numbers online, an advisory from Ranchi police said on Thursday warning residents of the city about a new practice by cyber frauds wherein they spew wrong helpline numbers of banks and other finance-related companies on search engine platforms in a bid to trap callers.

The advisory, shared by the official Twitter handle of Ranchi Police, said that cyber frauds often impersonate as bank employees over phone and ask for confidential details when the account holders call on the numbers available online. “Unaware bank customers are more likely to fall in the trap and get duped,” the advisory said.

In some cases, cyber frauds may ask the callers to download a mobile App from playstore and send links for the same. Downloading any such App, police said, can give access of private date on your phone to cyber frauds. “Since most of us use online banking on our respective smart phones, we become susceptible to cyber fraud of the frauds get access to our phone. No bank or help desk of any company should ever ask you to download any App from play store or any other platform,” the advisory said.

The police have also warned Ranchi residents of cyber frauds prowling platforms such as Olx, Quikr and even Facebook. These frauds, police said, put up advertisements of products at a through away price to entice buyers. The sellers ask for advance payment and shipping expenses and turn incommunicado once the money is transferred to their mobile wallet or bank account through UPI payment.

Ranchi resident Tarun Mehta came across a similar advertisement on OLX, wherein a person purporting to be a resident of the USA was selling the latest model of iPhone at half the price. The seller shared a Bank of Baroda account number and asked Mehta to send an advance of Rs 15,000 to the account. When Mehta refused to oblige, the seller agreed to ship the phone to India even if an amount of

Rs 500 was transferred to his bank account. “I knew had serious doubts on this man. I was sure that he was a fraud when he agreed to ship the product if I send Rs 500 to him,” Mehta said. Sometimes cyber frauds also contact people as buyers on such platforms and send links for monetary transactions. Such links, police said, were dangerous and should not be clicked. “Every seller should remember that you don’t need to enter your UPI pin anywhere in order to receive money. The pin is needed only if you have to send money to someone,” the advisory said.

Jharkhand is home to India’s cyber crime capital, Jamtara — a small, backward district in tribal-dominated Santhal Pargana region of the State. A data compiled by a Special Task Force (STF) of Uttar Pradesh police revealed that more than 2,000 mobile SIM cards across the country used to commit online fraud in 2015 were operated from Jamtara district.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/do-not-look-for--helpline-numbers--online--warn-police.html
99,17-1-20,Overloaded trucks spill coal dust in residential areas,"Residents in the Phusro, Kathara and Bokaro Thermal woke up to the black dust on Thursday morning. The stretch on Bermo, road from Phusro towards Kathara and Gomia was covered with mounds of coal spilled from the overloaded dumpers and trucks, making it difficult for the commuters and morning joggers who had to cover their faces.

The entire road from Jaina More towards Kathara via Phusro is facing the coal dust problem since long time, said Dilip Thakur a resident of Jarandih. Despite various representations from the environment activists to curb the nuisance, the district authorities

including Phusro Municipal Corporation are yet to initiate action.

Gulab Prajapati, a social activist living in Bokaro Thermal said, “Coal pollution is very high in this area. We can’t even think of jogging on the Kathara-Phusro road due to the coal dust. Despite

complaints, the authorities are unmoved.”

Dr H.Kumar MD said that the residents of Bermo coal belt inhale the most polluted air because of large scale mining and industrial activity. Consequently, while mostly people of Bokaro thermal, Kathara, Jarandih, Phusro and Gandhinagar, who are suffering from various disease because of contaminated water they drink and the polluted air they breathe, the Government, local administration and other

agencies have done a precious little to rid them of this problem, added Dr Kumar.

Prajapati said dust particles from the open cast mines are causing various diseases in the region. He further said that the excavated warthog the coal mines should be covered with trees but nothing much has been done towards this direction. The coal slurry is being dumped in Damodar which is considered the lifeline of this region, affecting the quantity of its water, Prajapati said.

Besides coal dust, the residents living in Bermo sub division of Bokaro district, including Kathara, Jarandih,and Gandhinagar also face the problem of fly ash generated by the power plant, CCL and open carrying coal dust by dumpers and suffer from various diseases, added Prajapati. When the issue was brought to the notice of CCL authorities, their project officer AK Jha said that the water sprinkling on the road of Jarandih and Kathara have been operated earlier with an aim to curb the rising level of dust pollution in the coal field but its tender has been ended and will soon start sprinkle of water on the roads which will help the dirt and soil wash away, added Jha.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/overloaded-trucks-spill-coal-dust-in-residential-areas.html

JIADA has passed orders to this effect and has served show-cause notices to over 24 such companies/investors at Bokaro, Kandra, Sindri as well as Giridih industrial areas, informed an official.

There are several companies that were allotted land to erect their units. But, after a long time they have only erected boundary walls on their plots and construction work of their establishments are yet to be kicked-off, said PN Mishra Secretary JIADA.

“Notices have been served to such owners of the companies asking them to present their side. If there is no satisfactory response, their allotment will be cancelled (through director level),” added Mishra.

Their allotments will be cancelled because those investors have not made any investment after a long time of allotment of land. There are several genuine investors waiting for a piece of land to set up their industries in those industrial areas, said Mishra adding, “Now JIADA has only one acre of land and we are finding very hard in allotment of land for new industrial units.”

The authority is also planning to take stringent action on closed industrial units. Action would be taken against such units that are yet to start their production in the second phase. While in the third phase JIADA is all set to act against those units that are shut since long, said an official.

“The Government puts in a lot of effort to acquire land and develop industrial areas. We do not want people to speculate on land, and profit from industrial plots by reselling them,” said the official. During the tenure of past Government, JIADA approved 21 new investment proposals to set up units, with an investment of Rupees 70 crore, at Balidih Industrial Area in Bokaro. JIADA also approved the investment proposal to set up a mega food park at Chandankyari in Bokaro and approved land to set up the unit, said an official.

103,17-1-20,Five held for sexual assault on schoolgirls,"Khunti police on Thursday arrested four local men and produced a minor boy before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) on charges of luring six school girls to an isolated place on pretext of buying sweets and sexually assaulting them. The minor boy, who was known to the girls, had convinced them to accompany him and the four other men to a sweet shop while they were at a local fair, police said.

While initial reports from Khunti said that the girls were gang-raped, police said that it was a case of sexual assault and the girls fled the spot before the accused could overpower them and outrage their modesty. “We have lodged a First Information Report (FIR) under the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act, and the girls have been sent to the CWC for counseling,” said Khunti Superintendent of Police Ashutosh Shekhar.

Police on Thursday sent the girls for medical examinations. Meanwhile, a team of Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) and Crime Investigation Department (CID) inspected the crime scene, police

said. “The minor boy, who was known to the girls, had convinced them to join his group. He is being questioned by the CWC,” Shekhar

said.

The arrested men have been identified as Rajesh Sanga, Pravin Nag, Avinash Saimurga and Sagar Aind – all residents of Hatudami village in Khunti. The incident occurred under the jurisdiction of Khunti Police Station, and the cops were quick to form a team for investigating the case. All four have confessed to their crime.

Khunti CWC member Baijnath Kumar said that the girls were taken to a neighbouring village on Wednesday evening and held captive till 2.30am on Thursday. “We will get the medical reports by tonight. For now, it appears to be a case of sexual assault and teasing. However, the accused will still face charges under the POCSO Act,” he said.

Hatudami village is only a few kilometers from Kochang – a village where five anti-human trafficking activists were abducted and gangraped on gunpoint in June 2018. The Jharkhand High Court sentenced all the six convicts in the case to life imprisonment last year. A priest of a Roman Catholic Church, Father Alfonso Aind, was one of the convicts in the case.

The victims in the Kochang case were abducted while they were performing a street play to spread awareness against human trafficking at RC Mission School in Kochang. They were taken to nearby Chhoutali jungle, where the perpetrators raped them in an attempt to teach them a lesson for speaking on the Pathalgadi movement.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/five-held-for-sexual-assault-on-schoolgirls.html

105,17-1-20,Opp boycotts Guv’s address at spl session,"In an unprecedented event, the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly witnessed a boycott of the Governor's address by main opposition parties on Thursday.

Governor Anusuiya Uikey, who was in BJP before her elevation as first citizen of the state, addressed the House while inaugurating the special one-day session to ratify Constitutional amendment for 10 years' extension of reservations to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

The House ratified the amendment before adjournment.

The BJP was joined by Janta Congress Chhattisgarh (JCC) MLAs in the boycott. BJP leader Brijmohan Aggarwal said: ""We had sought extension of time to discuss the Governor's address which was not granted. That is why all BJP MLAs walked out"".

Former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi said a wrong precedent has been set with no discussion being allowed on Governor's address. The Governor finally read her Address despite the walkout.

The Opposition resented the fact that the Governor's address being included in two sessions. It was not being done as per constitutional provisions. With the ratification of the Constitutional amendment being the key issue on the agenda, there is no scope for discussing the Governor's address before a motion of thanks. Like Madhya Pradesh the Chhattisgarh assembly should have also provided for another day's sitting.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ravindra Choubey called the boycott a Rs political stunt’. Former Chief Minister Raman Singh has said an important tradition of the House has been broken. ""We could not be a party to this"".

Last Sunday, the BJP Legislature Party met Governor Anusuiya Uike and Speaker of the Assembly Dr. Charandas Mahant and presented its objections. The MLAs argued that a one-day session could not do justice to the agenda with no discussion taking place on the Governor's address. It has never happened before, they claimed.

The Governor said the Chhattisgarh Assembly has established a good reputation in a short time with its excellent functioning. She said on her first visit to the assembly, she is quite emotional and energised.

The Governor said: ""I am very happy to say my government has given better life to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Chhattisgarh"".

In Jamshedpur 80 percent of the hotels that include tea stalls, small and medium scale eateries and few of the popular restaurants pull down their shutters for three consecutive days at least, as it is genuinely difficult for them to run their business in the light of fewer work force.

""I closed of my shop for three consecutive days and, it is only after January 21 the business will start as few of the labourers would get back,"" informed, Yogesh Gupta, owner of Gupta Tea Stall in Jugsalai.Traditionally, Tusu is celebrated with gaiety and fanfare across the Jharkhand and there is no point stopping the tribals, who constitute a large chunk of the hotel work force, from going on leave to celebrate this festival with their family and relatives.

""Through out the year they work sincerely and on occasions they work over time but never ask for additional pay or any other benefit. So, it is but human for us to understand their sense when they ask forleave during Tusu,"" conceded, Ramesh Mukherjee, owner of Snacks Point in Bistupur.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/eateries-and-restaurants-down-shutters-for-tusu.html

“It seems that the Uttar Pradesh government is identifying land (for the mosque) outside the periphery of Ayodhya city, which is unfortunate,” he said.

Talking to media persons on Thursday, Ansari said that land for the mosque should be given inside Ayodhya city so that a mosque along with a women’s hospital could be constructed on it.

Ansari further said that Ayodhya was always a place of communal harmony where Hindus and Muslims lived peacefully and now too, along with construction of a Ram temple and a mosque, a hospital should be set up to serve the people.

Earlier, media reports suggested that the district authorities had identified land for the mosque outside the 14-kosi parikrama path which is almost near the Ayodhya border with adjoining districts.

On November 9, 2019, the apex court had given its historic verdict on Ayodhya issue in which it directed the government to set up a trust within three months for the construction of Ram temple and give five acres of land in Ayodhya to Muslims for a new mosque.

119,17-1-20,Policy push for environment in MP,"Amid global efforts to arrest the scourge of climate change, Chief Minister Kamal Nath is leaving no stone unturned to reduce the carbon footprint in Madhya Pradesh.

Invigorating policy with a vision for the future, the state government, under Kamal Nath, has launched a raft of schemes and measures to maintain and nurture the fragile ecological balance in this biodiverse region.

Leading from the front the state government has banned single use plastics at public functions and ceremonies, and set a target to totally phase out this disposable packaging material by the year 2022.

Single use plastics are known to cause huge damage to the environment as they break down into microplastics and take thousands of years to decompose. Besides contaminating soil and water, disposable plastics further impact animal and avian life.

In a bid to curtail pollution caused by industries using furnace oil, the new policy makes it mandatory for such units to have an effective control over sulphur dioxide emissions before earning requisite permissions for use of the fuel.

Sulphur dioxide is a major air and water pollutant known to pose health risks to all forms of life. In humans, the pollutant causes various respiratory disorders.

Assessment of water quality of River Narmada is currently underway. Water from the river is being analysed along a 50-point index charted for the purpose.

The State Government is also analysing water quality of rivers along the inter-State borders and water intake points.

Putting in place a robust action plan for 22 polluted river stretches in the State, the Kamal Nath Government has constituted a river rejuvenation committee to oversee the restoration of water quality in these areas.

Implementation, steering and monitoring committees have been set up to ensure an improvement in ambient air quality in the six non attainment cities in the state.

Bio-monitoring of River Chambal is also being conducted simultaneously; the exercise aims to explore the various causes leading to the contamination of water in the river.

The unrelenting efforts recently came in for national acclaim when the Environment Planning and Coordination Organisation (EPCO) of the State Department of Environment was awarded the first prize of the National Water Mission for excellence in conducting the Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment Study in the state. EPCO was further adjudged the winner for the ‘Leadership in Urban Climate Action’ category under the Earth Care Award for conservation of Traditional water structures in Indore City.

Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS) have been established in five major cities and several districts in the state. 52 district headquarters have also been provided with apparatus to map ambient air quality.

In a bid to heighten awareness and transparency, the state government provides accurate air, water and industrial pollution statistics to citizens through its website and a mobile application developed for the purpose.

Bringing in innovation, arrangements have been made for disposal of recyclable plastic waste in cement kilns. The move will result in cost saving benefits as it helps save huge amounts of coal. The state government expects to dispose at least 22710 metric tones of plastic waste through this method.

The State Government has also rolled out new provisions for monitoring the tracking and disposal of industrial waste, hazardous waste and e-waste.

A well-equipped microbiology laboratory has been established in the State Capital to study the efficacy of various pollution control schemes.

Speaking of the developments, activists say robust and timely pollution control measures are imperative to not just human health but also the large forest cover in the state which is home to an astounding array of flora and fauna, animal and avian life.

The Forest Survey of India (FSI) in its recently published India State of Forest Report (ISFR) recorded an increase in the total forest cover in Madhya Pradesh.

The current forest expanse stands at 77,482.49 sq km or 25.14 percent of the total land area in the state while the previous report had measured it at 77,414 sq km or 25.11 percent. As per the report Madhya Pradesh has the largest area-wise forest cover in the country.

Enthused by the results, environmentalists say that the increase in forest cover is a result of timely intervention and sustained efforts.

They underline the need for a fluid and comprehensive environment policy which keeps up with the change in climate.

As per the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) Madhya Pradesh is among the leading states in the country for revising the State Action Plan on Climate Change.

Lauding the vision of Chief Minister Kamal Nath, the activists say that the inclusive policy and schemes reflect a deep understanding of the subject which otherwise tends to focus exclusively on urban or household pollution.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/policy-push-for-environment-in-mp.html

125,17-1-20,Spl lecture on research in Brajbhasha held,"A special lecture on research in Brajbhasha was organized by an Italian researcher at Sanchi Buddhist-Indian University of Knowledge Studies.

Rosina Pastore is a researcher in the Indian Philosophy Department of the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, and serves as a graduate assistant at the same university. Rosina is currently in the Indian Philosophy Department of Visva Bharati Shanti Niketan for a year to complete her PhD, which the Hindi department of Shanti Niketan is extending its full support.

Rosina Pastore focused her lecture on the many forms and sources of Prabodhchandra through Brajwasiadas's 'Brajbhasha' to professors and students of all departments of Sanchi University, especially students of Hindi Department. Rosina Pastore is trying to find the aspect of philosophy in Prabodhchandra written in Sanskrit.

In this lecture organised by the Hindi department of the university, Rosina Pastore told that in her research so far, it has been found that Tulsidas's Ramcharitramanas, does not have the influence, but Bharatamuni's play written in Sanskrit, and Prabodha Chandram written by Brajavasidas has more influence.

Prabodhchandra, written in Sanskrit in the eleventh century, is interpreted by Brajavasidasa in the 17th century. Rosina says that Brajavasidas has actually interpreted Prabodhachandra in Braj language because Braj was the emphasis of Hindi at that time. Hindi language too became the Braj language before Sanskrit and after it became Hindi language.

Rahul Siddharth, Department Head of Hindi Department of Sanchi University, says that Prabodh means awakening and this enlightenment brings harmony in society, harmony comes. Sanchi University Principal OP Budholia presented the book Monuments of Sanchi Rosina Pastore focusing on Sanchi Stupa and thanked her for presenting her lecture in Hindi as well as the philosophy.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/spl-lecture-on-research-in-brajbhasha-held.html

127,17-1-20,Express views in dignified way: Birla tells lawmakers,"Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla called on parliamentarians and legislators to lend their voices to the deprived and disadvantaged sections of society within the framework of parliamentary dignity and conventions to strengthen the Indian democracy.

In his inaugural address at the 7th Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA), India Region, conference at the UP Legislative Assembly here on Thursday, Birla said, “For a robust democracy to survive, it is essential that all elected members get the right to raise issues related to the common people and the government should pay due attention to those views, and it is the responsibility of the government to redress the issues.”

The lawmakers should express their views in the House strongly and emotionally but also in a disciplined and dignified manner to “successfully stand the test” as a public representative, he added.

The Lok Sabha Speaker said India was a leading democracy that had become synonymous with development.

“Since Independence, the voting percentage has steadily gone up which indicates that the faith of the people in our democracy has also increased and with it the responsibility of the elected representatives has increased manifold,” Birla said.

Referring to the parliamentary committees, he said they had an important role in keeping the legislative control over the executive and ensuring that the budgetary provisions were utilised for the intended purpose and benefited the common people. He said it was the duty of the elected representatives to keep a watch on the utilisation of the Budget.

“The parliamentary committee’s role is very important as its members rise above the political divide to express their views and give their independent version on any issue assigned to the committee like the framing of important legislation,” Birla said. He said it had been decided to frame law and rules for ensuring disturbance-free conduct of the proceedings of the legislature.

“The meeting of the presiding officers of the legislatures recently discussed this issue in Dehradun and very soon rules are expected to be announced and they can be adopted by the state assemblies,” he said.

Birla also stressed the need to maintain decorum during the House proceedings and expressed concern on the use of unparliamentary words by the members. “Such act should be prevented as it only brings a bad name for the country and weakens our parliamentary system,” he said.

“India is the largest democracy of the world and its legislature plays an important role in the functioning of the government which caters to the people through its schemes and policies,” he said.

Talking about the CPA, Birla said that it was a group of 57 countries and it was very useful to understand the legislative system of other countries. He said the conference would discuss ways and means to strengthen the legislative system. He thanked Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Assembly Speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit for holding this conference in UP.

In his brief address, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that the CPA was holding conference to strengthen the parliamentary and democratic system in the country.

“I think this conference will certainly give suggestions to make our parliamentary system more effective and powerful,” he said.

The chief minister also said that his government had held two special sessions in 2019 to strengthen the parliamentary system.

“The first one was held on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi when both the Houses of UP legislature sat for 36 hours without interruption to discuss the social charter of United Nations which is the basic essential for the people, while the second special sitting was held on the occasion of Constitution Day on November 26, 2019,“ he said.

Speaking on the occasion , Madhya Pradesh Governor Lalji Tandon raised the issue of unparliamentary words used by the members of legislatures and Parliament.

“Ruling party and opposition are two sides of the legislature and they have to play a constructive role in serving the people,” Tandon said and asked the people’s representatives to maintain decorum in the House while expressing their voice against anyone.

Leader of opposition in UP Assembly and Samajwadi Party leader Ram Govind Chaudhary spoke on opposition members’ rights and how they were being ignored by the treasury bench. “If our demands are heard, then there will be no reason for disruption of the proceedings,” he said.

The delegates were welcomed by UP Assembly Speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit, who described the historical and cultural importance of UP and how the state held key to the Indian politics.

“Nine prime ministers of the country, including the present Narendra Modi, have been from UP and this shows the political importance of the state,” he said.

Dikshit also stressed the need for change in some rules of the proceedings for better management of the House by the presiding officers.

The conference is also being attended by Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh along with secretary generals of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and Chairman of UP Legislative Council, Ramesh Yadav.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/express-views-in-dignified--way--birla-tells-lawmakers.html

Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai will chair the meeting which will be attended by Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla and Chief Secretaries and Census Directors of all states.

The meeting will discuss the modalities for the house-listing phase of the census and the NPR, to be carried out from April 1 to September 30, a Home Ministry official said. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has already announced that representatives from her state will not attend the meeting. A few state governments, including West Bengal and Kerala, have declared that they will not participate in the NPR exercise now as it is a prelude to a country-wide National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Officials said the objective of the NPR is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country. The database would contain demographic as well as biometric particulars, they said. Home Ministry officials said most states have notified provisions related to the NPR, which is a register of usual residents of the country. It is being prepared at the local (village/sub-town), subdistrict, district, state and national levels under provisions of the Citizenship Act, 1955 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. The rules have a provision for fine of up to Rs 1,000 on those violating it.

The data for NPR was last collected in 2010 along with the house-listing phase of the Census 2011. Updating of this data was done in 2015 by conducting door to door survey. While updating the register in 2015, the government had asked for details like Aadhaar and mobile numbers. This time, the information related to their driving licence and voter ID card may also be gathered, the officials said, adding that PAN card details will not be collected as part of this exercise.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/all-states--except-wb--to-participate-in-meet-on-census--npr.html
130,17-1-20,Rawat for hardline approach to tackle terrorism,"Chief of Defence Staff(CDS) General Bipin Rawat on Thursday called for global action against States sponsoring terrorism and said there is a need to take a hardline approach in dealing with this scourge. He also said children in the age group of 10-12 were getting radicalised in Kashmir and called for steps to wean them away by isolating them and put them in de-radicalisation camps.

Making these comments here during the ongoing Raisina Dialogue, he also said security forces cannot be blamed for injuries caused due to pellet guns and the radicalised stone pelters are “more dangerous” than the pellet guns. “The pellet guns are non-lethal weapons which are now used very rarely and only aimed below the legs,” he said.

Defending the security forces for using pellet guns for crowd control, the newly appointed CDS said the non-lethal weapon is “sparingly used” in Kashmir and even then they are aimed at the legs.

He said those throwing stones face action. “Stones can cause death. Now we cannot be throwing stones back at them. Pellet guns are non lethal weapons and are fired at the legs,” he said.

Explaining the most likely cause of injuries suffered in the face, Rawat clarified that most of the eye injuries are caused because those pelting stones bend to the ground to pick up stones and because pellet guns are fired at the legs they get hit them in the eyes.

Touching upon the issue of radicalisation, Rawat said children as young as 10-12 years are being radicalised in Kashmir and there is need to isolate those completely radicalised and put them in deradicalization camps.

He said radicalization can be countered by looking at where it is happening and who are behind it. “What we saw in Kashmir, we saw radicalization happening. Today we are seeing radicalization being undertaken even amongst young people. Girls and boys as young as 10-12 are now being radicalization. These people can still isolated from radicalization in a gradual way, but there are people who have been completely radicalised. These people need to taken out separately and possibility taken into some deradicalizaiton camps,” he said. We have deradicalization Camps going on in our country, he added.

He also said radicalization is happening in schools, universities, religious places and sites and then there are people spreading this. “First we need to get to the nerve of who is radicalising people. You can start isolating these people gradually and then start a counter radicalization programme by identifying people who have been radicalised, to what degree...”

On combating terrorism, the CDS said there is a need to take the bull by its horn and strike at the root cause and called for a hardline approach in dealing with terrorism, the way the US went after terror groups after the 9/11 terror attacks.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/rawat-for-hardline-approach-to-tackle-terrorism.html

Peeved by the number of road accidents across the country, Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari has called upon Transport Ministers from all States to prepare the roadmap without bothering about expenses.

Gadkari also warned that officials behind faulty engineering and road designs will not be spared as road accidents are causing a loss of 3 per cent of the GDP of the country every year.

More people in India die annually in road accidents than those killed in militant operations or extremism which is unfortunate, the minister said addressing the 18th Meeting of National Road Safety Council (NRSC) and 39th Meeting of Transport Development Council (TDC).

“There is no dearth of resources for infrastructure development in the country and the need is only for a coherent approach to serve the larger public. Work on improving road engineering will be undertaken with available resources worth Rs 14,000 crore,” said Gadkari.

The Minister said that black spots are being identified and repaired at a fast pace. District-level committees have been formed to examine and suggest such spots which need immediate attention, he added. He stressed on including NGOs and engineering students in conducting road audits.

Transport ministers and senior officials from various states participated in the meeting and discussed different road safety aspects, including the MV (Amendment) Act 2019; tourist vehicles authorisation and permit rules 2019; bus port guidelines; digitisation of transport and abolition of border check posts and inter-state transfer of vehicle registration and driving licenses among others

The Minister also exuded confidence that the number of accidents will decline sharply on the back of stringent traffic rules post enactment of the new Motor Vehicles Act and massive steps undertaken to curb accidents including correction of “black spots” or accident spots at a cost of Rs 14,000 crore.

“Road accidents cause a loss of 3 per cent to the GDP...I am hopeful that the accidents should decline by 50 per cent in five years on the back of stringent traffic rules after the implementation of Motor Vehicles Act...At the same time officials behind faulty road engineering and DPRs (detailed project report) will not be spared,” the minister said.

135,17-1-20,WHO endorses India’s TB test TrueNat for more accuracy,"In a matter of pride for Indian scientists, the WHO Global TB Programme has included an indigenously developed TrueNat tuberculosis technology, developed by them, to detect TB and multi-drug resistant TB in view of its high diagnostic accuracy. TrueNat gives results within an hour while the conventional TB tests take at least 24 to 48 hours.

According to Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Director General Dr Balram Bhargava, the endorsement of the technology by WHO would enable low and middle-income countries to procure TrueNat for tuberculosis and Rifampicin resistance, thus supporting elimination of the disease in developing countries.

The TrueNat TB test, is already part of the National TB Elimination Programme in India.

“It is highly cost-effective compared to GeneXpert and can be used in peripheral centres without an air conditioned laboratory as it runs on battery which can be solar powered.

“It works in two steps. In the first step, the DNA is extracted from the sputum and the second stage involves detection of tuberculosis and multi-drug resistant TB,” a senior ICMR official said.

Supported by the Department of Health Research (DHR), Union Ministry of Health and Department of Biotechnology (DBT), various indigenous technologies developed by Indian scientists and companies for detection of multi-drug resistant (MDR)/extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB were reviewed, said the official.

The most promising kits were selected by an expert group and those were subjected to a double-blind validation in comparison to standard tests at four national reference laboratories of the country.

After a stringent review, a series of validation, subsequent feasibility studies and continuous follow-up, the ‘TrueNat MTB & Rif’ assay was found to be on par with the internationally recognised molecular assay Gene Xpert in terms of sensitivity and specificity and detection of rifampicin resistance.

As part of WHO’s pre-qualification process, ICMR funded Indian centres of the FIND-coordinated multi-central, prospective field evaluation study in four countries -- India, Ethiopia, Peru and Papua-New Guinea.

Based on the interim analysis of data, WHO included TrueNat as test to diagnose TB, replacing sputum smear microscopy, and to sequentially detect rifampicin resistance in view of its high diagnostic accuracy.

Nearly 100 crore people are suffering from TB globally. India accounts for around 27 per cent of these cases, according to a WHO report. The Government aims to rid India of TB by 2025, five years ahead of the target set under the UN Sustainable Development Goals.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/who-endorses-india---s-tb-test-truenat-for-more-accuracy.html

142,17-1-20,"BJP top leaders, rallies to galvanise support for CAA","With the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) made effective from January 10 and the Opposition set to harden its stance against it, the ruling Modi Government is scaling up its efforts to galvanise counter-support for the law from this Saturday by organising major public rallies and deploying top central leaders and Union Ministers across the country.

The first of such public rallies, described as “carpet bombing” by senior party leaders, would be organised in Uttar Pradesh from January 18 to January 23 .

In the light of Congress-led-opposition’s attempts to put Modi Government on the mat and the rising protests around the campuses and on other forums, the BJP has decided to raise the decibel of its offensive substantially, beyond collecting “missed call support” on the citizenship issue.

Party President Amit Shah, Working President J P Nadda, Union Minister Smriti Irani and BJP Vice President and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan would address public rallies to garner mass support for citizenship law vis-à-vis Congress alleged attempt to create a domestic and international opinion against it. These leaders would visit politically key state of Uttar Pradesh for four-days from this week onwards.

An internal survey of the party maintained that the BJP has ground support of 80 per cent people in several states who are largely “silent” and the party needs to work on them.

“ The protest is sponsored by the Congress and Left which has no other issue to gain its lost political ground all over the country,” said BJP General Secretary Anil Jain, who maintained that regional parties have already realized the Congress-Left plan and quit their company. DMK, BSP, TMC and SP did not join Congress-led anti-CAA meet in the national Capital on Monday.

Another senior BJP leader pointed to DMK’s absence from the Congress meet claiming that in states like Tamil Nadu CAA was not a local issue and referred to party’s “success” in local elections in the state.

Jain, who is overseeing BJP’s campaign for CAA, said a majority of institutions and university campuses have not witnessed disturbances or anti-CAA protests. He said the party has received support of about two crore people in its mass contact programme in different states.

Asked whether continuing anti-CAA protests have also disrupted economy in the country, the BJP General Secretary said that may not have a direct link between the two subjects. The BJP leader said there was no question of stepping back on the CAA and it would be their plank for coming years.

Without giving the numbers of persecuted minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, to be given Indian citizenship in India, he said most of them were already in India and alleged that agitation against CAA is part of “opposition conspiracy”. He said citizenship would be accorded to with a cut-off date of December 31, 2014 .

Persecuted minorities from these three countries who move to India beyond the cut-off date will have to spend six years before being eligible for the citizenship.

In his public rallies in Bihar , Shah has accused opposition parties of “misleading minorities” on the CAA and discounted rumours of discord within NDA on the issue.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-top-leaders--rallies-to-galvanise-support-for-caa.html
143,17-1-20,"Adani Ent, NCCF officials booked for graft","The CBI has booked Adani Enterprises and former officials of National Cooperative Consumer Forum (NCCF) in a case of cheating, criminal conspiracy and graft in supply of imported coal to Andhra Pradesh Power Generation Corporation (APGENCO) in 2010.

Adani Enterprises is alleged to have got undue favours in the supply contract.

APGENCO had floated a limited tender enquiry for the supply of six lakh MTs of imported coal from sea ports to Narla Tata Rao Thermal Power Plant in Vijaywada and Rayalaseema Thermal Power Plant (RTPP) in Kadapa on June 29, 2010, according to the FIR.

The tender enquiry was forwarded to seven PSUs including National Co-cooperative Consumer Federation India Ltd (NCCF), a multi-State cooperative under Union Consumer Affairs Ministry having 78 per cent Government stake.

Besides, Adani Enterprises, the CBI booked then NCCF chairman Virender Singh, then Managing Director of NCCF GP Gupta and its senior adviser SC Singhal for allegedly favouring the Ahmedabad-based company in the tender and violation of guidelines.

The CBI alleged that acts of “omission and commission” by the NCCF officers disclose that they acted in “a manner as unbecoming of public servants” and conspired with the company.

The FIR said the officers “committed irregularities by the way of manipulation in the selection of the bidders, thereby giving undue favour to Adani Enterprises Ltd in award of work for supply of imported coal to APGENCO despite its disqualification.

Giving details of alleged criminal conspiracy and corruption, the CBI alleged that NCCF, Hyderabad unit which had received the APGENCO tender enquiry on June 29, 2010 had forwarded it to its headquarters in Delhi to Singhal.

The same day the head office selected a single party — Maharishi Brothers Coal Limited (MBCL) — to transport the coal at a margin of 2.25 per cent instead of initiating the process for floating an open tender to call for bids from the competitive bidders citing lack of time as the deadline was July 7, according to the FIR.

Six days later on July 7, APGENCO informed NCCF, Hyderabad that the date of tender has been extended to July 12 following which allocation to MBCL was cancelled and open tender was floated.

Six bidders Adani Enterprises, MBCL, Vyom Trade Links, Swarana Projects Gupta Coal India, and Kyori Oremin responded to NCCF Tender on July 10, 2010 whose details and bids were tabulated and sent to the headquarters by Hyderabad unit on the same day, it said.

Gupta Coal had quoted 11.3 per cent NCCF margin while MBCL had kept it at 2.25 per cent but remaining companies had not quoted any NCCF margin, it said.

“Instead of cancelling the bid of Adani Enterprises Ltd. Senior management of NCCF conveyed the offer margin of NCCF to the company through one of its representatives Munish Sehgal who was sitting in the NCCF head office on July 10, 2010 in the evening...,” the FIR alleged.

Subsequently, Adani Enterprises Ltd on the same day informed NCCF that they agree to pay minimum margin charge of 2.25 per cent to NCCF.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/adani-ent--nccf-officials-booked-for-graft.html
144,17-1-20,"Bulls awe tamers, Jallikattu events in TN continue to be crowd-pullers","Jallikattu, the popular bull taming sport of Tamil Nadu lived up to its reputation of being a huge crowd-puller as the contest unfolded on Thursday at Palamedu here and Suriyur in Tiruchirappalli district.

As thousands of spectators continued to flock both the events, the tamers were awed by several bulls which were determined to not allow anyone to even come anywhere near them.

Interestingly, at Suriyur, a huge bull not only allowed none to go near it, but also stood boldly on the sporting arena for a while refusing to move on. When a team of men arrived on a mini-truck to drive it away, it kept charging towards the vehicle.

Despite gentle prodding and honking, the animal did not budge and kept staring at tamers several of whom climbed the barricade to avoid the bull’s fury.

Eventually, a man well trained in cattle-rearing managed to throw a rope around its neck and led it away.

At Palamedu, which is more popular, announcements of a variety of prizes like gold coins, gift packs, cycles, and vessels kept the participants on their toes to dominate the animals and emerge victorious.

Bull owners were also anxious that their animals should evade the tamers and run over to the end point so that they could bag prizes.

Perfect nail-biting moments were witnessed when a tamer — who hung over the hump of a fierce bull that proved to be a running machine — slid through its shoulder and fell right in front of its legs.

As luck would have it, the participant escaped unhurt as the animal effortlessly jumped across and sped past.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bulls-awe-tamers--jallikattu-events-in-tn-continue-to-be-crowd-pullers.html
145,17-1-20,Bru tribals to permanently settle in Tripura,"More than 30,000 displaced Bru tribals from Mizoram, who have been living as refugees in Tripura since 1997, will permanently settle in Tripura and a tripartite agreement was signed in this effect on Thursday.

The agreement was signed by representatives of Bru and the central and Mizoram and Governments in presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah here at North Block. Under the pact, over 30,000 Bru tribals will live in Tripura permanently, Shah said.

The Bru tribals have been living in Tripura in different relief camps after they fled Mizoram in 1997 following ethnic clashes between Bru and Mizo communities. An agreement signed in July 2018 for repatriation of the Bru tribals to Mizoram did not materialise as majority of the community members refused to go back to Mizoram.

Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb, Mizoram CM Zoramthanga, Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalal were also present in the function. During the meeting, Shah said approximately 30,000 Bru refugees will be settled in Tripura and the Centre has approved Rs 600 crore package for this purpose.

He added Bru refugees will get a 40 by 30 feet plot along with a fixed deposit of Rs 4 lakhs, cash assistance of Rs 5000 per month for 2 years and free ration.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bru-tribals-to-permanently-settle-in-tripura.html
146,17-1-20,Nitish will lead NDA in Bihar polls: Shah,"Hailing Bihar for giving “the best response” to amended Citizenship Act, BJP president Amit Shah on Thursday appealed to the people to pledge their support to the new law by giving a missed call on a designated number from their mobile phones.

He urged the crowd attending a pro-CAA rally at Kharauna in Vaishali district, about 75 km from capital Patna, to give a missed call to the 8866288662, pledging their support to the legislation which has triggered country-wide protests.

Shah also sought to dispel “rumours” of discord within the NDA in the State, asserting that the upcoming assembly polls in Bihar will be contested under the leadership of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.

Shah slammed the Opposition for misleading minorities about the Act in pursuance of their “vote bank” politics and engineering violence that had erupted in the aftermath.

Underscoring that the law provided for granting citizenship and not snatching it away from anybody, he said the party was organising rallies across the country with a view to busting the misinformation campaign.

He talked in support of the CAA, but did not mention NRC or NPR (National Population Register) in his speech. Opposition RJD, Congress and their Grand Alliance partners in Bihar have been campaigning among the people against the CAA, proposed NRC and NPR. Lalu Prasad’s RJD has been targetting Chief Minister Nitish Kumar over these issues.

Kumar, whose party JD(U) voted in favour of Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in the Parliament to help it become an Act, has said a country-wide implementation of National Register of Citizens was “needless” and had “no justification”.

On NPR, he said in state assembly on Monday last that his Government agreed in principle to it as they did likewise when such an exercise was last conducted 10 years ago.

He, however, had emphasised that the census should be caste-based. Shah sought support of the people to the Modi governments measures like CAA as also abrogation of Article 370 and construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya.

With Bihar scheduled to see elections in the current year, Shah declared “I want to dispel all rumours about our coalition with Kumars JD(U). The elections will be contested under Nitish Kumars leadership”.

“Lalu Prasad (RJD supremo), who is in jail in corruption cases, may go on dreaming that our coalition will come apart. But he should know that the NDA has led Bihar out of his lantern age (an allusion to RJDs poll symbol) to the LED era.

“The country and the state shall progress under the leadership of Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar respectively”, Shah flanked by Union ministers Giriraj Singh, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Nityanand Rai and Ashwini Choubey besides state unit chief Sanjay Jaiswal and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nitish-will-lead-nda-in-bihar-polls--shah.html
147,17-1-20,SC clears deck for Goa airport construction,"The Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the decks for construction of an international airport at Mopa in Goa by lifting the suspension on environmental clearance (EC) granted for the project, which would be spread over 2,131 acres.

The top court in March last year had suspended the EC granted for the greenfield airport and directed the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) to revisit the decision in light of its impact on the ecology there.

The need for a new airport was buttressed as the passenger traffic at Goa was expected to rise in the upcoming financial years -- 12 million passengers by 2021 to 17.9 million by 2025 -- and the existing airport at Dabolim is a defence establishment which is closed to area traffic between 8.30 am and 1.30 pm daily.

Though Goa is one of the most sought after international tourist destinations in India, international charter flights are not granted parking facilities at night at Dabolim airport due to capacity constraints.

While lifting suspension on EC, bench of justices DY Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta noted assurance tendered on behalf of concessionaire GMR Goa International Airport Limited that it will adopt “zero carbon programme” both in the construction and operational phases of the airport.

“We accept undertaking of concessionaire and issue a direction for compliance,” the bench said, adding, “The suspension on the EC shall accordingly stand lifted.”

The top court appointed the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to oversee compliance with the directions issued by it in the matter and said the “project proponent shall bear the costs, expenses and fees of NEERI”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sc-clears-deck-for--goa-airport-construction.html

The 36-year-old, who became an Indian citizen only last September, is contesting for the post of the sarpanch from Natwara gram panchayat in Rajasthan’s Tonk district.

The elections are on Friday. Her candidature comes in the backdrop of the row over the the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The amendment makes it easier to get citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians who entered India before 2015 following religious persecution in three neighbouring countries.

“I know only this that CAA is good for those who want a better education and life in India,” Nita Kanwar said.

She said she is a Sodha Rajput whose members “cannot marry within their own caste”. That is one reason for many members of the community to migrate to India, mostly Jodhpur.

“I had migrated in 2001 for college education and later on found a perfect match,” Kanwar said. She said she had to fight for three years to receive Indian citizenship and it was last September when the Tonk district administration handed over the papers

“Now, I am contesting for sarpanch from Natwara, a general seat reserved for women candidates. I will work for promoting gender equality, women empowerment and development of villages,” she said.

Nita Kanwar migrated in 2001 and got her BA degree from Sophia College in Ajmer in 2005 and married Punya Pratap Karan in 2011.

149,17-1-20,Balasaheb had lot’s of respect for Indiraji: Aditya gets into damage control mode,"As the Shiv Sena’s relations with the Congress came under strain over its spokesperson Sanjay Raut’s claim that late Indira Gandhi used to meet Underworld don Karim Lala, its leader Aditya Thackeray on Thursday went into a damage control mode saying that his grandfather and party’s founder-chief Bal Thackeray had a lot of respect for the late Prime Minister, while Raut himself clarified that his statement had been “twisted” and “misinterpreted” by a section of the media.

Hours after Raut clarified that he always had huge respect for the Gandhi-Nehru family, especially late Mrs Gandhi, Pandit Nehru and Rajiv Gandhi, Aditya said,

“Raut has already clarified that whatever he said was in a different context. Late Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray had a lot of respect for Indira Gandhi. Hence, no Shiv Sainik will speak ill-about late Mrs Gandhi. Raut’s intentions are clean”.

Earlier, talking to media persons, Raut issued a detailed clarification on the controversy over the remarks made at a public interview of him held in Pune on Wednesday, wherein he had reportedly said that late Mrs Indira Gandhi used to meet Karim Lala at the latter’s residence at Pydhoonie in south Mumbai.

“The kind of respect I have shown towards Gandhi-Nehru family members like Indira Gandhi, Pandit Nehru and Rajiv Gandhi even while in the Opposition, no one has done that. You may have heard or read me earlier in “Saamana”. Whenever there used to be attack on Indira Gandhi, I defended her stand.

Please tell this to those who are putting out tweets on my statement on Indira Gandhi yesterday,” Raut said.

In his elaboration, Raut said: “Now to what I said at the media interview in Pune. At that time, the issue of Mumbai in those days was being discussed. I was explaining the audience as to what kind of atmosphere that prepared in Mumbai (in sixties and seventies). At that time a lot of politicians used to go and meet Karim Lal at his residence. There are a lots of photographs at his residence. The enviornament was totally different at that time,”

“Karim Lala used to be a leader of Phatan community in the entire world. Hailing originally from Afghanistan, he led an organisation called ‘Pakhtun-e-Hind’. He was associated with Khan Abdul, who used to be known as Frontier Gandhi. Leaders used to go and meet him to discuss the Phatan community issues. It was in this capacity of the leader of Pathan community that he met several top leaders including Indira Gandhi,” Raut said.

Raut slammed the media for “twisting and misinterpreting” his remarks about late Mrs Indira Gandhi.

“A section of the media is twisting and misinterpreting about late Mrs Indira Gandhi out of sheer desperation and political interest. But, in my mind, I have always had and will continue to have a lot of respect for Indira Gandhi, Pandit Nehru and Rajiv Gandhi. You should know whenever there used to attack on late Indira Gandhi I would used to be the first to defend her, even when the Congress men remained quiet”.

In Wednesday’s public interview: “There was a time when Dawood Ibrahim, Chhota Shakeel, Sharad Shetty would decide who will be Mumbai’s police commissioner and who will sit in Mantralaya (state secretariat). When Haji Mastan came to Mantralaya, the entire secretariat would come down to see him. Indira Gandhi used to meet Karim Lala in Pydhonie (in south Mumbai).”

There was an outrage with the Congress over Raut’s remarks about Indira Gandhi. Former Union Minister and Congress leader tweeted: Indira ji was a true patriot who never compromised on India’s national security. As former @INCMumbai President, I demand that @rautsanjay61 ji withdraws his ill-informed statement. Political leaders must show restraint before distorting the legacies of deceased Prime Ministers”.

Another Mumbai’s former Congress president Sanjay Nirupam tweeted: “”It would be better if Mr Poet of Shiv Sena continues reciting light-hearted poetry of others to entertain Maharashtra. If he propagates against former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, he will have to repent”

Meanwhile, Mumbai’s late underworld don Haji Mastan’s adopted son Sundar Shekhar said in a television interview: “Sanjay Raut (Shiv Sena leader) is right. Indira Gandhi used to meet him (Karim Lala). Many other leaders also used to visit. Haji Mastan was a businessman. Balasaheb Thackeray too was a good friend of Haji Mastan”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/balasaheb-had-lot---s-of-respect-for-indiraji--aditya-gets-into-damage-control-mode.html

“Amit Shah says all is normal in Kashmir. If so, why send 36 propagandists to Kashmir? Why not allow non-propagandists to go and understand the situation prevailing there?” tweeted senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal.

A group of Union ministers will visit Jammu and Kashmir later this month to spread awareness about the positive impact of abrogation of Article 370 provisions and the development measures taken by the government for the region.

The schedule for the visit of the ministers to the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir is likely to be finalised at a meeting of the Union Council of Ministers on Friday.

Thirty-six Union ministers will visit different districts in both the divisions of the Union Territory starting from January 18 to January 24 and the Home Ministry is coordinating it.

“36 Ministers running around J&K in 6 days is a sign of Panic not normalcy. Abrogating Article 370 was a blunder & no quick fixes will work Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall;

All the king’s horses and all the king’s men Couldn’t put Humpty together again,” tweeted Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari.

This will be the second round of visit by the Union ministers to Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of the special status of the erstwhile state on August 5.

155,17-1-20,"Verbal spat between Bedi, Narayanasamy reaches next level","The Pongal festivities in the union territory of Puducherry vitiated by Thursday as Chief Minister V Narayanasamy challenged Kiran Bedi, the lieutenant Governor to substantiate her allegations that the former and his family members were engaged in land grabbing.

“I challenge Kiran Bedi. If me or any of my family members are proved guilty in any land grabbing case, Ill resign. But will Kiran Bedi quit if its not proved? She is wrongly trying to malign me . She no longer deserves to remain as lieutenant governor,” Narayanasamy said while addressing a Press meeting at Puducherry on Thursday.

What upset the Chief Minister was a social media posting by Bedi about a complaint she received from one of the MLAs who had called on her recently.

The legislator told the Lieutenant Governor that he was in possession of documents which proved that the Chief Minister and his family members were engaged in land grabbing.

Bedi, who is having a running battle with the chief minister told the law maker that he was free to approach the concerned authorities and file complaints against those accused in land grabbing.

The relation between the Lieutenant Governor and the Chief Minister of the union territory is at its lowest ebb as the latter had submitted a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind during his visit to Puducherry asking for recalling Bedi.

Narayanasamy was upset over Kiran Bedi’s refusal to the former’s proposal to open casinos in the former French colony for boosting the economy of Puducherry. In a statement Narayanasamy alleged that the lieutenant governor was a “woman without conscience” and alleged that she was adopting a revengeful attitude against his Government.

The new year eve saw Bedi dispatching a strongly worded rejoinder to Narayanasamy and she shared the letter with the media.

She said the Chief Minister had been “Calling me and the Constitutional office of the Lt Governor all kinds of derogatory names and heaping unfounded accusations over a considerable period.”

Particularly over the last few days the Chief Minister “has crossed the line of decorum, dignity and decency,” she said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/verbal-spat-between-bedi--narayanasamy-reaches-next-level.html

The Indian Air Force (IAF) also tweeted about the rescue operation which it carried out with Ladakh’s newly-formed civil administration, nearby Army units and local disaster relief teams.

“IAF helicopters successfully airlifted nine foreign nationals (two French & seven Chinese) with other stranded trekkers on Thursday afternoon. An unwell woman passenger from Ladakh was provided required medical care on ground & during flight by IAF medical personnel,” the IAF tweeted.

The IAF in a statement said, its helicopters have helped rescue 107 individuals during the last two days.

“The rescued trekkers include one man and one woman from France, and four men and three women from China, who as per information were rescued from Padum. The IAF will continue the ongoing rescue operation till all the stranded trekkers, guides and porters are evacuated and brought to safety,” it said.

The trekkers, including foreign nationals and almost an equal number of local guides and porters, were part of the ongoing ‘Chadar Trek’, and got stranded when some portions of the frozen Zanskar River melted, the IAF said.

“The melting caused the flow of the water to become too strong, for the trekkers to continue across the river on foot. The stranded trekkers managed to move to Niraq, a small camp site upstream and were awaiting to be rescued,” it said.

To carry out the rescue operation by helicopters, a makeshift helipad was prepared along the river bank. Advanced Light Helicopters were immediately pressed into action from Air Force Station Leh, the IAF said.

To provide medical facilities to the stranded trekkers a medical officer and a medical assistant were also flown from Air Force Station Leh to Niraq.

158,17-1-20,BJP accuses Cong of protecting those involved in 1984 anti-Sikh riots,"Citing the SIT report, the BJP on Thursday accused the Congress of protecting those involved in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and alleged it never showed interest in providing justice to the victims with its leaders even “justifying” the violence against the community.

BJP leader and Union minister Prakash Javadekar said the Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by retired Delhi High Court judge Justice SN Dhingra has brought to fore the truth and said what happened in 1984 was not just riots but the “worst kind of genocide” against Sikhs.

The Modi government, he asserted, stands for giving justice to Sikhs and has already told court that it will act on the SIT’s recommendations.

Javadekar said Congress leaders like the then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and more recently, Sam Pitroda “justified” the violence with their comments. A Congress leader named as accused by victims has become chief minister, he said in an apparent reference to Madhya Pradesh CM Kamal Nath.

However, Kamal Nath has always denied his involvement and had received a clean chit in investigations carried out earlier.

The SIT report shows that the hands of the Congress are with “murderers”, the BJP leader said, noting that it points out that one FIR was registered to probe over 500 cases of arson and violence in places like Sultanpur, leading to delay in probe and acquittal of accused.

“The Congress never took any interest in the probe. In fact, it did exact opposite and protected accused,” he said, adding that over 3000 Sikhs were burned alive in a matter of days in the national Capital following the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-accuses-cong-of-protecting-those-involved-in-1984-anti-sikh-riots.html

The art exhibition exhibits unique styles, use of material and dimensions of creative thought that take the viewer to the class of the familiar masters with the freshness of the promising and emerging artists.

Masters like Anil Tato paints geometric forms to bring out expression and moods, while Shailesh Sanghvi’s paper collages on acrylics depict landscape of hills and river.

Dr Suryasnata Mohanty one of the artists termed her experience of participating in this show as “fascinating and inspiring”. “It thrills the artist and brings in an aesthetic fulfilment because hitherto unexposed eyes are drawn to the works while passing by and remain glued to the work, something established galleries too do not get to witness,” Mohanty said.

Mohanty exhibits her creativity with images of different forms of temples that have etheral leading steps to bring out the spiritual glory. Bold application of colours and symbolic expression takes the viewer to the infinite world of faith and bliss of almighty, a journey outward and within in Dr Suryasnata’s works Her works titled ‘Colours of Faith’, ‘Bliss’, ‘The House of Shiva’, ‘The Calling Bell’ and ‘Swapna Drishti’.

161,17-1-20,Policy push for environment in MP,"Amid global efforts to arrest the scourge of climate change, Chief Minister Kamal Nath is leaving no stone unturned to reduce the carbon footprint in Madhya Pradesh.

Invigorating policy with a vision for the future, the state government, under Kamal Nath, has launched a raft of schemes and measures to maintain and nurture the fragile ecological balance in this biodiverse region.

Leading from the front the state government has banned single use plastics at public functions and ceremonies, and set a target to totally phase out this disposable packaging material by the year 2022.

Single use plastics are known to cause huge damage to the environment as they break down into microplastics and take thousands of years to decompose. Besides contaminating soil and water, disposable plastics further impact animal and avian life.

In a bid to curtail pollution caused by industries using furnace oil, the new policy makes it mandatory for such units to have an effective control over sulphur dioxide emissions before earning requisite permissions for use of the fuel.

Sulphur dioxide is a major air and water pollutant known to pose health risks to all forms of life. In humans, the pollutant causes various respiratory disorders. Assessment of water quality of River Narmada is currently underway. Water from the river is being analysed along a 50-point index charted for the purpose.

The state government is also analyzing water quality of rivers along the inter-state borders and water intake points.

Putting in place a robust action plan for 22 polluted river stretches in the state, the Kamal Nath Government has constituted a river rejuvenation committee to oversee the restoration of water quality in these areas.

Implementation, steering and monitoring committees have been set up to ensure an improvement in ambient air quality in the six non attainment cities in the state.

Bio-monitoring of River Chambal is also being conducted simultaneously; the exercise aims to explore the various causes leading to the contamination of water in the river.

The unrelenting efforts recently came in for national acclaim when the Environment Planning and Coordination Organisation (EPCO) of the State Department of Environment was awarded the first prize of the National Water Mission for excellence in conducting the Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment Study in the state. EPCO was further adjudged the winner for the ‘Leadership in Urban Climate Action’ category under the Earth Care Award for conservation of Traditional water structures in Indore City.

Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS) have been established in five major cities and several districts in the state. 52 district headquarters have also been provided with apparatus to map ambient air quality.

In a bid to heighten awareness and transparency, the state government provides accurate air, water and industrial pollution statistics to citizens through its website and a mobile application developed for the purpose.

Bringing in innovation, arrangements have been made for disposal of recyclable plastic waste in cement kilns. The move will result in cost saving benefits as it helps save huge amounts of coal. The state government expects to dispose at least 22710 metric tones of plastic waste through this method.

The state government has also rolled out new provisions for monitoring the tracking and disposal of industrial waste, hazardous waste and e-waste.

A well-equipped microbiology laboratory has been established in the state capital to study the efficacy of various pollution control schemes.

Speaking of the developments, activists say robust and timely pollution control measures are imperative to not just human health but also the large forest cover in the state which is home to an astounding array of flora and fauna, animal and avian life.

The Forest Survey of India (FSI) in its recently published India State of Forest Report (ISFR) recorded an increase in the total forest cover in Madhya Pradesh. The current forest expanse stands at 77,482.49 sq km or 25.14 percent of the total land area in the state while the previous report had measured it at 77,414 sq km or 25.11 percent. As per the report Madhya Pradesh has the largest area-wise forest cover in the country.

Enthused by the results, environmentalists say that the increase in forest cover is a result of timely intervention and sustained efforts. They underline the need for a fluid and comprehensive environment policy which keeps up with the change in climate.

As per the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) Madhya Pradesh is among the leading states in the country for revising the State Action Plan on Climate Change. Lauding the vision of Chief Minister Kamal Nath, the activists say that the inclusive policy and schemes reflect a deep understanding of the subject which otherwise tends to focus exclusively on urban or household pollution.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/policy-push-for-environment-in-mp.html

More competition and private investment is the need of the hour, he said, adding that the role of private sector in Indian agriculture sector has to come in a big way.

“India’s farm sector growth for the current fiscal is expected to remain higher at 3.1 per cent,” Chand said while addressing an industry body Assocham event here.

The overall farm sector growth stood at 2.9 per cent in the 2018-19 fiscal. It was 2 per cent and 2.1 per cent in the first and second quarter of the 2019-20, respectively.

Emphasising on private investment, Chand said the face of agriculture from traditional to modern, and movement of agriculture from present stage to higher evolution will not happen without active involvement of private sector.

“Unless we increase corporate sector’s investment and involve them from seed and continuing it up to sale, it would be difficult to cause a breakthrough in growth of agriculture and doubling farmers’ income,” he said in a statement.

Chand also said that the NITI Aayog was trying to convince the Central government to make up its mind in drafting a Model Land Lease Act.

With regard to the implementation of the model Agriculture Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act and contract farming law, he said, “I think we need to persuade the states, we are already trying to do it that those two acts are adopted by the states”.

In its Budget proposals to the Finance Ministry, the industry body has also demanded that the government recognise mutual funds (MFs) as specified long-term assets, qualifying for Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG), as well as bring ULIPs of life insurance companies and equity MF schemes on par.

The mutual fund body has also asked for dividend distribution tax (DDT) exemption for EPFO, NPS and insurance companies investing in MF schemes and pass-through status for income tax purpose to those Category III AIFs which make 65 per cent investments in listed equities.

“Amfi’s suggestions have been in the Budget proposal list for a few years. We are hoping this time our long-pending submissions get addressed, which would help take the Indian MF industry not only to the next level of growth but also help in contributing to making economy stronger, especially with deepening of bond market, making long term availability of funds for infrastructure growth, and reducing the fiscal deficit by shifting investments from pure gold to gold ETFs,” Amfi Chief Executive NS Venkatesh said.

Some of the proposals are also aimed at bringing parity with comparable investment avenues and making mutual funds more retail investor friendly, he added.

Ghosh has been famous for courting controversies with his notorious statements. He was recently slammed by the opposition and also his party colleague and Union Minister Babul Supriyo for his controversial remark that the BJP had shot the agitators protesting against Citizenship Amendment Act like dogs in Assam and Uttar Pradesh.

“We are proud to work under a leader like Dilip Da who is famous for his no-nonsense words. He always speaks the truth and talks like a brave person.

168,17-1-20,Prakash Ambedkar Aghadi calls ‘Maha bandh’ on Jan 24,"The Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) on Thursday stepped up its offensive against the Narendra Modi Government over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register for Citizens (NRC) and current economic crisis, by calling a “Maharashtra bandh” on January 24.

A month it organised a massive rqlly of dalits in Mumbai, the VBA prepared itself for one more show down with the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre.

Talking to mediapersons after the leaders of VBA and other organisations supporting it, veteran Dalit leader and Aghadi president Prakash Ambedkar said: “As many 35 organisations are supporting our Maharashtra bandh on January 24. We have called the bandh among other things to condemn CAA, NRC and the oppressive ways of the Modi government”.

“There is a lot of anger against CAA and NRC among the people in the country. The Government is trying to implement the CAA and other laws through intimidation. On the other hand, the Government has lost control over economy. The Government is not able to raise adequate revenues because of a faulty GST, demonetisation and an atmosphere of mistrust. The country is heading towards bankruptcy,” Ambedkar said.

“We are holding the Modi government totally responsible for the situation in the country. We have called this bandh to condemn the Modi G overnment for its mis-governance. We request all political parties and organisations to join the bandh on January 24,” the VBA chief said.

It may be recalled that VBA had on December 26 organised a massive rally of his Dalits and Adivasis at Dadar in north-central Mumbai to oppose CAA and NRC.

At that rally, Amedkar had charged that the RSS and BJP-led government had hatched a “conspiracy” to create unrest in the country through CAA and NRC.

During his speech, he had contended that the CAA and NRC were not only against Muslims but they were also against 40 per of the Hindus in the country.

Ambedkar had demanded to know from Prime Minister Narendra Modi if he would seek the resignation of or change the portfolio of Union Home Minister Amit Shah for making a statement in Parliament for making a statement that NRC would be implemented across the country.

Singling out the RSS and ruling BJP for a vicious attack on the current unrest in the country, Ambedkar had said: “If someone has hatched a conspiracy to trigger unrest in the country over CAA, NRC and National Population Register (NPR), it is no one else other than the RSS and BJP-led government”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/prakash-ambedkar-aghadi-calls----maha-bandh----on-jan-24.html
169,17-1-20,Ready to join probe: ABVP member,"ABVP member Komal Sharma, who has been called for questioning by the Delhi Police in connection with the January 5 violence on the JNU campus here, wrote to the head of the investigation team, saying she was ready to join the probe.

“It is being claimed in the media and social media that I am absconding, which is false, so I write to you to join the investigation,” she said in a letter to DSP (Crime) Joy Tirkey.

“I can join in for questioning either at the office of the National Commission for Women or at a place and time appropriate to you, which may be communicated to me through this e-mail,” she said, adding that her family was concerned about her security.

She said her name with photos has been circulated on social media, “which made things very tough” for her .

“I started receiving threat calls on my number because of which I have switched off my number. My social media accounts were also filled with abuses and threats and so I have deactivated those as well,” she said in the e-mail. Sharma, who is a student of Delhi University’s Daulat Ram College, said a TV channel claimed that she was involved in the violence and used “all forums to defame her”, subjecting her to “mental violence”.

Meanwhile, the RSS-affiliate Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad said the “smear campaign” against them by some media houses is unfortunate and they have been co-operating with the special investigation team (SIT).

Two ABVP members appeared before the SIT on Thursday. Sidharth Yadav, state secretary, ABVP Delhi, alleged, “The misinformation being spread by some media houses and members of the press with respect to the ongoing investigation in the JNU violence case is unfortunate. These media houses have even been tweaking the statements of the

Delhi Police to propagate the false narrative that the ABVP has not been cooperating with the SIT.”

He claimed that the allegation against Komal Sharma that she was the masked girl involved in the JNU violence are baseless as police had not said “anything to this effect”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ready-to-join-probe--abvp-member.html

“The JNUSU, keeping in mind the opinion of various centre level GBMs (general body meetings), is expediting an immediate legal challenge to the IHA manual seeking interim relief. Therefore, we request the student community, especially those who have not registered, to continue to boycott the registration process in the light of such a move.

“The JNUSU will undertake all manner and means of struggle to see to it that the students facing proctorial enquiries and punitive actions like suspension/eviction are not victimised and their registration is completed on a priority basis,” the statement said.

In the meeting, the student body decided to intensify it’’s movement for the “removal” of M. Jagadesh Kumar as the Vice Chancellor of JNU.

It said that JNUSU will take up various programmes and campaigns in support of public education and against the Violence that JNU has had to face. Over 4,000 registrations have been done in JNU for the new semester so far, said a source.

171,17-1-20,Cong-DMK alliance should continue in interest of TN people: Thirunavukkarasar,"As fissures remained in the Congress-DMK alliance in Tamil Nadu, former AICC secretary S Thirunavukkarasar wanted the tie-up to continue in the interests of people of the state and both the parties.

Talking to PTI over phone on Thursday, he said the two parties should forget critical statements and counter-statements made by their leaders as “bad experience” and move on. The trouble in the alliance started when Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president KS Alagiri and Congress legislature party leader KR Ramasamy charged the DMK leadership of violating the “coalition dharma” in the distribution of seats for the just concluded rural local bodies election.

The DMK took objection to this and boycotted an all-party meeting convened by Congress president Sonia Gandhi in Delhi on Monday.

DMK leader Durai Murugan even said that his party was least bothered if the Congress left the alliance. Thirunavukkarasar, who is also a former TNCC president, said he was hopeful that the alliance would continue and pointed out that there was no difference of opinion between Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi with DMK president MK Stalin.

“This alliance had proved its strength by winning 38 out of 39 Lok Sabha seats during last year’s poll. Assembly poll in TN is also not far. Both the parties should forget their differences and move on in unity,” he said. The Congress leader, a Lok Sabha member from Tiruchi in TN, added that the parties should continue to work hand-in-hand and devise strategies to oppose the ideologies and policies of the AIADMK-BJP alliance. “Everything can be resolved if the leaders of both the parties sit together and talk,” he said.

The ruling AIADMK-BJP alliance is also facing strain with former union minister and BJP leader Pon Radhakrishnan claiming that Tamil Nadu had become a “den” of terrorists and the state government was doing nothing to finish off terrorism.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cong-dmk-alliance-should-continue-in-interest-of-tn-people--thirunavukkarasar.html

In reply to a question that the government will return it to him if he won’t sign, Khan shot back, “who said so, there is nothing like that.”

Khan of late has been putting his foot down and has taken a tough position in the manner the Pinarayi Vijayan government has been taking positions on the Citizenship Amendment Act.

He also attacked the Vijayan government for challenging the CAA in the Supreme Court.

“There is a legal maxim, neither me nor anyone is above the law. Clearly I am not against anyone approaching the judiciary.

177,17-1-20,No SC relief for telcos on Rs 1.47L cr dues,"The Supreme Courton Thursday dismissed review petitions of top telecom firms including Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea seeking review of its earlier order asking them to pay Rs 1.47 lakh crore in past statutory dues by January 23 saying it did not find any “justifiable reason” to entertain them.

The apex court had on October 24 ruled that the statutory dues need to be calculated by including non-telecom revenues in what is known as adjusted gross revenues (AGR) of telcos.

A Bench comprising Justices Arun Mishra, SA Nazeer and MR Shah in-chamber hearing did not find merit in the review plea and dismissed it.

The telecom companies had sought an open court hearing on their review petition but the Supreme Court decided to stick to its convention of doing an in-chamber hearing.

“Applications for hearing in open Court/oral hearing are rejected. Having perused the Review Petitions and the connected papers with meticulous care, we do not find any justifiable reason to entertain the review petitions. The Review Petitions are, accordingly, dismissed,” the bench said.

The apex court had on October 24 last year upheld the AGR definition formulated by the DoT and termed as “frivolous” the nature of objections raised by telecom service providers.

Bharti Airtel, in its plea, had sought review of the directions on aspects of levy of interest, penalty and interest on penalty relating to AGR.

Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had told Parliament in November that Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and other telecom companies owe the Government as much as Rs 1.47 lakh crore in past statutory dues.

He had added that there is no proposal at present to waive interest and penalties on such dues.

In replies to separate questions in the Lok Sabha, Prasad had said telecom companies owe the government Rs 92,642 crore in unpaid licence fee, and another Rs 55,054 crore in outstanding spectrum usage charges.

In an affidavit filed earlier in the top court, the DoT said Airtel owed Rs 21,682.13 crore as licence fee to the government and dues from Vodafone totalled Rs 19,823.71 crore, while Reliance Communications owed Rs 16,456.47 crore. BSNL owed Rs 2,098.72 crore, and MTNL Rs 2,537.48 crore.

Holding that interest and penalty have rightly been levied on the telecom companies, the apex court had made it clear that there would be no further litigation on the issue and it would fix a time-frame for calculation and payment of dues by the telecom companies.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-sc-relief-for-telcos-on-rs-1-47l-cr-dues-2020-01-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/no-sc-relief-for-telcos-on-rs-1-47l-cr-dues.html

A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde took note of the submissions of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Enforcement Directorate, that he was assailing the high court order to the extent of allowing the release of two promoters from the prison and this needed to be stayed.

185,17-1-20,Amazon not doing favour to India by investing a billion dollars: Goyal,"A day after the world’s richest person Jeff Bezos announced fresh $1 billion investment in India, Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday said his firm Amazon was not doing a favour to the country by the investments and questioned how the online retailing major could incur such “big” losses but for its predatory pricing.

Goyal, who has not yet given Bezos an audience, said e-commerce companies have to follow Indian rules in letter and spirit and not find loopholes to make a back-door entry into multi-brand retail segment.

India does not allow foreign investment beyond 49 per cent in multi-brand retailing and has not yet approved any application of overseas retailers.

“They (Amazon) may have put in a billion dollars but if they make a loss of a billion dollars every year, then jolly well will have to finance that billion dollar. So, it is not as if they are doing a favour to India when they invest a billion dollars,” he said at the Raisina Dialogue here.

The USD 1 billion investment by Amazon.Com to help bring small and medium businesses online is on the top of $5.5 billion funding it had previously announced.

The minister wondered why an e-commerce market place model, where a firm provides an IT platform for buyers and sellers, incurring huge losses adding that it needs to be looked upon.

“They are investing money over the last few years also in warehousing and certain other activities, which is welcome and good. But if they are bringing in money largely to finance losses and those losses in an e-commerce market place model,” Goyal said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/amazon-not-doing-favour-to-india-by-investing-a-billion-dollars--goyal.html
186,17-1-20,"Phase-1 trade deal with US ‘addressed’ mutual concerns, ‘good’ for both sides: China","China on Thursday said the phase-1 trade deal with the US “considerably addressed” mutual concerns and is “good” for both the countries, as the world’s two largest economies move forward to end their bitter two-year tariff war that has ruptured supply chains, rattled markets and contributed to a global slowdown.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier and top trade negotiator Liu He signed the phase-1 of the trade deal at a special ceremony at the White House, raising hopes of improvement of trade ties between the two nations hit by the tit-for-tat tariff hikes of nearly half-a-trillion dollars worth of products.

Trump, however, refused to roll back the massive tariff imposed on import of Chinese goods and said he will roll back the tariffs only if the second phase of the trade deal is signed.

The trade deal, considered as major political and diplomatic victory for President Trump, came on a day when the House voted to sent his impeachment trial to the Senate.

Trump, who has used tariff as a leverage in trade talks with major economic powers of the world, mainly China, asserted that he will continue with his policies on tariffs. He also said that there will be no phase 3.

Briefing the Chinese media after signing the deal, Liu said the phase-1 trade agreement has “considerably addressed the concerns” of both sides.

It has both economic and political significance with bearing on world peace and prosperity, state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Liu as saying.

The deal has injected positive energy into the stability and development of the world economy, he said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/phase-1-trade-deal-with-us----addressed----mutual-concerns-----good----for-both-sides--china.html

188,17-1-20,Trump impeachment: US House sends historic case to Senate,"The US House of Representatives passed a resolution and submitted the articles of impeachment against Donald Trump to the Senate for a historic trial to remove him from office, a move described by the unfazed President as “another con job” by the Opposition Democrats.

The House, controlled by the Democratic Party on Wednesday voted to send articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate, in a major development to remove him from office for his alleged abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

In a 228-193 vote, which was mainly on party lines, the House appointed seven impeachment managers who will argue the Democrats’ case for removing Trump from the office of the US President.

The managers were named by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

“We are here today to cross a very important threshold in American history,” Pelosi said, addressing the House before the vote.

“This is what an impeachment is about,” she said earlier, announcing the seven-member prosecution team led by Congressman Adam Schiff, chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

“So sad, so tragic for our country, that the actions taken by the president to undermine our national security, to violate his oath of office and to jeopardize the security of our elections, has taken us to this place,” Pelosi remarked, before using several ceremonial pens to sign the articles.

While Pelosi’s press conference was in progress, Trump weighed in on Twitter: “Here we go again, another Con Job by the Do Nothing Democrats. All of this work was supposed to be done by the House, not the Senate!”

The 435-member House, where Democrats enjoy a majority, on December 18 charged Trump with “high crimes and misdemeanors” and impeached him for pressuring Ukraine to investigate former US Vice President Joe Biden, a potential Democratic rival for the current president in the 2020 elections.

190,17-1-20,Finding the right value,"Thousands of crafters worldwide are creating goods in a bid to help the wildlife caught in the Australian fires. But will they be judiciously used?

Kyla Gill had never so much as touched a sewing machine or picked up a crochet hook two weeks ago. Now, she’s hooked on crafting for critters 10,000 miles (16,000 km) away, to the point of temporarily putting aside her floor refinishing business in Pittsburgh. “I do hard labour so I’m rough with my hands. Sewing, knitting — that’s just completely out of my realm,” she said and added, “But to go to work the next day knowing that there are animals and people suffering? I just pretty much wiped my schedule clean and put my projects on hold.”

Hoping to help the wildlife harmed in the Australian wildfires, thousands of crafters worldwide are churning out swaddling wraps for bats, hanging enclosures for kangaroos, and cozy pouches for wallabies and other animals. But confusion abounds about whether the items actually are needed or will be used.

The Animal Rescue Craft Guild, based in Australia, and associated groups have told their members to pause work while they take stock of donated items. And some wildlife organisations say what they need most is money, not handmade goods, which can help pay for cages, medical supplies, specialised animal feed and other critical items, said Megan Davidson, CEO of Wildlife Victoria.

“While we have been overwhelmed by the kindness of people wanting to donate items for wildlife, physical donations of clothes, knitted items and food are very difficult for relief agencies to sort through, distribute and store — especially during peak periods like the current bushfire crisis,” she said. “It is so lovely that people want to help. The most practical way to help right now is by a direct donation.”

The unprecedentedly fierce fires in southeast Australia have claimed the lives of at least 28 people since September, destroyed more than 2,600 homes, mostly in New South Wales state. The area burned is larger than the US state of Indiana. Half of the money will go to front-line responder groups, with the other $25 million funding an advisory panel to analyse affected areas and plan for long-term habitat restoration.

A donator, Anna Key gathered together a bunch of sewing, knitting and crochet patterns approved by wildlife rescue groups and posted them on social media, due to which multiple Facebook groups popped up to collect donations.

Key, who lives in Yamba in New South Wales, called the response to what she’s dubbed the #globalcraftmovement overwhelming but said participants should not be discouraged. “Rescuing our animals is a marathon, not a sprint,” she said.

In Lee, New Hampshire, 10-year-old Gibson Griffith organised an event at his church to sew dozens of bed liners for crates and cages. About 15 people donated fabric and more than a dozen showed up to help make the liners.

In Haverhill, Massachusetts, Kimberly McCullough had cut fabric for about 50 pouches and was about to start sewing when the confusion erupted.

McCullough has reached out to local animal shelters to see if they could use the items. “It really opened my eyes to ways crafters can help other animal rescue organisations,” she said. “So, it felt better to realise. I cut all this stuff out and maybe it’s not going to make it to Australia, but it might just make it to the Boston Animal Rescue League.”

Similarly, Gill has no regrets about her efforts, which included staying up until 2 am one night, getting to the fabric store before it opened the next morning, sewing more than 60 pouches with her partner and learning how to crochet bird nests. They’ve become online friends with a woman in Australia, who has invited them to stay with her next year. “It’s uplifting for her, and it made her feel better to see the humanity,” she said. “It makes me cry. It really touches me.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/finding-the-right-value-2020-01-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/finding-the-right-value.html

192,17-1-20,An ode to tranquility,"Art exhibition, Arth - Tribute to Shades of India, features various traditional and contemporary artists whose works showcase the ghats of Varanasi, bring forth the nostalgia of Kolkata and the rare artform, pyrography. By Sakshi Sharma

Yellow and blue trams amid a vintage background, black and white trees and grey railway lines, a faded red abstract work, the meaning of which one fails to figure out in the first glance, ghats of Varanasi and visuals of nature and wildlife... these are some of the landscapes brought to life on various canvasses. The series, Arth - Tribute to Shades of India, clearly holds up our cultural mosaic at a time it is most under threat.

The exhibition features many traditional and contemporary artists showcasing different artforms made through diverse media. Artist Arpan Bhowmik, who is known for his Monochrome Kolkata series, highlights a few aspects of the city he grew up in via A Journey Through Kolkata. “Through this, I want to tell people about the nostalgia I feel for Kolkata. Its yellow taxis, trams, hand rickshaw lend a special identity to the city. So my paintings usually have a black and white background and these elements are coloured so that they remain the focal point,” says he.

He uses the African canvas for most of his works to use the water colour wash technique. His paintings have a water splash effect which makes the scenery look like a photograph of a city taken right after a rain shower. However, it is an acrylic which he has developed using the same technique in the past 20 years which lends it such a filter. He describes it as a “difficult artform but a serdious medium” that lasts for over 100 years.

Next in line is Chennai-based contemporary Indian artist, A Viswam. Usually based on hues of yellow, burning red, cool green, deep blue and quiet grey, Viswam’s paintings are either monochromes or come out in vibrant combinations. He says, “I work on unidentified elements of time and space through different combination of colours. The use of monochrome and colour varies with want I want to display. For instance, if I want to depict a morning scene, it has to be filled with colours, while for evening, I would use black and white.”

There’s hardly any art exhibition in the South where the national award-winning artist hasn’t been invited. But in North, he still has a long way to go to become a recognised face. And Arth... is also an attempt to make people aware about such artists and talent that is present across our country, adds he.

Next up, artist Pritam Mehta’s medium of art is wood. This is an “unusual and rare” art form in India as the artist believes he hasn’t come across anyone else doing it. It’s followed in some Western countries. “Painting or colours have no role to play in pyrography since it’s the fire flames which do the wonder here. They are used to create different pieces of art. There’s a pen with a tungsten metal tip, which you can connect to a small machine and plug in to get the electric current. It then gets heated up, after which one can start creating artworks. There’s also a small temperature control button on the machine,” says the artist.

Through pyrography, Mehta creates different works of animals, birds and leaves. The artist also tries his hands on coffee table logs, wall hangings and sandooks. It is the wildlife and nature mostly that appeals him. “I have recently started making portraits of human beings too. We don’t use any colour in this but just control the temperature and create images,” he adds.

Talking about the difficulties of such an artform, he tells us that the biggest challenge of painting with fire is “guiding the flame” and trying to make it leave the kind of trace you want. He adds, “The second biggest challenge is preservation of the work. The soot is very fragile and sensitive to touch. I’m always holding my breath when working with a piece because anything that touches the surface will leave a trace. So it really demands a lot from you, including both your patience and attention at the same time.”

Artist Sandeep Chhatraband, who is also a part of the exhibition, portrays the ghats of Varanasi through water colours and acrylics on canvas, which he sees as “unique, tranquil and full of energy.”

193,17-1-20,Delhi-6 on my plate,"Salaam-e-Dilli brings the traditional flavours of Old Delhi to your candle-lit tables at Le Meridien, Gurugram, says Shambhavi Suri

Old Delhi has captured the imagination of food lovers for centuries. The best time to experience the wide variety of food that it has to offer is during the winters when the warmth of the sun, peeping from the winding lanes of Delhi-6, reaches you. It is only then one can enjoy a hot and authentic Indian meal, dripping with ghee. #ComfortFood.

Bringing this experience outside of Delhi-6, Le Meridien, Gurugram, has introduced its first pop-up restaurant, Salaam-e-Dilli. In an open area, its ambience of a lavish but limited seating looks warm and welcoming. The lanterns and candlesticks seem romantic and exclusive, as though making promises to the customers of a memorable evening. And to make the bitterly cold weather a tad bit cosy and bearable, tall patio heaters are provided near each table. “The idea of going to Old Delhi during peak winters to enjoy the widespread Mughlai cuisine, so that the food doesn’t make one sweat but warm, is what inspired us to have an outdoor restaurant,” says chef Talat Mehmood Khan.

With the aroma of the tandoor in the air and the thought of kebabs on my mind, the first two plates arrive. The two kebabs — Chicken gilafi and Gosht seekh — are brought in a rustic-coloured plate with different oils laying around it and served with some finely-chopped onion and green coriander chutney. After my first bite of the chicken gilafi, I realise the kebab is packed with spices. Well, it would be fair to call the dish a paradise of flavours. Though sharpness of the green chilli is quite evident in the kebab, the richness of the ghee aptly balances the level of spiciness, leaving behind a subtle heat on the palate. If the spices are too much to handle, a dip in the coriander chutney adds a freshness to the seekh, bringing the spice quotient down. While the Chicken gilafi is punched with spices, the Gosht (mutton) seekh kebab goes milder. It made me wonder if anyone has ever had a Gosht seekh like this one before. The kebab melts in your mouth, the spices are well balanced and the fattiness from the mutton and the rich ghee that the kebab is poured with adds to the flavour. The charred smell from the tandoor is well defined, leaving a smoky yet buttery aftertaste, which makes you drool for more. This kebab is the definition for soul food.

Next up are Purani Dilli Murgh tikka and the Malai paneer seekh, served with chopped onions and green coriander chutney. My first thought is that the tikka was marinated in a spicy red paste — different from my idea of it as an ardent lover of the dish. This tikka has a creamier marination, which seems like a cross between a chicken tikka and a murghmalai tikka. As I dig my fork into it, it quickly falls off the bone. However, one bite of it, I realise that it’s a creamy heaven. Its aftertaste is buttery and has some garlic flavour in it. It is for kebabs like these that food lovers from around the world fall in love with what Old Delhi has to offer. Well, this dish certainly does the place’s speciality credo justice. The Malai paneer seekh, I feel, came to me as the right way to end the starters. The cheesy texture of the paneer and the doughy-ness of the white flour (maida) — which has been used as the binder of the kebab — cleanses all the spices off my palate.

Now, the main course makes its way. I refuse to agree that there could be a better subsitute of Khameeri rotis to go with the traditional Mutton nihari. The nihari is served in a matka (earthen pot) and as I lift its lid, the aroma of fried onion and ginger captivate my senses. The dish is garnished with finely-sliced ginger and green chillies that act as major flavour enhancers. The mutton is so tender, it melts in my mouth at once. The rich flavour of the bone marrow is packed in the gravy of the nihari. And the fried onion adds a rustic flavour to it. And as always, the ghee reduces the heat of the chillies, leaving a mesmerising flavour on my tastebuds. The dish, cooked to perfection, represents what the culinary wizards of Old Delhi are famous for — bringing the heartiest food that leaves you in awe of it.

A whiff of cardamom comes through and before I realise, the Gosht biryani is served. The colour of the rice is saffron and the fragrance of the aromatics in the biryani is breathtaking. The mutton, like the previous one, falls off the bone and has the flavour of the spices infused in it. Every grain of this biryani has the flavour of the khade masale (a combination of the essential whole Indian spices) — star anise, cinnamon sticks and cardamom — used to prepare the dish. Cooking a biryani with such delicacy and perfection is truly an art.

Even though I cannot stop savouring the biryani, to end the evening on a sweet note, Delhi-6’s famous dessert, Shahi tukda is served. Doing justice to its name, it is royal and decadent. Toasts, dipped in sugar syrup, are layered with rabri and pistachios, and are served hot. This is an all-time classic and a speciality of Old Delhi. Certainly, the perfect way to end my evening too, making me realise that just as Old Delhi ensures that nobody will go home without a taste on their lips that one would remember for the rest of their life, Salaam-e-Dilli has been quite successful in replicating the experience.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/delhi-6-on-my-plate-2020-01-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/delhi-6-on-my-plate.html
194,17-1-20,Bake it till you make it,"The perfect baked potato begins with russets

A fluffy baked potato is a glorious thing, but too often you slice into the potato and it is shiny and waxy, not light and creamy in texture.

Baking a potato is the easiest thing in the world, right? Then why are so many potatoes lacking in texture and flavour?

First, for the traditional baked potato that is going to be loaded with toppings, you must buy a Russet potato. Russets have a thicker skin and a beautiful starchy, snowy — almost meaty — interior that soaks up all your butter, cheese and sour cream. I love making smashed potatoes with red new potatoes or baby Yukon gold potatoes, but only a Russet will do for a “baked potato.”

For my latest cookbook, Steak and Cake, I tested several popular ways of baking potatoes. I have friends who swear by wrapping the potato in foil before baking. I have always baked the potato without the foil but I tried both ways. I baked them at 350 degrees Fahrenheit and at 400 degrees too. The potatoes took a bit longer to bake at 350 but they were fluffier, and had a better crust and interior texture. Generally, when you cook anything at a higher temperature, the outside gets done before the inside. That means you risk an overdone exterior by the time the interior is cooked through. Potatoes are no exception. That’s why I prefer a lower temperature. But if you like to bake your potatoes at a higher temp, do so. It is all about what works.

The potato wrapped in foil was waxy and had a hard texture even when fully cooked. The foil also prevents the skin from becoming crusty, which I think is the best part of a baked potato. If you are a fan of twice-baked potatoes, you have to bake them unwrapped or the skin/shell will be too soft to re-stuff.

When I bake potatoes, I preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and place a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil on the bottom shelf of the oven in case any of the juices drip. After washing and drying the potatoes, I coat them with either a little regular Crisco shortening or olive oil — both work well. Next, I prick them four or five times with a fork to let steam escape while they are baking. Sometimes, I sprinkle them with a little kosher salt to add to the skin’s flavor, but it doesn’t affect the interior. I place the potatoes in the centre of the oven, directly on the oven rack set over the foil. Drips are generally not an issue for Russet potatoes, but they are a big issue for sweet potatoes, which I bake exactly the same way.

After an hour of baking, I stick the end of a paring knife into the potato to gauge its doneness. It generally takes another 20 minutes to be perfect, but it depends on the potato’s size.

A little tip for those who like to make twice-baked potatoes: Always bake three potatoes for two finished potatoes, so you can mound the filling over the top. I make them often for dinner parties since they are best made in advance and re-heated just before serving.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bake-it-till-you-make-it-2020-01-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/bake-it-till-you-make-it.html

198,17-1-20,Iran’s president says ‘no limit’ to nuclear enrichment,": Iran’s president said on Thursday that there is “no limit” to the country’s enrichment of uranium following its decision to abandon its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal in response to the killing of its top general in a US airstrike.

In a speech before the heads of banks, Rouhani said the nuclear program is in a “better situation” than it was before the nuclear agreement with world powers.

President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement in May 2018, in part because it did not address Iran’s support for armed groups across the region and its ballistic missile program. The US has since imposed “maximum” sanctions on Iran’s economy.

Iran continued to abide by the agreement until last summer, when it began openly breaching some of its limits, saying it would not be bound by the deal if it saw none of its promised economic benefits. After the January 3 airstrike that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the architect of Iran’s regional military operations, it said it would abandon all restrictions in the nuclear deal. Thus far, however, it has only modestly increased its nuclear activity.

In recent months it has boosted its enrichment of uranium to 4.5 per cent — higher than the 3.67 per cent limit set by the agreement but far from the 20 per cent enrichment it was engaged in before the deal. Uranium must be enriched to 90 per cent to be used in a nuclear weapon.

Britain, France and Germany have spent months trying to salvage the deal, but have not found a way to continue trading with Iran amid the tightened US sanctions.

Earlier this week, they triggered a dispute mechanism in the nuclear deal to try to bring Iran back into compliance. That process could lead to the snapback of international sanctions.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/iran---s-president-says----no-limit----to-nuclear-enrichment.html
199,17-1-20,Putin cements power as Russian Duma votes for new PM,": Russian lawmakers are set to quickly approve the appointment of a new prime minister Thursday, a day after President Vladimir Putin kicked off an unexpected reshuffle of his inner circle that could keep him in power well past the end of his term in 2024.

Mikhail Mishustin, the chief of Russia’s tax service, met with lawmakers from various factions in the State Duma ahead of the confirmation vote in the Kremlin-controlled lower house.

Mishustin vowed to focus on social issues and improve living standards.

“We have all the necessary resources to fulfill the goals set by the president,” he said.

“The president wants the Cabinet to spearhead economic growth and help create new jobs. Raising real incomes is a priority for the government.”

Mishustin would succeed Dmitry Medvedev, a Putin associate who was Russia’s prime minister for eight years. Medvedev resigned hours after Putin proposed sweeping changes to the constitution.

Medvedev served as president in 2008-2012, keeping the seat warm for Putin who continued calling the shots as prime minister when he was forced to step down from the top job due to term limits.

Under Medvedev, the constitution was amended to extend the presidential term from four years to six, although it limits the leader to two consecutive terms.

Putin has kept his longtime ally Medvedev in his close circle, appointing him to the newly created post of deputy head of the presidential Security Council.

The 53-year-old Mishustin is a career bureaucrat who has worked as the tax chief for the past 10 years, keeping a low profile and showing no political ambitions.

He has won a good reputation among experts who praised him for boosting tax collection and streamlining Russia’s rigid tax administration system.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/putin-cements-power-as-russian-duma-votes-for-new-pm.html
200,17-1-20,HK leader says city could keep freedoms if it ‘stays loyal’,": Hong Kong may be allowed to keep its unique freedoms beyond their 2047 expiry date, its leader said on Thursday, but only if inhabitants remain loyal to Beijing’s vision of how the city should be run.

Chief executive Carrie Lam, a pro-Beijing appointee, made the comments during a fiery session in the city’s legislature, where she was frequently interrupted by opposition lawmakers -- many of whom were ejected.

Hong Kong has been battered by seven months of pro-democracy protests, which Lam and Beijing have taken a hard line against.

The protests are fuelled by fears that the city is losing freedoms under an increasingly authoritarian Beijing.

Under a “one country, two systems” deal agreed ahead of the city’s 1997 handover, authoritarian China has allowed Hong Kong to keep key liberties and its capitalist system for fifty years.

But protesters say Beijing is already reneging on that promise, while uncertainty swirls around what might happen when the deadline expires.

On Thursday Lam said the city’s continued freedoms were contingent on the city not challenging Beijing.

“Only if we insist on implementing the ‘one country, two systems’ principle and practice it continuously and fully ... Then I think there will be enough grounds for ‘one country, two systems’ to move ahead smoothly and there would be no change after 2047,” Lam said during Thursday’s appearance in the legislature.

She then called on the city’s youth not to damage the principle because of “temporary misunderstandings”.

“Otherwise, what they are worried about will be brought about by themselves,” she added.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/hk-leader-says-city-could-keep-freedoms-if-it----stays-loyal---.html
201,17-1-20,Intense fighting in Syria’s Idlib kills 39: Monitor,": Intense fighting between pro-government forces and jihadist-led fighters in Syria’s Idlib province killed at least 39 fighters overnight, a war monitor said on Thursday.

The violence, which saw air strikes, shelling and ground combat, further buried a ceasefire announced by Russia on Sunday in Idlib, the last major opposition bastion in the country.

Government and allied forces took two villages in their advance towards the key town of Maaret al-Numan, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

According to the Britain-based war monitor, the fighting flared late on Wednesday in areas south of Maaret al-Numan, the key target of the Syrian government’s latest military offensive.

At least 22 anti-government fighters were killed, most of them members of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a group that includes fighters from the former Al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria.

Seventeen Government troops and allied militia were also killed in the fighting, said Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of the Observatory.

He added that government forces were now just seven kilometres (less than five miles) from Maaret al-Numan, a town that was one of the bastions of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad’s rule.

Nearly nine years into the conflict, protests against the government are still held in some of the province’s towns.

In the city of Idlib itself, 18 civilians were killed in air strikes on Wednesday, shattering the truce brokered by Moscow and rebel backer Ankara.

The fighting has prompted hundreds of thousands of civilians to flee their homes in recent weeks, exposing them to a harsh winter.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/intense-fighting-in-syria---s-idlib-kills-39--monitor.html
202,17-1-20,Musharraf approaches Pak SC to suspend death sentence ruling by special court,": Pakistan’s self-exiled former dictator Pervez Musharraf on Thursday approached the Supreme Court to challenge the ruling of a special court that had handed him death sentence on charges of high treason.

The special court in Islamabad on December 17 last handed down the death penalty to the 74-year-old retired general, now based in Dubai, after six years of hearing the high-profile treason case against him.

The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government led by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had filed the treason case against the former army chief in 2013 over the imposition of an extra-constitutional emergency in November 2007, which led to the confinement of a number of superior court judges in their houses and sacking of over 100 judges.

On Monday, Musharraf’s trial in the high treason case was declared as “unconstitutional” by the Lahore High Court (LHC), leading to the annulment of the death sentence against the ex-Pakistan Army chief.

In a huge reprieve for Musharraf, the LHC declared that the formation of the special court was “unconstitutional” and that the treason case against the former president was not prepared in accordance with the law.

Barrister Salman Safdar, the counsel for Musharraf, submitted the 90-page petition challenging the special court verdict in the top court. In the petition, the former president urged the Supreme Court to declare the special court ruling null and void.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/musharraf-approaches-pak-sc-to-suspend-death-sentence-ruling-by-special-court.html

204,17-1-20,Mahi starts training with Jharkhand Ranji squad,"The 38-year-old showed up at his home team's net practice in Ranchi, indicating that he is gearing himself for the upcoming Indian Premier League. This was on a day when BCCI axed him from the list of centrally contracted players.

“Even we did not know that he was going to come and train with us. It was a pleasant surprise. He batted for a while and did the usual training routine,” a source close to the Jharkhand team management told PTI.

“We are expecting him to train with the team regularly from now on. His presence can only help the players,” the source added.

In fact, Dhoni has bought a brand new bowling machine for his training. While the Jharkhand team will have their red-ball routines, Dhoni will primarily practice against the white ball.

205,17-1-20,Kohli to be back at No 3,"Skipper Virat Kohli is set to be back at his regular number three position after the strategy of coming two-down boomeranged in the lung-opener as India take on a resolute Australia in the must-win second ODI here on Friday.

India go into the game 0-1 down after Australia registered a 10-wicket win in the lung-opener at Mumbai, courtesy David Warner and Aaron Finch, who hit unbeaten hundreds.

In a bid to field all three in-form players — Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and KL Rahul —, Kohli dropped himself down the order but the plan backfired spectacularly as he was unable to convert his start.

Opener Dhawan later said he was ready to bat at number three if asked to by the team management, but since Kohli has been successful at that position, the skipper would be more than willing to walk in one-down.

Kohli batting at three also provides stability to the middle-order.

With a concussed Rishabh Pant out of the second game, Rahul is a certainty as he will keep wickets.

So, like in the last game, Rohit and Dhawan, who made a dogged 74 off 91 balls in Wankhede, could open, and there could be a toss-up between Rahul and young Shreyas Iyer at number four. Iyer had a rare failure on Tuesday.

Pant's absence could pave the way for the inclusion of Karnataka batsman Manish Pandey, who made optimum use of the opportunity that he got in the third T20 against Sri Lanka in Pune.

It would also be interesting to see which among the experienced Kedar Jadhav and rookie Shivam Dube makes the squad.

Rohit, who had a phenomenal 2019, failed in the first game, but given the form he is in, the opener is expected to bounce back strongly here.

Ditto for Kohli, who is just one hundred short of equalling cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar’s record of most hundreds on home soil for India.

The bowlers led by Jasprit Bumrah had a forgettable outing at the Wankhede and they would be more than eager to make a strong comeback and prove their mettle.

Bumrah, since his comeback, has not been as effective as earlier and he would like to change the perception.

It would be interesting to see whether India play Delhi speedster Navdeep Saini or persist with Shardul Thakur, who gave away 43 runs in Mumbai.

Ravindra Jadeja looks a certainty and so the choice would be between chinaman Kuldeep Yadav, who conceded 55 runs in the first ODI and Yuzvendra Chahal as the lead spinner.

On the other hand, a high on confidence Australia will be looking to seal the issue to register back to back series wins in India, a rare feat for any visiting team. The Finch-Warner combination will look forward to carry the momentum.

Their middle-order comprising the experienced Steve Smith, in-form Marnus Labuschange, Ashton Turner and Alex Carey looks more or less settled.

If all of them fire in unison, along with the openers, then it will hard for the opposition bowlers.

However, it will be quite a test of their middle-order at the Saurashtra Cricket Association stadium.

Australian bowlers also showed at the Wankhede, why they are considered among the best.

Led by pace spearhead Mitchell Starc, they bundled out India for a sub-par 255 and Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins would be raring to go once again.

Spinners Adam Zampa and Ashton Agar, not only contained the runs, but provided crucial breakthroughs and are expected to play a similar role again in the middle overs.

The track here is expected to be a belter and India can draw confidence from the home series against New Zealand in 2017, when they won 2-1 after losing the opener, co-incidentally in Mumbai.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kohli-to-be-back-at-no-3.html
206,17-1-20,HD quality,"Cristiano Ronaldo was too ill to play, while Zlatan Ibrahimovic spent the evening resting on the bench, but even without their biggest stars, Juventus and AC Milan cruised into the last eight of the Italian Cup on Wednesday.

Juventus beat visiting Udinese 4-0 in the late game, after Milan had dispatched SPAL, 3-0.

In the first game of the evening, 10-man Fiorentina beat Atalanta 2-1.

Ronaldo was sidelined after suffering an attack of sinusitis in the afternoon, but he is not the only ace in the Juventus pack.

After 16 minutes, Paulo Dybala carved through Udinese with a series of quick one-twos, finishing with a couple of exchanges with centre forward Gonzalo Higuain.

When his Argentine compatriot played a pass one little behind him, Dybala spun and floated the ball onto Higuain’s chest and he strode forward and scored.

“That was a goal of rare beauty, to see three or four exchanges like that at high speed. It was worth the price of the ticket,” said Juve coach Maurizio Sarri.

“I love to see goals like that with fast passing, but they can only work with players of great technical quality” Ten minutes after the opener, Udinese goalkeeper Nicolas tripped Federico Bernardeschi and Dybala converted the penalty.

Dybala scored a in the 58th minute, clipping the ball over Nicolas from the right edge of the box. Two minutes later Douglas Costa converted Juve's second penalty after Bram Nuytinck handled.

In Milan, Krzysztof Piatek, who is reportedly on the verge of a move to Tottenham Hotspur, outpaced the sluggish SPAL offside trap to give the home team the lead after 20 minutes.

Samuel Castillejo curled a precise left-foot shot inside the far post just before half time.

Fullback Theo Hernandez added a third in the 66th minute, surging upfield and smashing home a left-foot shot from just outside the penalty area.

In Tuscany, Spaniard Pol Lirola collected Erik Pulgar’s long pass before charging towards goal and slotting home his first Fiorentina goal six minutes from time, winning the tie for the hosts despite German Pezzella’s sending off 14 minutes earlier.

Patrick Cutrone also scored his first goal for the club when he put Fiorentina ahead in the 11th minute of his first start since arriving on loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers last week.

Prajnesh, ranked 122 in the world, had to battle it out for one hour and 22 minutes to get past Yannick Hanfmann of Germany 1-6, 6-2, 6-1.

Prajnesh, seeded 17th in the qualifiers, will take on Ernests Gulbis of Latvia in the final round.

Gulbis defeated Argentina’s Federico Coria 6-3 ,1-6, 6-2 in another second round qualifying match.

208,17-1-20,Mbappe returns to haunt Monaco,"Kylian Mbappe scored twice to take his season tally to 20 as the French World Cup winner shone in Paris Saint-Germain’s 4-1 rout of his former club Monaco on Wednesday.

The victory kept PSG eight points clear at the top.

They also registered their 50th goal of the league campaign from 20 matches. Monaco came away from PSG with a point in a thrilling 3-3 draw in the capital last weekend but they posed no similar threat just three days later. Mbappe was on target in the 24th and 90th minutes with Neymar tucking away a penalty in first-half stoppage time.

Pablo Sarabia added another in the 73rd minute, just seconds after coming on as a substitute.

Ibrahima Bakayoko grabbed a late consolation for Monaco, beating the impressive Kaylor Navas in goal.

“In every area, we were better than Sunday,” said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel.

“It’s a deserved victory, we had lots of possession.” Tuchel fielded his ‘Fab Four’ attacking stars in Mbappe, Neymar, Mauro Icardi and Angel Di Maria.

It was a decision which paid dividends when Di Maria floated over a cross for Mbappe to score the opener.

Monaco goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte denied Mbappe on two further occasions in the first half.

Neymar made it 2-0 from the penalty spot in injury-time after Kamil Glik had fouled Layvin Kurzawa.

Sarabia’s goal was set-up by fellow substitute Marco Verratti before Mbappe completed the rout of the club he had joined in 2015.

“With our four attackers, we can carry out our plan,” added Tuchel.

“For Icardi, it wasn’t a negative game. It’s a good mix.

“Kylian and Neymar carry the ball a lot, Mauro is used to working with us, for the team, to open spaces.

“He hasn’t scored in two matches, but he works. There are no doubts over him. He added: “The objective was to win the game, take the three points to improve our position.

“We have the best players but I also want to have the best team in each match.” For Monaco coach Robert Moreno, the defeat was a sobering experience coming after Sunday’s encouraging draw in the French capital.

“I am very happy and proud of my team,” said Moreno after his first home game in charge saw Monaco’s six-match win streak at Stade Louis II end.

“It’s a different result to Sunday but tonight we conceded three goals on the counter-attack and a penalty.

“At 3-1, we took risks but had we scored a second then the mental situation would have changed and the last few minutes would have been interesting.”

Rennes are third in the table, five points behind Marseille and 13 off PSG after a 1-0 win over Nimes.

Adrien Hunou scored the winner in the 64th minute to ensure a sixth win in the last seven games.

Nimes are second bottom, three points behind Amiens who drew 1-1 at home to Reims.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mbappe-returns-to-haunt-monaco.html

Sindhu frittered away a one-game lead to lose 21-16, 16-21, 19-21 in a thrilling quarterfinal match that lasted one hour and six minutes.

World number six Sindhu had a 4-2 head-to-head record against the 14th ranked Japanese before Thursday's match.

Takahashi had defeated another top Indian, Saina Nehwal, in the second round.

With the defeat of Sindhu, India’s campaign in the BWF Super 500 tournament came to an end.

World championships Bronze medallist B Sai Praneeth, Kidambi Srikanth and Sourabh Verma crashed out of the tournament in the second round on Wednesday.

Indians thus continued their poor form after making early exits in the Malaysia Masters last week. Sindhu and Saina had reached the quarterfinals in Kuala Lumpur but none of the men’s singles players could cross the second round.

Sindhu began well, breaking away 11-6 in the first game. The Japanese later caught up with the Indian and took the score line to 11-12. But Sindhu was in no mood to allow her opponent to claw her way back and she was 16-15 up.

Sania and Kichenok defeated the American duo of Vania King and Christina McHale 6-2, 4-6, 10-4 in a contest that lasted one hour and 24 minutes.

The fifth-seeded Indo-Ukrainian combination will now lock horns with the Slovenian-Czech pair of Tamara Zidansek and Marie Bouzkova.

Zidansek and Bouzkova got the better of Canada’s Sharon Fichman and Ukraine's Kateryna Bondarenko 6-3, 3-6, 10-4 in their last-eight stage clash.

Sania and Kichenok made a strong start and broke their opponents twice to take the lead. They also did well to save four break points in the opening set.

The second set went on serve till the eighth game before King and McHale broke Sania and Kichenok to draw level in the contest.

However, the third set was a stroll in the park for Sania and her partner as they dominated their opponents with superior serves.

The 33-year-old Sania is returning to WTA circuit after two years. During her two-year break, she battled injury breakdowns before taking a formal break in April 2018 to give birth to her son Izhaan. She is married to Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik.

Before the ongoing event, Sania last played at China Open in October 2017.

211,17-1-20,"In current situation, you should be ready to bat anywhere: Iyer","Shreyas Iyer on Thursday said the current competition in the Indian team demands one to bat at any number after he did not get to play at his usual number four spot in the first ODI against Australia.

Iyer returned to India’s limited overs set-up following the 2019 World Cup and has done well at number four.

“In this situation, you should be ready to bat at any number because it is really important to play in the team, (considering) the competition which we have now right now,” 25-year-old Iyer told reporters ahead of the second ODI here.

The stylish batsman also said that the team is looking forward to more experimentation.

“We can’t give any reasons of batting at any particular number. Yes it is really important for us to be focused and not to cry about why we haven’t been batting at a similar position. Experimentation is something we are looking forward to. Hopefully, we will get a good number for each batsman.

“This is the time we should try and experiment things and hopefully it will work-out in the future,” said the Mumbaikar.

A middle-order collapse in Mumbai exposed India's weakest link but Iyer said that it was part and parcel of the game.

“Well it happens sometimes and you are not prepared. The country was not prepared to see us collapsing in such situations but it is a part and parcel of the game,” said Iyer on the collapse.

“You have to take it in your stride and move forward. As a team we have been doing really well throughout the season and it was just one of the matches where you completely collapsed...There is lot of learning from there,” said Iyer.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/in-current-situation--you-should-be-ready-to-bat-anywhere----iyer.html
212,17-1-20,Need to have a strong character to get better of Kohli: Zampa,"Australian leg-spinner Adam Zampa on Thursday said one needs to have a “strong character” to get the better of a class act like India captain Virat Kohli, who he has dismissed six times in limited overs cricket so far.

Zampa said despite enjoying an upperhand over the Indian captain in limited-overs, Kohli is a hard nut to crack.

“It’s going to be an attacking approach. I think if you’re on the back-foot and have a defensive mindset then that’s when he (Kohli) can get on top of you. The most important thing playing in places like India against these guys is to have a little bit of character,” said Zampa ahead of Friday’s second ODI here.

Zampa has dismissed Kohli four times in ODIs and twice in T20s.

“You probably know you’re going to get hit for boundaries but it can really get worse if you make that affect you. I have got him a few times now but I don’t think there is anything in it. He still scores at over 100 (strike rate) against me,” the 27-year-old spinner said.

“He is a very hard guy to bowl to. He’s one of the toughest guys I’ve ever had to bowl to. After game one (first ODI), he will be even more switched on. It will be a big challenge,” said Zampa, who has 66 ODIs wickets from 49 games.

Steve Waugh had said in the past that Kohli has not shown enough respect to Zampa, but the leggie disagreed with the former Australia skipper.

“I don’t think he (Kohli) doesn’t respect me. I don’t think that’s correct (referring to Waugh's statement).”

Zampa said Australia has managed to find out Kohli’s weak point.

“We basically just found that Virat finds leg-spinners hard to line up early in his innings. He's such a great starter, even the other day he was 16 off 14. How much energy he brought to the crease, his running between the wickets, some of the cover drives he played off the quicks,” he said.

“I think it’s important to try and have a game plan against him. So we figured out before the last game that it would be good to start with leg-spin to him.

“I’ve got him out four times in the last year or so it's nice to have that confidence to bowl to him at the start of his innings,” said Zampa, who is on his third tour to India.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/need-to-have-a-strong-character-to-get-better-of-kohli--zampa.html
213,17-1-20,‘India to fight back hard in second game’,"Australia captain Aaron Finch has no doubts that India will “fight back"" in the second ODI here Friday after being battered in the series-opener in Mumbai.

Australia gave the hosts a reality check with a crushing 10-wicket win in the lung-opener on Tuesday, riding on David Warner and Finch's unbeaten hundreds.

But Finch said it would be silly to take India lightly as they boast of world-class players.

“That was a pretty good performance. I think our fielding was a little bit sloppy but all in all we ar really happy with how the boys went,” he was quoted as saying by ‘cricket.Com.Au’.

“They (India) will fight back no doubt. They are a great side, got some world-class players,” Finch said talking about what to expect from Friday's match.

Asked about his opening partner’s batting display, the Australia skipper said: “He (Warner) is playing unbelievably well I think. It’s so hard to bowl to him once he gets in. He hits the ball all around the ground, so stopping him from scoring is so hard.

“He is so clear with how he is going to bat, his footwork is pretty good. His mental state is unbelievable when he is out in the middle. He is so clear with his thoughts and his game. He is in top shape.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---india-to-fight-back-hard-in-second-game---.html
214,17-1-20,Dhoni dropped from BCCI's central contracts list,"Mahendra Singh Dhoni was on Thursday dropped from the BCCI’s list of centrally contracted players, raising fresh doubts on the future of the former India captain who has not played since the World Cup semifinal loss to New Zealand last year.

The BCCI announced the central contracts for the period of October 2019 to September 2020. The 38-year-old Dhoni was in the A category, which fetches a player Rs 5 crore as annual retainership, until last year.

Skipper Virat Kohli, his white-ball deputy Rohit Sharma and top pacer Jasprit Bumrah were retained in the highest A+ bracket of Rs 7 crore.

Dhoni’s contract not being renewed is not exactly a surprise as he has not played a competitive game since that World Cup semifinal on July 9. He has been on an sabbatical and has refused to divulge his future plans.

Head coach Ravi Shastri had recently said that Dhoni may soon end his ODI career but could be in contention for a spot in the T20 World Cup squad provided he does well in the IPL.

Among others, batsman K L Rahul has been promoted from B grade to A. Having lost his place in the Test side following a dismal tour of Australia last year, Rahul has made a strong comeback and been a consistent performer in the shorter formats.

Test opener Mayank Agarwal, who has done well since making his debut during the tour of Australia in 2018-19, has been included in the Grade B category, which also features Hardik Pandya and Yuzvendra Chahal along with two others.

Pacer Navdeep Saini and T20 specialist Washington Sundar are new entrants in Grade C alongside Shreyas Iyer, Deepak Chahar and Shardul Thakur. Though he has not played Tests, Saini has emerged as an option in all three formats.

Iyer, who made a limited-overs comeback following India's World Cup campaign, has cemented his place in the middle order and seems to be a stable number four that the team has been looking for.

Pacer Thakur too has made an impact in the limited opportunities he has got while the injured Chahar has become a strong contender for a spot in the T20 World Cup with a string of impressive performances, including a six-wicket haul against Bangladesh in November. It is the best ever in the shortest format till date.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dhoni-dropped-from-bcci-s-central-contracts-list.html
215,17-1-20,Runaway favourites Ind ready for High Five,"A few precocious talents, hardworking teenagers and a chunky lot which might fall by the wayside in times to come will form an eclectic 16-team mix in the melting pot called ICC Under-19 World Cup starting on Friday.

Defending champions India will be overwhelming favourites to win the junior global meet for the fifth time with at least six players, including skipper Priyam Garg having played senior cricket (first-class, List A or T20).

Not to forget four players — Yashasvi Jaiswal, Garg, Ravi Bishnoi, Kartik Tyagi—who have already landed fat contracts in the IPL.

India have been the team to beat on the junior cricket circuit since Virat Kohli's team dominated the proceedings in the 2008 edition.

While there will be future stars in Pakistan, Australia, England and New Zealand teams, the presence of Japan and Nigeria will certainly have its own curiosity value.

In fact Japan are clubbed with India, New Zealand and Sri Lanka in group D.

The Japanese team mostly has South Asian expats with names like Tushar Chaturvedi, Yugandhar Retharekar, Ishan Fartyal, Debasish Sahoo helping out the likes of Kazumasha Takahashi, Masato Morita and Shu Noguchi.

The Nigerian team, which is clubbed in a difficult group comprising Australia, West Indies and England, has more local flavour in the presence of Sylvester Okpe, Oche Boniface, Ifeanyichukwu Uboh and Olayinka Olaleye.

The tournament starts with hosts South Africa taking on Afghanistan in the 'Diamond City' of Kimberley on Friday, followed by Australia's big-ticket game against West Indies on the very next day.

Australia like India have a number of players, who have already played senior level cricket with one prominent name being former death over specialist Ian Harvey’s nephew McKenzhie Harvey, who has played 2 List A and 13 T20 games.

Similarly England have Ben Charlesworth with an experience of 11 first-class games to his credit while a few of his teammates have also played for their respective counties.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/runaway-favourites-ind-ready-for-high-five.html
216,17-1-20,Ireland stun WI by four runs,"Ireland rode a career-best 95 from opener Paul Stirling before keeping their nerve in a nail-biting final over to pull off a four-run win over world champions West Indies in the first of a three-match Twenty20 series on Wednesday.

The burly Stirling steered Ireland to 208-7 in their 20 overs.

However, the home side appeared comfortably on course for victory — bringing up their hundred inside 10 overs with just two wickets down — until the game was decided in the last over.

Needing 15 to win, all-rounder Josh Little (3-29) got rid of the dangerous Dwayne Bravo, one of two wickets to fall in the last over.

With five needed off the last ball and seven wickets down, Hayden Walsh could only wave his bat into thin air in a desperate attempt to win the game.

It was only Ireland’s second victory in T20 cricket over the West Indies who went into the game having swept the ODI series 3-0.

“Everyone is ecstatic, we came so close in that second ODI (lost by one wicket) and it maybe affected us in that third ODI, so to show the bottle and come out against one of the top teams in T20 cricket and get a win was great for the vibe of the team,” said Ireland skipper Andrew Balbirnie.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ireland-stun---wi-by-four-runs.html
217,17-1-20,"Pope, Stokes revive England","World cricketer of the year Ben Stokes survived three reviews by South Africa as he and Ollie Pope regained the initiative for England on the first day of the third Test at St George’s Park on Thursday.

England were 224 for four at the end of an attritional day during which South Africa had briefly claimed the advantage.

England were 148 for four when Stokes and Pope came together, in danger of failing to capitalise on batting first on a placid pitch on a hot, sunny day.

But the pair added 76 without being parted and were able to lift a slow scoring rate after England were able to score only 117 for two in 58 overs before tea. Stokes was unbeaten on 38 at the close while Pope made 39 not out.

Stokes came into the match a day after being named player of the year by the International Cricket Council and on the back of a man-of-the-match performance when England levelled the four-match series by winning the second Test in Cape Town by 189 runs.

Stokes made a shaky start, surviving a leg before wicket review on umpire’s call against left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj and an appeal for a catch at slip off what South Africa thought was an inside edge off the pad.

South Africa wasted their last review when Stokes played no shot against Vernon Philander with the second new ball but the ball was well outside the off stump.

Kagiso Rabada took two wickets for South Africa but the home team's most impressive bowler was Maharaj who took one for 55 in 32 overs. He bowled an unbroken spell of 30 overs which enabled captain Faf du Plessis to rotate his fast bowlers as England struggled to assert themselves.

Openers fall into trap

Zak Crawley and Dom Sibley gave England a solid start, putting on 70 for the first wicket but both fell to catches at backward square leg.

Joe Denly was leg before to Maharaj when South Africa successfully sought a review which showed a ball headed for the stumps had hit pad before bat, while Root was beaten and bowled by a fast delivery from Rabada which hit the top of his off stump.

With the four-match series tied at 1-1, batting first appeared to be a considerable advantage on a pitch which had a fair covering of grass but which offered no help to the bowlers.

It was the sixth successive Test toss lost by Du Plessis.

South Africa picked new cap Dane Paterson as a specialist fast bowler in place of all-rounder Dwaine Pretorius. Paterson surprisingly shared the new ball with Philander, with the quicker Rabada and Anrich Nortje having to wait for their turn.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/pope--stokes-revive-england.html
218,17-1-20,Devils catch pack of Wolves,"Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted his decision to risk Marcus Rashford as a second half substitute “backfired” despite seeing his side progress to the fourth round of the FA Cup with a 1-0 win over Wolves on Wednesday.

Rashford lasted less than 15 minutes on the field due to a back injury and is now a doubt for the trip to runaway leaders Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday.

The brief cameo from United's top goalscorer coincided with the only goal of the game as Juan Mata's clinical finish ensured United will travel to either Watford or Tranmere on January 26th.

“That backfired, but you’ve got to go for them,” Solskjaer told BT Sport.

“He’s got a knock and couldn’t run. Let’s test him for Sunday and see how he goes.

“He’s had a few knocks with his back lately and he got another one.” Wolves put United out of the FA Cup last season and were unbeaten in five previous meetings between the sides since returning to the top flight in 2018.

“We are delighted to finally beat Wolves,” added Solskjaer. “We have had a few goes.”

Nuno Espirito Santo signalled his intent by making just one change from his side's Premier League clash with Newcastle at the weekend as John Ruddy replaced Rui Patricio in goal and Wolves looked likely to inflict more pain on the Red Devils in the first half.

Pedro Neto’s strike was ruled out after a VAR review for handball against Raul Jimenez before Matt Doherty hit the post for the visitors.

“It’s a frustration knowing we performed well, but we did not go to the next round,” said Nuno.

At the other end, Ruddy made a fine save to deny Daniel James before the Welsh international then fired just wide of the far post early in the second half.

Rashford had come off on Saturday after scoring twice in a 4-0 thrashing of Norwich, with Solskjaer admitting the England international is carrying “quite a few knocks.”

The Norwegian still ran the risk of introducing his star striker 25 minutes from time and within three minutes United led.

A rare moment of defensive disorganisation from Wolves allowed Anthony Martial to play Mata through on goal and the Spaniard coolly dinked the ball over the advancing Ruddy.

Rashford then went down holding his back and was replaced by Jesse Lingard.

His absence could be a huge blow to United's fight for a top-four finish in the Premier League and in three cup competitions with Solskjaer's side also still in the League Cup and Europa League.

221,17-1-20,Owaisi hits out at Bipin Rawat on,"Hitting out at the Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat who said de-radicalisation camps are operating in the country, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has questioned who would deradicalise attackers of Muslims and Dalits.

Speaking at a public meeting at Adilabad on Thursday night, the Hyderabad MP said de-radicalisation is needed for those who lynch and kill innocent Dalits and Muslims.

""I want to inform the chief of Defence Staff, General Saab, if you want to deradicalise, then listen, you first read the Juvenile Act. IPC is not applicable to children. What kind of de-radicalistion you are talking about,"" he said.

""General Saab says that they will bring new law to deradicalise children. Meerut SP says in Muslim localities that they (Muslims) eat here and sing songs in favour of Pakistan. He says go to Pakistan. Who will de-radicalise such SPs. Dalits and Muslims are being lynched. Who will de- radicalise those attackers?,"" the AIMIM chief said.

Rawat on Thursday in an address at the Raisina Dialogue, said de-radicalisation camps are operating in the country as it was necessary to isolate people who are completely radicalised.

The MIM supremo alleged that names of five lakh Bengali Hindus and an equal number of Muslims are missing in Assam and the Hindus will be given citizenship under CAA, leaving out the Muslims.

He said the names of some family members of former President of India Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed were also missing in Assam and questioned who would de-radicalise those responsible for the blunder.

In series of tweets, Owaisi said this is not the first time that Rawat uttered comments undermining the civil administration.

""This is not the first ridiculous statement he has made. Policy is decided by civilian administration not by any General. By speaking on policy/politics, he is undermining civilian supremacy,"" he tweeted.

""Who'll deradicalise lynchers & their political masters? What about those opposing citizenship for Assam's Bengali Muslims? Maybe deradicalise ""Badla"" Yogi & ""Pakistan jao"" Meerut SP?

228,17-1-20,ISRO's GSAT-30 satellite successfully launched by Ariane Rocket.,"India's ""high power"" communication satellite GSAT-30, aimed at providing high- quality television, telecommunications and broadcasting services, was successfully launched onboard Ariane 5 rocket from French Guiana in the early hours of Friday, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said here.

Blasting off from the Ariane Launch Complex in Kourou, a French territory located in northeastern coast of South America at 2:35 a.M IST, European launch provider Arianespace's Ariane 5 vehicle injected GSAT-30 into the orbit in a flawless flight lasting about 38 minutes and 25 seconds.

""India's communication satellite #GSAT30 was successfully launched into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit by #Ariane5 #VA251. Thanks for your support !!!"" ISRO tweeted soon after deploying the satellite into the transfer orbit.

Confirming the successful launch, Arianespace CEO Stphane Isral too tweeted, ""A strong start to 2020 as #Ariane5 successfully deploys its two satellite passengers EUTELSAT KONNECT and GSAT-30 into geostationary transfer orbit! I appreciate the trust from the two customers on this mission: @Eutelsat_SA and @ISRO #VA251 #MissiontoSuccess.""

ISRO's U R Rao Satellite Centre Director P Kunhikrishnan, who was present in Kourou, congratulated the ISRO community and Arianespace team on the successful launch.

Calling it an ""excellent start"" to 2020 for ISRO with the launch, he said, ""The mission team at the master control facility have already acquired the satellite and they will immediately complete the post launch operations...""

ISRO's Master Control Facility (MCF) at Hassan in Karnataka took over the command and control of GSAT-30 immediately after its separation from the launch vehicle and preliminary health checks of the satellite revealed its normal health, the space agency said in a statement later in the day.

In the days ahead, orbit-raising manoeuvres will be performed to place the satellite in Geostationary Orbit (36,000 km above the equator) by using its onboard propulsion system.

During the final stages of its orbit raising operations, the two solar arrays and the antenna reflectors of GSAT-30 will be deployed, ISRO said adding following this, the satellite will be put in its final orbital configuration.

The satellite will be operational after the successful completion of all in-orbit tests.

The 3,357-kg satellite, which was deployed from the lower passenger position of Ariane-5 launch vehicle (VA 251) into to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), is configured on ISRO's enhanced I-3K Bus structure to provide communication services from geostationary orbit in C and Ku bands.

The satellite derives its heritage from ISRO's earlier INSAT/GSAT satellite series, and is equipped with 12 C and 12 Ku band transponders.

GSAT-30 is to serve as replacement to the ""ageing"" INSAT-4A spacecraft services with enhanced coverage, ISRO has said.

""GSAT-30 has a unique configuration of providing flexible frequency segments and flexible coverage. The satellite will provide communication services to Indian mainland and islands through Ku-band and wide coverage covering Gulf countries, a large number of Asian countries and Australia through C-band,"" ISRO Chairman Dr K Sivan was quoted as saying by the ISRO release.

With a mission life of 15 years, GSAT-30 is an operational communication satellite for DTH, television uplink and VSAT services.

The Bengaluru-headquartered ISRO has said the communication payload of GSAT-30 is specifically designed and optimised to maximise the number of transponders on the spacecraft bus.

""GSAT-30 will provide DTH Television Services, connectivity to VSATs for ATM, stock-exchange, television uplinking and teleport services, Digital Satellite News Gathering (DSNG) and e-governance applications. The satellite will also be used for bulk data transfer for a host of emerging telecommunication applications,"" Sivan said.

One Ku-band beacon downlink signal is transmitted for ground-tracking purpose, the space agency has noted.

For its initial flight of 2020, Arianespace orbited EUTELSAT KONNECT, a telecommunication satellite for the operator Eutelsat, along with GSAT-30, using an Ariane 5 launch vehicle from the Guiana Space Centre.

EUTELSAT KONNECT which was produced by Thales Alenia Space for Eutelsat was riding in the upper position of Ariane 5's payload arrangement, and was released first in the flight sequence at 27 minutes following liftoff.

Since the launch of India's APPLE experimental satellite on Ariane Flight L03 in 1981, Arianespace has orbited 24 satellites, including GSAT-30, for the Indian space agency.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/isro-s-gsat-30-satellite-successfully-launched-by-ariane---rocket--2020-01-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/isro-s-gsat-30-satellite-successfully-launched-by-ariane---rocket-.html

231,17-1-20,1993 Mumbai blasts convict goes missing during parole,"A 68-year-old convict of the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case, Jalees Ansari, went missing on Thursday morning while being on parole, officials said.

Ansari, a resident of Mominpura in Agripada here who is serving a life term, is suspected to be involved in many bomb blast cases across the country, an official said.

He was on parole for 21 days from the Ajmer Central Prison, Rajasthan, and was expected to surrender before prison authorities on Friday, he said.

During the parole period, he was ordered to visit the Agripada Police Station everyday between 10.30 am and 12 pm to mark his attendance, he said.

However, Ansari did not visit the police station on Thursday during the designated time, the official said.

In the afternoon, his 35-year-old son Jaid Ansari approached the police station with a complaint about his ""missing"" father, he said.

According to the complaint, Jalees Ansari woke up in the early hoursand told family members he is going to offer namaz, but did not return home.

On his complaint, the Agripada Police registered a missing case, he said.

The Crime Branch of the Mumbai Police and the Maharashtra ATS have launched a massive manhunt to trace him, he said.

Jalees, who is known as Doctor Bomb, was allegedly connected with terror outfits like SIMI and Indian Mujahidin and taught terror groups how to make bombs, he said.

He was also questioned by the NIA in 2011 in connection with the 2008 bomb blast in Mumbai, he said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/1993-mumbai-blasts-convict-goes-missing-during-parole-2020-01-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/1993-mumbai-blasts-convict-goes-missing-during-parole.html

234,17-1-20,India to invite Pak for SCO meet,"MEA decries China after UNSC rejects Beijing bid to raise Kashmir

The India-Pak relation may witness some thaw after a prolonged hiatus when New Delhi will be inviting Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan later this year to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) heads of Governments meeting. India will invite all eight members and four observer states of the SCO for the regional summit to be held in Delhi.

The important announcement on Thursday came hours after Pakistan’s effort to raise the Kashmir issue at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) through China failed on Wednesday as most members of the UNSC said it was not the place to discuss the issue.

This was China’s third initiative to hold a closed-door meeting to discuss Jammu & Kashmir at the UNSC. The Government has condemned the move by Pakistan, calling its efforts a “misuse of UNSC”.

External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said here, “India will be hosting the heads of Government summit later this year. As per established practice and procedure, all eight members and four observer states and other international dialogue partners will be invited.”

The SCO is an eight-member economic and security bloc to which India and Pakistan were admitted in 2017. The group was founded in 2001 by Russia, China, Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan had attended the SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan’s capital Bishkek last June where Modi had said countries sponsoring, aiding and supporting terrorism must be held accountable. He had urged strengthening co-operation in the fight against terrorism and favoured a global conference to combat it.

Meanwhile, India took strong exception to China helping Pakistan in trying to raise the Kashmir issue at the UNSC saying Beijing should seriously reflect on the global consensus and refrain from such actions in the future.

Pakistan has repeatedly tried to raise the Kashmir issue at the UNSC with China’s help, but it failed again to find any support. The latest attempt failed as other countries of the 15-member council felt Kashmir is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan.

The overwhelming majority of the UNSC was of view that it was not the right forum for such issues, Raveesh Kumar said at a briefing when asked about the developments in the UNSC.

An attempt was made by Pakistan to misuse the UNSC, he said, adding Islamabad has a choice to avoid such a global embarrassment in the future. Pakistan’s attempt to peddle baseless allegations and show an alarming scenario failed as it lacked credibility, he said.

Noting that the meeting concluded without any outcome, Kumar said, “China should seriously reflect on this global consensus, draw proper lessons and refrain from taking such action in future,” while replying to a question on why India has not reacted strongly to Beijing raising the Kashmir issue at the UNSC. “I suggest that this question should be posed to the Chinese side as well,” he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-to-invite-pak-for-sco-meet-2020-01-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/india-to-invite-pak-for-sco-meet.html
235,17-1-20,Court seeks status of Nirbhaya convicts’ scheduled execution,"After the Delhi High Court on Wednesday refused to stay the death warrants of the Nirbhaya’s rapists-killers, a city court on Thursday directed Tihar Jail authorities to file a proper report by Friday about the status of the scheduled execution of convicts.

Taking cognisance of the issue, Delhi Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal recommended the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to reject the mercy petition of one of the convicts, Mukesh Kumar, who filed it a few days ago.

Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Satish Kumar Arora, who had issued death warrants against convicts Mukesh, Vinay Sharma, Pawan Gupta and Akshay Thakur, passed the directions after the jail authorities said they have written to the Delhi Government on the issue of scheduled execution on January 22 in view of pending mercy plea.

The court was hearing a plea by one of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya case, Mukesh, seeking postponement of the date of his execution on the ground that his mercy petition is pending with the President.

In a related development, senior MHA officials said the L-G’s recommendation to reject the mercy petition has been received. “The petition is being examined and an appropriate decision will be taken soon,” they added.

The Delhi Government on Wednesday recommended rejection of the mercy plea filed by Singh in the 2012 gangrape and murder case and forwarded it to the L-G.

Meanwhile on Thursday, all the four death-row convicts were shifted to Tihar prison complex’s jail number 3 where their hanging is set to take place, a jail official said.

Nirbhaya’s father on Thursday said, “We have not lost hope. There is no law for the victim’s family but there are legal remedies available to the convicts, which is why the problems are arising,” he said.

However, he added, “Justice is not far and their (convicts) hanging is not far. They should prepare themselves for the hanging. They might delay it, but it will happen.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/court-seeks-status-of-nirbhaya-convicts----scheduled-execution-2020-01-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/court-seeks-status-of-nirbhaya-convicts----scheduled-execution.html
236,17-1-20,"5 JeM ultras nabbed, major attack averted","The Jammu & Kashmir Police on Thursday foiled a major attack plan ahead of Republic Day by busting a terror module of Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e- Mohammad (JeM), responsible for series of grenade attacks in the recent months in Srinagar.

Five operatives, associated with the JeM terror group, have been arrested by the police. A huge cache of incriminating material and explosive substances, including gelatine sticks, explosives, detonators, arms, explosive body vests, batteries and nitric acid, were recovered following searches based on their disclosures.

VK Birdi, DIG, Central Kashmir Range, told the media in Srinagar that the five men, who were working towards executing sensational incidents like terror attacks and causing IED explosions, were nabbed in two phases.

Giving details of the arrests, Birdi said a grenade explosion on January 8 near Habak crossing near Hazratbal area of the city led to minor injuries to a few civilians.

Police launched investigations into the incident and nabbed two suspects — Ajaz Ahmad Sheikh, a driver by profession, and Umar Hameed Sheikh, a street vendor, both residents of Hazratbal.

During the investigation, they admitted their role in the incident and provided leads to a similar attack near Kashmir University on November 26 last year, the officer added.

“More raids were conducted and three more persons were apprehended — Imtiyaz Ahmad Chikla alias Imran, a sports shop owner, Sahil Farooq Gojri who has a private job and Naseer Mir, a businessman. All are residents of Hazratbal,” the DIG said.

Further investigation indicated they were active cadres of the JeM. “The investigation has revealed their motive to enforce shutdown and paralyse normal life in the city and further plans to execute sensational incidents like terror attack and causing IED explosions,” Birdi said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/5-jem-ultras-nabbed--major-attack-averted-2020-01-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/5-jem-ultras-nabbed--major-attack-averted.html
237,17-1-20,Venal J&K DSP aided terrorists to fly high,"Interrogation of suspended Jammu & Kashmir Deputy Superintendent of Police Davinder Singh has revealed that he used to facilitate air travel of several terrorists out of the Valley in lieu of money.

The probe so far has also revealed that the disgraced cop used two email accounts and saved messages in the “draft” and deleted them after the recipient accessed his accounts and read them. This has led to suspicion that Singh might be compromised by hostile intelligence agencies and this aspect is also being probed in detail, sources privy to the joint interrogation said.

Meanwhile, the Jammu & Kashmir administration has stripped Singh of his Sher-e-Kashmir gallantry medal in view of his “disloyalty” and conduct bringing disrepute to the police force.

Singh was booked by the Jammu & Kashmir Police at Wanpoh Police Station in Kulgam when he was ferrying two Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists — Syed Naveed, alias Naveed Babu, and Altaf — in his private vehicle.

The arrested DSP has been lodged at a camp of the Special Operations Group (SOG) in Srinagar for joint interrogation by the agencies.

After his arrest, the police had recovered one AK-47 assault rifle and some grenades from the residence of Singh in Srinagar.

Before the arrest from the Srinagar-Jammu Highway, the Singh was on the way to Chandigarh along with Naveed Babu and Altaf.

Preliminary probe has revealed that Singh had negotiated an amount of Rs 12 lakh from the nabbed terrorists to safely transport them to Chandigarh.

Agencies are also suspecting that the nabbed terrorists could be involved in some insidious activities for Khalistani groups under the patronage of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence which has shifted its strategy to use some Sikhs from Jammu region for its nefarious agenda to foment trouble in India, sources said.

Singh is also suspected to have passed on ""secret"" information to terrorist groups from time to time and further grilling is continuing to establish the level of such compromises, the sources said.

The arrested DSP had transported terrorists out of Valley in the past, too. During his questioning, it has also emerged that Singh had managed air travel of several terrorists out of valley since his posting at Srinagar airport, they said.

The agencies are also probing whether he was working for covert agencies of other countries. He had provided shelter to terrorist Naveed Babu for two months in lieu of Rs 8 lakh.

During interrogation he has also taken the name of another police official involved in his racket who has risen from the rank of Assitnat Sub Inspector and retied as a Deputy Inspector General and this claim is being further verified, the sources further said.

In its order issued by the Home Department of J&K Government, it said, ""Consequent upon the arrest of Singh on 11.01.2020 while trying to assist terrorists to travel outside J&K and recovery of arms and ammunition in the case FIR No 05/2020…..

238,17-1-20,Not ready for peace with India without resolving Kashmir issue in just manner: Pak FM,"Pakistan is not prepared to pay any price for peace with India and certainly not without resolving the Kashmir issue in a just manner, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has said.

Addressing the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think-tank here on Thursday, Qureshi reiterated Pakistan's demand that US President Donald Trump should mediate to resolve the Kashmir issue.

Ties between India and Pakistan came under severe strain after New Delhi revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcated it into two Union Territories on August 5, evoking strong reactions from Islamabad.

Pakistan has been trying to rally international support against India on the issue.

""Our government wants peace in the neighbourhood. We want, we need peace in order to focus on achieving our domestic agenda for economic reform and development. But we are not prepared to pay any price for peace with India, certainly not our dignity and certainly not without resolving the Kashmir dispute in a just manner,"" Qureshi said.

He alleged that instead of fighting poverty and hunger together, the ""RSS-inspired BJP government has embarked upon the project of turning India into a Hindu Rashtra"".

""The adherence of Hindutva and an Akhand Bharat have established this ascendancy with disastrous consequences for all in India and the world to see,"" he alleged.

Qureshi said on August 5 India tried to change the ""disputed status"" of Jammu and Kashmir and ""alter"" its demographic structure, breaking all relevant international laws and ""violating"" several UN Security Council resolutions in the process.

India has been seeking to break the will of the Kashmiri people by imprisoning them in their homes and imposing a communications blockade that continues to this day, he said.

""Indian narrative that Kashmir is India's internal part is firmly refuted by its being on the Security Council agenda. If this were not the case, why would the French President raise it with the Indian Prime Minister?"" he asked.

""We know that President Trump is profoundly worried by the Kashmir situation and we welcome his repeated offers of mediation in resolving the Kashmir dispute. The United States alone commands the moral authority and respect in South Asia to resolve the longest pending dispute on the UN agenda,"" he said.

""We hope president Trump is successful in realising his goal and can make a lasting contribution to substantial peace in South Asia. That could be his enduring legacy,"" Qureshi said.

Although President Trump has offered to mediate on the Kashmir issue in the past, New Delhi has told Washington that it is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan and there is no scope for any third-party mediation.

On the sidelines of the G7 summit in the French town of Biarritz in August last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while interacting with the media alongside President Trump, categorically rejected any scope for third party mediation between India and Pakistan on Kashmir, saying the two countries can discuss and resolve all issues bilaterally and ""we don't want to trouble any third country"".

On a two-day visit to Washington DC, Qureshi is scheduled to meet Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and US National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien on Friday. On Thursday, he met lawmakers at the US Capitol.

In his speech, Qureshi referred to the recent arrest of an Indian police officer and joined the conspiracy theory about terrorist attacks in India.

""Meanwhile, we all followed reports of capture of Indian police officer, Davinder Singh, whose footprint is now being seen in some major terrorist attack, which India itself orchestrated and blamed on Pakistan,"" said Qureshi.

""We have been consistently warning the world community about another false flag operation against Pakistan that Davinder Singh was accompanied by two militants on his way to Delhi in close proximity to Republic Day celebrations should not be lost on anyone,"" the minister said.

Qureshi said that the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens were raising fundamental questions about the ideals like democracy and secularism that India's founding father passionately advocated.

He said that every other day, military officials or politicians from India make veiled threats against Pakistan.

Earlier in the day, Qureshi met members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/not-ready-for-peace-with-india-without-resolving-kashmir-issue-in-just-manner--pak-fm-2020-01-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/not-ready-for-peace-with-india-without-resolving-kashmir-issue-in-just-manner--pak-fm.html
239,17-1-20,We're doubling down on our investments in India for Amazon Prime Video: Jeff Bezos,"Amazon chief Jeff Bezos has said the company's streaming service, Prime Video, is doing better in India than anywhere else and he has decided to double down the investment for it in the country.

Bezos met Bollywood biggies Thursday night at a gathering where he sat down for a chat with superstar Shah Rukh Khan and director Zoya Akhtar, recounting experience of his India trip and how his vision to create the world's biggest bookstore led to the foundation of Amazon.

The billionaire said the whole world is witnessing ""a golden age of television"" and he wants Amazon to be ""the most talent friendly"" studio in the world and India features prominently in this plan.

""Prime Video is doing well all over the world. It is doing well in Japan, in Germany as well as in America. It is doing well everywhere but there's nowhere it's doing better than in India,"" Bezos said during the half-an-hour-long chat with Shah Rukh and Zoya.

He added that the Prime membership, which comes with free shipping from Amazon, has also proved great for the e-commerce service.

""It's a vehicle to make fantastic content and from business point of view, it works for us as well. So we love it. We just made a decision to double down in our Prime Video investments here in India,"" he said.

The number of hours that people watched Prime Video had grown by six times in just two years in India, he added.

The streamer, which has rivals in Netflix and Hotstar, also unveiled seven more shows that will soon be joining its exclusive Indian content slate.

The shows are ""Dilli"", ""Bandish Bandits"", ""Paatal Lok"", ""Gormint"", ""Mumbai Diaries-26/11"", ""The Last Hour"" and ""Sons of Soil- Jaipur Pink Panthers"".

The existing popular India originals include ""Mirzapur"", ""Inside Edge"", Zoya's ""Made in Heaven"", ""Four More Shots"" and ""The Family Man"".

Bezos said one should not try for a successful formula in entertainment as storytelling is an incredibly difficult art with people always looking for something new.

""This is one of those businesses which really takes human ingenuity... I want Amazon Studios to be all over the world.... When you look at TV series today, they are really good in terms of quality. They're as good as the very best movies have ever been. And now we're getting the best storytellers and actors to come and do TV.

""One of the hardest things that humans do is tell riveting, engaging, inspiring stories. When you get it right, it's a lever that can change the world,"" he said.

Bezos, who is on his fourth trip to the country and the first one in Mumbai, said he had never seen a more diverse place than India.

In Delhi, he also visited the Gandhi memorial and laid a wreath in honour of the Mahatma. The trip, he said, was very meaningful for him.

""There's a man that truly changed the entire world, taught the principles of non-violence... It was a great honor to be able to go there,"" he said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/we-re-doubling-down-on-our-investments-in-india-for-amazon-prime-video--jeff-bezos-2020-01-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/we-re-doubling-down-on-our-investments-in-india-for-amazon-prime-video--jeff-bezos.html
240,17-1-20,China's economy slumps to 6.1 per cent in 2019; lowest in 29 years,"China's GDP grew by 6.1 per cent last year, the lowest in 29 years, the government said on Friday, as weak domestic demand and the bruising 18-month trade war with the US took their toll on the world's second-largest economy.

The new data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) comes a day after China and the US signed a long-awaited phase one deal, marking a ceasefire in the 18-month-long trade war which saw the world's two largest economies slap 25 per cent tariffs on about half a trillion-dollar worth of each other's exports.

The world's second-largest economy grew by 6.1 per cent last year, its worst performance since 1990, but it remained above the psychologically important six per cent mark. The GDP growth remained well within the 6 to 6.5 target set by the government, the NBS said.

However, significant from the Chinese government's perspective, the GDP expanded to USD 14.38 trillion from last year's USD 13.1 trillion.

In 2018, China's economy sank to a 28-year low slowing down to 6.6 per cent year on year, lower than the 6.8-per cent growth registered in 2017 as it grappled with the continued slowdown amid the trade war with US and declining exports.

There is a sense of relief among the officials here as the official growth rate remained above the psychologically important 6 per cent as mandated by Chinese President Xi Jinping who in the past directed that GDP should not go down below six per cent, which could cause serious disruption to the world's second largest economy.

Chinese economy was hit hard by the US tariffs as a result of the trade war between the two countries.

After signing the phase one deal on Wednesday, US President Donald Trump said 25 per cent tariff hike on USD 360 billion worth of Chinese products would continue until the phase-2 deal is worked out.

""The phase one deal is only an interim agreement between China and the US. In fact, to push for negotiation in the next stage, the US will keep existing tariffs on imports from China unless the two countries manage to reach a phase two deal,"" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis.

""In the bilateral evaluation and dispute resolution chapter, the agreement also makes it clear that, if the concerns cannot be resolved, the two parties hold the right to suspend an obligation, adopt a remedial measure, or in the worst case, withdraw from the agreement,"" he told the South China Morning Post.

Despite falling to a new low since 1990, when political turmoil drove economic growth down to 3.9 per cent, the 6.1 per cent rate met the target range of between 6.0 per cent and 6.5 per cent set by the central government at the beginning of last year, but was below the market expectation of 6.2 per cent.

The headline figure was in line with forecasts of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for China's economic growth this year, the Post report said.

Chinese officials say the consumer spending has increased showing success of China's efforts to rejig its economy from one based on exports to more reliant on consumer spending.

According to the NBS data, China's per capita disposable income stood at 30,733 yuan (USD 4,461.95) in 2019, up 5.8 per cent year on year in real terms.

Chinese per capita consumer spending increased by 5.5 per cent year on year in real terms to reach 21,559 yuan in 2019, the data said.

By 2020, China aims to double the per capita income of its urban and rural residents from 2010 levels.

China's value-added industrial output, an important economic indicator, expanded 5.7 per cent year on year in 2019, slowing from 6.2 per cent growth in 2018.

The growth rate was higher than that in the first 11 months of 2019, the data said.

In December alone, China's industrial output expanded 6.9 per cent year on year, up 0.7 percentage points from November, state-run Xinhua news agency quoted the data as saying.

Her remarks came after a Delhi court issued fresh death warrants for the four convicts scheduling their execution at 6 am on February 1.

Earlier they were scheduled to be executed on January 22, but that had to postponed after one of them filed a mercy petition before the President. His mercy petition was rejected by President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday.

""The law of the country is such that it does not give any rights to the victim. Taking advantage of these shortcomings in the law, the murderers of Nirbhaya are using all the tactics. Their aim is to get the execution date postponed,"" she tweeted in Hindi.

248,17-1-20,World 'will not rest' until answers on downed Iran jet: Canada,"Canada's foreign minister on Thursday vowed to push Iran for answers about the mistaken downing of a passenger plane amid high tensions after the US killed one of Tehran's top commanders.

The plane was hit and all 176 people on board were killed just hours after Iran fired strikes against US troops stationed in Iraq in retaliation for a drone attack that killed its most prominent general, Qasem Soleimani.

""In the wake of such a horrific tragedy there are many questions,"" Francois-Philippe Champagne said at a meeting in London.

""Families want answers, the international community wants answers, the world is waiting for answers and we will not rest until we get them.""

Champagne was speaking after talks with counterparts from countries whose nationals were among those killed when the plane was hit after taking off from Tehran last week.

Fifty-seven of the victims on board the Kiev-bound Ukraine International Airlines flight were Canadian.

Iran's initial denial of claims, based on US intelligence, that the Boeing 737 was hit by a missile sparked days of protests and international calls for a full and transparent investigation.

But the Islamic republic later accepted the jet had been targeted ""unintentionally"". President Hassan Rouhani called it an ""unforgivable mistake"".

In a joint statement after Thursday's talks, Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan and Britain issued a five-point plan for cooperation with Iran.

It called for ""full and unhindered access"" for foreign officials to and within Iran and ""a thorough, independent and transparent international investigation"".

Iran should ""assume full responsibility for the downing of flight PS752 and (recognise) its duties towards the families of the victims and other parties -- including compensation"".

In addition, it called for those responsible to be held to account in an independent criminal investigation and trial in line with international standards of due process and human rights.

Champagne told a news conference that families of those who died needed closure and there was a need to prevent similar incidents in the future.

""When you accept full responsibility there are consequences coming from that,"" he said.

""Today is not the day for blame, today is the day for answers,"" he added, saying the families had ""grief and anger and they want us to stand for them"".

The ministers earlier took part in a candle lighting ceremony and a moment's silence at Canada House in London in memory of the victims.

The United States said on Tuesday that it supported the three EU countries that launched a process charging Iran with failing to observe the terms of the 2015 deal curtailing its nuclear programme.

Britain, France and Germany began the dispute process in the wake of Soleimani's death.

German's defence minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer on Thursday confirmed reports that US President Donald Trump threatened the EU3 with a 25-percent tariff on car exports if it continued to back the deal.

British minister Andrew Murrison said the government wanted to keep the deal alive, assessing it was the ""best hope"" of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.

President Rouhani said earlier on Thursday that his country's ""daily enrichment"" of uranium was currently ""higher"" than before the conclusion of the 2015 nuclear deal.

He did not specify whether Iran was now producing a greater quantity of enriched uranium, or whether it was enriching ore with uranium 235 isotopes at a higher level than before the deal.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/world--will-not-rest--until-answers-on-downed-iran-jet--canada-2020-01-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/world--will-not-rest--until-answers-on-downed-iran-jet--canada.html
249,17-1-20,John Cena says acting career not transition from wrestling,"Wrestler-actor John Cena is not finished with wrestling despite his blossoming acting career.

Cena has followed fellow World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) legend and actor Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson's path to Hollywood, having rarely stepped into the ring since taking a hiatus from the sport in 2018, reports aceshowbiz.com.

He says his success as an actor doesn't mean his wrestling career is at an end -- even if movie commitments are keeping him out of the ring for now.

""I'm not done with WWE yet. Keep in mind that being a sports entertainer is like being an actor. You have to invest your full passion into it. Due to insurance liabilities for movies, you can't do other stuff... I am far from done with the WWE. I am trying to change perception -- it's not a transition,"" Cena told portal Extra.

The star went on to say that there's a ""great chance"" his fans will see him back in the ring at some point.

Cena is set to join Johnson as a member of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, debuting in ""Fast and Furious 9"" later this year, and said he was welcomed by his new castmates --despite some initial rivalry.

He added: ""At first it was like being the new member of a family. Everyone is sizing you up...

The show witnessed some of the most violent exchanges between Madhurima and Vishal, with the most recent one happening when Madhurima Tuli started beating her former boyfriend Vishal, leading to severe punishments.

""I am saddened by what is happening. You have no idea what goes on in a parent's heart when something of this sort takes place. Madhurima was very wrong in beating up Vishal but she has never reacted in this extreme manner. Her bottled up frustration came out after Vishal's provocation,"" Vijaya Tuli told BollywoodLife.com, while opening up on her daughter's behaviour and the words Vishal used for her.

Vijaya pointed out Vishal is an aggressive person, and that he has mentioned about anger management issues in the past.

""He told me about his anger management issues. In fact, he was also wearing pearls suggested by an astrologer to calm down,"" she said.

""We have seen that only Shehnaaz Gill and Sidharth Shukla are Madhurima's friends in the house. It is so sad that no one can see the pain on my daughter's face. She is so broken inside seeing how Vishal is humiliating her on national TV. I was happy to see Shehnaaz and Arti Singh take a stand for her.

251,17-1-20,"We will watch 'Love Aaj Kal': Sara, Kartik on Valentine's Day plans","Sara Ali Khan and Kartik Aaryan will be romancing each other in Imtiaz Ali's ""Love Aaj Kal"" but their off-screen equation was the centre of attention at a press conference here with reporters asking about their Valentine's Day plans.

Rumours of a romance started when Sara, during an episode of ""Koffee with Karan"", said she liked Kartik and would like to go on a date with him. Soon Ranveer Singh shared a picture of him introducing the two actors and making the heart sign, which was enough to start the Bollywood rumour mill.

When a reporter asked Kartik to finally clarify the status of their relationship, the actor said, ""Jab inhone national television pe bola tha, uss time mujhe inpe crush aa gaya tha. Tabhi main phir sharmane laga tha (When she confessed her crush on me on national television, I also developed a crush on her. After that, I felt shy)"".

""What should I say when you ask such questions. She said it straight to the camera but what should I say. Tu haan kar ya naa kar tu hai meri Sara (You say yes or you say no, you are my Sara),"" he joked.

The next question to Kartik was who was his 'Love Aaj Kal' between Ananya Pandey and Sara. He sidestepped the question, saying ""Sara you know it all. She is a good actor.""

""What's happening, something like this was asked to you during 'Pati Patni Aur Woh'. Is this 'Love Aaj Kal',"" Sara joked.

The actors were also asked about their plans for Valentine's Day, which also happens to be the release date of the movie.

""We will watch 'Love Aaj Kal'. What else. He will also come,"" Sara said.

""Yes, we will go on a date on Valentine's day,"" Kartik said.

Sara said they were happy that fans had already accepted them as a pair even before the release of their film and had christened them as 'Saarthik'.

Both the actors said it was a dream come true to work with Ali on the film.

""In my case, he knows how to get you there, you feel exactly what you should be feeling before a scene. I can't believe I have had the opportunity to work with him. It has been so special and wonderful,"" Sara said.

Kartik said his first phone call with Ali was of 45 minutes and working on the film was like living a dream.

""We have seen 'Rockstar' and 'Jab We Met' and these are some of our favourite movies. When I saw the first poster of my film, I kept looking at the poster for hours. It's a complete circle. He completely changed me as an actor. His style is very simple, and the process was fun,"" the actor added.

Sara said she could identify with her character of Zoe.

""Zoe represents youth today. The character is carrer driven and I totally agree with and that is the big similarity between me and the character.""

So far Sara has worked with Sushant Singh in her debut film ""Kedarnath"", Ranveer Singh in ""Simmba"", Kartik Aaryan in ""Love Aaj Kal"" and Varun Dhawan in ""Coolie No 1"". She said all her co-stars have never made her feel like a newcomer.

""They all have worked so much in films but they have never made me feel (like a newcomer). They all have been supportive and so helpful, they motivated me,"" she adds.

Sara has often been pitted against her contemporaries Janhvi Kapoor and Ananya Pandey but finds the comparison unfair.

""All three of us are young girls and I understand why it happens but it doesn't make sense to compare one person with another. We are different as people, actors, they both are my contemporaries and friends. I wish the best for them and I hope they are wishing the same for me.""",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/we-will-watch--love-aaj-kal---sara--kartik-on-valentine-s-day-plans-2020-01-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/we-will-watch--love-aaj-kal---sara--kartik-on-valentine-s-day-plans.html
252,17-1-20,Microsoft aims to be 'carbon negative' by 2030,"Microsoft has set an ambitious goal to reduce its carbon footprint, saying that the company will become carbon negative by 2030 and by 2050, it will remove from the environment all the carbon the company has emitted to date.

At an event at its headquarters on Thursday, the company announced a new plan to reduce and ultimately remove its carbon footprint.

""While the world will need to reach net zero, those of us who can afford to move faster and go further should do so. That's why today we are announcing an ambitious goal and a new plan to reduce and ultimately remove Microsoft's carbon footprint,"" said Microsoft President Brad Smith.

""By 2030, Microsoft will be carbon negative, and by 2050. Microsoft will remove from the environment all the carbon the company has emitted either directly or by electrical consumption since it was founded in 1975,"" Smith said in the presence of CEO Satya Nadella, CFO Amy Hood and Chief Environmental Officer Lucas Joppa.

The company also announced a new initiative to use Microsoft technology to help our suppliers and customers around the world reduce their own carbon footprints and a new $1 billion climate innovation fund to accelerate the global development of carbon reduction, capture and removal technologies.

""Beginning next year, the company will also make carbon reduction an explicit aspect of our procurement processes for our supply chain,"" it said.

The human activity has released more than 2 trillion metric tonne of greenhouse gases into the Earth's atmosphere since the start of the First Industrial Revolution in the mid-1700s.

Over three-quarters of this is carbon dioxide, with most of this carbon emitted since the mid-1950s. This is more carbon than nature can re-absorb, and every year, humanity pumps more than 50 billion metric tons of additional greenhouse gases into the air.

""We recognize that progress requires not just a bold goal but a detailed plan. We are launching an aggressive program to cut our carbon emissions by more than half by 2030, both for our direct emissions and for our entire supply and value chain,"" said Microsoft.

""By 2025, we will shift to 100 per cent supply of renewable energy, meaning that we will have power purchase agreements for green energy contracted for 100 per cent of carbon emitting electricity consumed by all our data centers, buildings, and campuses,"" the tech giant emphasized.

256,17-1-20,Trump's trial begins at the start of an election year,"The US Senate opened the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump with quiet ceremony Thursday — senators standing at their desks to swear an oath of “impartial justice” as jurors, House prosecutors formally reciting the charges and Chief Justice John Roberts presiding.

The trial, only the third such undertaking in American history, is unfolding at the start of the election year, a time of deep political division in the nation. Four of the senators sitting in judgment on Trump are running for the Democratic Party's nomination to challenge him in the fall.

“Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!"" intoned the Senate's sergeant at arms, calling the proceedings to order just past noon.

Senators filled the chamber, an unusual sight in itself, sitting silently under strict rules that prohibit talking or cellphones, for a trial that will test not only Trump's presidency but also the nation's three branches of power and its system of checks and balances.

The Constitution mandates the chief justice serve as the presiding officer, and Roberts made the short trip across the street from the Supreme Court to the Capitol.

He has long insisted judges are not politicians and is expected to serve as a referee for the proceedings. Senators rose quickly when he appeared in his plain black robe.

""Will all senators now stand, and remain standing, and raise their right hand,"" Roberts said.

“Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, president of the United States, now pending, you will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws, so help you God?” The senators responded they would, and then they lined up to sign an oath book.

Trump faces two charges after the House voted to impeach him last month.

One, that he abused his presidential power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, using military aid to the country as leverage. Trump is also charged with obstructing Congress' ensuing probe.

The president insists he did nothing wrong, and he dismissed the trial anew on Thursday at the White House: “It's totally partisan. It's a hoax.”

Eventual acquittal is expected in the Republican-controlled Senate. However, new revelations are mounting about Trump's actions toward Ukraine.

The Government Accountability Office said Thursday that the White House violated federal law in withholding the security assistance to Ukraine, which shares a border with hostile Russia.

At the same time, an indicted associate of Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Lev Parnas, has turned over to prosecutors new documents linking the president to the shadow foreign policy being run by Giuliani.

The developments applied fresh pressure to senators to call more witnesses for the trial, a main source of contention that is still to be resolved. The White House has instructed officials not to comply with subpoenas from Congress requesting witnesses or other information.

“What is the president hiding? What is he afraid of?'' asked Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.

“The gravity of these charges is self-evident,"" he said.

“The House of Representatives has accused the president of trying to shake down a foreign leader for personal gain.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the new information from Parnas demands an investigation, which she doesn't expect from Trump's attorney general.

""This is an example of all of the president's henchmen, and I hope that the senators do not become part of the president's henchmen.”

Before the swearing-in, House Democrats prosecuting the case stood before the Senate and Rep. Adam Schiff of the Intelligence Committee formally read the articles of impeachment.

Seven lawmakers, led by Schiff and Rep. Jerrold Nadler of the Judiciary Committee, made the solemn walk across the Capitol for a second day.

All eyes were on Schiff as he stood at a lectern in the well of the chamber, a space usually reserved for senators.

“House Resolution 755 Impeaching Donald John Trump, president of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors,” he began, reading the nine pages.

The other House prosecutors stood in a row to his side. Senators said later that when Roberts appeared the solemnity of the occasion took hold. Security was tight at the Capitol.

""I thought this is a historic moment, and you could have heard a pin drop,” said Republican John Cornyn of Texas.

“And so I think the gravity of what are undertaking I think was sinking in for all of us.” Republican House Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took a far different view of the charges and proceedings.

He opened the chamber decrying Pelosi's decision to hand out ""souvenir pens” on Wednesday after she signed the resolution to transmit the charges to the Senate.

“This final display neatly distilled the House's entire partisan process into one perfect visual,” McConnell said.

“It was a transparently partisan process from beginning to end.” GOP Sen. James Inhofe was absent, home in Oklahoma for a family medical issue, but plans to take the oath when he returns as the full trial begins next week, his office said.

The Senate will issue a formal summons to the White House to appear, with the president's legal team expected to respond by Saturday. Opening arguments will begin on Tuesday.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-s-trial-begins-at-the-start-of-an-election-year-2020-01-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-s-trial-begins-at-the-start-of-an-election-year.html
257,17-1-20,'1917': Astonishing do-not-miss fare,"""1917"" Cast: George Mackay, Dean-Charles Chapman, Mark Strong, Andrew Scott, Richard Madden, Claire Duburcq, Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Daniels Mays, Adrian Scarborough, Jamie Parker, Nabhan Rizwan; Direction: Sam Mendes; Rating: **** (4 stars)

The premise of ""1917"" is sweet, simple and straightforward. Two young soldiers are given the task of sneaking through enemy line in order to deliver a message to the commander of another unit, which will, in turn save thousands of lives if the message is received in time.

The narrative begins on April 6, 1917, on the frontlines in the middle of World War I.

After telephone lines have been cut off, two ordinary British Soldiers, Lance Corporals Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George Mackay), are summoned by General Erinmore and tasked to hand-deliver a message to the 2nd Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment.

The military unit would be walking into a trap, if they do not receive this crucial message in a few hour. Sixteen hundred men would lose their lives, including Blake's older brother.

The duo have only a few hours before the fateful attack is launched and must traverse into enemy territory that may not have been deserted as they have been lead to believe.

This sets the narrative rolling. It is the journey of these two soldiers, who from their base cross through the no-man's land into the enemy territory and thereafter to their destination. This makes for a tense telling.

George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman live their characters to perfection. Their on-screen chemistry and camaraderie is palpable and thus you are drawn to them from the beginning to the end.

Apart from the performances, what makes this film a jaw-dropping experience, are its production designs and cinematography.

The camera seamlessly follows the two actors in and out of small or big sequences, and the entire two hour-plus film appears as if it is a single, long, unbroken film take. There have been films earlier that have achieved this feat, but for a war film, this is the first.

The sheer technical brilliance that this film offers is for one to see it on the big screen. It is like a cinematic magic trick, allowing you to sit in awe at the sheer ambition and technical wizardry of the filmmakers, for there are moments that bring an interesting verité feel to the narrative.

One of the brilliant set pieces, when Schofield runs through the ruins of a French village at night, with German flares providing momentary bursts of visible light above, is astounding. The meticulous precision of the camerawork, the timing of the lighting cues and the action of the actors make the entire enterprise to be deeply immersive, visceral and thrilling in its stunning sense of plausibility.

The only cause for concern is the momentary visual fatigue and boredom that sets in, owing to the monotonous visuals of the battlefield. Also there are a few cinematic liberties that can be overlooked.

As for the production values, each crater, each corpse strewn on the battlefield, helps paint a larger picture of the unseen stories leading to the moment. It adds to the real equivalent of ""show, don't tell"" method of storytelling. The serpentine trenches and the long walk from one end to the other get etched into our minds and make us aware of how daunting this trial will be, especially since every step is fraught with danger.

Layered on top of these jaw-dropping visuals is the superb score by Thomas Newman which elevates the viewing experience.

Overall, this film is do-not-miss fare.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-1917---astonishing-do-not-miss-fare-2020-01-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/-1917---astonishing-do-not-miss-fare.html

259,17-1-20,I fall in love with India every time I return here: Bezos,"Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos on Friday posted a note on the company's e-commerce website Amazon India, saying ""he falls in love with India every time he returns here"", a day after Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal snubbed him during a public event.

""I fall in love with India every time I return here. The boundless energy, innovation and grit of the Indian people always inspire me,"" Bezos wrote in the letter while mentioning Amazon's investment in the Indian economy and that the firm is aiming to create 10 lakh new jobs by 2025.

Those visiting the website for the first time on Friday -- January 17 -- are likely to be greeted with a full page letter by Bezos that is meant for its customers, sellers and partners.

Bezos, in the letter, adds how more than 550,000 small and medium businesses (SMBs) in India are using Amazon as a platform to offer millions of products.

The new expected jobs are on top of the 700,000 jobs Amazon has already created in the country since 2013, the company said in a statement.

The job announcement came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a cold shoulder to the world's richest man who has an estimated net worth of $117 billion, by not meeting him.

On Thursday, Goyal not only ticked off Bezos saying that they are not doing India a favour by investing a billion dollars, but also raised concerns if its losses were a result of predatory pricing and if Amazon and Flipkart were gaining entry into multi-brand retail by using loopholes.

More importantly, alluding to the $1 billion investment announced by Bezos in India, Goyal had a different take.

""(If) they have made a loss of a billion dollars then they jolly well have to finance the billion dollars. So, it is not as if they are doing a great favour to India when they invest a billion dollars,"" the minister said at the Raisina Dialogue.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/i-fall-in-love-with-india-every-time-i-return-here--bezos-2020-01-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/i-fall-in-love-with-india-every-time-i-return-here--bezos.html
260,17-1-20,"North, S Blocks to reflect pre-&-post-1857 history","The iconic North and South Blocks will be turned into grand museums under the proposed redevelopment plan of Parliament and revamp of Central Vista. The National Museum will also be moved into these buildings.

As per the initial plan, South Block will reflect the country’s history till 1857 while North Block will showcase the history after 1857. At present, the South Block houses the Prime Minister’s Office, Ministry of Defence and Ministry of External Affairs, while the North Block has offices of Home Ministry and Finance Ministry.

The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is yet to take a final decision on the proposal, which is part of the new plan prepared by the HCP Design Planning and Management.

The firm has made a presentation on the redevelopment of Parliament and revamp of Central Vista in Lutyens’ Delhi.

North and South Blocks are the symbol of British Raj and it reflects the Central Government authority since their inception. North and South Blocks were built on top of Raisina Hill in 1931. Designed by Herbert Baker, one of Britain’s most distinguished architects of the early 20th Century, the two impressive Secretariat buildings flank Rashtrapati Bhavan on each side. South Block is an intricate labyrinth of vaulted staircases and high ceiling passages. Colonnades and flat roofs, dominated by huge domes, are striking features of the building.

Both these buildings have four levels, each with about 1,000 rooms, in the inner courtyards to make space for future expansions. In continuation with the Viceroy’s House, these buildings also used cream and red Dholpur sandstone from Rajasthan, with the red sandstone forming the base. Together the buildings were designed to form two squares.

They have broad corridors between different wings and wide stairways to the four floors and each building is topped by a giant dome, while each wings end with colonnaded balcony.

The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and residence and the Vice President’s house will have to be shifted to make space for the proposed Central Vista redevelopment plan. The plan also envisages a new triangular structure for the new Parliament, which will come up beside the existing one.

The PM’s residence will move from 7 Lok Kalyan Marg to near the Rashtrapati Bhavan. The PMO, too, will move from the Central Secretariat to a place closer to the proposed new residence of the PM. The main purpose is to reduce the distance between the PMO and PM’s residence and also make for efficient VVIP security arrangement besides avoiding traffic bottlenecks.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/north--s-blocks-to-reflect-pre---post-1857-history-2020-01-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/north--s-blocks-to-reflect-pre---post-1857-history.html
