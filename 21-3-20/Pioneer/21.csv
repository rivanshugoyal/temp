0,21-3-20,"CM orders action against 10 officials, 1 firm for graft","Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s crackdown on corruption continues as on Friday he asked officials to register cases against 10 officials and a firm in Jalaun district on charges of not functioning as per government standard and embezzling government money.

Besides, he ordered investigation into these cases.

According to a tweet by the Chief Minister’s Office, Yogi Adityanath has ordered an enquiry after registering cases against a former executive engineer, four sub-divisional officers and five junior engineers.

Enquiry has also been ordered against one firm accused of corruption and one of its officers.

The officers against whom action has been initiated are Executive Engineer Subodh Kumar Jain SDOs Ramesh Chandra Jaiswal, GN Mehrotra, Babulal and Amar Pal, junior engineers Sohan Swaroop Katiyar, Rajiv Kumar Pushkar, Gokran Singh, Anil Kumar Singh and Rajveer Singh.

The chief minister has ordered action against these officials under sections 420, 409, 120B of Indian Penal Code and sections 7, 13(1)A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, against M/s IVRCL, Hyderabad under sections 409, 120B of the IPC and against the company’s representative Bhimsen Yadav under sections 408 and 120B of the IPC.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-orders-action--against-10-officials---1-firm-for-graft.html
1,21-3-20,UP seeking ICMR approval for 4 labs to test coronavirus,"The Uttar Pradesh government is trying to get the approval of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for four institutes in the state to conduct novel coronavirus tests.

This was stated by UP Health Minister Jai Pratap Singh on Friday.

As of now, only King George’s Medical University in Lucknow has the approval for testing Covid-19 cases.

“We are working on a war footing to deal with the situation arising out of the coronavirus outbreak. We have a virology lab in Gorakhpur and facilities in Aligarh, Banaras Hindu University and Sanjay Gandhi Post-graduate Institute of Medical Sciences Lucknow. We are trying to procure equipment and get accreditation from ICMR for carrying out tests at these places,” the minister said.

“Samples from Gautam Buddha Nagar and some other places in western UP go to National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in Delhi for testing,” he said.

“We have many coronavirus cases in UP. The entire country is dealing with it at its level but on our part we started working from January 27 after alerts from the Centre,” Singh said.

“We have 19 points along India-Nepal border and screening began at all points with thermal analysers in January. We have screened over 18,000 people at our airports and are following Central government’s protocols as and when issued,” he added.

A Union Health Ministry data said that the number of novel coronavirus cases in the country rose to 173 on Thursday. This includes four deaths reported from Punjab, Delhi, Karnataka and Maharashtra. Uttar Pradesh has recorded 23 Covid-19 cases, including one foreign national.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-seeking-icmr--approval-for-4-labs--to-test-coronavirus.html
2,21-3-20,"Akhilesh asks SP workers, people to stay with family to check coronavirus spread","A day after cancelling all political programmes in view of the coronavirus outbreak, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav appealed to the people to stay with their families to check the spread of the deadly virus that has so far affected 23 people, including a foreigner, in Uttar Pradesh.

Akhilesh Yadav, however, lashed out at the Yogi Adityanath government, accusing it of being insensitive to the epidemic and ignoring the directives issued by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

He also charged that the state government was maintaining double standards in implementing measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

“Today I want to tell my party workers and people of the state that treatment of Covid-19 is the job of a doctor but checking its spread is our responsibility. Visit a doctor immediately for testing if you spot symptoms of Covid-19 in yourself, family or neighbourhood. Remain clean, don’t meet others and also check spread of rumours through WhatsApp and other media,” the SP chief said.

Akhilesh further said, “Remain with your family and be positive and assume that for the first time there is a summer vacation and you are at home.”

“In view of the spread of coronavirus, I appeal to party workers to remain at their homes and remain connected through phones with others and provide them necessary help. All programmes will be held after Navratra (starting March 25). The Cycle Yatra proposed on March 23 has also been cancelled,” he said.

However, when asked about the protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the SP chief said, “The issue is more serious than coronavirus. This hatred being spread by the BJP is also a very serious disease. I appeal to protesters to take preventive measures.”

Akhilesh also lashed out at the Yogi government for its failure to implement measures to prevent the spread of the virus.

“A former chief minister of the BJP, ministers and people holding high offices in the government were attending lavish parties where singer Kanika Kapoor, who has tested positive for coronavirus infection, was also present. The behaviour of the high and mighty is highly condemnable in view of the pandemic,’’ the SP chief said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/akhilesh-asks-sp-workers---people-to-stay-with-family-to--check-coronavirus-spread.html
3,21-3-20,"Govt makes land mgmt, allotment transparent","In an attempt to improve upon ease of doing business in Uttar Pradesh, the state government is taking significant steps to streamline and bring transparency to land management and allotment system in all industrial development authorities.

Principal Secretary (Infrastructure and Industrial Development) Alok Kumar directed all key industrial development authorities, which currently have off-line system, to develop on-line system for land allotment for all purposes and integrate it with Nivesh Mitra single window portal of the state.

In a government order issued on Friday, Greater Noida, Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA), UP Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) and Gorakhpur Industrial Development Authority (GIDA) have been directed to ensure that all land allotments, including industrial, commercial and for other purposes, are made through the state’s single window portal Nivesh Mitra by June 30.

UP State Industrial Development Authority (UPSIDA) and New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (NOIDA) are already allotting all types of land plots through Nivesh Mitra.

Kumar also issued directive that from June 30 onwards, advertisements and notices for allotment of land as well as receipt of applications be done through Nivesh Mitra portal only.

Under this system, land allotment results will be displayed on Nivesh Mitra portal to ensure transparent and time-bound action.

Moreover, system generated allotment letters will be issued to allottees to minimise the human interface.

Industrial Development Minister Satish Mahana said that Uttar Pradesh was focusing on collaborating with global organisations and corporations, especially in focused sectors like defence and aerospace, and therefore, having a robust on-line land bank database linked with GIS and on-line building plan approval mechanism was the need of the hour.

It was also decided that from April 1, building plan approval applications for all purposes (including commercial, institutional etc.) shall be accepted only through on-line mode on Nivesh Mitra portal in industrial development authorities.

In another crucial initiative to eliminate ambiguity in land management system in industrial development authorities, a statewide geo-information system (GIS) has been mandated for effective and transparent on-line land allotment system in all industrial development authorities by May 15.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-makes-land-mgmt--allotment-transparent.html

5,21-3-20,Corona: CM urges PM to defer Census 2021,"Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Friday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting the Central Government to review the decision for Census 2021 keeping in view the coronavirus outbreak and take an appropriate decision in the interest of people.

In the letter, Patnaik said that around 30 lakh enumerators and supervisors in the country would be engaged to collect data by visiting each household in a first phase. However, in the current situation, where all efforts are directed towards containment of COVID-19, mobilisation for the Census and other concerned activities would pose a great risk for filed functionaries and people as well.

“I would suggest you to postpone the scheduled Census and related activities in the country and take (an) appropriate decision in the interest of people. Overall stock may be taken on the emerging situation,” Patnaik wrote to the PM.

Notably, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs has issued notifications for conduct of Census 2021 and updating of the National Population Register throughout the country. Accordingly, all States have been given schedules to complete the first phase for house-listing, housing census and updating of population registration during 45 days between April 1 and September 30, 2020.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/corona--cm-urges-pm-to-defer-census-2021.html
6,21-3-20,Naveen wants PM to boost corona test facilities,"Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Friday suggested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to scale up coronavirus (COVID-19) testing facilities at Government and private hospitals across the country and make them free of cost.

Patnaik made the suggestion during a videoconference meeting of the PM with the CMs of all States over coronavirus containment and treatment. Patnaik also suggested for availability of protection equipments and masks for healthcare personnel.

Financial support for MGNREGS workers for at least 50 days and families covered under the National Food Security Act, additional instalments for farmers covered under the PM KISAN scheme, economic package for various sectors and construction workers and distribution of funds to the States in advance were other major suggestions of Patnaik.

7,21-3-20,When we are the virus,"There’s a long way to a world where humans and animals are treated at par. This is why the AWBI’s move to think about the welfare of animals amid COVID-19 threat is praiseworthy

The chairman, Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI), Dr OP Chaudhary, has acted commendably in issuing a circular, dated March 11, 2020, to the Chief Secretaries of all States and Union Territories about pet animals at a time of Coronavirus. Stating that it was being brought to the board’s notice that animal owners were “leaving their animals to stray without proper food, water or shelter” due to the spread of COVID-19, the circular added, “In this regard, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has clarified that dogs and cats are not involved in spreading infection in the current episode of Coronavirus infection.” Further, the circular reminded that cruelty to animals was an offence under Sections 3 and 11(1) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 and the rules thereunder, as well as violative of the Supreme Court’s directives in this regard.

The circular stated that AWBI had already advised the Governments of States and Union Territories to see that stray animals were looked after by local bodies, which were responsible for the matter. It requested Chief Secretaries to issue circulars to all concerned to create awareness among the public about not leaving the animals they were taking care of to stray or not inflicting unnecessary pain and suffering on animals because of the spread of COVID-19 and directing the law enforcement authorities to ensure the same. A copy of the circulars, it ended by saying, might be forwarded to the board.

Here is a kind of pro-active action on the part of authorities one does not ordinarily see. Irrespective of the results that follow in its immediate aftermath, it will add to the pressure, building up over time, on the authorities and the public, to treat animals humanely and according to law. It is going to be a long haul. Cruelty to animals is part of a wider proneness to hatred and cruelty that is as integral a component of the human psyche as love and compassion. Humans enjoy being cruel, whether to other humans or animals. As Erich Fromm points out in his seminal work, The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness, animals “do not enjoy inflicting pain and suffering on other animals, nor to ‘they kill for nothing.’ Sometimes an animal seems to display sadistic behaviour — for instance, a cat playing with a mouse; but it is an anthropomorphic interpretation to assume that the cat enjoys the suffering of the mouse; any fast-moving object can serve as a plaything whether it is a mouse or a ball of wool.”

“Man,” Fromm points out, “is the only mammal who is a large-scale killer and a sadist.” He holds that indulgence in destruction and cruelty can always cause a man to feel “intense satisfaction; masses of men can suddenly be seized by lust for blood. Individuals and groups may have a character structure that makes them eagerly wait for — or create — situations that permit expressions of destructiveness.”

Animals have been a special target of human savagery because the dominant global discourse arising in the background of the European Renaissance and the 18th century Enlightenment have excluded them from the moral universe of the humans. The two principal grounds for doing so is that they, unlike people, lacked rationality and were created to serve humans. Neither ground survives scrutiny. Irrationality is as much a part of the human psyche as rationality. Otherwise so many people would not have cheered Hitler and Mussolini or clung to countless superstitious beliefs. Elizabeth Costello, the main protagonist in JM Coetzee’s The Lives of Animals, puts things in perspective when she says, “Both reason and seven decades of life experience tell me that reason is neither the being of the universe nor the being of god. On the contrary, reason looks to me suspiciously like the being of human thought; worse than that, like the being of one tendency of human thought. Reason is the being of a certain spectrum in human thinking.”

Reason, the cutting edge of rationality, is an instrument for analysing and assessing information and integrating it into the consciousness. Equally, it is an instrument for solving problems and coping with the world through the establishment of causal relationships based on thought process like induction, the drawing of conclusions from empirical observation and deduction, the drawing of conclusions from premises derived through induction. The conclusions it has yielded have, however, often proved wrong, especially when the process of reasoning has been based on incorrect premises. As important, reason is value neutral. It can equally serve moral and immoral causes.

Second, reason has not been the only instrument for coping with and modifying the world. Sometimes instinct has worked where reason has failed or instinctive responses have triggered rational speculation widening the frontiers of knowledge and technology and changing the world materially, philosophically and morally. Animals have far sharper instincts — or the sixth sense if you will — than human beings. More, they have far stronger and sharper faculties like that of hearing and smell, can often see in the dark and have far stronger survival capacities than men and women. Coetzee further makes Elizabeth Costello say, “scientific experimentation that leads you to conclude that animals are imbeciles is profoundly anthropocentric. It values your ability to find your way out of a sterile maze, ignoring the fact that if the researcher who designed the maze were to be parachuted into the jungles of Borneo, he or she would be dead of starvation in a week. If I as a human being were told that the standards by which animals are measured are human standards, I would be insulted. It is experiments themselves that are imbecile.”

Finally, animals may not be rational in the manner humans are but they can reach conclusions by weighing options and map courses of action to be followed. They feel emotions such as grief and joy exactly the same way that humans do. They are as entitled to free and joyous lives as humans. Most of them do not do so because they have either been enslaved and mercilessly exploited or savagely hunted as sport. Things have improved. Many countries have legislated against cruelty to animals, banned or limited animal experimentation and banned or restricted hunting. It is, however, still a long way to a world in which humans and animals are treated legally and morally at par. Time was when people thought that human slavery could not be abolished. It was. There will also be a time when animal slavery will cease to exist.

8,21-3-20,Congress loses MP,"With two States, where it was a ruling entity either in coalition or singly, out of its grip, party needs to take final call

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath’s resignation may appear to have been taken under duress because of the BJP’s Operation Lotus, or toppling elected Governments by breaking ruling parties and buying over MLAs. He may have claimed that he was gracious under destructive pressure and took the moral high ground of the BJP “murdering democracy.” Even then, it would seem like he is shifting the blame to an externality rather than looking at the cracks in his own house. One must remember that the Assembly elections of 2018 had thrown up a badly split verdict that set the coalition politics rolling with the Congress itself guilty of buying support from the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and just about scraping past the BJP’s 107 mark. So it is not like the Congress, for whom winning States and restoring its federal matrix is more a necessity than an indulgence, crouching as it is in a pit of national irrelevance, didn’t know what was coming. Or what needed to be worked on. It is a gross failure of the central party leadership to continue status quo rather than break the mould, trust its old coterie of leaders to manage affairs rather than embolden young leaders, who had not only worked the ground but had won the people’s faith that they could renew and rescue the party. Both Jyotiraditya Scindia in Madhya Pradesh and Sachin Pilot in Rajasthan had electoral verdicts to prove that they could be just as credible in capability, rebuilding and outreach. Still, Congress matriarch Sonia Gandhi gifted the chief ministership to old hawks like Kamal Nath and Ashok Gehlot. These courtiers of the dynastic party had long built their indispensability through a transactional relationship of managing their home turfs and generating enough political capital to strengthen the central leadership. At the time, the leadership had counted on this dependence to deliver power, ignoring that this continuity would cost it dearly. The young Turks, all itching in their middling years to deliver the goods, were rebellious and determined. All that the central leadership’s obstinacy and fears of a split by the old guard achieved was delay the inevitable. Had there been a breakthrough change, the Turks would be with the party and emboldened, crafted a new model of governance. Even a peerage that respected its members. As the Madhya Pradesh imbroglio has shown, there was no love lost between Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh. The Congress’ tailspin may have happened after 22 MLAs flew to Bengaluru last week and resigned after Scindia quit his party of 18 years. But trouble was brewing much before. Kamal Nath miscalculated, thinking managing legislators was a shopping expedition. But the Scindia loyalists have proved that even the grassroots workers need new direction. Scindia has undoubtedly made a politically convenient choice. But by being just another leader of the State BJP, he wants to forget the irrelevance of the many party posts that the Congress had placated him with. If this is still not a lesson for Congress, then its stakeholders better prepare for more sell-offs.

As for the BJP, the party won’t stop short at anything to destabilise its hold on the heartland. Madhya Pradesh, in particular, is intrinsically a Hindutva factory, where the ideology resonates among people easily. The Sangh Parivar’s leaders have always been rewarded, even brutal hardliners like Pragya Thakur. And there will be acceptability for some like Shivraj Singh Chouhan, a three-time Chief Minister who should be returned to power, because he has an enviable performance record that has scripted the State’s turnaround story. In fact, there was a time when his proactive policies, although not as well publicised as Narendra Modi’s Gujarat model of governance, and clean image helped him beat anti-incumbency. His asset of being a doer-politician is also his liability as the Modi-Shah duo do not want his persona to outshine their own. In fact, Chouhan had put together the numbers, too, when the Congress staked claim in 2018 but was not allowed to emerge taller in crisis. Already names of Narottam Mishra and Union Minister Narendra Tomar are in circulation, the former asserting his centrality a la BS Yedyurappa in Karnataka. Mishra comes from the Gwalior-Chambal region and may want a prize for gifting the party a rare moment of stealing a dear friend of Congress crown prince Rahul Gandhi. Tomar happens to be close to Chouhan. Maybe it is time for the BJP leadership to shed its biases and entrust the party fate in the hands of a ground warrior like Chouhan. Most importantly learn from the Congress failure to back the winning horse.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/congress-loses-mp-2020-03-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/congress-loses-mp.html
9,21-3-20,"Finally, a closure","The hanging of Nirbhaya’s rapists after seven long years is more disturbing to our sense of justice than relief

Now, Nirbhaya, the unfortunate daughter of India, can finally rest in peace as four of her violators were hanged to death at 5.30 am inside Tihar jail on Friday morning. Beyond that, everything else is a shame and a gross travesty of justice. The closure came seven-odd years too late for the 23-year-old paramedic, who was gangraped, tortured, humiliated and subsequently died of her grievous injuries. While the life of a bright girl, who was her lower middle class parents’ hope for a better future, was cut short brutally by the six demons, five of them continued to live and breathe long after she was gone. Five, because, Ram Singh, who was arrested along with the four other accused — Vinay Sharma, Akshay Singh, Pawan Gupta and Mukesh Kumar — committed suicide in prison, while a juvenile, who subjected Nirbhaya to unimaginable physical torture and brutality, was freed after getting a mild punishment of three years in a remand home. That he roams the streets of India today, unknown and unrecognised, itself is a travesty of justice.

Their hanging has brought the curtains on a distasteful saga of willful distortion and exploitation of the laws of the land, making a mockery out of them and using every trick in the book to delay the inevitable with plea after plea in various courts. Had they been punished in time, they would have acted as a deterrent for all those with twisted minds who think they can get away with rape. Perhaps, it would have stalled copycat acts. Perhaps the Hyderabad veterinarian, who was brutally raped and killed, would have been alive. India, its people and the criminal justice system never remained the same after December 16, 2012. The only silver lining is that it has brought about changes in the law, widened the definition of rape, made it a non-bailable crime and taught the women of the country to report rape, talk about it and seek justice. Nirbhaya’s parents, in their decision to reveal the name of their daughter and their own identity, set an example for all other parents of the country to stand by their daughters in their darkest hour. It taught society to come out and fight for justice for the aggrieved, instead of victim shaming. It is another matter that NCRB data shows that the number of rapes reported shot up by 34 per cent between 2012 and 2018 from 24,923 to 33,356 and the Supreme Court of India itself laments that changes effected to criminal law after the Nirbhaya case haven’t yielded results.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/finally--a-closure-2020-03-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/finally--a-closure-finally--a-closure.html
10,21-3-20,A matter of faith,"The Preamble to our Constitution and Articles 25 and 26 dealing with freedom of religion guarantee equality to all individuals and groups irrespective of their beliefs

American statesman and prominent attorney Daniel Webster once said, “Justice is the greatest interest of man on Earth. It is the ligament which holds civilised beings and a civilised society together.” We, the people of India, were gifted with one of the most significant Constitutions ever written, on January 26, 1950 and are fortunate to have our freedoms and rights acknowledged and defined in it. The framers of the Constitution recognised that people have inherent fundamental rights that are inalienable and constitutionally-enforceable through courts, subject to reasonable restrictions. They are universally recognised and include the right to equality, freedom of expression, freedom of conscience and religion and the right to approach courts to enforce them. These rights are contained in Part III of the Constitution. Part IV deals with the Directive Principles of State Policy that act as instruments of instruction for the implementation of fundamental rights in Part III.

Unlike the Indian Constitution, the American Constitution written in 1787 was probably flawed at first. It did not have a written provision or a “Bill of Rights” which guaranteed protection of fundamental personal freedoms and rights of its citizens. Seeing the need for it Thomas Jefferson argued that the people were entitled to it against every Government on the planet and “no just Government should refuse a Bill of Rights to its people.” After that, in 1791, the “Bill of Rights” was introduced in the US Constitution by the first ten amendments and it prohibited the Congress from making any law which impedes the free exercise of religion, speech, right to peaceably assemble and the right to a fair trial and several other personal rights of individuals.

According to Justice Sandra Day O’Connor in the “Bill of Rights”, the framers of the American Constitution built a wall around certain fundamental individual freedoms, forever limiting the majority’s ability to intrude upon them. Fundamental rights are recognised in every civilised nation and are founded on the rule of law which no law can deprive its citizen of, in a civilised and secular society.

Justice Patanjali Sastri in the AK Gopalan vs State of Madras case in 1950 noted that Part III forms a new feature of the Constitution and it is the Indian “Bill of Rights.” It is modelled on the first ten amendments of the American Constitution which declare the fundamental rights of US citizens.

The rule of law and secularism are at the heart of the Indian Constitution and Indian laws. The rule of law assures us of equality before it and equal treatment of laws, liberty, dignity, personal freedom and the right to life. The Preamble to our Constitution and Articles 25 and 26 dealing with freedom of religion guarantee equality to all individuals and groups irrespective of their beliefs. They also emphasise that there is no religion of the State itself. The concept of secularism is one facet of the right to equality woven as the central golden thread in the fabric depicting the pattern of the scheme of the Constitution as noted in the M Ismail Faruqui vs the Union of India case.

There may be times when the Government must be reminded about the rule of law and secularism as reflected in our Constitution. Recently, a statue of Lord Jesus and 14 crosses portraying events in the Passion of Christ, from his condemnation by Pontius Pilate to his entombment, were removed from a cemetery in Karnataka near Bengaluru by the district administration. It was alleged that the church was encroaching on public land and involved in forcible conversions. The church says that the property was being used on the basis of a valid Government sanction for several years. The church also says that the statue and the crosses were removed at the behest of majoritarian groups amid false accusations of forcible conversions.

The church requested the State administration to allow them to continue with their Lenten observances which they have been doing for the last several years at the cemetery. Lent is a 40-day period before the crucifixion and burial of Lord Jesus on Good Friday and his resurrection from the dead on Easter Sunday, that is observed by Christians by fasting and praying. The belief in the crucifixion and resurrection of Lord Jesus is the central belief of Christianity. The church says that the removal of the statue of Christ and the 14 crosses is illegal as the land was sanctioned for a Christian graveyard and they have the documents to prove it. They say that the State administration showed undue haste to remove the statue and crosses and could have at least waited till after Easter and not obstruct the religious observances that have been going on for several years.

There are other incidents when Christians have wrongly been accused of forcible conversions. In 2017, eight Christians were intercepted and arrested on charges of forcible conversion under the Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act and kidnapping under the Indian Penal Code. They were travelling for a Bible camp along with 60 children from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur. After a long and arduous trial, a court in Madhya Pradesh acquitted the eight Christians in February, as they were proved innocent of all charges. Increasingly, churches are targetted by mobs and their Sunday services disrupted. Disturbingly, more often than not, no action is taken against the attackers. However, the pastors and church leaders are assaulted and are arrested and accused of forcible conversion. In 2015 in Jhajjar, Haryana, Sunday services in one church were stopped by the district administration on account of a procession and puja which happened to be taking place near it. The district administration did not respond to the pleas of the church to allow the members to worship.

However, the administration hastily withdrew its illegal order as soon as the church approached the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The court directed the State to provide adequate security as and when required, especially when the church services were in progress. The church was allowed to function as per the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution and the established principles of the rule of law.

States such as Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh have Freedom of Religion Acts which are also referred to as anti-conversion laws. These laws rightly prohibit religious conversions by force, fraud and inducement. Some of these State laws have been in existence for more than 50 years in Madhya Pradesh and Odisha and there have been many false convictions under these laws. It appears that such laws only serve the purpose of intimidating and harassing Christian pastors and not others who indulge in conversions and forced re-conversions. Such Acts impede on the rights of Christians only and are being used to threaten religious leaders and congregations even in States where no such laws exist. Accusing church leaders and pastors of forceful conversion has become a convenient method for the perpetrators of crimes against Christians, to assault and silence them, just like the dreaded Blasphemy law in Pakistan is used against minorities. The anti-conversion laws only promote communal hatred and do not subserve any Constitutional purpose and are a blot on our democracy. All citizens of India are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practice and propagate religion as contained in Article 25 of the Constitution.

The Government must be reminded of its duty, as reflected in the observations of the Supreme Court in the State of Karnataka vs Praveen Bhai Togadia case which said that secularism is not to be confused with the communal or religious concept of an individual or a group of persons. It means that the State should have no religion of its own and no one could proclaim to make the State have one such or endeavour to create a theocratic State. Each person, whatever be his religion, must get an assurance from the State that he has the protection of law to freely profess, practice and propagate his religion and freedom of conscience.

The anti-conversion laws are impeding the rights of the Christian minority and must be repealed. The abrupt removal of the statue of Lord Jesus in Karnataka and the promptitude with which the administration acts to appease groups who accuse pastors of forcible conversion are a few real incidents of a travesty of justice and the misapplication of laws. The anti-conversion laws are an antithesis to the rule of law and must be struck down from the statute books.

11,21-3-20,The outlay of prevention,"The economic cost of shutting down workplaces would be lesser than the price of a potential spread in a densely-populated country like India

Given the Coronavirus outbreak, India is faced with the challenge of protecting its 1.3 billion people from the pandemic. Worryingly, the number of COVID-19 positive cases in the country has risen to 223, including 32 foreign nationals, as at least 50 fresh cases were reported on March 20, making it the largest single-day jump since the outbreak began weeks ago. At least four deaths have been linked to the virus. The country has limited resources and as the Western world calls it, “a patchy healthcare system.” Though the country has experience in dealing with epidemics in the past, be it the H1N1(swine flu) contagion, H5N1(bird flu), Nipah or the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the fact remains that it is largely resource-constrained.

India chose the path of preventive care to handle the Coronavirus crisis and the country has fared well so far. We cancelled trains, sealed the borders, carried out extensive screening at all airports and ports around the country, stopped visas for foreign travel, quarantined the reported cases, screened the suspected cases, closed schools and colleges, stopped social gatherings, reduced the number of people at weddings, postponed cricket matches and examinations, closed malls, cinema halls, restaurants and crowded monuments. A message from the Government of India is heard by everyone who makes a phone call, giving sound information on hand hygiene and sanitising and other steps to be taken to combat the potential epidemic. The Government has cracked down on hoarding of hand sanitizers and modes of public transport are being cleaned and sanitized daily. Now, the Government has asked people to undergo a “janata (people) curfew” on March 22.

The informal information network on social media is also active to spread awareness regarding the dreaded pandemic and the number of jokes shared on the Coronavirus exhibit the resilience of the people of India in tough times.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), has conducted a survey to understand the level of community transmission of the disease. The virus has been reported so far in individuals with a travel history to other parts of the world where people are affected. The ICMR has conducted random tests on people with flu-like symptoms to find out the local carriers of the virus, because the cases could have been under-reported like everywhere else in the world.

Public awareness, self-reporting and self-isolation would be the key to controlling the Coronavirus spread in the next two weeks. The economic cost of shutting down workplaces would be lesser than the cost of a potential spread, as it will be difficult to control the disease in a densely-populated country like India. Doctors worry about a shortage of gloves, masks, ventilators, medicines and test kits in the wake of a spread of an epidemic. Hospitals would be overwhelmed and the health system would be put to test in the reverse situation for the next three-four months. The man-hours lost due to disease would be much higher than the man-hours lost in preventing the disease. Covid-19 will pose a threat to production in India, as firms depending upon supplies from China will be curtailing operations. We have not heard of shutdown of production houses so far in India. A successful preventive care strategy will eliminate a supply shock in India, as production houses can clear inventories during this critical time. A temporary supply shock will be handled adequately by policymakers, by reassuring the public and the corporate houses by taking adequate steps to support demand and supply. Indian production chains are more resilient and the banking and corporate sector have had the experience of handling demonetisation.There should be more awareness about hygiene arrangements on the highways, be it food or restroom facilities. Police, banks, hospitals and food suppliers should be added to keep their premises sanitised, as they are essential services. The virus outbreak in India could end swiftly, by the self-discipline of the people and the resolve of the Government and policymakers. In that case the economic impact of Coronavirus will not be felt much by the economy, although the temporary shock of the breakdown of the global supply chain will affect India.

In the US, $1 billion is given by the federal Government to States and hospitals for disaster preparedness. India spends $63 per capita on health as per WHO estimates and public health expenditure is $22 as per NHP estimates. The total healthcare expenditure in 2016 was about $110 billion and there is roughly a total public health expenditure of about $30 billion today. We do not have the economic resources to handle a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic but a better economic sense of the people, institutions and policymakers by choosing the preventive way, will hold us in good stead. A developing country may provide an important lesson for public health, to the developed world, in that case.

12,21-3-20,Cleaning the Ganga: Are we on the right path?,"There is a need to undertake the cleaning of individual watersheds of the river basin on a decentralised basis, providing local solutions to local problems/origins of pollution. Tapping pollution at the local level will not only help in curbing it at the source but will also make the system sustainable

With March 22 being celebrated as World Water Day each year, it is pertinent to take stock of India’s efforts to clean the most revered river of the country, the Ganga. Namami Gange the flagship programme which aims to clean Ganga on a mission mode, gets considerable attention from the Central Government in terms of funds and priority. Namami Gange lays much emphasis on pollution abatement through the improvement of sewage infrastructure. However, despite the concerted efforts being made towards cleaning the river, the results have not been very promising. The data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) indicate that there was no change in the water quality of the river between 2014-2018 in terms of bacteriological parameters. The CPCB has also been monitoring the organic load in the priority drains entering the river. In 2018, the pre-monsoon data showed that the drains discharged water of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) varying from 2.48 tonnes per day (TPD) to as high as 241.17 TPD. Further, the CPCB has also installed real-time water quality monitoring of the Ganga near the ghats and the drains entering the river, which highlights the areas with BOD higher than three mg/L. Further, the data from CPCB indicates that most of the river water from the stretch between Uttar Pradesh to West Bengal is unfit for drinking and at some places for bathing as well.

Another major cause of concern is the non-point source of pollution. The Government’s effort, in this case, has only been restricted to provide toilets in the villages at the bank of the river but there has been no strategy for other non-point sources of pollution such as farm and cattle waste runoff. Regulatory authorities do not monitor these pollution sources and the focus is only on monitoring sewage-related contaminants.

There clearly exists a gap in the effective implementation of this mission mode programme. The main objective of this flagship programme was to stop direct dumping of waste into the river by having effluent treatment plants and sewage infrastructure in all major riverine cities. Under this objective, the target was to create sewage treatment capacity for 3,700 million litres per day (MLD). However, by February 2019, the Government could only create a capacity of 480 MLD.

Some of the reasons for ineffective implementation can be sourced from the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2017, which highlighted unused funds, lack of staff and the absence of long-term planning. Because of this mismanagement a large amount of solid and liquid waste still finds its way into the river unchecked. The extended deadline of 2020 has promised that most of the drains would stop discharging filth into the river but this seems difficult to achieve unless the focus changes from centralised solutions to a decentralised ones.

One of the main interventions by the Government was setting up effluent/sewage treatment plants at a city level i.e. the centralised systems. This was because a greater population could be served and also to maximise the environmental and social gains. Such systems have been able to improve the quality of the river to some extent and also reduce further deterioration. But at many places, these treatment plants were designed according to the future needs and hence involved huge costs, while running under capacity. The Government’s plan to clean the river on mission mode might not lead to the desired results unless there is a shift towards the decentralised systems which is further strengthened through active stakeholders’ participation. These systems should be supported by the bye-laws of city management rules. It helps to treat the wastewater generated in small localities. The treated wastewater could be reused in replenishing the local water bodies. Further, such systems have several advantages such as lower costs, the potential to gradually increase the capacity, environmental benefits and also increased opportunities for reuse of the effluents.

Decentralised systems that can be undertaken for wastewater management include septic tanks, waste stabilisation ponds, constructed wetlands, membrane bioreactors (MBR) and land treatment. A constructed wetland in Pompia, Greece is one example where it was used for treating the wastewater generated by the local community. Due to the wetland, the treated effluent was equivalent in terms of quality to the tertiary treated municipal wastewater. There were high removal rates for Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN), phosphorus, Total Coliform (TC) and Fecal Coliform (FC). Hence, it has a potential to be reused in several areas, especially irrigation. Given that the world is facing the exacerbating effects of climate change, the availability of treated water for non-potable purposes can reduce its deleterious impact on dwindling water resources. Decentralised systems in such scenarios can be dependable and cost-effective solutions and the treated effluent can either be reused in some application or for replenishing the drains/channels which feed into the rivers.

India has also been able to build the technologies of constructed (floating) wetlands such as the Phytorid Wastewater Treatment, which has been designed especially to treat industrial, municipal and agricultural wastewater. Siddheshwar Lake in Pachpakhadi, Dawala Lake in Ovala as well as Dativali Lake in Diva are a few examples in Thane, where this decentralised system has been used and was successful in reducing BOD and COD in the wastewater.

Such systems can be replicated at most of the places, especially the 100 riverine cities at the bank of the river Ganga. These systems can help India in solving two major problems of the sector — wastewater pollution and a declining availability of the resource by treating the wastewater and putting it to use for irrigation, landscaping and so on, which will reduce the burden on freshwater resources. It is also a way of adapting to the mounting stress of climate change.

The emphasis should be on breaking down the puzzle of river cleaning into smaller problems and the provision of sewerage infrastructure cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution. Each smaller problem should have a customised solution addressing it locally. Local bodies play a crucial role in this and they should be empowered to participate in the process of decision-making, implementation and facilitation to reuse treated wastewater.

There is a need to undertake the cleaning of individual watersheds of the basin on a decentralised basis, providing local solutions to local problems/origins of pollution. Tapping pollution at the local level will not only help in curbing it at the source but will also make the system sustainable.

15,21-3-20,State auctions 23 mineral blocks worth Rs 4.87L crore,"The State Government has auctioned at least 23 iron ore, manganese and chrome ore blocks having resources worth Rs 4.87 lakh crore.

The Government of India had the State Government to go for auction of the mineral blocks whose term would end on March 31, 2020.

“This is one of the biggest auctions of its kind; and Odisha stands top among the States,” said a senior Department of Steel and Mines official. The State would get one of the highest premiums like 144% in one block, Guali Iron Ore, the auction of which ended on March 18.

While Jharkhand, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh are far behind in conducting auction of their mineral blocks, Odisha has undertaken the auction process without much hassle.

Out of the 23 auctioned mineral blocks, 11 are in Keonjhar district, eight in Sundargarh, three in Jajpur and one in Mayurbhanj. Resource wise, iron ore blocks contain 1,716.92 million tonnes (MT), manganese 8.77 MT and chrome ore 104.96 MT, all worth a total Rs 4,87,082 crore, according to official estimates.

While the auction process started for two chromite blocks on July 31, 2019, then on October 4 a second round of auction process began, which was cancelled; and later an NIT (notice inviting tender) was issued on December 6.

For Sukinda Chrome Ore and Guali Iron Ore, the NIT was issued in January and completed on March 17. The Sukinda block in Jajpur district having 406 hectares with a 92.55-MT deposit went to the TS Alloys with a premium of 93.75%. The TS Alloys is a subsidiary of Tata Steel, which gained the control of the Sukinda chromite mines having a deposit worth Rs 70,929 crore.

The Guali iron ore block auction came up with a floor price of 105% and ended in 144%, which went to the Jindal Steel and Power Limited (JSPL) on March 18. The Guali block in Keonjhar district is 355 hectares having a deposit of 198.74 MT worth Rs 39,877 crore.

This will be a captive mine of JSPL, which has a 6-MT steel complex at Angul and would expanding the plant capacity to 20 MT in near future.

The premium for iron ore mines in the State which ranges between 90% and 140% is higher than the average premium fetched in auction in Karnataka, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh.

While Odisha has auctioned 23 mineral blocks, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh have been able to auction one each and Karnataka has been successful in auctioning 12 blocks, officials here said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-auctions-23-mineral-blocks-worth-rs-4-87l-crore.html

24,21-3-20,Works Dept woes: Secy’s lack of tech expertise blamed,"Of late, the Odisha Works Department (OWD) which has the responsibility of construction, repair and maintenance of buildings, roads, bridges, highways and other related structures, is in a limbo thanks to an IAS officer being posted as Secretary of the engineering department. Though the norms say the OWD is nominally headed by a position of Engineer-in-Chief or EIC-cum-Secretary who reports to the Minister of Works.

As “Engineer-in-Chief”, this position holds technical responsibility; and as “Secretary”, it exercises administrative control of the department. But as the present Works Secretary is not an engineer and lacks technical expertise, there is absolutely no coordination and transparency in the department.

Earlier also, there were some instances of persons with engineering background being appointed as EIC-cum-Secretary by the Government’s Cabinet decision. Like AC Padhi (1974 to 81), Architect AK Biswal was shunted out in 1990 and in his place SP Gantayat was appointed. IAS Arabinda Behera (2003-04) was given the additional charge of Works Secretary with approval of the Cabinet.

Later, the Government appointed Nalini Kanta Pradhan as Chief Engineer superseding 22 engineers. He was also given additional one-year extension. But the Government drew flak when there were many financial irregularities like price escalation, poor quality work, delay in project completion and bride collapse. So, the Government appointed an IAS Officer to streamline the functioning of the department.

But though present, Works Secretary Kishan Kumar, has a good track record and is highly efficient, due to lack of technical knowledge and multiple responsibilities he has found it difficult to improve the functioning of the department.

So it is no surprise that most of the projects executed by OWD have been either stalled or moving at a snail’s pace. There are lot of deviations in utilisation of funds. Taking advantage of the Secretary’s lack of technical expertise, contractors are executing works worth crores of rupees on verbal assurance and there is absolutely no transparency.

It is alleged that taking advantage of it some unscrupulous officials are also fixing tenders. The Chief Engineer (Roads) is alleged to be promoting nepotism and awarding contracts to people with dubious background.

Besides, there is lot of delay in getting forest clearances for projects.

This has led to dissatisfaction among most of the engineers. They feel that they are paying for the sins of former Engineer-in-Chief and Works Secretary Pradhan.

The engineers opined that as per the Supreme Court’s order to appoint a permanent administrator for the Jagannath Temple, Kumar cannot function as full time SJTA Chief Administrator and the Works Secretary and do justice to both responsibilities.

The service engineer association is demanding to appoint an engineer with good track record as EIC to improve the functioning of OWD.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/works-dept-woes--secy---s-lack-of-tech-expertise-blamed.html

28,21-3-20,COVID-19 test strategy: Let India follow S Koria,"In a somewhat strange response to a leading news channel, Dr Raman Gagankhedkar, Head of Epidemiology at Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), sounded quite sceptical about going for more tests for COVID-19, on the ground that, more testing wouldn’t yield desired results as this may give rise to identification of more COVID-19 positive cases.

And furthermore, those individuals who have tested positive might not submit themselves for getting quarantined, as they may give false name and identity and become untraceable thereafter. Ridiculous isn’t it?

The whole exercise is not about building a fake profile of achievement for the Government as regards containing the COVID-19 outbreak but taking concrete measures on the ground, so that, the outbreak is indeed controlled.

So, the point is actually it needs to be clear about how to deal with this fatal outbreak? And amongst all of this, the most important aspect is our coronavirus testing strategy.

About 12,000 tests have been conducted in India since February. South Korea has conducted over 2.5 lakh tests so far, which is 10,000 tests per day. And as per reports, India has conducted about 5-10 tests per million people, whereas South Korea has conducted more than 4,000 tests per million people.

According to ICMR, ‘Symptomatic Testing’ is the correct approach for now and which means only those are tested who have travelled from countries affected by high rate of coronavirus infection or those who have come in contact with those who are tested positive for COVID-19. Amongst them only those showing symptoms of Coronavirus infection like dry cough, fever, shortness of breath are prioritised.

So, the problem remains in the fact that, since we are not going for adequate tests, we may not be in a position to identify all the positive cases that might be existing or that might be coming up. And this shall indeed mean inviting a situation which shall be even worse than Italy.

However, as per reports, Italy started with three cases of corona-positive cases on February 15 and South Korea with 28 cases but little did anyone know then that, Italy will pose as a class apart with over 30,000 positive cases and over 2,500 dead. And the country will be under full lockdown. However, as of now South Korea has less than 9,000 positive cases, and less than 90 dead, which is distinguishably lesser than Italy.

Arguably, what Italy didn’t and South Korea did do, was lot of testing. In Indian context it shall be prudent if we follow the South Korean example and test all, with any of the symptoms of flu associated with COVID-19 infection.

However, South Korea enhanced its testing capacity from January onwards, so that large numbers of the population can be tested but Italy lagged behind in that field and showed deplorable lethargy in the conduct of mass testing, quarantining people and the result is before us.

The argument from some quarters is not encouraging enough since a view is doing rounds that we are such a large population and only around 200 cases by now have tested positive, but the point is how can we be so sure about the positive cases since we are not doing enough tests.

Say for example America, in the beginning, the situation there was not so alarming and the administration was not serious about self-quarantine and testing. Now the case in US is quite precarious, it has over 6,500 cases, and out of which about 120 dead.

Coming back to India, the present state of the infection in India is at stage two, which is called ‘local transmission’ or from affected person to healthy persons. And this is the right momemt when we can take effective measures to control the outbreak.

When Stage 3 reaches, it shall affect large chunks of the populace, which is called, ‘community transmission’, and as per experts bringing things to control once the outbreak reaches stage three, is almost difficult and shall be out of bounds.

The stand of the Indian Government so far is, that it has conducted random tests among 1, 000 people with no travel or contact history and no one of them have tested positive for coronavirus, therefore, for now the Government shall adhere to its symptomatic testing policy.

However, what seems important is apart from social distancing and other precautionary measures, we need to build our capacity for going for tests with adequate human resources and testing facilities. According to reports if we conduct 6,000 tests per day, India would exhaust all of its testing kits in less than four weeks.

However, given the stand of the Government of India on the condition in which ideally one should go for coronavirus testing is adequately discussed above, which is in sharp contrast to the Ministry of Health’s definition of “suspect cases” of coronavirus, which says, “those with severe respiratory illnesses, that cannot be explained by any other cause must be considered as ‘suspect cases’ for COVID-19 even if they do not have any travel or contact history.”

But ironically, it has been the consistent statement that is coming from various Government agencies that, for the time being only those with a travel history of contact history are being put for testing, which is in sharp contrast to the Ministry of health’s position on the issue.

It is true that, though the number of COVID-19 positive cases is on a rising trend but so far it has not been on a meteoric upsurge as far as India is concerned. Therefore, we still have hope, but how long? Non-disclosure and non-determination of positive cases owing to our inability to cater to the requisites for conducting adequate tests shall be fatal for the nation. Can you imagine another Italy or China in India?

The essential take away is, we have to be responsible, no doubt, social distancing, no unnecessary movement outside our homes have to be strictly adhered to, but at the same time we need to rethink of our coronavirus testing strategy, that is to make it more diverse across the cross section of society, even if someone shows severe respiratory illnesses as defined by the Health Ministry irrespective of travel or contact history.

Rawat directed all the DMs to ensure that continuous publicity is undertaken to raise public awareness on measures for safety from coronavirus.

The general public should be made aware to maintain social distance. Appealing senior citizens and those aged below 10 years to remain indoors, he exhorted the citizens to make the Janata curfew this Sunday a success.

Rawat directed the district magistrates to make additional district magistrate rank officer the nodal officer in their respective districts.

These nodal officers should inspect all the hospitals to check the preparations and keep updating the district magistrate consistently. They should also inform about gaps and other types of requirements. The district magistrates should make necessary arrangements to meet the requirements.

Stressing on the need for sanitising public places, Rawat directed the DMs to undertake regular monitoring and seek sanitisation report consistently.

39,21-3-20,Endangered house sparrow making slow comeback,"The house sparrow, once an integral part of our immediate environment, all but disappeared almost two decades ago. These common birds that lived in the cavities of our houses and polished off our leftover food today sit on the red list of the endangered species of The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

Scientific studies have established that the house sparrows follow us everywhere and simply cannot live where we don't. Fossil evidence suggests that these birds shared their space with early humans.

According to a 2018 Royal Society of London report, the bond between humans and sparrows goes back 11,000 years; and the starch-friendly genes of the house sparrow tell us a story linked to our own evolution. Agriculture, the study said, triggered similar adaptation in three very different species, dogs, house sparrows and humans.

Around the start of agriculture, the urban house sparrow split from the wild birds; it has a pair of genes, AMY2A, which helps it digest complex carbohydrates, the reason that it shares our love of starchy wheat and rice.

Conservationists attribute the decline in the population of house sparrows to the unfriendly architecture of our homes, chemical fertilisers in our crops, noise pollution that disturbs acoustic ecology and noxious exhaust fumes from vehicles. The debate about whether the digital revolution has jammed the air passages is inconclusive, but common people say it is no coincidence that the house sparrow started disappearing in the late 1990s when mobile phones came to India.

Concerted efforts are being made to bring back the house sparrow. According to scientist-conservationist Mohammed Dilawar, ""Earlier, the house sparrow and other common species were not considered conservation material by scientists, and common people were far removed from conservation as a subject.""

A vigorous campaign by the outfit he heads, ""Nature Forever"", led to March 20 being observed as the World Sparrow Day; and the house sparrow being declared the State bird of Delhi in 2012. Today, the sparrow enjoys a high profile globally; its conservation has become a people's movement. However, little data are available on the impact of the campaign that focussed on simple, doable and affordable things like putting nesting boxes and water/grain bowls in balconies.

It is largely believed that the house sparrow is making a steady come back. ""Thanks to the sheer number of people who have been longing to see the bird that connects them to their childhood, the house sparrow is coming back,"" says Panchami Manoo Ukil, an avid birdwatcher. Many places in Odisha too have seen a comeback of these little avian species.

But not everyone is fond of the house sparrow; in fact, quite the opposite. Some people see the sparrow as an invasive pest, a ""kind of brown-winged rat stealing our food"". In an article in smithsonianmagazine.com, biologist and author Rob Dunn said the human love-hate relationship with the bird was typical of human beings:

Dunn write, ""I can tell you that when sparrows are rare, we tend to like them, and when they are common, we tend to hate them. Our fondness is fickle and predictable and says far more about us than them. They are just sparrows, neither lovely nor terrible, but just birds searching for sustenance and finding it again and again where we live.""

46,21-3-20,C’garh considering converting hotels into isolation centres,"Sanitizer with over 65 percent spirit content will alone be able to provide safety and not whisky or rum: Singhdeo

The Chhattisgarh government is considering using hotels for isolation centres for Covid-19 suspects, state health minister TS Singhdeo said here on Friday.

“Together we are facing a disease for which we do not have any medicine. So, the best way to fight Coronavirus is first of all try not getting it and second do not become a means to spread it,” Singhdeo said.

He expressed satisfaction over measures adopted at the Swami Vivekananda airport for screening of passengers.

On Friday, seven more seven suspected persons who arrived at the Raipur airport, were placed in isolation with their consent, he said, adding: “I think it is a great service by those seven people to save, not only their own loved ones but also unknown people of the society.”

Commenting on the reports doing the rounds on social media that alcohol can contain Coronavirus, he said, “A mixture of more than 65 to 70 percent of alcohol or spirit content, alone is capable of disinfecting the virus.”

“So, a sanitizer with more than 65 percent spirit content, will alone be able to provide safety and not whisky or rum,” he said.

“Wash hand with soap and water for more than 20 seconds and it will be more effective.”

76,21-3-20,Hanging a deterrent to potential rapists: Investigator,"Pramod Singh Kushwaha, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Special Cell, who was during Nirbhaya gang rape and murder in 2012, the additional DCP (South) and headed the investigation team, said the hanging is a tribute to the departed soul and this will also act as a deterrent to other rapists.

On Friday, as the four convicts were executed in the premises of Tihar Jail, the investigators recalled the challenges they encountered while probing the case.

Kushwaha said there was a separate investigation team that was designated to follow-up of the case and he was also part of that SIT.

""We ensured that the family was kept informed about the developments in the case and the arrests so that they remained confident in the investigation,"" said Kushwaha.

Anil Sharma was the Station House Officer (SHO) of the Vasant Vihar police station where the case was registered in 2012 which had led to an outrage across the nation. ""This is a tribute to the departed soul. Finally, her soul can rest in peace. We are there for her family,"" he said.

Sharma said he had not missed a single hearing in the case and was still in touch with the victim's family.

Recalling his days, Sharma said students used to be sitting outside the police station and police personnel escorted the accused to court through the rear entrance by crossing a drain, a slum cluster, through PVR Priya, all while ensuring that they are not lynched by the angry public.

""Apart from this, I also had thejob of collecting evidence in the case, handling her friend who was also with her in the bus,"" he said. Sharma, who was also managing other cases at the time, said he used to visit the victim and forged a bond with her.

""I regularly spent time with her. I had even told her O Henry's popular story 'The Last Leaf' as her story was similar to it,"" said Sharma. The officer recalled how they had spoken about celebrating New Year and Christmas together, but the woman passed away on December 29, 2012 in Singapore during treatment.

Sharma said her family was like an extended family for him and they always had good things to say about the police team which investigated the case.

""During the trial, I lost my elder brother and father. While I was bathing my brother's body for last rites, I got a call from a senior officer about the case, I immediately got up and attended it without telling him about the tragedy. That has been my level of dedication,"" he said.

The then DCP (South) Chhaya Sharma had asked Benita Mary Jailer, an IPS officer fresh out of training, to remain with the family during that trying time.

""It was a landmark investigation that was completed in just 18 days of the incident. In first 18 hours, the accused were identified and three of them arrested as well. Over 100 policemen worked round the clock to crack the case and police collected unimpeachable scientific evidence,"" Chhaya Sharma had said earlier.

The arrest of the juvenile and Akshay Singh required a massive manhunt because Akshay had escaped to a village in Naxalite belt in Bihar, she had said.

The then police commissioner, Neeraj Kumar, said it was a challenging case but they ended up cracking it open within five days and filed the chargesheet within 17 days. The police got their first break in the case when they checked the CCTV footage from the area in south Delhi where the two had been dumped.

""Overnight we located the bus and then its driver and interrogated him. By the next afternoon, Ram Singh confessed that he had been driving the bus,"" he recalled.

Singh, who was subsequently jailed, allegedly committed suicide in his cell in Tihar in March 2013. What made matters more difficult for the police was the mounting public and media outrage over the crime, and the demand for quick results.

""The juvenile involved in the crime was apprehended from Delhi's Anand Vihar bus terminal by our team. He was working as a bus conductor and his co-accused told the police that he had a particular way of hailing passengers. He was apprehended on the basis of this clue,"" said former CP.

Kumar stressed that he took ""all the brickbats"" and ensured that his officers did not face public anger that grew as more and more gory details about the crime came to light.

""I faced the media outrage and the public wrath. I succeeded in shielding my officers. I told them, 'I will face the brunt of the media trial and all the criticism. You people carry on',"" he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hanging-a-deterrent-to-potential-rapists--investigator.html

78,21-3-20,Khaki Files throws light on arrest of Akshay from naxal-hit Bihar village,"For Delhi police inspector Rituraj and his team, arresting the accused, Akshay Singh, in the Nirbhaya case, was not easy. The police team who had to visit a naxal-affected village in Bihar had to keep a low profile to nab him.

According to police investigation, Akshay, the cleaner of the bus in which the 23-year-old physiotherapy intern was gangraped, had left for his native village in Aurangabad district after committing the ghastly crime.

""The police traced Akshay through a mobile number of Ram Singh, the driver of the bus and the first accused to be arrested in the 2012 case. Ram Singh had shared number with the investigators during interrogation,"" said police.

According to Khaki Files, the book written by former Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar during, who was also police chief during the heinous act, Akshay had used the phone number to speak to his family back home and it was registered with a service provider in Aurangabad.

This breakthrough led the police to believe Akshay could be hiding in his village. Delhi police inspector Rituraj and his team rushed to Patna by flight and took the road from there to reach Aurangabad.

On December 19, 2012, three days after the gang rape, the Delhi police team contacted the Tandwa police station under whose jurisdiction Akshay's village fell.

""The Delhi police team then learnt that the village area was affected by Left-wing extremism and the team members were required to tread cautiously without drawing undue attention,"" Rituraj said.

""The police station in Tandwa had been attacked four times by naxals and was therefore heavily fortified with personnel from Bihar Military Police deployed on its rooftop, armed with light machine guns,"" according to the book.

Sub-inspector Ajay Kumar from the local police station joined the Delhi police team and they decided to quietly recce Akshay's village. Local intelligence gathering suggested that Akshay could have escaped to his in-laws' residence, also in a naxal-infested area.

Inspector Rituraj's team decided to wait and sought help from watchmen in Akshay's village in nabbing him. Soon enough the wait paid off. One of the chowkidars spotted the accused at Tandwa railway station on December 21 and alerted the police who arrested Akshay.

Rituraj contacted the district magistrate to obtain a transit remand and he introduced the Delhi police official to the district judge. The judge took Rituraj to his residence, called his staff and dictated the order.

It was 9 PM on December 21 when the police received the transit remand but Rituraj left for Varanasi the same night in dense fog and low visibility with the accused and his team.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/khaki-files-throws-light-on-arrest-of-akshay-from-naxal-hit-bihar-village.html

The JMM MLA targeting former Chief Minister Raghubar Das said that the former CM has made such a domicile policy which indirectly favoured outsiders, especially those from Bihar.

On earlier occasion too, Lobin had attacked BJP and former Chief Minister Raghubar Das saying that BJP Government policy was such that jobs were given to people of Arrah-Chhapra. Lobin raised the issue of outsiders taking possession of land taken from the raiyyats in HEC while discussing demand grants. The JMM MLA said that the people of Ara, Chhapra came and settled here, while the original Raiyat here became beggar. He accused the previous Government of imposing such as local policy which opened the door for outsiders. The BJP protesting against Lobin remark staged uproar in House and later boycotted in the House.

The JMM on several occasions had opposed the Raghubar Das’ local policy. After the formation of Grand Alliance Government in State JMM president Shibu Soren had said that the previous Raghubar Das-led Government's ‘Sthaniya Niti’ of making 1985 as the cut-off year for being eligible to be a resident of Jharkhand was ‘not proper’, and that the policy will be changed. Similarly, at the 41st foundation day function of JMM in Dumka, a resolution was passed. The leaders urged the CM to implement domicile as per 1932 Khatiyan. With the introduction of such domicile policy, those having land records as per 1932 land records will be given preference in III and IV grade jobs.

Sources said that though JMM’s stand is clear on domicile issue, the contentious issue is likely to bring heart burns among other constituents of Grand Alliance especially Congress and RJD. The BJP sensing the issue has asked Congress and RJD to clear their stand on domicile issue.

The BJP Govt headed by former CM Raghubar Das in 2016 announced the new domicile policy.

As per the provisions of the Domicile Policy, people living in Jharkhand before 1985 are considered local inhabitants and avail all the facilities offered in the policy.

Sources said that though Raghubar Das announced the domicile policy it created rift in BJP too as many tribal leaders were opposed to Government fixing 1985 cut-off date for defining the local issue.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-boycotts-house---over-jmm-mla---s-local-policy-remark.html

92,21-3-20,Schools’ closure: Nuapada villagers hold demo,"Hundreds of villagers of Karandaba, Mahuljharan, Katapada and Mahulpada villages of Khariar block in Nuapada district arrived at the office of the BEO (Block Education Officer), Khariar on Wednesday forenoon and staged a demonstration by locking the main gate.

The objective was to express their resentment over the decision of the School and Mass Education Department, Government of Odisha, for closer and merger of the schools in their respective villages.

As per SME Department decision, under the policy of rationalisation and consideration of schools, a total of 265 elementary and secondary schools in Nuapada district are going to be closed and merged. Out of them, 127 primary schools are having less than 20 students, 98 schools are having less than 40 students and located within 1 km distance of another school and the third category consists of 36 upper primary schools having class I to VIII and the UP section enrollment is has less than 20.

""Our villages are located in interior pockets inside forests and there are hilly streams. How can we let our children travel through such hilly and lonely tracks"", asked the villagers.

The schools in these villages were established about ten to fifteen years ago.

""We never admitted our children in schools of nearby villages. Even there were no school only because of the distance. Instead, we engaged ""Ghinua masters"" (literary it means purchased teachers) to teach our children. If the schools are now closed we will start our schools as before,"" said the villagers.

The primary school at Karandaba village in Lanji Panchayat has 14 students, which is in the closure list. The nearest school now is Lanji, which is 3 km far.

""We ran the school in Karandaba for seven years before the Government established one in our village. We had appointed Prem Barik and Jasobanta Majhi as Ghinua masters and paying them paddy as their remuneration. If the school is closed now, we will start it on our own as before,"" told Ward Member of Karandaba Supari Majhi, .

Phulmati Majhi of the village informed that the villagers were contributing paddy, rice etc towards the remuneration of the teachers and even running MDM through contribution. ""When the Government started MDM, we also started our own feeding programme,"" she added.

Phulmati was the cook at that time doing the work free of cost for the children. People of other villages have also similar stories to share. The Mahulpada primary school of the same Panchayat has 18 students now. ""Our students have to walk for 2 km and cross a stream,"" informed the people of Mahulpada.

Likewise, the Upper Primary School in Mahuljharan has 21 students from class 1 to 8. ""We know, the number is low, but the problem is one has to cover 3 km ghat road in side forest to reach the nearest school at Birighat,"" the villagers said.

The villagers are very much annoyed, because there was no consultation with them before taking such decision. ""Even the School Management Committee (SMC) was not consulted,"" said the villagers.

""In this background, it is necessary that the Government should revert the decision. Furthermore, we have to see whether the lead schools where the closed school would be merged are equipped to accommodate the burden,"" said president of Jami Jangal Mukti Andolan Khuturam Sunani.

""We demand withdrawal of the closer and merger policy,"" the villagers said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/schools----closure--nuapada-villagers-hold-demo.html

94,21-3-20,Corona: Curfew-like situation in Sambalpur,"Much before the appeal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to observe ‘Janata Curfew’ on Sunday, Sambalpur city witnessed a similar situation with crowded places looking almost empty. People preferred to stay home and not join crowd like before.

The situation in the roads and markets spoke volumes of the fear and the alertness of the people to beat the menace. The road from GM University to Court (Kacheri Chowk) that hardly remains free during any part of the day, bore a deserted look all through the day.

Similar was the situation in most of the daily markets like Gole Bazar, Professor Colony, Ainthapali, Dhanupali and other places. People’s awareness or fear apart, the district administration and Health Department had also taken all precautionary measures to control the situation. Fortunately, no one here was found to the Corona positive so far.

Those who were admitted in VIMSAR, Burla were given clean chits as their blood samples were found to be negative.

“But hospital authorities are ready to face any challenge with isolated wards in ICU and ventilators,” informed Sambalpur Collector Subham Saxena. At the same time the district administration, in the meanwhile, had closed all saloons, spas, gyms, beauty parlours etc to stop contamination of the disease. Further, it had released emergency numbers like 1077, 0663-2412087, 0663 -2533405 where common people or the persons with corona symptoms could call to inform their health related problems.

96,21-3-20,‘Include Ansupa in Ramsar Convention’,"Cuttack MP Bhartruhari Mahtab has demanded in the Lok Sabha that the Union Government include the Ansupa Lake in the Ramsar Convention. Mahtab said the Ansupa Lake, the sweet water lake on the Mahanadi riverbank in Banki subdivision, spreads over 5,000 hectares of land. Recently, the lake has been cleared of weeds with financial support of Rs 2.3 crore from the World Bank. This lake attracts thousands of migratory birds throughout the year, especially in winter. Fish cultivation in the lake enhances the income of the fishermen in over four gram panchayats around it.

“The State Government is now maintaining the lake. If it is included in Ramsar convention, the lake will draw the attention of international organisations and thereby can get a special tourism spot status. Like the Chilika Lake, the Ansupa will also generate funds.

97,21-3-20,Coronavirus has united Indians,"Don’t get me wrong, but I am happy in a way that things have panned out. For the first time in 45 years, India is uniting, and out of sheer fear. The world has united too in its desperate fight against the dreaded Coronavirus, but then I am singling out India because first, I am Indian and second, because this is a country where division rules, fragmented independence is reckoned to be its core democratic strength. Everybody in India has an independent opinion that is most often different from the next person’s, and therefore there are countless pockets of opinions. Everybody is either a Bengali or a Gujrati, a Marathi or a Madrasi, a Malayali or a Kashmiri. Nobody is an Indian. Everybody is a know-all. And argument is considered to be the universal birthright of every individual, for right reasons or the wrong. The spectrum of divergence was all too evident this time also when the Corona scare started surfacing. If someone said “I think we should wear masks”, three others would jump up to say “Are you out of your mind? Why should you wear masks? Boss, this Corona thing is just like any other flu, don’t get worried, don’t make yourself a laughing stock by wearing one of those weird things on the face”. Someone said “Use a handkerchief at least when sneezing”. The next person would instantly taunt “Where will you get 130 crore handkerchiefs? Sneeze, as you have always sneezed.” End of story.

The divergence still exists, but it is narrowing down. I am very happy to see it in my city, Kolkata – the protest capital of the country, the “cholbe na, cholbe na” mega metro – and therefore a barometer of the general pan India situation. People are actually wearing masks, staying indoors, telling each other about essential hygiene; roads are largely empty, people are more cautious and what was very encouraging to see this morning was local youth at a roadside tea stall accost a guy who had openly sneezed and had shot the sputum out of his mouth without a second thought and walked on as is habit. There were five of them, none had masks, they stood some five feet away and screamed “Who do you think you are? You look educated enough to understand the prevailing situation, and yet you sneeze openly? Do you know how much of germs that greenish-grey stuff you spat out on the road carry? Now you have to wipe it clean with whatever you have, we will give you water, but you wash the road”. I was impressed. I couldn’t believe it was Kolkata.

In 1975 too, unity was born out of fear, but it was fear of a different kind. It was an administrative fiat, a state of emergency declared under Article 352 of the Constitution by the President, and therefore it was binding on all. All law enforcement agencies were put to use to ensure that for 18 months till January 1977, nobody across the country dared to violate the rules. Trains and buses ran on time, cabbies didn’t refuse, people rushed to office, all State and Central government offices recorded attendance sharp at 10 am, the usual chaos evaporated from life. And people got adjusted to the new lifestyle. Before 1975, there were the three wars -- the Sino-Indian conflict in 1962, the first Indo-Pak war of 1965 and the second, aka the Bangladesh war of 1971 – and I was witness to the changes they brought about in usual Bengal life style. Those were days when total curfew ruled, blackouts became the norm after dusk, all car headlights were painted half-black so that the high beam didn’t travel and of course everybody would run towards the basement or get out on the streets the moment the sirens sounded the alarm. There was total and absolute Unity.

Forty five or 50 years is a long slice of Time, enough for people to forget what sweeping Fear is. Peacetime Indians have long got immersed in a foolish self-belief: “Nothing will happen to me”. The Corona virus seems to have shaken that confidence somewhat. Doubts have crept in: “What if…”, they are asking now. Collective concern has surfaced for a change, and it is right too. Change yourself, change others. The worrisome thing about India is the utter lack of discipline and basic hygiene. So every bad habit is considered okay throughout the length and breadth of the country. It is time for a reform, a thorough change of habits. There is no bravery in falling ill and making other people sick. Just consider this. We have weathered nipah, swine flu, jaundice, hepatitis, flu, plague, smallpox, malaria, cholera, SARS, chikungunya, dengue, zika, avian flu, Japanese encephalitis, so on and so forth. But Corona is perhaps the first time that an Indian Prime Minister has had to address the nation, that every State head across the country has pulled out all stops to prevent a catastrophic outbreak. As I pray like every other Indian for the crisis to blow over, I also pray that India emerges a stronger, more united and healthier country in future.

98,21-3-20,"Dec 16 memories send shivers down my spine even today, says former police chief's daughter","Quick action of Delhi Police led to nabbing of all the culprits within three days of the gruesome 'Nirbhaya' rape, but the world changed for us, recall the younger daughter and wife of former police chief Neeraj Kumar.

Talking to PTI, Ankita, now in her late 20s and a pianist by profession, says she was dumbfounded after her father briefly mentioned the gruesome rape of the physiotherapy intern on December 16, 2012. She says memories of that night sends shivers down her spine even today.

Expressing relief at the outcome of the case, Ankita and her mother, Mala Kumar, recall how the growing protests against Kumar had made them suggest that he resign.

""As pressure was building, I did not want him to go through the ordeal. I wanted him to quit because it was becoming too much for me to take. Everyone around me was changing, I was getting threat calls and someone said they wished me and my sister get raped too, to make the police wake up,"" Ankita reminisced.

Both mother and daughter were critical of press and said the media only wanted to carry anti-Neeraj mar stories and anything that did not pander to their rhetoric was never aired or written.

""One day, I was at my piano school located in the basement of my house and a journalist from a TV channel walked in with his camera and asked me to comment on the inefficient police headed by my father. ""I confronted him that he was in the basement of my house and he could easily harm me, and my father will only come to know once the damage has been done. I was trying to draw home a point, but probably he never understood,"" she says.

99,21-3-20,Safdarjung docs remember victim as brave woman,"Recalling the days when Nirbhaya was treated in Safdarjanj Hospital in 2012, the doctors remembered her as a brave woman and said that with the hanging of the four convicts law had taken its course.

Dr BD Athani, who was the medical superintendent of Safdarjung Hospital when Nirbhaya was treated, said they have got ""closure"".

""I was involved in the medical management part of it. It was a very heinous crime that they committed. Law has taken its course. We had referred the patient to Singapore. We have got closure as far as this patient is concerned,"" he said.

Athani said they were under immense pressure at that time and despite that medically, the case withstood scrutiny. ""We did not spare any efforts in treating her and tried till the end. I appreciate the team of doctors. Right from the senior resident who was on duty when she was brought to the hospital to the other doctors. They were all emotionally affected but it did not affect the treatment,"" he said.

A doctor, who was part of the team that treated her, said at that time, most of the women resident doctors in the hospital were traumatised seeing what she had gone through.

""She was an adult and she was with her friend when the incident happened. It was not even that late in the night. All the resident doctors who were on duty were shaken up. They felt it could have been any one of them in her place,"" she recalled.

The doctor said they have the same feelings as any woman who has followed the case closely would have at this point. ""She was a very, very brave woman. When I saw her during her surgery, we didn't know she had so many problems. She was so calm and composed even after going through so much trauma. That's what we still remember and admire her for it,"" the doctor told.

The 23-year-old physiotherapy intern was brutally gangraped in a moving bus by six men, including a juvenile, on the night of December 16, 2012.

100,21-3-20,Child marriage stalled; 3 held in Baleswar,"The police after rescuing a minor girl who was married off to a major 10 days ago arrested three persons including the bride groom, his mother and mother of the minor.

All the accused persons were forwarded to court and they were further sent to jail under judicial custody following rejection of their bail petitions.

The police, sitting tight even after knowing such illegal marriage in the district, swung into action after pressure on them mounted from various quarters including social media.

The incident took place in Jaydevkasaba village under Sadar police station limits on March 11 and it is alleged that the wedding was solemnised when police were mute spectators.

The local Child Development Project Officer (CDPO) rushed to the marriage venue along with her three staffers and police after receiving information about marriage of the minor girl with Niranjan Behera of Tapasi village in presence of the relatives of the groom and bride.

All of them asked them to stall the illegal marriage, yet it is alleged a local leader of ruling BJD and family members of the groom allegedly obstructed the enforcing actions and the nuptial knot was tied despite resistance from the enforcement agencies.

The video of hot conversations among the local leader and the police and CDPO went viral where the leader warned the authorities of dire consequence.

A distant relative of the minor while lodged a complaint with police following instructions of Superintendent of Police, the arrests were made and the minor was rescued. However, no action had been taken so far against the local leader who was involved in a brawl with the authorities.

Chairman, Child Welfare Committee, Bhagirathi Barik said the minor was rescued since the marriage was illegal. She was lodged in a child care institution.

107,21-3-20,Device invented to fight virus,"Amidst the panic across the world over the rapid spreading of pandemic Covid 19 disease, IIT and AIIMS alumni have invented a device named Airlens Minus Corona (-Corona) to counter the robust spreading of coronavirus.

As the deadly virus has infected about 2.3 lakh people worldwide and claimed over 9,357 lives, the scientists have come out with a technology.

According to the scientists, the device will fight the coronavirus with corona discharge.

Robo Sapien — human like machine — will operate on the mechanism of charged or ionised water droplets which is ionised using the corona discharge. The ionised water in return oxidises the viral protein reducing it to a non-harmful molecule.

Dr Sashi Ranjan, Co-Founder of PerSapien Innovations said, ""Diving deeper into the scientific research I did at NUS, Singapore, I realised that oxidation is one of the most potent antimicrobial tools which can sterilize the entire city. Our technology uses an optimal combination of electric energy and water atomisation techniques to induce a charge on water droplets while creating the most potent oxidative entities, Hydroxyl radicals that can oxidize and kill the coronavirus.""

The ""Robo-Sapien"" machine will travel on the streets especially targeting the public gathering places like hospitals, bus stops, railway stations, shopping malls, etc. to sterilize the city from the spreading of the virus.

Debayan Saha, Co-Founder of PerSapien said, ""Alcohols (like ethanol or IPA) are known to inactivate viruses by denaturing their protein coat. But the alcohol-based hand sanitizer is useful for individuals or for sanitizing surfaces at a smaller scale (home, offices, etc.) in the fight against Coronavirus. However, this is insufficient in such an emergency as it is impractical to use alcohol for sanitizing cities.""

""Thus, to combat the virus at a global scale/ national level, the entire city needs to be sanitized for which Airlens Minus Corona (-Corona) has been created,"" he added further",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/device-invented-to-fight-virus.html

The exhibition showcases how food items are associated with superstitious beliefs of India.

The culinary world is not an exception through the power of mystery, testifying of a very ancient heritage, bequeathed by the Vedas, 7000 years ago; by the delicate balance of the 3 vital energies which go through our body.

“The Totka series contains all the nods to the symbols that were dear to me: the third eye, Gond art, protective mother earth, knowledge of ayurveda plants, temple offering, chakras, tribal dance and finally Shivatri. I have a great respect for all these mythological references. With regards, I add a final Namaste dedicated to my creative duo, the Indian photographer Varun Namdev”, said Enora.

Enora further said that the marvelous is everywhere and seizes every chance to be embodied in the smallest details of the daily life : in the small mountains of colorful spices, in the pattern of a sari, in the wide-eyed of Kali, in the rituals flowery protection, in the cacophony of the horns that never disturb the cows chilling on a four-way. It is about permanent saturation, a colorful epileptic score that forcefully invites our senses to a dance that we are not ready for.

“India heckles our habits, upsets our rasas, whispers magnificent mythological stories,” Enora added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/painting-exhibition----totka----on-display-at-alliance-francaise-de-bhopal-painting-exhibition----totka----on-display-at-alliance-francaise-de-bhopal.html

124,21-3-20,DPP proposes higher desi content and incentives for local software,"In an effort to give a boost to 'Make in India' project of the NDA Government in defence manufacturing, the draft of Defence Procurement Procedure(DPP) 2020 proposes higher indigenous content and incentives for local material and software.

The draft unveiled by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday here also provides for making after sales support a part of capital acquisition contract, leasing of defence equipment introduced for the first time and emphasis on product export under offsets. The proposed DPP also offers incentive under offsets for units in Defence corridor.

The main focus of the DPP 2020 is to further increase indigenous manufacturing and reducing timelines for procurement of defence equipment. These and several other such innovative measures were part the draft finalized by a high-level committee headed by Director General Acquisition, Ministry of Defence that was set up in August 2019.

Speaking on the occasion, the defence minister said the objective of the DPP is to make India self-reliant and a global manufacturing hub. The government is constantly striving to formulate policies to empower the private industry including MSMEs in order to develop the eco-system for indigenous defence production. The defence industry of India is a strategically important sector having huge potential for growth. It needs to be the catalyst for India's economic growth and realisation of our global ambitions.

With experience gained by the industry and the Ministry of Defence , it is now time to take further steps to strengthen 'Make in India' initiative, refine Life Cycle Support of procured equipment and platforms and hasten the defence acquisition process by further simplifying the procedures & reducing the overall procurement timelines, he added.

The major changes proposed in the new DPP are hike in indigenous content ratio by more than ten per cent to support Make In India. Also, use of raw materials, special alloys and software incentivised as use of indigenous raw material is a very important aspect of 'Make in India' and Indian Companies are world leaders in software. A new category Buy(Global-Manufacture in India) is part of the proposed DPP with minimum 50 per cent indigenous content.

Leasing has been introduced as a new category for acquisition in addition to existing 'Buy' & 'Make' categories to substitute huge initial capital outlays with periodical rental payments. Leasing is permitted under two categories i.e, Lease (Indian) where Lessor is an Indian entity and is the owner of the assets and Lease (Global) where Lessor is a Global entity. This will be useful for military equipment not used in actual warfare like transport fleets, trainers and simulators.

The scope and options for Product Support have been widened to include contemporary concepts in vogue, namely Performance Based Logistics (PBL), Life Cycle Support Contract (LCSC), Comprehensive Maintenance Contract (CMC)to optimise life cycle support for equipment. The capital acquisition contract would normally also include support for five years beyond the warranty period.

The DPP draft was prepared by a Review Committee based on the recommendations of all stakeholders, including private industry. In order to accrue advantage of domain specialisation of various subject matter experts, eight sub-committees headed by Lt Gen/equivalent officers were constituted to assist the review committee. These committees carried out extensive deliberations and interactions over a period of six months to formulate their respective charters.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/dpp-proposes-higher-desi-content-and-incentives-for-local-software.html

127,21-3-20,"Crisis of confidence in MP, CM quits before trust vote","Ending days of speculation over the survival of 15-month-old Madhya Pradesh Government after 21 Cong MLAs rebelled against their own Government, Chief Minister Kamal Nath tendered his resignation to Governor Lalji Tandon around 1 pm on Friday. Later, the Madhya Pradesh Assembly was adjourned sine die. The Governor asked Kamal Nath to continue as the caretaker Chief Minister until the next Government is formed.

The Congress veteran stepped down a day after the Supreme Court ordered the Madhya Pradesh Assembly Speaker to conduct a floor test on Friday by 5 pm.

As the House assembled at 2 pm for the trust vote, only BJP legislators turned up, while the Congress MLAs remained absent. Speaker NP Prajapati read out the agenda saying that the meeting was convened as per the directives of the apex court. He said that since Kamal Nath has submitted his resignation, there was no point in holding the trust vote. He then announced the sine die adjournment of the Assembly.

Earlier on Friday while talking to the media, the CM announced that he is tendering his resignation, hours ahead of the scheduled floor test.

“I have decided to tender my resignation to the Governor today,” he said while addressing a press conference in Bhopal.

On Thursday, the Supreme Court had ordered a floor test in the state Assembly to be held on Friday. While addressing the press conference, Kamal Nath stated that the Bharatiya Janata Party had tried to “destabilise” his government and added, that his government “tried best to give a new direction to the state in a span of 15 months”. He also accused the BJP of holding Congress’s MLAs captive in Karnataka in order to topple the government in the State.

“Over the last 15 months, I have worked for the progress of Madhya Pradesh. BJP got 15 years but I only got 15 months, but during this time people of Madhya Pradesh know the conspiracy that BJP has indulged in. From day one, BJP began plotting. The party also held our MLAs captive in Karnataka. 22 of our MLAs were held captive in Bengaluru. This was politics spending crores of rupees,” he said.

“We delivered on our 400 promises in 15 months, BJP did not like it. It could not stomach our achievements. We also acted against the mafia, it could not thrive.” “People will not forgive those who went against their wishes,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/crisis-of-confidence-in-mp--cm-quits-before-trust-vote.html

133,21-3-20,City residents gear up for 'Janta Curfew',"Amidst the rising fear of Coronavirus, Ranchiites have welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call of self imposing social distancing or ‘Janta Curfew’ on Sunday from 7 am to 9 pm.

While addressing the nation on Thursday evening, the PM emphasised that there is no need to be panic but at the same time also urged people to follow Janta curfew- a curfew which is imposed on the people, by the people for themselves.

People from all walks of life and across all age groups in the City are keen to support Modi and curb the spread of the deadly virus.Dr Kiran Mehra, Retired Associate Professor, chemistry department, Ranchi Women’s College said, “I absolutely agree with the PM and will totally abide by the self imposed curfew. If the virus is active for about 12 hours, then the Janta curfew will go a long way in breaking its chain. The second important point which he spoke about was clapping, banging vessels or ringing bells. It is being said that if everyone follows it, then the sound energy produced will also help in killing the virus. My children based in Mumbai and Bangalore are also planning to stay home on Sunday.”

Shweta Murarka, a young mother has been using disinfectants to wash clothes and vegetables said. “Since I come from a joint family, it will be after a long time when all of us will be home together. With three kids at home, we plan to spend Sunday playing board games like Othello, Zenga and Scrabble. The purpose is to make the day fun as well as educational for them. We are trying to create awareness amongst the children and inculcate some good habits in them. As a last wash, we have been using disinfectants for clothes, vegetables and also for mopping the house.”

“With my college closed till April 14, I am planning to follow Janta curfew not just for a day but a week. Since both my parents are working, we hardly get to spend any time together. We plan to make some traditional Gujrati dishes which are otherwise available only in restaurants. With work and college, we don’t get to see many films, so I have also made a list and we plan to have a marathon movie session,” said Jay Vachharajani, a student of Indian Institute of Management, Ranchi. Senior citizen Renu Hirani and her family who are residents of Kanke Road have not ventured out of their house for the last 15 days. “Of course we are following Janta curfew. It is a very good idea. We have also planned on chanting ‘Om’ from 6 pm to 6:15 pm. In case of an emergency, we have stocked groceries and regular medicines for about 15 days at home. We are not even stepping out to meet our neighbours in the building.”

“Announcement of Janta curfew by the PM is a great step to fight the deadly Coronavirus. Practicing self curfew on Sunday will be very convenient as many business houses and day to day activities can easily be put on hold on Sunday. I think everyone should follow it as it is for their own safety. From what we have heard, the life span of this virus is of 12 hours while the self imposed curfew is of 14 hours- it will help in breaking the chain,” said city based businessman Manindera Kumar.

“On Janta curfew since the whole family will be home, I plan to cook some of their favourite dishes. The idea of thanking those involved in emergency services by clapping, ringing bells is a great one and my kids and I will surely participate in it. We haven’t stepped out of the house for a week. I am generally busy with household chores and hardly get much time with the kids. With schools shut this is like a golden period where I am thoroughly enjoying spending quality time with my children,” said Dr Neha Nupur, guest faculty at Doranda College.

137,21-3-20,"PK Banerjee was India’s glamour boy of 1950s, 60s","nAn encounter with Pradeep Kumar Banerjee, the ace footballer who breathed his last on Friday is like watching a movie being shown on wide screen. He was one of the few quintessential football coaches the country had seen. “As a player, he was the prince of the era and reigned supreme in the maidans. Speed, agile and ball control were his forte,” remembers T K Chathunni, former Indian defender who had represented Bombay’s Orkay Mills and Goa’s Vascoe Club during his playing days.

Chathunni said PK was a loving personality who loved anything about football including the rival team members. “The Salgaonkar team coached by me had beaten East Bengal in the Federation Cup finals held in Kolkata in the early 70s. PK Sir was the coach of East Bengal. Immediately after the match, he was gracious enough to come to us and congratulate each and every member of the Salgaonkar team,” said Chathunni.

The last time PK Daa came to Kerala was in 1985 as the coach of Indian team that played in the Nehru Cup International football match held at Thiruvananthapuram. That was the first time football lovers in Kerala saw Anaadi Barua, a surprise inclusion in the team.

India was pitted against USSR in the opening match of the tournament. The Soviets who were getting readied for the 1986 world cup at Mexico had sent a team that included players like Igor Belanov, Vassly Rats, Andrei Baal and Rinat Dassayev who ultimately made it to the national team that played in Mexico. It seems the Soviets never wanted to leave any stones and unturned in their march to the final. They literally butchered the Indian team 5-0.

“This is all I have to offer as Indian stars,” said PK after the match . The likes of Mauricio Afonso, Parminder Singh, V P Sathyan, Krishanu Dey and Babu Mani stood bewildered as the Sovites mesmerized them with top quality football. “We don’t have players now. What you see here is stars and they are nowhere near the likes of Inder Singh or Subhash Bhowmick,” said PK after the match.

One could feel the pain in his words because he was the player who made the Europeans understand that football is played in India too. “With this kind of stars and administration, I don’t have any hope or dreams,” he said after India’s last match in the tournament in which the hosts failed to score even a single goal. When K Bhaskaran, sports journalist wrote a book on Indian football as part of the Wills Book of Excellence series, he chose PK as his adviser and consultant.

It was a tribute to the man who helped India win the one and only gold medal in Asian Games.

The last time one saw PK in television was in a “promo” shot for Kokata Metro. The fact that the organisers included PK in the short film, wearing his customary green safari suit, was an indication of the respect he commanded in the State. Pradeep Kumar Banerjee is a household name in Kerala’s Kozhikode and Kannur districts known as football cities of the State. Au revoir PK , and thank you for everything",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pk-banerjee-was-india---s-glamour-boy-of-1950s--60s.html

Allaying their apprehensions, Minister of Chemicals and Fertilisers Mansukh Mandaviya said more than 100 manufacturing units all over the country were producing more than one and half crore masks every day. Therefore, fears about shortage were unfounded, he said. The minister also assured the Elders that there was no paucity of sanitisers.

147,21-3-20,Tippler’s attempt to get spirit through online platforms goes haywire as HC strikes,"An attempt by a tippler to make the Kerala State Beverages Corporation, the State-owned retail and wholesale dealer of Indian Made Foreign Liquor, to home deliver the usual quota of spirit misfired on Friday as the Kerala High Court not only dismissed his petition in this regard but imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 as cost of the case on Jyothish, the petitioner.

The demand of Jyothish was to make the liquor available through online platforms. His contention was that in the backdrop of coronavirus COVID, it has become risky to stand in the long queue in front of the retail outlets to purchase the regular quota of liquor. There are no dearth of customers queuing up in front of the BEVCO counters because the State is one of the largest guzzlers of liquor in the country.

Jyothish pleaded before the court that the retails were crowded during business hours and it was unsafe to wait hours in front of the “watering holes” for procuring alcohol for consumption. His suggestion was that the BEVCO could start distributing the spirits through on-line service whereby the material would be home delivered.

But AK Jayasankaran Nambiar, the judge who heard the petition was neither amused nor humored by the contention of the petitioner. “The citizenry ought to realize that the restrictions imposed by this Court on the filing of cases is with a view to ensuring that their fundamental rights as citizens, for access to justice is, guaranteed to the extent possible, even at the cost of exposing the judges, lawyers, Clerks and staff of this court to the risk of viral infection. When measures such as these are adopted by the Institution in public Interest , the very least that is expected from the litigating public is a sensitivity to the interests of their fellow citizens in society who like them have a fundamental right to a safe place of work and a healthy environment. One cannot help but lament at the selfishness of the petitioner in the instant case , and others like him in society whose obsession with perceived rights blinds them to the obligatory duty that they owe to the fellow citizens,” said the judge while dismissing the petition.

He also pointed out that ‘the petitioner’s conduct in filing a frivolous petition at a time like this while making a mockery of the salutary concept of access to justice which this institution strives to guarantee also ridicules the functioning of this noble institution. For the said reckless, insensitive and insolent action, the petitioner cannot be let away lightly.’

The amount of Rs 50,000 will be paid to the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund.

Old timers in the capital city of Thiruvananthapuram recalled an incident that took place in 1986 when late Prof M P Manmathan, a Gandhian who devoted his life to bring in total prohibition in the State staged a demonstration in front of the State secretariat demanding the closure of all liquor shops. A renowned film personality led a rally of 100 tipplers demanding the provision of ‘quality’ liquor through retail outlets!

158,21-3-20,"Fitch cuts India growth to 5.1% for FY’21, says world economy in recession","Fitch Ratings on Friday cut India growth forecast to 5.1% for FY 2020-21, saying supply chain disruptions in the wake of coronavirus outbreak are likely to hit investment and exports.

It also said that with global GDP falling, the world was in “recession territory”.

Fitch had in December 2019 projected India to grow at 5.6% in 2020-21 and 6.5% in the following year.

In its Global Economic Outlook 2020, Fitch said the number of people affected by coronavirus in India would keep rising in the coming weeks but that the outbreak would remain contained. However, there are downside risks to this scenario.

“Supply-chain disruptions are expected to hit business investment and exports... We see GDP growth to remain broadly steady at 5.1% in the fiscal year 2020-2021 following growth of 5.0% in 2019-2020,” Fitch said. For 2021-22, Fitch projected India’s growth to be 6.4%.

Stating that the coronavirus crisis is “crushing” global GDP growth, Fitch halved its baseline global growth forecast for 2020 — to just 1.3% from 2.5% projected in December 2019.

“The level of world GDP is falling. For all intents and purposes we are in global recession territory,” said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.

Fitch said the outbreak of the virus was hitting sentiment, while local governments had rolled out measures to contain the spread of the virus, such as closing schools, cinemas and theatres.

“While India’s linkages with China (e.g. trade and tourism) are modest, manufacturers in India are heavily reliant on key Chinese intermediate inputs, especially of electronics and machinery and equipment,” it said.

It also projected the Indian rupee to be at 74 to the US dollar by the end of December 2020. The rupee is currently trading around 74.78 to a dollar.

WHO has declared coronavirus pandemic. Over two lakh people have been infected globally and the disease caused by it — COVID-19 — has claimed over 9,000 lives. In India there are over 160 positive cases and four deaths so far.

The difficulties facing the Indian economy have been exacerbated by Yes Bank failure.

“Fragilities in the financial system will further undermine sentiment and domestic spending. The overall financial system remains burdened with weak balance sheets, which will limit any upside to credit and growth despite policymakers’ efforts in recent months to ease stresses,” it added.

Fitch said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) held an emergency meeting in mid-March and announced measures to shore up liquidity in money markets, including the launch of further long-term repo operations.

“Given downside pressures on growth, we think the RBI will have to take additional measures and we forecast a cut in the policy rate to 4.5% before the end of the year,” said Fitch which has a ‘BBB-’ rating on India with a stable outlook.

On the fiscal front, the authorities announced targeted stimulus measures to mitigate the impact of the outbreak, it added.

Fitch said the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in India was low, but was picking up, at the time of projecting growth in the Global economic outlook report.

“Our scenario assumes the number of people affected will keep rising in the coming weeks but that the outbreak will remain contained. However, there are downside risks to this scenario,” it added.

Fitch also lowered its oil price forecast to USD 41% (Brent) for 2020 (annual average) from USD 62.5 per barrel in December.

“With the collapse of ‘OPEC+’ co-operation boosting prospects for OPEC supply, we now expect oil prices to average USD 48 per barrel in 2021 compared to our previous forecast of USD 60 per barrel,” it said.

Fitch said the global health crisis sparked by the outbreak of the coronavirus is taking an extraordinarily heavy toll on the world economy.

Fitch further said it sees an outright decline in global GDP this year if more pervasive lockdown measures have to be rolled out across all the G7 economies, but a recovery could be in sight in the second half of calendar year 2020.

“Emergency macro policy responses are purely about damage limitation at this stage but should help secure a ‘V-shaped’ recovery..., although this assumes that the health crisis eases,” it added.

Fitch said even though it expects a recovery in China from the second quarter of 2020, Chinese growth is expected to fall just 3.7 year for the year as a whole, down from 6.1 year in 2019.

“The shock to the Chinese economy – primarily resulting from the official ‘lockdown’ response to contain the virus – has been very severe,” it added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/fitch-cuts-india-growth-to-5-1--for-fy---21--says-world-economy-in-recession.html

Kapoor, arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) earlier this month, was remanded in judicial custody till April 2 as the investigation agency did not seek his further remand.

The CBI, meanwhile, obtained a production warrant against him in another case.

As his earlier remand ended, the ED produced the 62- year-old Kapoor, former MD and CEO of the beleaguered Yes Bank, before the court here. When the judge asked if he had any complaints, Kapoor said he has been suffering from asthma for the last six-seven years, has low immunity, and he was in acute depression.

Advocate Abbad Ponda, his lawyer, said a person with low immunity is ""easily susceptible"" to catching coronavirus.

161,21-3-20,Stock markets rise on huge economic support plans,"Global stock markets pushed higher Friday at the end of another volatile week, as weary investors welcomed a worldwide fightback against the coronavirus fallout by governments and central banks.

In the eurozone, markets jumped after the European Central Bank launched a vast stimulus this week, with Frankfurt, Paris, Milan and Madrid scoring gains of between 2 and 4 per cent.

London's stock market won about 2 per cent one day after the Bank of England slashed interest rates to a record-low 0.1 per cent and ahead of new UK state stimulus plans later Friday.

The dollar eased somewhat after a lengthy rally fuelled by traders cashing out of their investments, while the embattled oil market extended Thursday's gains.

US stocks rose at the opening bell, with the Dow adding 0.5 per cent in the first couple minutes of trading, as US authorities move forward with stimulus plans.

""The stock markets' upside is a result of a number of big bazookas fired off by central banks,"" Scope Markets analyst James Hughes told AFP, before sounding a note of grim caution.

""The markets hate uncertainty — and we could not be in a more uncertain time,"" he added in reference to the COVID-19 pandemic that has killed more than 10,000 people around the world.

""So overall I feel markets may recover from here in the short term, but we must remember it has been a week where this crisis escalated in an immeasurable and unprecedented way. Who knows what next week has in store.""

164,21-3-20,"Virus deaths pass 10,000 globally","Europe’s south strains under pandemic, 40 million Californians ordered to stay home; over 86,000 infected people recover globally; NASA suspends work on Moon rocket

Southern Europe buckled under the strain of the coronavirus pandemic on Friday, with gasping patients filling sick wards in Spain and Italy and field hospitals going up in hotels and a convention centre, as the global death toll surpassed 10,000 people worldwide.

In the US, California’s governor barred nonessential movement for all 40 million residents, and the Trump administration warned Americans abroad to return home or risk spending an “indefinite” period away. And the income tax filing deadline was moved from April 15 to July 15.

Meanwhile, John Hopkins University’s coronavirus resource centre says that over 86,000 infected patients have been recovered to date.

The World Health Organization noted the dramatic speed of the virus’ spread.

“It took over three months to reach the first 10,000 confirmed cases and only 12 days to reach the next 100,000,” the UN health agency said.

In Bergamo, the epicentre of the virus in Italy, cemeteries were overwhelmed. Sky News video from inside the city’s main hospital showed patients lined up in a narrow ward, struggling for breath as doctors and nurses moved swiftly from one beeping machine to the next.

“When the virus arrived here, there was no containment and it spread through the valleys very quickly... Some said it was the normal flu. We doctors knew it was not,” said Dr Luca Lorini, head of intensive care at the hospital, where nearly 500 beds were dedicated to people suffering severe symptoms of the virus, 80 of those in intensive care.

In the farm town of Fondi that has the largest wholesale produce market serving Rome and Naples, a new ordinance banned all but essential people from entering or leaving after 40 elderly residents became infected. At a convent on the outskirts of Rome, 19 of 21 nuns were infected, according to the Italian daily Il Messaggero. The Vatican published a decree absolving the sins of the faithful who are sick or in quarantine as well as their caregivers if they met certain conditions.

Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began, offered a ray of hope with no new infections reported for a second day in a row and only 39 cases reported nationwide — all of them brought from the outside, the Government said.

The effects of a global economy grinding to a halt were also taking a toll, from millions of unsold flowers rotting in piles in Kenya to the slow emptying of the world’s skies. The UN chief warned of a looming global recession “perhaps of record dimensions.”

Scientists advising the British Government warned that restrictions on daily life may have to be in place for a year, with periods of less stringent and more stringent measures.

In the US, Congress worked to put together a $1 trillion emergency package that would prop up industry and small business and dispense relief checks to households of $1,200 for adults and $500 per child.

In a measure of how the fortunes of East and West have shifted, a Chinese Red Cross official heading an aid delegation to Milan castigated Italians for failing to take their national lockdown seriously. Sun Shuopeng said he was shocked to see so many people walking around, using public transportation and eating out in hotels, adding: “All people should be staying at home in quarantine.”

China also sent medical equipment to the Czech capital, Prague.

Governments are trying to balance locking down residents with the need to keep food, medicine and other essentials flowing. In Britain, the category of vital workers includes doctors, nurses and paramedics — and also vicars, truckers, garbage collectors and journalists.

French President Emmanuel Macron urged employees to keep working in supermarkets, production sites and other necessary businesses amid stringent movement restrictions.

“We need to keep the country running,” Macron said.

Worldwide, the death toll from COVID-19 passed 10,000 and infections exceeded 2,44,000, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally. Italy, with 60 million citizens, has recorded 3,405 deaths, exceeding the 3,248 in China, a country with a population over 20 times larger. Spain, second behind Italy in Europe, reported 1,002 deaths and 19,980 infections. The US death toll rose to 206.

“Certain medical centres are suffering stress that is reaching the limit,” said Fernando Simón, director of Spain’s center for health alerts and emergencies. “The difficult days in which we must bear down are coming now. We must keep our focus.”

A convention centre and hotels were being prepared as field hospitals for nearly 10,000 beds in Madrid, and France’s military worked to build a makeshift medical center in the country’s hard-hit eastern town of Mulhouse. Although the illness is mild in most people, the elderly are particularly susceptible to serious symptoms. Italy has the world’s second-oldest population, and the vast majority of its dead — 87% — were over 70.

Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit, a virologist at Germany’s Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, offered another reason for Italy’s high mortality rate: “That’s what happens when the health system collapses.”

More than 86,000 people have recovered, mostly in China. Recovery takes two weeks or so for mild cases but can be up to six weeks for those that turn serious, according to the WHO.

Iran’s official toll of more than 1,400 deaths was rising quickly as well amid fears it is underreporting its cases. Tehran accused Washington of helping spread the virus by retaining sanctions that prevent it importing desperately needed medicine and medical equipment.

“While the US is trying to curb the virus internally, it is helping the spread of the virus externally,” Iran’s UN mission said in a statement.

Meanwhile, NASA said it has suspended work on building and testing the rocket and capsule for its Artemis manned mission to the Moon due to the rising number of coronavirus cases in the community.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/virus-deaths-pass-10-000-globally.html
165,21-3-20,A world of possibilities,"Filmmaker Brian De Palma on why films should be beautiful and one should believe in the ones they make

Film theaters may be shuttered across the country and projects delayed but there is still the newly released work of lurid and pulpy goodness from Brian De Palma.

The 79-year-old filmmaker has written his first work of fiction, Are Snakes Necessary? a crime novel he penned with his partner, Susan Lehman, a former editor for The New York Times. The book, full of snappy dialogue and sharp knives, bears plenty of the hallmarks of De Palma. Films are baked into it (the title refers to a book Henry Fonda is seen reading in The Lady Eve). Martin Scorsese sums it up in a blurb: “It’s like having a new Brian De Palma picture.”

Just over two weeks ago, I drove out to East Hampton to meet De Palma (the director of Carrie, Scarface, Body Double and Carlito’s Way) at an inn near his and Lehman’s Long Island house.

The conversation spanned his new book (a John Edwards-inspired tale about a senator having an affair with a young staffer), his grim thoughts about the advent of streaming (The industry is eclipsing the artistry) and his plans for a film partly inspired by Harvey Weinstein.

An abiding passion for cinema coursed through De Palma’s reflections. Lately, he’s been soaking up westerns. The day before, he said, he watched John Ford’s My Darling Clementine again — a film De Palma, noted, that knew how to shoot a shoot-out.

Why is Are Snakes Necessary? a book and not a film?

Too many ideas and not enough time to make all the films. You write a lot of stuff that never makes it into a film. With my partner, Susan, we just basically did it because we had fun doing it. We had never written a novel before, neither of us. I had an idea for a script I had never developed based on the Edwards campaign and the girl (Rielle Hunter, the woman he had an affair with) making webisodes, those little intimate things she shot. As I was watching this happen, being a director, you can see someone flirting with the camera. We started with that.

Has the straightforward process of fiction writing been a welcome alternative to the struggles of filmmaking for you? Your last film, 2019’s Domino, had financial difficulties and wasn’t released in the US.

It’s a very sad situation. It was under-financed. I was there 100 days and shot 30. They weren’t paying anybody and I had a whole bunch of people working for me. We finished it. But I was so disenchanted with the people who financed it ... that I said, “Guys, here it is. Good luck.” And I didn’t do any publicity for it.

Did that sour you on making more films?

I had never been in a situation like that except way back when I first was starting to make independent films like Sisters, which I think was budgeted at $150,000.

What struck me reading your book is how enduring your obsessions are. Vertigo, for instance, makes a cameo. In the book, it’s being remade.

It was a very influential film. I saw it in 1958 in Vista Vision, I might add, at Radio City Music Hall, I believe. It left a very strong impression on me, obviously. As I’ve gotten older and made a lot of films, I can see there’s always lessons to be learned from Hitchcock the way he sets up certain sequences. And Vertigo is the whole idea of creating an illusion and getting the audience to fall in love with it and then tossing it off the tower twice. Very, very good idea.

Are there any Hitchcock films you don’t like?

I thought the late Hitchcock stuff was not that good. When he got finally discovered by the French and all the critics started to write about him, that’s when he was in his decline, I thought. I don’t think he ever reached the pinnacle that he did after Psycho and Vertigo.

Do you think of your career as having a pinnacle?

Sure. I’ve studied directors’ careers my whole life. Susan doesn’t like me to say this, but you get older. You have a very good creative period, but if you’re making decent films after you’re 60, it’s kind of a miracle.

What’s that pinnacle for you then?

In my mid-50s doing Carlito’s Way and then Mission: Impossible. It doesn’t get much better than that. You have all the power and tools at your disposal. When you have the Hollywood system working for you, you can do some remarkable things. But as your films become less successful, it gets harder to hold on to the power and you have to start making compromises. I don’t know if you even realize you’re making them. I tend to be very hard-nosed about this. If you have a couple of good decades, that’s good, that’s great.

You must have gotten accustomed to your films, years after critical or commercial disappointment, reemerging as cult classics.

You’ve got to believe in the films when you make it. The fact that the audience didn’t respond to it and 30 years later they think it’s a masterpiece is always gratifying. Your instincts were always right. I’ve always said that the film you make is measured against the fashion of the day. That shouldn’t stop you from trying to do what you think is correct, what works for you.

Do you think that kind of bold, wide screen filmmaking is still being practised?

The things that they’re doing now have nothing to do with what we were doing making films in the 70s, 80s and 90s. The first thing that drives me crazy is the way they look. Because they’re shooting digitally they’re just lit terribly. I can’t stand the darkness, the bounced light. They all look the same. I believe in beauty in cinema. Susan and I were looking at Gone With the Wind the other day and you’re just struck at how beautiful the whole film is. The sets, how Vivien Leigh is lit, it’s just extraordinary. If you look at the stuff that’s streaming all the time, it’s all muck. Visual storytelling has gone out the window.

Is that what irks you most about today’s films?

The whole system is changing. You used to go out and make a film. Our generation, we wanted to take over the studios. Which we did. I think what’s so interesting about the generation I came up with, they got very rich, extremely rich, working within the studio system. Now, we’re into this endless streaming. Everything has 10 parts and six seasons. It’s sort of moved back to the old studio system where the producers and the writers are the king. The directors, who knows who directs one of these things from another? Then you have the whole Marvel universe, which is digital action stuff, all computer generated. When I made Mission to Mars and spent a year working on these shots with three or four digital houses — one was working on the ship, one was working on the smoke, one was working on the dust — I would storyboard a shot and it would keep coming back to me for a year as they added things. The shots are hopelessly expensive. You say: “What am I doing?” That’s when I went to Europe and said I can’t make films like this anymore.

Mission: Impossible is up to, what, it’s seventh installment?

Stories, they keep making them longer and longer only for economic reasons. After I made Mission: Impossible, Tom asked me to start working on the next one. I said: “Are you kidding?” One of these is enough. Why would anybody want to make another one? Of course, the reason they make another one is to make money. I was never a film director to make money, which is the big problem of Hollywood. That’s its corruption.

Women in your films has always been a flash point. Some have called your films misogynistic. The bloody drill-bit scene in Body Double is hard to imagine happening today.

That was the film that was attacked relentlessly when it came out, but I can’t tell you how many people come up to me and talk to me about Body Double.

Do you feel time has disproved those criticisms?

They always considered I was somehow a misogynist director because I had women as focal points in my thrillers. Well, I’m sorry. I prefer to photograph women walking around rather than men. (laughs) I think some great philosopher once said: The history of movies is of men photographing women. I’ve always said: “If I have to follow somebody, I’d rather it be a beautiful woman than Arnold Schwarzenegger.” I’m sorry.

Scorsese has wondered before how many films he has left. What’s your expectation?

I think we’re getting near the end here. I have a bad knee. William Wyler said when you can’t walk, it’s over with. Now, if you write these books, that can use up our creative imagination. But as long as I can do it, I will do it. But I’m not going to miss not doing it.

166,21-3-20,Beyond prescribed roles,"Director Rohena Gera’s film Sir delves into two completely disparate worlds which co-exist within a single home and overlap partially. By Team Viva

How did you conceptualise the film, Sir?

The questions the film asks have been with me for almost my entire life. I was aware of class divisions as a child... While growing up, many of us need caretakers and we are close to them but there is always a barrier when it comes to love.

As an adult, I employed women in my home, women who I grew close to... There is tremendous intimacy when one shares a home, though of course it is a bit one-sided. For instance, someone who works for you can read your moods, they know if you’ve had a bad day, or if you don’t eat well, or if a phone call suddenly changes your demeanour. Perhaps, even though we do not read them carefully but a bond that develops over time.

The presence of two completely disparate worlds within a single home is what I find most interesting — such different realities and concerns but a human connection.

I decided to explore it as a love story to see how far I could take it and make the two characters more equal. I feel that when you are in love with someone you see the world through their eyes. It happens easily, automatically... and that’s interesting as the individuals on either side of the barrier want to see each other’s points of view.

Is the film inspired by real-life instances? What were the references that you took?

It is inspired from real-life instances. The details are all from life, from my observations of people, life and society... Let’s say it’s a sort of heightened reality.

What is your definition of love? How do you think our society understands it?

In the film I wanted to explore ideas of love. What is it really, how do you know it is real, who is the one?

For me, it is about finding someone who sees you for who you are and enables you to be all that you can be. And vice versa. Simply, someone who brings out the best in you. And of course, respect is crucial as there is no love without that.

Do you think financial differences or class hierarchy are a barrier for love?

I think they act as a barrier, especially, when people stick to prescriptive roles in society — what men and women ought to be and so on. (Often in our society we accept it if a man marries a woman who has less but the opposite is more complicated).

I feel that it’s important to change your gender in your head before taking certain decisions. I ask myself sometimes, would I do this if I was a man? If the answer is unchanged by gender, I know I am on the right path but if it changes, then I have to stop and think.

One can overcome financial differences if people are self-aware and willing to actively fight prejudices, even when it comes to the ones we have internalised in our own heart.

The film compels one to think — we all believe in love but can we really love across class? And if we can, how far do you think one can go?

People can love across class... Love is a human emotion and I believe it can transcend class if we allow it to. The question is how free does an individual feel with respect to their family or society? How accountable do we need to be? That is a personal decision.

Also, each person has his/her own needs. For some, a deep emotional bond is more important while for some a structurally viable life, where families and lifestyles are similar. It is again, a very personal choice.

Most of your films have revolved around different dimensions of love...

I guess I love love stories and I believe in the transformative power of love. Like I said, when you love someone you see the world through their eyes, you see differently. That is incredibly powerful.

Given the pandemic of Coronavirus, which is not going to go away anytime soon, how do you think delaying film releases is going to affect the industry, especially the small budget films?

It’s very hard to say as nobody knows how long this will take. I am trying to focus on the positive aspects. The trailer has received an overwhelming response, the film has been trending on IMDb (Internet movie database) as the most anticipated Indian film. Of course, the release schedule will be very crowded whenever cinemas open but I feel Sir… is a film that is quite different from mainstream films, so we can coexist.

I have spent years on this film and I will do what it takes to get it to its audience. But right now, I feel there are bigger issues at stake. For a lot of people, it’s going to be a struggle to make ends meet or have two square meals a day. We need to be conscious of that and try to reach out to the most vulnerable around us.

How do you plan to tide over it?

Right now, I am spending time with my family and am extremely grateful that we are able to be together. I am trying to enjoy living a slow life... and I am writing again, which helps me stay sane.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/beyond-prescribed-roles-2020-03-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/beyond-prescribed-roles.html
167,21-3-20,The quarantine effect,"Kartik’s monologue returns

Actor Kartik Aaryan, who made a splash with his famous monologue in Pyaar Ka Punchnama, his 2011 debut film, has come up with another non-stop one in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. In a video that the actor shared with his fans on social media, he uses the monologue to advise people to stay at home in order to limit the spread of the disease.

His monologue begins with, “Problem? Problem ye hai ki hum sab genius hain. Aur kya problem hai! Problem ye hai ki hume kisi ki sunni hi nahi hai. Subah shaam Netflix and chill ke sapne dekhne hai, lekin jab do hafte ghar baithne ko mil raha hai, toh hume kaam pe jaana hai.” Posting the video, Kartik writes, “#CoronaStopKaroNa. My Appeal in my style. Social Distancing is the only solution, yet.”

UNICEF’s notice by Trisha

South Indian actor Trisha, also a UNICEF brand ambassador, took to social media to share an advisory against the pandemic. In a video that the actress posted in Tamil and English, she informs her followers about ways to avoid contacting the virus, which includes the basics such as washing hands with soap and contacting the medical helpline if the symptoms begin to show.

“Novel coronavirus or COVID-19 can be stopped. Together we can do it,” she said. In 2017, Trisha Krishnan became the first south-Indian to be bestowed with the UNICEF celebrity advocate status.

Cannes can’t

The 73rd edition of the Cannes Film Festival has been postponed in the wake of Coronavirus outbreak. The festival organisers issued a statement, confirming the delay in the gala, which was initially scheduled to take place in May.

Today, we have made the following decision — The Festival de Cannes cannot be held on the scheduled dates from May 12 to 23. Several options are considered in order to preserve its running, the main one being a simple postponement, in Cannes, until the end of June to beginning of July 2020,” the statement read.

168,21-3-20,"For F1, coronavirus means less is more in 2020","It was supposed to be a record 22-race world championship but with seven Grands Prix already either postponed or cancelled, Formula One in 2020 has become a shorter, tightly-packed and economically challenging sprint for the title.

The season-opener in Australia and F1’s iconic Riviera showpiece in Monaco have been axed.

Races in Bahrain, Vietnam, China, Netherlands and Spain have also been shelved but with organisers still hoping to shoehorn them into a breathless finale once the threat of the coronavirus had subsided.

A season which should have started in Melbourne on March 14 will now not start until Azerbaijan on June 7 — at the earliest.

“It’s super complicated to redo a calendar because you don’t know when everything will be operational,” Frederic Vasseur, the team principal of the Alfa Romeo F1 team, said.

“You need to have a global vision. England is not too affected at the moment but it could be when Italy is less affected,” he added in reference to the two countries which play host to most of the teams in the world championship.

There are still 15 races left on the schedule before the concluding race at Abu Dhabi on November 29.

Last weekend, Ross Brawn, the sporting director of F1, said he was optimistic of a “17-18 race” championship.

However, that was when only Australia, Bahrain, Vietnam and China had been dropped.

On Thursday, the Dutch Grand Prix, slated to make its return to the calendar for the first time since 1985 on May 3, and the Spanish event, set for May 10, were postponed.

The Monaco GP, an annual showstopper since 1955 and set for May 24 this year, was cancelled completely.

‘Unchartered territory’

“We are in unchartered territory. I’m pretty optimistic that we can have a good 17-18 race championship or more,” Brawn told Sky Sports.

“I think we can squeeze them in. But it depends on when the season can start.”

There is wriggle room.

The traditional three-week summer shutdown in August has been scrapped to be replaced by a 21-day break in March and April while the racing season hunkers down.

The championship now becomes a frantic six-month sprint rather than a nine-month marathon.

To rescue the calendar, there is an option of two races organised on the same weekend.

“It’s possible,” said Brawn, eyeing the three weeks between the Hungarian Grand Prix on August 2 and at Spa in Belgium on August 30.

“One thing we have also been talking about is two-day weekends, and therefore if we have a triple header with two-day weekends, that could be an option.”

F1 experimented with three races in a row in 2018 but support was lukewarm from teams who sweated over staff fatigue.

“I think what we need from the teams this year is flexibility, I think they’ve got to give some scope to do these things,” added Brawn.

“Because we are in very unusual circumstances, and we’ve got to make sure we’ve got a season that gives a good economic opportunity for the teams.

“For sure we’re going to have a quiet start. I’m sure the teams will be flexible to allow us to fit those things in.”

More than ever, bank balances and income will be key in 2020 as teams and organisers grapple with the implications of a shorter, crammed season.

“The costs are not necessarily much lower if you do 18 races rather than 22,” said Vasseur.

“Also, our income will be less — we do fewer races, we will have less commercial rights.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/for-f1--coronavirus-means-less-is-more-in-2020.html
169,21-3-20,F1 drivers to stage virtual reality races,"Formula One’s drivers will battle it out in an Esports Virtual Grand Prix series in a bid to give fans their racing fix while the season is delayed by the coronavirus.

Formula One chiefs are aiming to start racing in Azerbaijan on June 7, but to fill the void for now the sport has asked current F1 drivers to play a racing game featuring as-yet unnamed celebrity guests.

“Featuring a number of current F1 drivers, the series has been created to enable fans to continue watching Formula 1 races virtually, despite the ongoing COVID-19 situation that has affected this season’s opening race calendar,” a statement said.

“The first race of the series will see current F1 drivers line up on the grid alongside a host of stars to be announced in due course.

“In order to guarantee the participants safety at this time, each driver will join the race remotely.”

F1 drivers Max Verstappen and Lando Norris took part in two separate virtual races last weekend following the cancellation of the Australian Grand Prix.

The races will be run for 28 laps for around 90 minutes and will take place at the same time as the postponed Grands Prix would have occurred.

The events start this weekend with the Virtual Bahrain Grand Prix run on the official 2019 F1 video game.

Viewers will be able to tune in via YouTube, Facebook and Twitch with a qualifying session to determine the grid preceding the race itself.

Results will not count towards the F1 world championship, but the plan is to run the virtual tournament until real racing can return.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/f1-drivers-to-stage-virtual-reality-races.html
170,21-3-20,Home comforts no excuse for slacking off: Laporte,"French defender Aymeric Laporte has urged his Manchester City teammates to keep up their home training routines during their self-isolation — but admits he cannot stop thinking about the club’s possible exclusion from the Champions League.

The 25-year-old is presently recovering from a hamstring problem, the latest in a litany of injuries that has limited him to eight appearances this season.

City’s players have had to stay at home and been given training plans since the reigning Premier League champions closed the training ground following British government advice on Monday to avoid all non-essential travel and contact.

“That’s (personal training schedule) the best thing for everyone, that we do it every day,” Laporte said, quoted in The Times on Friday.

“They trust in you and you have to be professional. You have to follow what they say and we have to be responsible in this case. “When we return to normality, when we start training again outside, we have to be ready.”

Premier League chiefs on Thursday fixed a planned resumption of domestic football for April 30. Britain has only just begun to take the same restrictive measures as other European countries to fight the pandemic. Laporte said City players had been advised to adhere to the guidance on avoiding social contact.

“We have the same protocol as has been given out in all countries: stay at home as much as possible, don’t go out in the street, don’t shake hands with anyone,” said Laporte.

Laporte said he was worried about City’s ban from European football for two years for breaching financial fairplay rules, although the club has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

“We are waiting for a final decision,” said Laporte “We are going to see what happens next season.

“Obviously it would hurt us a lot if we aren’t in the Champions League next season.

“I am very happy here at Manchester City. I am enjoying my football here. We are doing great things here. In the last two years we have won eight trophies.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/home-comforts-no-excuse-for-slacking-off--laporte.html
171,21-3-20,Improve Mushtaq Ali T20 standard: Gavaskar,"Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar believes the BCCI has taken the right decision to suspend the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.

“The decision by the BCCI to suspend the IPL till April 15 is a laudable one. The health and safety of a nation are more important than sport and it’s wonderful that the usually much-maligned BCCI has put that before anything else,” Gavaskar wrote in a column for Sportstar.

Gavaskar also said that the fate of the IPL depends upon how quickly the spread of coronavirus is controlled in the country.

“Whether the IPL will be played at all depends on how quickly the spread of COVID-19 is controlled. Till April 15 overseas players won’t get a visa so it may take a bit longer for the tournament to take off. Foreign players bring a different flavour to the tournament and add to the excitement, so it’s important to have them,” he said.

The former Indian skipper also lashed out at a BCCI official for the suggestion that they did not want IPL to be like a Mushtaq Ali tournament without the participation of foreign players.

“Having said that, for a so-called top BCCI official to comment that ‘the BCCI has to ensure the quality of the game is not poor. We did not want a Mushtaq Ali tournament,’ is an incredibly insensitive statement if indeed it is true,” wrote Gavaskar.

“Firstly, it’s insulting to the great man after whom the tournament is named and secondly begs the question that if it’s such a ‘poor’ tournament, then why have it at all? Also, can light be shed on why the quality of the tournament is poor? Surely it’s not simply because there are no international players in it, but also because there are no Indian internationals in it! That is a scheduling issue that the BCCI has to look at,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/improve-mushtaq-ali-t20-standard--gavaskar.html

No new domestically transmitted cases of the novel coronavirus disease were reported on the Chinese mainland on Thursday, the National Health Commission (NHC) said.

Meanwhile, Beijing accused US President Donald Trump on Friday of trying to “shift the blame” for the global coronavirus pandemic in an escalating row between the two powers.

Trump charged on Thursday that the world is “paying a big price” for China’s lack of transparency on

the outbreak when it emerged in the central city of Wuhan late last year.

China has been criticised for suppressing information and punishing whistleblowers during the early stages of the contagion, which an AFP tally shows has now killed nearly 10,000 people with more than 232,000 cases worldwide.

“Some people on the US side are trying to stigmatise China’s fight against the epidemic, and shift the blame onto China,” foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.

Trump has defended his description of the virus, saying it was “not racist at all”.

China achieved a new milestone in its efforts to contain the spread of the COVID-19 in the last three months by reporting zero cases on Wednesday.

However, the NHC said on Friday that it received reports of 39 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases on the Chinese mainland on Thursday, all of which were imported taking the total of confirmed cases of people coming from abroad to 228.

Of them, 14 were reported in the Guangdong Province, eight in Shanghai, six in Beijing and three in the Fujian Province.

Air Canada plans to temporarily lay off more than 5,000 flight attendants, due to the new coronavirus pandemic, their union said on Friday.

YouTube has unveiled a fresh effort to stem the spread of coronavirus misinformation with a “news shelf” on its homepage promoting “authoritative content”. The move is the latest by technology platforms to curb the sharing of rumors and hoaxes about the pandemic, with Facebook having announced a similar action this week.

Paris police have detained two people on suspicion of hoarding face masks in defiance of a government decree ordering such products be turned over to authorities during the coronavirus outbreak, prosecutors said.

A Polish member of the European Parliament said he had tested positive for coronavirus, making him the first known MEP with the disease. “Folks, I got tested for COVID-19. It was positive. I’m in the hospital and I feel fine,” Adam Jarubas said on Twitter.

The Catholic Church granted forgiveness — under certain conditions — for the sins of the faithful struck by the novel coronavirus. A decree published by the Vatican also covers healthcare workers and those who pray for their wellbeing. Relatives who care for their sick family members may also be forgiven.

Britain’s Farnborough airshow, a showpiece event for the global aerospace sector battered by the coronavirus pandemic, has been cancelled for this year, organisers said on Friday. “It is with great regret that we announce the Farnborough International Airshow 2020, due to take place in July, is cancelled,” read a statement from the organisers of the biennial event.

Authorities in Moscow are detaining and deporting Chinese nationals for violating quarantine procedures the city Government mandated in response to the coronavirus, according to court filings and a lawyer working on at least 15 cases.

Nepal pledged nearly $1 million contribution to the SAARC Corona Emergency Fund, which was proposed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi with an initial offer of $10 million to help combat the viral pandemic in the region.

British doctors and health workers have raised the alarm about a lack of sufficient protective kit to treat potential coronavirus patients, potentially exposing themselves and putting vulnerable patients at risk.

Germany’s largest state Bavaria on Friday became the first region in the country to order a lockdown to prevent coronavirus infections. “From midnight tonight for a provisional period of two weeks, there will be fundamental restrictions on going out,” state premier Markus Soeder said.

Mexico and the US announced plans Friday to sharply limit travel over their busy shared border as part of efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. President Donald Trump and Mexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said the two governments agreed to prohibit recreational and tourist travel, similar to the restrictions put in place earlier this week along the US and Canadian border.

President Donald Trump has invoked the Defense Production Act to get needed medical supplies on the front lines of the coronavirus outbreak, mobilising the federal Government to marshal the private sector to combat the pandemic. Trump had said earlier in the week he would tap the act as needed. He said he has put that “in gear.”

176,21-3-20,Ba’s unwritten diary,"Author BM Bhalla tells Chahak Mittal that while writing Kasturba Gandhi: A Biography, he interpreted the events in the life of the protagonist by browsing through literature on her more famous husband

She has always been looked at through the prism of her husband. Commonly called ‘Ba’, Kasturba Gandhi was an ideal model, great support and the perfect co-voyager of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi’s journey from South Africa to India and his transformation into the Mahatma. She devoted herself to the dharma of being a true Hindu wife and followed it her entire life. However, as author BM Bhalla argues, “she was much more than that.” She weathered one storm after another and successfully faced unexpected challenges. She emerged to become one of the brightest faces of womanhood during India’s freedom struggle while remaining within the precincts of her home.

While the Father of the Nation has been the topic of many debates and discussions by various authors and by Gandhi himself, not many accounts mention Kasturba and her life at length. People know her through a few letters written to her by Gandhi that he has talked about in his Autobiography. However, she has no personal memoirs about her thoughts and experiences. Bhalla, in his book Kasturba Gandhi: A Biography, talks about how her contributions to India’s struggle for independence have not been given the critical importance they deserve. Excerpts:

Why Kasturba? How is she relevant today?

The book deals with the life of Kasturba, who took her own conscious decision to participate in the Satyagraha movement in South Africa along with a large contingent of uneducated poor Indian women there. Her story is very relevant today because uneducated poor women are still struggling for their rights.

Documenting a prominent person’s life could be challenging, especially if s/he is related to the history of the nation. How did you gather information for the book about Kasturba Gandhi?

Kasturba was not educated. She herself left no records of her thoughts, feelings, struggles, associations, experiences or any details of events she was a part of. She never thought of it nor was she intellectually equipped for it. So we don’t have Kasturba’s version of the events in which she was involved. Not many detailed accounts or reminiscences have been left by the members of her family or friends in public life.

Kasturba’s life and work can’t even be imagined or assessed independently; it was enmeshed in the day-to-day engagements of her husband and the alchemy of his life. Her situation did not allow her to initiate any action outside her home. All initiatives and innovations were initiated by her husband and obeying his dictates became an opportunity for her to learn, react and resist. So the facts about her life and work are part of the history of the eventful years in the 19th and 20th century in South Africa and India.

An author has to cope with the huge material about Gandhi’s struggle with himself and the mighty forces against which he pitched himself. Kasturba was a perpetual partner in these struggles. Her life and work can only be assessed in an imaginative and contextual framework of this historical epoch and it is indeed a challenging task for any author.

An author who is penning a biography always has this pressure of showcasing his protagonist in the right light since questions could be raised later over the accuracy and actuality of the facts presented in the book...

A biographer is an interpreter of events in respect of his protagonist and he has to decide what the “right light” for his interpretation is. The facts presented in the book have to be documented and the events as they unfold in the life of the protagonist should be presented accurately. Yet the author’s own set of values gives a certain slant to his interpretations. How convincingly he argues in presenting the facts is a matter of his art.

Kasturba Gandhi’s life experiences have never been properly documented or even talked about much. Where did you source your data from?

Yes. It is a fact that the Gandhi industry has definitely expanded worldwide but any bibliography dealing with Kasturba would not list more than a dozen entries even today. However, in the last few decades, Gandhi has been rescued — to some extent, out of myths, legends, apotheoses — and dealt with more critically.

Kasturba’s life and work call for the same critical approach. Her story has to be read in terms of the struggle of Indian women for identity, equality and self-empowerment. The data for the book has been sourced from Gandhi literature, his complete works in 100 volumes and historical narrations. But in Kasturba’s case, interpretations are more important as the data has its limits.

How do you think womanhood was neglected during India’s freedom struggle? How does the book present it? Also, given today’s nationwide protests, most of which are being led by women (for instance, at Shaheen Bagh), how do you think the understanding of women’s role in challenging times has evolved?

The struggle of women for emancipation started with the spread of democracy and technological development all over the world and it is still continuing in India and in other countries. Women were not neglected during India’s freedom struggle. Rather they were brought out of the confines of the four walls of their homes to the public arena and they participated both in the revolutionary struggles and the social reform movements.

After Independence, the unfolding of the democratic process, spread of education and different movements across India have resulted in women’s participation in all walks of life. Different groups are now vying with each other for a share in economic and political power and women are trying to become a vote bank to achieve their rights.

How long did it take to compile the work into a book?

The book was conceptualised over many years and it was out of my interest in the life and work of Mahatma Gandhi.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ba---s-unwritten-diary-2020-03-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/ba---s-unwritten-diary.html
177,21-3-20,‘Karan Arjun was special’,"It was 1995 when Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan shared screen space together for the first time in the film Karan Arjun. Whether it was the Mere Karan Arjun aayenge dialogue or the songs or the actors’ performances, the Rakesh Roshan directorial became a huge hit for several reasons.

Reminiscing about the film’s 25 year long journey, Salman said: “Karan Arjun was a special film. It is the first time that Shah Rukh and I had come together on-screen. I have so many beautiful memories attached to this film. Karan Arjun is a complete entertainment package and even 25 years after its release, fans can sit together with their families and enjoy it.”

The film also featured Raakhee Gulzar, Kajol and Mamta Kulkarni in the lead roles. Rakesh Roshan too shared his experience of working on the iconic film.

“When I had written Karan Arjun, I knew I had to write a different kind of a story from all the work I had done. Reincarnation as a topic was doing the rounds since the black-and-white era but when I decided to make a film on the theme but using two brothers, I faced a lot of criticism and rejection. So, I wrote the film with a different lens like that about a mother-son bond. I had immense belief in the story and somehow knew that my audience would feel and believe every dialogue narrated by the characters. The reaction the film received then and even today is still overwhelming. The fact that a mother’s dialogue like Mere Karan-Arjun aayenge got the status it has, is all because of the conviction it was delivered with. If at that time they returned from an unimaginable place, it would have been accepted by the audience. Conviction is the one element that is behind the success of the movie and the milestone being celebrated today,” Rakesh added.

As Karan Arjun completed 25 years a few months ago, Zee Cinema will air the film to celebrate the milestone.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---karan-arjun-was-special----2020-03-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/---karan-arjun-was-special---.html
178,21-3-20,Travelling trickster,"The series, You’ve Got Magic With Neel Madhav, will present a new perspective on magic and the best of travel, food, culture, history and heritage of India, says the magician. By Team Viva

What made you believe in magic?

It all started when I used to go to Harvard Business School with my father. There, he learnt creativity and innovation from a magician. It was surprising to see how magic was treated with a completely different perspective outside India. So that changed my thought process. I always thought magic was only Abra-Ca-Dabra.

I remember my father once invited me to Harvard to watch a magic show. For some reason, I was late, which angered me. Negative emotions were running through my mind but a glimpse of the magic show changed something in me. Long story short — the magician literally had the power to take away all the negativity that I had in me. After two hours or so, I did not even realise that I was angry or sad. I felt like he had the superpower to just take away all woes. I understood that good magic had the power to heal you in a certain way. And I thought maybe in this world, something like this is very essential. That’s when I knew what I wanted to be and ended up becoming a magician.

How is You’ve Got Magic With Neel Madhav different from other exploration shows?

I am very excited. I am over the moon. I am elated. I am trying to find more words in the dictionary right now to tell you how excited I am but I can’t think of many. I think it’s high time that magic as a genre gets accepted. And this time, it’s accepted by such a great media house. Who could be better than Sony BBC Earth? I think it’s an amalgamation of all good things to make the right potion. It’s the best of magic, travel, food, culture, history and heritage. It’s a show through which most number of people in India and across the world will be able to explore Indian heritage and culture in the most magical way.

What draws you more — the travel or the reactions of people while you perform the magic?

I think they go hand in hand. In my experience of travelling, magic is a major part of the interaction that I do. A lot of communication and conversation happens after the magic, which actually acts like an ice breaker between the audience and me. It breaks through the general norm, the thought processes and the perception that someone has.

We look at it through a regular person’s perspective. If a random person woke up in the morning not knowing that he will see magic today or he’s going to experience something as magical as that, the perception of the person is different because if you take someone off guard, the conversation just gets better. It becomes more real and truer.

What kind of practice does magic require? How do you stay on top of the game?

To have expertise at anything, you need practice. If you know you want to become better than David Copperfield, you work hard for it. It’s as simple as that. There are no shortcuts. I wasn’t born with extra-terrestrial powers or this art of magic. This is just skin and I believe that in the process of wanting to master things, each day is a gift to practice and learn more. And every performance is practice in itself. So just keep adding on and on.

Which was that one location you would like to revisit?

All of them. We under appreciate our Indian heritage, culture and history. All the places have been amazing and I’m the luckiest person to have experienced so many of them. I have spent the last six years of my life travelling across India and now, I have officially been to all the 29 states in India. I have done the most magical things and not so magical things — all at once!

Have you performed your art for any celebrity or influencer? If yes, then how was that experience? And if not, then who would you like to perform for?

My go-to magic effect is definitely to reveal someone’s ATM pin. So whenever I meet a celebrity or artiste, that is the first trick I try with them. This obviously has one and only one reaction where they call me a ‘deadly guy’ or a ‘dangerous guy’. I kind of know almost every celebrity’s ATM pins ranging from the Queen of Bhutan, who does not actually have one but she made it up for the trick, to the Prince of Kuwait and knighted people from London. Well, the list goes on...

Your favourite trick?

As mentioned, I love finding peoples ATM pins. It’s the creepiest and fun magic I have ever performed on celebrities. It’s interesting, keeps people on their toes and also enough for them to not want me to dive deeper into the game (Laughs).

“...A further five tournaments have also been cancelled or postponed,” BWF said in a statement.

“This includes the suspension of the three Continental Confederation championships scheduled for week 17 on the BWF Tournament Calendar — one of the last chances for athletes to gain qualification for Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games before the April 26 deadline,” it added.

“I am thankful to my family for supporting me in all my endeavours. They have never stopped me.”

Harendra, who guided India to the 2016 Junior World Cup title in Lucknow, said his 3C principles of communication, commitment and coordination, which he employed as a hockey coach, have played a key role in his work so far at the airport.

“In this mission too, I just followed my 3C formula. It is the same formula which I employed during the Junior World Cup,” he said.

“When you have got an opportunity to serve the country, you can’t take a step back. Life threat is there but I am enjoying every bit of this challenge,” said Harendra, who is often seen running from the terminal to the tarmac wearing a decontamination suit.

Harendra said being in charge on the ground, his job is to ensure smooth and hassle free transfer of the passengers after they land here.

He said conducting operations at the airport was a completely different ball game but his hockey experience is definitely coming handy in his current assignment.

“Both the experiences are challenging but are completely different. But I must admit my experience as a hockey coach is definitely giving me an edge,” Harendra signed off.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/hockey-coach-harendra-leads-on-different-turf.html
182,21-3-20,Japan Olympic Committee official urges delay,"The Tokyo Olympics should be postponed, according to a senior member of the Japan Olympic Committee, adding her voice to a growing chorus calling for Tokyo 2020 to be delayed.

“It should be postponed under the current situation where athletes can’t be well prepared,” Kaori Yamaguchi, a JOC executive board member, told the Nikkei daily in an interview published on Friday.

Yamaguchi, who won a Bronze medal for judo at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, is the first JOC board member to call openly for a postponement of the Tokyo Games.

Yamaguchi criticised the IOC stance, saying the body “is putting athletes at risk.”

“By asking them to train under these conditions, the IOC is opening itself up the criticism that it is not putting athletes first,” Yamaguchi told the newspaper.

“Unlike other sporting events, the Olympics symbolise the ideal that sports bring about world peace,” she said.

The Olympics should not be held “if people across the world can’t enjoy themselves,” she said.

“What I’m most scared of is that we force an opening and have people question the Olympics, asking, ‘Why only the Olympics’?” she said.

She also urged the IOC to at least set a deadline for its final decision.

Yamaguchi said she plans to argue her position when the JOC meets Friday next week, the business daily added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/japan-olympic-committee-official-urges-delay.html
183,21-3-20,Japan welcome Olympic flame,"The Olympic flame arrived in Japan on Friday to a muted reception, what should have been a joyous celebration dramatically scaled down due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The flame landed on a special charter flight into Matsushima Air Base in Miyagi province, chosen as part of the “Recovery Olympics” to showcase the region’s revival after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown.

Former Japanese Olympians Saori Yoshida and Tadahiro Nomura collected the flame from the aircraft and took it to a cauldron in the shape of a cherry blossom on a stage in front of selected guests.

But some 200 local children that were due to welcome the flame were kept away as part of what organisers called the “heartbreaking” decision to pare back events as the world battles the virus.

After a speech by chief organiser Yoshiro Mori, the former Olympians lit the cauldron with the torch, also designed to represent Japan’s cherished cherry blossom.

“Children had planned to welcome the Olympic flame, but we decided to scale it down, giving priority to their safety,” Mori said.

The actual torch relay begins on March 26, starting from the J-Village sports complex in Fukushima that was commandeered as a base by workers scrambling to contain the fall-out from the nuclear meltdown.

“The Olympic flame relay is the biggest event ahead of the Olympics. It is very important for us to carry it out at any cost,” said Tokyo 2020 CEO Toshiro Muto ahead of the ceremony.

But organisers have been forced to scale back what should have been a key event to raise awareness and excitement ahead of the July 24 opening ceremony.

While spectators are allowed to watch from the roadside, fans have been urged to “avoid forming crowds”, with organisers warning there could be a change of programme in the event of “excessive congestion”.

Daily arrival and departure ceremonies are closed to the public and all torch-bearers will have their temperatures taken before participating in the relay, which is scheduled to visit every part of Japan on a 121-day journey before entering Tokyo.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/japan-welcome-olympic-flame.html
184,21-3-20,Aussies seek “fair play” from Oly organizers,"Australia’s swimmers are more concerned about a level playing field than ruling the pool at the Olympics.

Due to travel bans, isolation requirements and other issues thousands of athletes still haven’t qualified for their events.

“We are still preparing for the Olympics and Paralympics to the best of our ability but we absolutely understand that for a lot of our peers and colleagues this isn’t the reality anymore, as it may not be for us soon,” Swimming Australia said in a release co-signed by head coach Jacco Verhaeren on Friday.

“We hope the IOC and (Paralympic organizers) are considering everything they can to ensure that there is a level playing field, with athletes being able to perform in healthy conditions.”

The key theme? It would be fairer to postpone the Olympics.

Swimming has been a regular source of medals at the Olympics and world championships for Australia, where the climate, location and relatively high number of Olympic-size pools is an advantage, but not an insurmountable one.

“At the heart of the Olympic and Paralympic competition is the notion of fair play — a value we hold very close, and we do not want that to be compromised,” the statement continued. “We know athlete preparation is being severely compromised. Friendship and solidarity are important Olympic and Paralympic values and we stand with you in this time of uncertainty.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/aussies-seek----fair-play----from-oly-organizers.html
185,21-3-20,‘Premature’ to postpone Tokyo Games: IOC chief,"International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said it would be “premature” to postpone the Tokyo Games but admitted the body was “considering different scenarios” as the coronavirus pandemic advances.

The IOC will act on advice from its own taskforce and the World Health Organization, Bach told the New York Times, after a week when the IOC has weathered criticism over its response to the crisis.

But he remained optimistic about holding the Tokyo Olympics on schedule from July 24 to August 9, and said there was no question of cancelling the Games altogether.

“Of course we are considering different scenarios, but we are contrary to many other sports organizations or professional leagues in that we are four-and-a-half months away from the Games,” Bach said.

“For us, (postponement) would not be responsible now and it would be premature to start speculation or make a decision at a time when we do not have any recommendation from the task force,” he added.

Speculation has been growing over the Games, scheduled to start on July 24, after the COVID-19 outbreak closed sports competitions around the world, and paralysed many countries along with international travel.

Olympic qualifiers are among the tournaments affected, with 43 percent of athletes yet to book their spots. But Bach said the situation was still too uncertain to make a decision about Tokyo.

“What makes this crisis so unique and so difficult to overcome is the uncertainty. Nobody today can tell you what the developments are tomorrow, what they are in one month, not to mention in more than four months,” he said.

“Therefore it would not be responsible in any way to set a date or take a decision right now, which would be based on the speculation about the future developments.”

Athletes lashed out at IOC advice this week to continue training “as best they can” but Bach said health considerations were “first and foremost”, adding “the decision of the IOC will not be determined by any financial interest”. “For us, while not knowing how long this tunnel will be, we would like the Olympic flame to be a light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.

Despite remaining hopeful of starting the Games on time, Bach said the IOC’s risk-management policies and insurance “will make it possible for us to continue our operations and organize future Olympic Games”.

“The IOC has no cash-flow problem,” he added, when asked about the potential problem of broadcast payments not arriving in July.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---premature----to-postpone-tokyo-games--ioc-chief-2020-03-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---premature----to-postpone-tokyo-games--ioc-chief.html

Smart tested positive Thursday but said he was not showing any of the symptoms.

""I feel great. I feel fine. I feel like I can go play a game right now,"" the 26-year-old from Texas told CNN Friday.

But he had a warning for young Americans like those shown partying on Florida beaches undeterred by the threat of COVID-19.

""I advise my generation, I am 26, to take it seriously,"" Smart said.

""Be alert. Take precautions. By protecting yourself, you protect others.

""That's the key. People are not showing symptoms so it is hard for anyone to know they have the virus. But being around a group of people, friends, family and not isolating themselves, you are a carrier. You can spread the virus around without knowing.""

On Twitter he also stressed that the younger generation must self-distance.

""This is not a joke. Not doing so is selfish. Together we can beat this, but we must beat it together by being apart for a short while. Much love!!,"" he tweeted.

At least 14 NBA team members have so far tested positive for COVID-19, including Brooklyn Nets Kevin Durant and Utah Jazz's Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell.

On Wednesday, commissioner Adam Silver said NBA players should be considered ""super spreaders"" of the disease.

Silver's comments came amid criticism that wealthy athletes were getting tested for the virus ahead of critically ill patients in US hospitals.

Smart said he was tested on Saturday and got the results five days later.

""I found out yesterday evening,"" he said. ""I was like, Oh wow! It makes you alert to what is going on.""

Smart told CNN he was not worried about his symptoms getting worse.

""I talked to my doctors and they just told me that I have not experienced symptoms yet so I should be on the last curve of the ball.

""I am just ready to get this behind and move on.""

187,21-3-20,Warner pulls out of Hundred,"Star Australian opener David Warner has reportedly decided to pull out of England Cricket Board’s The Hundred league as it is clashing with national team’s limited overs series against Zimbabwe.

According to Australian website WAtoday, Warner’s manager James Erskine said that the decision has got nothing to do with prevailing COVID-19 pandemic that has caused a global lock-down of cricketing activities.

“David Warner has pulled out of the Hundred in what could be the first of multiple withdrawals from England’s new franchise league by international players as the coronavirus pandemic grips world sport,” the website reported.

Warner at a fee of GBP 125,000 was the highest paid player for the 100-ball-a-side spectacle which was set to be held from July 17 to August 15.

“His decision to withdraw from the competition was unrelated to the COVID-19 outbreak, his manager James Erskine said as he confirmed the move on Friday,” the report further stated.

Erskine on Thursday had said that Warner will be playing IPL if the COVID-19 pandemic is under control and the league gets rolling after April 15, the time till which the league has been suspended.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/warner-pulls-out-of-hundred.html
188,21-3-20,"One of Indian football’s greatest, PK Banerjee dies at 83","PK Banerjee, a footballing colossus of his time and a raconteur for life, died here on Friday aged 83, having dribbled and dazzled for a good part of his mind-boggling 51 years of service to the game.

He was suffering from respiratory problems due to pneumonia and had an underlying history of Parkinson’s disease, dementia and heart problem. Banerjee, who was on life support at a hospital here since March 2, breathed his last at 12:40pm.

Born on June 23, 1936 in Moynaguri on the outskirts of Jalpaiguri in West Bengal, Banerjee’s family relocated to his uncle’s place in Jamshedpur before partition.

The 1962 Asian Games Gold-medallist’s best days as a player coincided with Indian football’s golden era. He scored 65 international goals in 84 appearances for the national team.

His contribution was duly recognised by FIFA which rated him as India’s greatest player of the 20th century, bestowing him with the Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.

From his debut for Bihar in the Santosh Trophy as a 16-year-old in 1952 to a stint as Mohammedan Sporting coach 51 years later, Banerjee takes leave as one of India’s greatest.

A member of the holy trinity, that also included Chuni Goswami and Tulsidas Balaram, Banerjee was the last surviving scorer of the 1962 Asiad Gold-winning team.

Another one his bright moments with the national team was a fourth-place finish at the 1956 Olympics, where India beat Australia 4-1.

In the final of the 1962 Asiad, India prevailed in front of a hostile crowd angered by chef de mission Guru Dutt Sondhi’s remark that it was ‘Jakarta Games’, for barring countries like Taiwan and Israel.

Banerjee scored the opener in that game.

He was captain of the Indian team that last played the Olympics in Rome 1960.

He retired as a player in 1967 after being laid low by recurring injuries. But then went on accumulate a staggering 54 trophies as a coach.

He pulled off a heist as Mohun Bagan coach when they famously held New York Cosmos 2-2 in an exhibition match starring Pele in 1977.

The star of Indian football when the sport was at its peak, Banerjee never played for Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, representing Eastern Railways all his life.

A FIFA-certified coach, Banerjee had a coaching career as illustrious as his playing one, beginning with Bata SC and Eastern Railway.

Having struck gold as a player, a young 35-year-old Banerjee was made a joint India coach with G M Basha, and they delivered a Bronze at the Bangkok Asiad in 1970.

Within a year at the helm, Banerjee guided India to a joint triumph at the Singapore Pesta Sukan Cup in 1971.

East Bengal won five CFL titles on the trot under his tutelage.

He also delivered at Mohun Bagan, guiding them to a treble — IFA Shield, Rovers Cup and Durand Cup — in 1977.

He was coach of the Mohun Bagan that famously held the then Soviet Union team, Ararat Yerevan, in the 1978 IFA Shield final.

Back at East Bengal, Banerjee oversaw their famous 4-1 win over the arch-rivals in the 1997 Federation Cup semifinal.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/one-of-indian-football---s-greatest--pk-banerjee-dies-at-83.html
189,21-3-20,We will earn profit from PSL: PCB,"Pakistan Cricket Board is confident of gaining profit from the Pakistan Super League despite the T20 competition was suspended at the semi-final stage.

According to official sources, the PCB is set to make profits from four major commercial deals, including broadcasting and digital media.

“We will earn more compared to the four previous editions because majority of the matches (in earlier editions) had to be held in the UAE where we generally had low crowds and commercial deals were also not very profitable,” a source said.

“The losses will come from four matches being held behind closed doors in Karachi and Lahore but the gate money receipts are minimal compared to the profits we will make from commercial, sponsorship and broadcasting deals.”

The PSL was on Tuesday suspended after the PCB revealed that a foreign player showed symptoms of the dreaded COVID-19. The PCB had also shortened the league by four days considering the worsening coronavirus situation but was forced to call it off on Tuesday.

One source said 24 off the 30 matches held before the semi-finals and final were full houses in Multan, Lahore, Rawalpindi and Karachi and gate money earnings were very good.

“But yes, some matches were hit by bad weather and reduced overs but we will still make good profits from the PSL this time despite four matches being held in empty stadiums,” he said.

Chopra, who has qualified for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics, has been told by the SAI to stay at his hostel room without mixing up with other athletes at the NIS if he has to be at the premier sports facility of the country.

He returned to India from Turkey on Wednesday.

Another Olympics-bound javelin thrower Shivpal Singh has left NIS as he preferred to stay at his home.

“SAI said if Neeraj wants to stay at the NIS, he has to remain in self isolation for 14 days without mixing with others. He and Rohit Yadav who returned from Turkey have been given hostel rooms separated from other trainees. They have also been given an old gym facility near their hostel room,” a source at the NIS Patiala said.

“Shivpal and Vipin Kasana who returned from South Africa wanted to leave for home. They left NIS Patiala yesterday,” he added.

The source said SAI insisted that Neeraj and all those who returned from abroad should remain isolated for 14 days even though they were screened for coronavirus symptoms at the Indira Gandhi International airport.

“At the airport, everyone was screened and cleared but when they reached NIS, the SAI said all the returning athletes and coaches should remain in isolation for 14 days. AFI said it was all right since they have been screened and cleared at the airport but SAI insisted.”

The 22-year-old Chopra qualified for the Tokyo Games in a competition in South Africa in January with a throw of 87.86m, having made his return from an elbow surgery last year. He then went to Turkey for a training stint as part of preparations for the Olympics.

He was supposed to take part in the elite Diamond League series beginning in Doha on April 17 but the World Athletics announced its decision to postpone the first three legs.

Another Indian javelin thrower Shivpal also qualified for the Tokyo Games while training at Potchefstroom in South Africa.

192,21-3-20,Mary Kom found some freedom in self-isolation,"The COVID-19 pandemic has isolated her from the world outside but iconic Indian boxer M C Mary Kom says the forced slowdown of life as usual has also redefined the meaning of freedom for her.

Mary Kom has self-isolated at her Delhi residence since returning from the this month’s Asian Olympic Qualifiers in Jordan where she booked herself a second Olympic berth.

The precautionary measure was necessitated by a training trip to Italy before landing in Jordan even though the entire Indian team got COVID-19 negative certificates from the IOC.

“I am chilling, doing my exercises, taking care of my fitness and playing with my children after being away from them for almost one month,” Mary Kom said.

“That’s the best part of this isolation, I am with my family through the day without having to think of anything. My appeal to everyone is don’t panic, try and stay at home if you can and spend time with your family,” she said.

“In my case, I have felt a sense of freedom with this isolation. I have realised that I am not feeling the stress of a daily schedule right now.”

A five-time Asian champion besides being a Gold-medallist at the Commonwealth and Asian Games, Mary Kom would be competing in her last Olympic Games if it goes ahead as scheduled in July-August in Tokyo.

“I don’t think the Games will be postponed or cancelled. It is too huge an event to be shifted just like that. It will cause chaos. In any case, it’s not in my hands. So, it’s better I don’t say much,” she said.

But will the current situation, in which travel restrictions by most countries have nearly brought the world to a halt, have a bearing on her preparations for Tokyo?

“Some planning is required. I haven’t yet made up my mind, Training here is also pretty smooth. There is nothing missing. We will see how the situation is in the next couple of weeks before deciding on whether going outside is an option,” she explained.

“Till then, everyone please stay at home and don’t forget to wash your hands,” she laughed.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mary-kom-found-some-freedom-in-self-isolation.html
193,21-3-20,Mirabai sure-shot for her second Olympics,"Weightlifting’s Olympic qualifying schedule has gone haywire due to the Covid-19 pandemic but India’s Mirabai Chanu is a sure-shot for the Tokyo Games, if they are held, while young Jeremy Lalrinnunga is also set to make the cut for the mega sporting spectacle.

Former world champion Chanu currently occupies third place in the women’s 49kg world rankings following the cancellation of the Asian Championships, the last Olympics qualifying event of the continent due to the coronavirus outbreak.

She has taken part in five events out of the six mandated in the new qualification rules.

In a meeting of the Executive Board of the International Weightlifting Federation held on March 17-18 via video conference, the world body has made some recommendations to the International Olympic Association (IOC) regarding the Olympic qualifying events.

One of the key recommendations, sources said, may close the qualification process as all the five continental championships were cancelled.

This would mean the Olympics qualification slots will be decided based on the current world rankings. The IOC will, however, take a final call on the recommendations of the International Weightlifting Federation.

“Mirabai is certain to the qualify for the Olympics, she is currently at third spot in the world rankings. The top eight from the world rankings after the end of the qualification period automatically qualifies for Tokyo Olympics,” Indian Weightlifting Federation Secretary General Sahdev Yadav said.

“She has competed in five qualifying events but the sixth one, the Asian Championships in Tashkent was cancelled. I think there will be no more qualifying events and the world rankings is set to be based on what it currently is.”

Under the new rules, to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics, a weightlifter must compete in at least one event in each of the three periods of six months (spread over November 2018 to April 2020), at least six events overall and in at least one gold and silver-level event.

The 25-year-old Chanu has now collected 3869 Robi points — the IWF’s official calculation method — to be placed third behind Hou Zhihui (4703) of China and Ri Song Gum (4209) of North Korea.

Regarding the 17-year-old Jeremey (men’s 67kg), who won a Gold in 62kg in the 2018 Youth Olympic Games, Yadav said, “In the Olympics, there will be 14 competitors in each weight category, men and women. Besides the top eight from the world rankings, the top ranker from each of the five continents will also qualify. Jeremy is at the top of Asian rankings and if the international federation’s recommendations are accepted by the IOC, he will also qualify.”

Jeremy is at the top of Asian rankings with 3119 Robi points, far ahead of second-placed Mohammed Almazyadi Nawaf (2672) from Saudi Arabia. He is set for his maiden Olympics.

The last slot will be from the host country, if that country (Japan) has not qualified from this method. But if a weightlifter from the host country has qualified, the last slot will be given through the tripartite commission process.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mirabai-sure-shot-for-her-second-olympics.html

The Assembly speaker had accepted the resignations of 16 of these rebel Congress MLAs on Thursday, a day before Chief Minister Kamal Nath chose to resign after it became clear that his government had lost the majority.

The speaker had accepted the resignations of six of them earlier.

Scindia, a former Union minister, quit the Congress and joined the BJP recently.

The saffron party is likely to stake claim to form the government in Madhya Pradesh.

Italy has overtaken China as the worst-hit with over over 4,000 deaths reported so far.

The NHC said on Saturday that no new domestically transmitted cases of COVID-19 were reported on the Chinese mainland for the third day in a row on Friday.

On Friday, seven deaths and 36 new suspected cases were reported on the mainland, with all the deaths reported from the virus' epicentre Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, it said.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland have reached 81,008 by the end of Friday, which included 3,255 deaths, 6,013 patients still undergoing treatment, 71,740 patients who have been discharged after recovery, the NHC said.

Facing a sharp increase of COVID-19 cases from abroad, China will take strict measures to prevent imported cases, spokesman of the NHC Mi Feng told media here on Saturday.

He said the total number of imported cases to the Chinese mainland increased by 216 per cent to 269 from March 11 to 20.

He also noted that the mainland reported no new domestically transmitted COVID-19 cases for the third day in a row on Friday, and provincial-level regions except the hard-hit Hubei province had been clear of indigenous cases for nine days.

He called for unswerving efforts in preventing the COVID-19 epidemic from rebounding.

The NHC said 41 new confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported on the Chinese mainland on Friday from the people arriving from abroad, taking the total number of imported cases to 269.

While reporting about a steady increase in imported cases, the NHC did not specify whether the infected persons were foreigners or Chinese nationals returning from abroad.

China has imposed strict quarantine measures for all those returning from other countries.

Hong Kong reported 17 additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 20 preliminary positive cases on Saturday. With the 17 newly confirmed cases, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong has risen to 273.

Meanwhile Wuhan, which is under lockdown since January 23 as part of attempts by the government to isolate the COVID-19 epidemic, will reopen commercial outlets to residents in an orderly manner, local authorities said.

Commercial outlets in residential communities and villages without existing confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases can resume business, state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Wuhan municipal bureau of commerce as saying.

Those outlets mainly include supermarkets, convenience stores, fresh food shops, fruit and vegetable shops and others that supply daily necessities.

Each household can send one person a day to go shopping with a one-time pass certificate or an electronic health code. Each shopping trip will be limited to within two hours, it said.

China is speeding up construction on major infrastructure projects to mitigate the economic impact of the novel coronavirus epidemic.

The country, which came to a grinding halt since January third week due to the coronavirus scare, has resumed the construction in nearly 90 per cent of 11,000 key projects from March 20, Ou Hong, an official with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), told media here.

The FIR was registered at Sarojini Nagar police station on Friday based on a complaint filed by the Lucknow chief medical officer, said Police Commissioner Surjit Pandey.

Pandey said Kapoor has been charged under IPC Sections 269 (negligent acts likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant acts likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant).

Kapoor is said to have visited at least three gatherings in different areas of Lucknow.

She has become the first Bollywood celebrity to test positive for the deadly virus in the country and has said she is under complete quarantine and medical care.

In a statement on Instagram, the 41-year-old 'Baby Doll' singer said she developed signs of flu in the last five days.

Talking to reporters, Tope said the number of coronavirus positive patients in the state has increased to 63 with 11 new cases.

""Of the 11, eight have travel history abroad and three came in contact with the affected persons,"" he said, adding that 10 cases are in Mumbai, while one is in Pune.

""A rise from 52 to 63 is big,"" he said.

Of the total number of patients, 13 to 14 patients are those who came in contact with the positive patients.

""Rest all are import cases,"" he said.

""The spread has been largely because of people who came from outside,' he said.

""I appeal to the people not to venture out. They should exercise self discipline by maintaining social distancing and hygiene,"" he said.

""Ifthere is no reductionin crowd in public transport, a shutdown will have to be put in place. There is also an option of allowing people in public transport after checking their I-cards,"" he said.

The suburban trains in Mumbai will function for essential activities, he added.

Tope said that the rise in the number of patients is a major cause of concern and people's cooperation is needed to fight out the outbreak.

""If people don't listen and continue to use public transport unnecessarily, we may have to think otherwise,"" he said, adding that we are in Phase-2 and heading towards Phase-3.

Tope said the WHO and the Centre's guidelines say that virus survives in cool places or a longer time.

""So, not just the government offices, but people should also follow the guidelines of not using air conditioning systems,"" he said.

He also said that the rush of the working class at the railway stations to head back to their home state is something to worry about.

""We have asked for increasing the number of outstation trains, so that those who want to go back to their native places, can do so. This will reduce crowding at railway stations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune,"" the minister said.

Tope said the government was closely monitoring the crowding in local trains after all offices and shops have been asked to shut down.

""We are in observation and appeal mode as of now. Even the Centre feels that the public transport in Mumbai needs to be shut down. This was conveyed to (Sharad) Pawar saheb by Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan,"" he said.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Pawar were in touch with the Centre.

The NCP chief talked to Harsh Vardhan over phone about the need to upgrade testing facilities, he said.

""Private labs should be given permissionto conduct testing and even medical colleges hospitals can do it. This will reduce the waiting period for reports,"" he said.

""Planned surgeries in civic-run and medical college hospitals have been put off. As many as 7,000 quarantine beds have been added in the state,"" he said.

Tope said the chief minister is likely to visit some railway stations to see if people are responding to avoid crowding.

210,21-3-20,E-cigarette users at high bladder cancer risk: Study,"A team of US researchers has discovered six substances that have a strong link to bladder cancer in the urine of people who had used electronic cigarettes and, sometimes, other tobacco products.

In a study published in the journal European Urology Oncology, researchers from the University of North Carolina (UNC) Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center and NYU Langone Health compiled the results of 22 different studies that analyzed the urine of people who used e-cigarettes or other tobacco products, including cigarettes.

The aim was to check for evidence of cancer-linked compounds or biomarkers of those compounds. They found six biomarkers or compounds with a strong link to bladder cancer.

""Smoking is the No.1 modifiable behavioural risk factor for bladder cancer. There is now evolving literature showing that people who vape may have similar carcinogens in their urine as combustible cigarette users,"" said Marc Bjurlin, associate professor of urology in the UNC School of Medicine.

To develop a better understanding of the long-term risks of vaping, including cancer, researchers investigated possible exposure to substances that can cause bladder cancer in particular since carcinogens could be processed in the body and then passed in urine.

In their review, Bjurlin and his colleagues found 40 different parent compounds that can be processed in the body to produce 63 different toxic chemicals or carcinogenic metabolites, which are substances that remain after in the body after processing.

Six of those chemicals have a strong link to bladder cancer, according to researchers' analysis of carcinogens databases of the International Agency for Research on Cancer and the Collaborative on Health and the Environment Toxicant and Disease Database.

""The first and foremost side effects that we're seeing from electronic cigarette use are lung and pulmonary related,"" Bjurlin said.

""We won't see the side effects for these other kinds of carcinogenic pathways until much later down the exposure pipeline"".

They found evidence in some studies that e-cigarette users had ""significantly"" higher levels of several carcinogens that can be metabolized into substances linked to bladder cancer in their urine compared to people who had never used them.

""This finding shows us that people who vape will be exposed to a variety of different carcinogens,"" Bjurlin said.

People who have decades of exposure to these carcinogens from vaping may be at risk for developing malignancies, especially bladder cancer, the authors wrote.

There were limitations to the study, including that researchers did not know the levels of all of the cancer-causing substances in the urine of users from the studies.

In addition, some studies included people who were ""dual users"", or people who both smoked and vaped e-cigarettes.

Further research is needed, said Bjurlin, who wants to determine the threshold of exposure to carcinogens that would lead to development of bladder cancer or other cancer types.

213,21-3-20,Wuhan recovery gives hope to rest of world: WHO,"The World Health Organization said Friday that the Chinese epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak at last reporting no new cases gave hope to the rest of the world battling the pandemic.

The city of Wuhan registered no new cases of COVID-19 in 24 hours -- for the first time since reporting its first case in December in an outbreak that has gone on to infect more than 250,000 people around the world and kill more than 11,000 people.

""Yesterday, Wuhan reported no new cases for the first time since the outbreak started,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual news conference in Geneva.

""Wuhan provides hope for the rest of the world that even the most severe situation can be turned around.

""Of course, we must exercise caution; the situation can reverse. But the experience of cities and countries that have pushed back this coronavirus gives hope and courage to the rest of the world.""

Tedros said that although older people had been the hardest hit by the disease, younger people were not spared, saying they made up many of the sufferers needing hospital treatment.

""Today I have a message for young people: you are not invincible. This virus could put you in hospital for weeks -- or even kill you,"" he warned.

""Even if you don't get sick, the choices you make about where you go could be the difference between life and death for someone else.

""I'm grateful that so many young people are spreading the word and not the virus."" He said solidarity between the generations was one of the keys to defeating the spread of the pandemic.

The WHO also said it was now using the term ""physical distancing"" rather than ""social distancing"" to describe the need to maintain space between people to avoid the virus passing.

It said the change of emphasis was to stress that though people may need to go into physical isolation, they did not need to become socially isolated, saying it was important to maintain good mental health during the crisis.

""We can keep connected in many ways without physically being in the same space,"" Maria Van Kerkhove, who heads the WHO's emerging diseases unit, said.

""We want people to still remain connected.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/wuhan-recovery-gives-hope-to-rest-of-world--who-2020-03-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/wuhan-recovery-gives-hope-to-rest-of-world--who.html

President of India, dozens of Parliamentarians, Union Ministers, and several dignitaries have come under the coronavirus scanner for coming into contact with Lok Sabha member Dushyant Singh, who had earlier attended dinner in Lucknow with COVID positive Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor, famour for her “Baby Doll” number.

Dushyant’s mother Vasundhara Raje as well several top officials of the State Government and UP Health Minister Jai Pratap Singh were present at the party attended by over 180 guests.

Dushyant, who had attended Parliament proceedings for three days after Kanika’s party and also attended a dinner reception hosted by President Ram Nath Kovind where Union Ministers Rajnath Singh, Smriti Irani, Maneka Gandhi, VK Singh and others were present at Rashtrapati Bhawan on Wednesday. The samples of Dushyant and Vasundhara have gone for testing and results were awaited. Both of them have quarantined themselves.

Meanwhile on Friday, the Lucknow Police booked Kanika for negligence and disobedience to the order issued by a public servant. “An FIR was lodged under IPC Sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant),” said Police Commissioner Surjit Pandey.

Several MPs, including TMC’s Derek O’Brien and Sukhendu Shekhar Roy, and Apna Dal’s Anupriya Patel, on Friday went into self-quarantine following the announcement by the BJP MP and his mother that they were self-isolating themselves. Former Union Minister and senior Congress leader Jitin Prasada too went for self isolation.

Singh was among the many MPs who attended a breakfast meeting hosted by President Ram Nath Kovind on March 18 as well as a Parliamentary panel meeting on transport, tourism and culture attended by around 20 MPs on Wednesday.

“While in Lucknow, I attended a dinner with my son Dushyant and his in-laws. Kanika, who has unfortunately tested positive for COVID-19 was also a guest. As a matter of abundant caution, my son and I have immediately self-quarantined and we’re taking all necessary precautions,” Vasundhara said in a tweet.

According to sources, after attending the party in Lucknow along with Kanika who is now undergoing treatment for coronavirus, Singh attended birthday party of an industrialist and former MP. Dushyant also attended the BJP Parliamentary Party meeting on March 17.

“This Government is putting us all at risk. The PM says self isolate yourself but Parliament is on. I was sitting next to Dushyant the other day for 2.5 hours. There are two more MPs who are in self isolation. The session should be deferred,” O’Brien tweeted after the news of Singh going in self-isolation broke.

Kapoor has become the first Bollywood celebrity to test positive for coronavirus in the country. There were reports that the singer landed in Lucknow from the United Kingdom and was admitted in a city hospital after she showed signs of flu. Before that she attended three well attended parties and hobnobbed with hundreds of people. Kanika reportedly took help of some airport officials to avoid quarantine protocol after returning from London. Kanika also addressed a Press conference in Noida.

Alarmed by the fact that Kanika tested positive on Friday, the UP Chief Minister’s office issued directives to sanitise all the places in Lucknow, Kanpur and Noida visited either by the celebrity singer or by those who were present in different parties with her.

The singer and UP Health Minister were among 100 guests at a party hosted by interior designer Adil Ahmad, the nephew of former BSP MP Akbar Ahmad Dumpy, at his residence recently in Lucknow. Several VVIPs including top bureaucrats and political figures across parties were present.

The UP Health Minister on Friday took a test for coronavirus as it emerged that he was at a party thrown by celebrity singer Kanika Kapoor who is now suffering from COVID-19, while three BJP MLAs who met him on Thursday went into self-isolation, sources said.

Noida MLA and BJP State general secretary Pankaj Singh, Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh and Dadri MLA Tejpal Nagar took to Twitter to say they are going into self-isolation as a precautionary measure as they had met the Health Minister on Thursday in Greater Noida.

District Magistrate Abhishek Prakash ordered closure of Taj Mahal hotel in Lucknow till further orders. Though the official order gave no reason, sources said Kanika had attended a party at the hotel.

According to Kanika’s father Rajiv Kapoor, she attended a few parties between March 13 and 15. Nearly 300 people attended these parties. In a statement posted on Instagram, Kanika said she developed signs of flu only in the last four days.

Soon after, Raje, O’Brien and Patel took to Twitter to announce they have gone into self-quarantine as a precautionary measure.

“I got myself tested and it came positive for Covid-19. My family and I are in complete quarantine now and following medical advice on how to move forward. Contact mapping of people I have been in touch with is underway as well.

“I was scanned at the airport as per normal procedure 10 days ago when I came back home, the symptoms have developed only four days ago,” Kanika said in her statement.

Hitting out at the Government, O’Brien said that on one side they are talking of self-isolation and on the other hand they are continuing with the Parliament session. “Parliament has hardly discussed coronavirus. The Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha discussed COVID19 for only 3 per cent of total time. Is this how Governments inspire confidence in crisis? Defer session! Stop conflicting messaging!,” O’ Brien said.

“I was present at an event yesterday and Dushyant Singh was also present at the event. As a precaution, I am going for self isolation. I will follow the necessary guidelines by the government,” tweeted Anupriya Patel.

Earlier, MoS External Affairs V Muraleedharan had self-quarantined after he visited a Kerala-based medical institute whose hospital later reported a coronavirus case.

“Please follow social distancing norms and avoid any non-essential local travel. Approach the local health department officials in case you or your family member(s) experience any of the symptoms mentioned in the CDC website,” the embassy said.

224,21-3-20,North Korea fires two 'ballistic missiles' into sea: Seoul,"North Korea on Saturday fired two projectiles presumed to be short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast, Seoul's military said.

The projectiles were fired from North Pyongan province into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement, without providing further details.

""The military is monitoring for additional launches and maintaining readiness,"" it added.

Japan's defence ministry said the North launched what appeared to be ""ballistic missile-like object(s)"", adding there had been no indication of anything coming down in Japanese territory or its exclusive economic zone.

Earlier this month, the nuclear-armed North carried out similar launches on two occasions -- Pyongyang said they had conducted ""long-range artillery"" drills, but Japan said the projectiles appeared to be ballistic missiles.

The latest launch comes amid a prolonged hiatus in disarmament talks with the United States.

The North has been continuing to refine its weapons capabilities, analysts say, more than a year after a summit between its leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump broke down in Hanoi.

Shortly before the launch, the North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that the country would convene its rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA), on April 10 -- despite the coronavirus pandemic.

Saturday's launch came weeks after Kim sent a personal letter to the South's President Moon, offering ""comfort"" for the coronavirus outbreak in the country.

At the time, the South was the country hardest-hit by the virus outside China, but Seoul appears to have largely brought the outbreak under control -- while Pyongyang insists it has not had a single case.

That message had followed an unprecedented statement from Kim's younger sister Yo Jong, when she berated Seoul for its condemnation of Pyongyang's weapons test earlier this month was a ""truly senseless act"" and ""perfectly foolish"".

Pyongyang is under multiple sets of sanctions by the United Nations and the United States over its weapons programmes.

The North carried out a series of weapons trials late last year, the last of them in November, which it often described as multiple launch rocket systems, although others called them ballistic missiles.

Heightened tensions in 2017 were followed by two years of nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington, including three meetings between Kim and Trump, but little tangible progress was made.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/north-korea-fires-two--ballistic-missiles--into-sea--seoul-2020-03-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/north-korea-fires-two--ballistic-missiles--into-sea--seoul.html

Flip phones are back -- upwards of Rs 1 lakh -- and Samsung which initiated the new-age foldable war with Galaxy Fold is back with Galaxy Z Flip that folds into the size of a wallet, so you can easily fit it in your pocket or clutch bag, like a make-up compact.

Once you flip it open, the foldable glass features a 6.7-inch display for your regular smartphone needs. The crease in the middle is visible but doesn't disturb as you perform daily tasks - no image distortion either.

There's a tiny screen on the outer next to the cameras which shows the time and other important notifications when you tap the little display twice.

The device is available in three colour options - a stunning mirror gold colour, mirror purple and mirror Black - for Rs 1,09,999 in India.

In its previous two sales in India, the device went out of stock within minutes - cementing its position in the new-age aspirational India which is willing to spend that kind of money on a device that doesn't hurt their pockets.

Powered by a 7nm octa-core Snapdragon 855+ processor with 8GB RAM and 256GB internal storage, the device has aDynamic AMOLED Infinity Flex' display as the main display.

It is backed by a 3300mAh battery with fast-charging support via power cord and wireless PowerShare and runs Android 10 OS. The battery gives a day-long charge with ease.

In terms of optics, the phone houses 12MP ultra-wide sensor and 12MP wide-angle camera at the rear. At the front, there is a punch-hole 10MP camera.

Images were well-lit, had details and did justice in almost all light conditions - better than iPhone 11 Pro Max.

There's a fingerprint sensor, situated in the power button on the right edge - accurate and fast.

It is a dual-SIM smartphone -- with one eSIM and one Nano-SIM card slot. E-SIM services are currently available on Airtel and Jio networks.

The best part is that it slips easily into the front pocket of your shirt, back pocket of your jeans, or your clutch bag and no one knows if you are carrying any smartphone. And then you bring it out slowly, flip it open and all eyes are on you.

Another USP is that you can use rear cameras for selfies, as well as the inside sensor.

Other benefits that come with the device include accidental damage coverage, which includes one-time screen protection and a 24X7 dedicated call centre support, one-year Samsung care and protection, one-time screen damage protection service for inner screen and external screen at discounted fee (at the time of repair), up to 12 month interest-Free EMI in 10 cities and four-month free YouTube premium subscription.

Conclusion: For millions of people, this is a perfect device to remember that classic, vintage flip phone era and for the millennials -- the smooth feel, pocketable size,AmesmerizingAdesign and powerful interiors makes it a device worth their pocket.

Remember that top-end flip phones two decades ago also carried a hefty price tag compared to the basic mobile phones and still, a lot of Indians owned those devices.

Only the flip device has changed but your pocket remains the same so go, flaunt your style, impress your girlfriend, and make a solid statement with Galaxy Z Flip.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/samsung-galaxy-z-flip--worth-your-pocket--with-same-nostalgia-2020-03-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/samsung-galaxy-z-flip--worth-your-pocket--with-same-nostalgia.html

235,21-3-20,‘Long live Nirbhaya’ fills air as rapists walk to gallows,"Justice finally delivered, but fight for speedy justice for others to go on: Family

God sees the truth, but waits”, the famous story by Leo Tolstoy, was exactly the same in the modern context, the way Nirbhaya’s battered soul and her grieving parents waited for the 7 long years to see the rapists and killers being hanged. Justice was finally delivered when hangman Pawan pulled the lever of all the four death-row convicts one after another at 5.30 am on Friday morning and thus putting an end to the most talked about gangrape and subsequent murder of a 23-year-old paramedic girl in the independent India.

Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) were executed at 5.30 am in Tihar Jail.

Cheers went up after the hanging with some waving the national flag and shouting slogans of “Long Live Nirbhaya” and “Bharat Mata ki Jai”. The crowd even distributed sweets amid chanting “Nirbhaya has got justice, the other daughters still await”.

The brutality of the crime on a winter night more than seven years ago had shaken the nation. After the execution of the convicts, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said justice has prevailed. “It was of the utmost importance to ensure the dignity and safety of women,” the PM said.

While talking to the media at her home after a sleepless night that also saw the Supreme Court holding an extraordinary hearing that continued till 3.30 am, Asha Devi, mother of Nirbhaya said they finally got justice but their fight will continue for India’s daughters.

Nirbhaya was raped and brutalised by six men, including a juvenile at the time, in an empty bus that was driven through the streets of the national Capital on December 16, 2012. They then dumped her on the road and left her for dead on the cold winter night. Her friend who was with her was also severely beaten and thrown out along with her.

She was so severely violated that her insides were spilling out when she was taken to hospital and died in a Singapore hospital after battling for her life for a fortnight.

Of the six, Ram Singh allegedly committed suicide in Tihar Jail days after the trial began, and the juvenile was released in 2015 after spending three years in a correctional home.

On Friday morning since 4 am, hundreds of people started to gather in front of Tihar prison. In view on execution the authorities has also increased its security in and around the jail premises.

As the clock ticked for the execution of the four convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case and the Tihar Prison authorities geared up for the process, none of the convict showed any resistance while being taken up to gallows on Friday morning.

According to Tihar prison authorities, the convicts also did not show any signs of anxiety on the night before their execution and skipped breakfast on Friday. Vinay and Mukesh had dinner but none of the four had breakfast or a bath before they were led to the gallows.

“The meal comprised roti, dal, rice and sabzi. Akshay had tea in the evening but did not have dinner. The four convicts showed no signs of anxiety in the evening. Minutes before the execution, Mukesh had said he would like to donate his organs while Vinay wanted his paintings, done during his years in jail, to be given to the jail superintendent and his ‘Hanuman Chalisa’ to his family,” he said.

“The bodies were kept hanging for half an hour, a mandatory procedure after execution in accordance with the prison manual. The bodies were taken to the DDU Hospital for post-mortem and later were handed over to family,” said the official.

This is the first time that four men have been hanged together in Tihar Jail, South Asia’s largest prison complex that houses more than 16,000 inmates.The executions were carried out after the men exhausted every possible legal avenue to escape the gallows. Their desperate attempts only postponed the inevitable by less than two months after the first date of execution was set for January 22. In last-gasp attempts, one of the convicts knocked on the doors of the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court just hours before the hanging. A Supreme Court bench dismissed Pawan’s last plea in a late-night hearing that began at 2.30 am and lasted an hour.

It also refused to pass any direction allowing Pawan and Akshay to meet their family members just before they are sent to the gallows. Outside Tihar Jail, hundreds of people gathered despite the unearthly hour and the coronavirus scare to await news of the execution. Union Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani welcomed the news. “I have seen Nirbhaya’s mother’s struggle over the years, though it took time to get justice but it has been done finally. It is also a message to people that you can run away from law but cannot finally avoid it.

Pramod Singh Kushwaha, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Special Cell, who was during Nirbhaya gangrape and murder in 2012, the additional DCP (South) and headed the investigation team, said the hanging is a tribute to the departed soul and this will also act as a deterrent to other rapists.

Taking a counter view, human rights group Amnesty International said death penalty is never the solution towards ending violence against women and called the execution a “dark stain” on India’s human rights record. Recalling the days when Nirbhaya was treated in Safdarjanj Hospital in 2012, the doctors remembered her as a brave woman and said with the hanging of the four convicts’ law had taken its course. The road to the gallows was a long and circuitous one, going through the lower courts, the High Court, the Supreme Court and the president’s office before going back to the Supreme Court that heard and rejected various curative petitions. The death warrants were deferred by a court thrice on the grounds that the convicts had not exhausted all their legal remedies and that the mercy petition of one or the other was before the president.

On March 5, a trial court issued fresh death warrants for March 20 at 5.30 am as the final date for the execution.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---long-live-nirbhaya----fills-air-as-rapists-walk-to-gallows-2020-03-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/---long-live-nirbhaya----fills-air-as-rapists-walk-to-gallows.html
