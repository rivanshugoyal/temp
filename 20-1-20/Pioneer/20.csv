0,20-1-20,The hand that rocks,"Women across the world are challenging the authoritarian politics of the times by leading mass grassroots movements and civil uprisings

It is just another Sunday evening in Delhi, the howling cold forcing people indoors for comfort and wrapping up their energies for the week ahead. Yet in an old warehouse in Okhla, an all-women group stages a play, a dark tale about the common woman’s conflict with identity, one who finds no space to breathe amid the sorting and reordering of society that decides who she should be. What of the migrant worker, who doesn’t know where she was born or belongs, who got her to the city or not except the world that her workplace has become? Trafficked as a child, she has no paper trail, no parentage to prove why she was born. Then there’s the grass widow of Assam, whose husband has gone to the big city in search of work after their farmland was ravaged by the floods in the Brahmaputra, her ration card, the only claim to her citizenry and proof that she was married to a local, washed away by the raging waters. So left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC), she has been torn apart from her family. What of the orphaned factory worker, who has no memory of ancestry? These are survivors in a no woman’s land, a wilderness of the disowned, rising up to claim their dues for service to a nation that they are being told is not their own. “For years, have we not improved your lives as workers in factories and helps at home? Have you not trusted your children with us? Have we not been productive or contributed to your economy? Have we not helped you build your lives? Why throw us away now?” Rhetorical questions that trouble the audience.

The thunder of protest courses through the walls and seeps into every pore of human consciousness. Somehow it streams out all the way to Shaheen Bagh, to Seelampuri and even Prayagraj. Everyday women, having finished their chores and responsibilities for the day, are sitting on night vigils with candles and woollens — the same faces showing up like clockwork at the same time, same place and for the same time period — to fight for the safe future of their children and their right to be heard as mothers born of earth. Nurturing societies as they have known, created and healed, they won’t let them be destroyed by divisive constructs of the empire of politics or the hate virus that’s lab- grown from the databank of social and ancestry profiles. Certainly, they are shedding the patronising mantle of empowerment, like some undeserved grant or concession, and creating their own powerful narratives on their terms. And should that meet brutality, they would face it not as human shields or spoils of war but as a force majeure of all humanity. Age, education, privilege wouldn’t matter.

Women across the world are challenging the authoritarian politics of the times by leading mass grassroots movements and civil uprisings. Be it the women of Shaheen Bagh, or those in Sudan and Algeria, they have become the new face of democracy, change and peace-building in a world where all of these have become toxic or anachronistic. Why is this so? Because for all their efforts at political participation as drivers of change, women are still a minority or a marginalised lot in decision-making processes. This despite the United Nations’ vision from 20 years ago that women could anchor conflict resolution better when entrusted with leadership roles. Somewhere, this has got to do with the idea of leadership itself mutating with the bubbling up of women and the intransigence of a patriarchal order to give in. It is becoming increasingly muscular and male, qualities that are increasingly finding acceptance in a fractured world looking for direction. One that is dominated by a totalitarian control of egoistic fiefdoms and the toxic masculinity of helmsmanship. One that cannot deal with the crumbling of failing institutions and seeks solace in history, one that is lazy about finding one’s way in changed times and contexts and falls back on the protectorate of revisionism, one that chooses simplicity of binaries over the complexities of multiplicity. Simply because it is easier to follow than evolve, simply because the past is tested and the present is too risky to try out. As a “pretend democracy,” India is fast becoming an Orwellian nightmare, the State controlling every cellular aspect of national life. Be it through identity and privacy laws or through nationalism enforced with the sanctity of religion, there is a patriarchal aggression, sometimes violence, at play to keep order simply by denial of rights. That is why women are changing this paradigm by not staying within but choosing to move out and seizing the polarity that lies vacant, by embracing the oppositeness of gender as a strength, not a weakness. They also embody the contrarian discourse through their rather dramatic campaigns, the night vigils across India being a case in point.

Taking the global scenario into account, women-led movements are inclusive, non-violent, compassionate and have a 50 per cent chance of ensuring results than those led by others. They are cooptive, practical, welcoming of other subsidiary movements and can metabolise them into a larger force to spark a revolution. Women’s movements have managed to reset the agenda in Spain, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea, simply because they reflect the issues that matter to people at a structural, livelihood level rather than foisting imagined devils that hang in the air so thick and heavy, it gives you a brain fog. UN research has shown that where women are influencers rather than being a token presence, the peace processes and social stability are more lasting. And as the women of Shaheen Bagh have shown, their door-to-door access to homes has meant that they are best placed to generate a groundswell of support, irrespective of faith, propaganda or hired activism. A Sikh jatha cooked for the women of Shaheen Bagh in solidarity, simply because the community is convinced by their spontaneity and sense of justice. Theirs is an ethical integrity, one that can never be bought or intimidated. This subliminal hold as nurturers definitely lends women movements a decisive edge. And given their tenacity and discipline, women-led movements last longer and emerge as a social disruptor. Most importantly, they appeal to the youth, simply because by their resistance, they appeal to their sensibility of challenging status quo. If we pan all mass movements of 2019, we would find that women collectives, not leadership, have compelled course correction.

Narmada Bachao Andolan activist Medha Patkar had once said that women were swords, something she herself harnessed for her anti-dam agitations and ensured rehabilitation of evacuees and refugees. Visuals of women half-immersing themselves in water still form a picture of civil determination. Or remember Sundar Bahuguna’s Chipko movement, where village women encircled and hugged trees to save them from being felled by loggers and set an example for conservation much before Greta Thunberg did? This organised resistance did lead to a ban on tree-felling in Uttar Pradesh.

Women have spearheaded protests against the Kudankulam nuclear plant, where authorities wanted to set up a reactor for spent fuel, and have got a conversation going on safeguards against radioactivity for communities that live around it. And let us not forget the women survivors and descendants of the Bhopal gas tragedy, who despite getting their compensation, have not given up the campaign against exploitative practices of multinationals or the awareness drive on chemical contamination, ensuring that there is no repeat of a disaster that resulted from governmental sellouts. Women in India will no longer be content being unicorns with self-made success stories meant to be emulated and inspirational. They are going to have faith in their regular lives and take on societal irregularities by staying together.

1,20-1-20,"SP, Cong sponsoring anti-CAA protest in Lucknow: BJP","The Bharatiya Janata Party has accused the Samajwadi Party and the Congress of sponsoring the protest by Muslim women in the state capital against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

The BJP said the action taken by the Yogi Adityanath government against those who indulged in arson and rioting and damaged public property had unnerved the SP and the Congress as properties of their members were being forfeited.

The BJP charged that the riotous mobs were patronised by these two opposition parties in December.

On December 20, after Friday prayers, violent mobs in 35 districts had targeted the police and pelted stones and opened fire at the cops during protest against the CAA.

BJP state spokesman Chandramohan said the protest by the women in old city of Lucknow had been organised only to mount pressure on the state government to stop the action against the criminals behind the anti CAA violence in December.

He said that despite the inducements offered by the two opposition parties, very few Muslim women turned up for the protest at Hussainabad.

He said far from the common people, the family members of these women were also not supporting their protest.

The BJP leader said the people of the state had seen through the game of the two parties and they would not be misled by their political conspiracies.

Chandramohan alleged that the Congress and the SP had used Muslims as their vote bank and puppets and manipulate them for their own narrow political ends but had done nothing for the uplift of the community.

The BJP leader claimed that the Yogi Adityanath government on the other hand, had taken a series of measures for empowerment of the Muslim women, particularly those victims of triple talaq.

He said the victims of triple talaq had been provided the benefit of Prime Minister Awas Yojana, universal health insurance scheme and annual pension of Rs 6,000.

The BJP state spokesman said efforts of the UP government would continue for the empowerment and overall development of the Muslim community in the state.

According to the amended citizenship law, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 due to religious persecution there, will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sp--cong-sponsoring--anti-caa-protest--in-lucknow--bjp.html
2,20-1-20,BKU urges PM to meet farmers at mahapanchayat,"Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to meet farmers during their mahapanchayat in New Delhi on March 18.

The BKU has already submitted a 14-point charter of demands to the government. The demands include withdrawal of cases against farmers and more facilities to the agriculture sector.

The BKU took several decisions at the three-day ‘chintan’ camp held at the Magh Mela ground in Prayagraj that ended on Saturday.

BKU president Rakesh Tikait said here on Sunday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had not met farmers during his six-year tenure. He said it was high time for the prime minister to intervene for the resolution of pending issues of the agriculture sector.

Tikait said the farmers would not wait for indefinite period for the resolution of their grievances.

He warned that if the UP government failed to accept their demands, the farmers would be forced to stage demonstration in Lucknow along with their cattle and enter the state secretariat building.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bku-urges-pm-to--meet-farmers-at--mahapanchayat.html
3,20-1-20,Road Safety Week closing fest held 2 days late,"Delay in observance of the concluding ceremony of the 31st Road Safety Week by the Commerce and Transport Department has raised many questions on the efficacy of the State Government in creating awareness on road safety among people.

The Road Safety Week had been held from January 11 to 17 across the State. It was observed by Regional Transport Offices, traffic police, educational institutions, companies etc to create awareness on traffic rules and safe driving. The Commerce and Transport Department had also published an advertisement in newspapers informing people about the observance of the week from January 11 to 17. However, the department observed the concluding day of the week on January 19, two day after the scheduled date. The department has also published advertisements in newspapers in this regard.

According information, Transport Minister Padmanabha Behera had also not attended the inauguration ceremony held the Driving Testing Track at Chandrasekharpur here on January 11. He even didn’t attend events organised by some private organisations here despite giving consent to invitations.

The reason behind delay in holding the concluding event was known to be the absence of the Minister on January 17. He was away at New Delhi.

“If the inauguration of the Road Safety Week could be organised in the absence of the Minister, the concluding event could have been held on time by any other Minister. This shows the department’s seriousness in creating awareness of road safety and protecting people’s lives,” opined many.

In the Government-sponsored closing function on Sunday, Minister Behera, MLAs Anant Narayan Jena and Sushant Rout, Police Commissioner Sudhanshu Sekhar Sarangi, Railway Coordination Commissioner Manoj Kuamr Mishra and Transport Commissioner Sanjib Panda were present.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/road-safety-week-closing-fest-held-2-days-late.html

To encourage heart and liver transplants as per the need of treatment, Dr Ayan Kar, cardiologist consultant and Dr Sandip Pal, gastroenterology consultant from the Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) provided some details at a Press meet here on Sunday.

Speaking about the need of healthy organs and liver transplant, Dr Pal said chronic diseases resulting in liver failure and critical functioning of the organs, the transplant option should be opted in due time in order to reduce further risks involved in the process.

Talking about chronic heart diseases and heart transplant as an option, Dr Kar said that due to lack of awareness and availability of a desired system, a large number of patients are waiting for organs.

8,20-1-20,"Maximum city, again","Shops, malls and eateries will remain open 24X7 in Mumbai from January 26. Will this rebrand the city?

For some time, besieged by infrastructural breakdowns and carrying the weight of history, Mumbai had lost its swanky flavour and standing as the first among metros. Newer cities and the Tier II explosion meant that it was no longer considered a smart option. Besides, once considered a safe haven for women, the rising crime graph even punctured the indulgent soft spot it has had in urban consciousness. And ever since the Mumbai blasts of March 1993, the subsequent gangland killings and terror blasts meant that the nightlife the citizens so prided in was gone forever. Not to forget the monsoon deluge every season that has now pushed it to the edge of our consciousness as a forgettable urban nightmare. All that is set to change from January 26, when Mumbai turns 24X7 and literally becomes the city that never sleeps. Thanks to a seven-year-old proposal that got the green signal on January 16, restaurants, malls, multiplexes, shopping plazas and food courts will remain open round-the-clock. Though the restaurants will not be able to serve alcohol beyond 1.30 am due to security concerns, the move gels well with the Maximum City’s singular character that has mixed business and pleasure with effortless ease and made it an aspirant of the world city tag. A vibrant nightlife defines a city’s culture of acceptability and openness. A pet project of the young and aspirational Environment and Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray, who was the first to suggest it, the move will do much to boost tourism and employment in Maharashtra that’s battling an employment crisis with as many as 1.5 lakh job opportunities lost. That the Government is keen to boost tourism to offset the impact of the economic deceleration and put Mumbai on the global map became clear when it gave the green signal for setting up a Mumbai Eye on the lines of the London Eye. Mumbai will be the testing ground for this initiative — the notification for which was issued over a year ago by the erstwhile BJP-Sena Government but was shelved post the restaurant fire in Kamala Mills Compound — before it is eventually rolled out in other cities of the State to draw crowds and generate much-needed revenue. Politically, the young Thackeray also wants the “Mumbai nightlife” campaign to neutralise the Shiv Sena’s retrograde image as anti-youth and anti-West.

The idea is to open more business avenues and capitalise on existing resources in a city that does not have any scope for expansion and also to attract international businesses by fostering a hip metropolitan culture like that of New York, Las Vegas, Paris, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Bangkok and Cairo, cities which have seen a boost in their economies by capitalising on their unique distinction and culture. Nightlife has been a major revenue earner for these cities. The untapped potential is exposed by comparative figures for Mumbai and Bangkok — the former attracts five lakh tourists per year while the latter gets 15 million. As it is, Mumbai practically runs day and night with people commuting long distances to work and factories working in multiple shifts due to the availability of State transport buses at all hours and suburban trains running for over 20 hours. However, the success of this initiative hinges on security. One is yet to forget the street molestation on a New Year’s night some years ago. So keeping this in mind, only establishments falling within gated communities, non-residential zones with security, CCTVs, parking areas and so on can remain open round-the-clock. This move, which is being hailed as progressive by the traders and hospitality industry, is expected to boost employment by at least 25 per cent and open up nearly 50,000 jobs for security providers. Some of the major luxury malls, clearly at the receiving end of a sluggish economy and online business, are already on board to harness the potential of the Maximum City. Can this be the zing thing?",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/maximum-city--again-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/maximum-city--again.html
9,20-1-20,No surprises here,"Both the BJP and AAP candidate lists play safe with expected names and reward turncoats

With the gong being struck for a three-cornered electoral contest in Delhi, the two top contenders — the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — have had a tough task drawing up candidate lists as local polls mean that each face has to be popular and an effective vote-gatherer for each seat no matter what the party ideology or politics is. And the Delhi voter is known to be demanding when it comes to choosing representatives who serve his/her interests. Neither can AAP, which has the advantage built on its performance and delivery of promises, sit easy, nor can the BJP use the tried and tested formula of banking on the nationalist persona of Narendra Modi or identity politics to make up for warring State unit leaders. If we consider the winnability factor, then the BJP’s list looks lacklustre as it has sought to repeat most of its candidates, certainly not a determined push for wresting the Delhi durbar. For none of these faces have delivered in the 20 years that the party has been out of power in the State. Either the BJP has not learnt a lesson from its defeat in five States in the past 12 months because of its over-dependence on the Modi brand or it is giving up without a fight and a chief ministerial face. Maybe it feels its improved Lok Sabha vote share last year could be a jetpack for the State polls. At least it should have conveyed the optics for attempting a “generational change.” But it has sought to rely on old-timers, particularly those who had helped it sweep the 2017 civic polls. In about 57 of the 70 seats, candidates who have previously fought the Lok Sabha or the municipal polls, have been given tickets. Perhaps, the BJP in Delhi is hemmed in by the localised hold of these leaders and doesn’t want to risk dissent and sabotage. At the same time, it has rewarded AAP turncoat Kapil Mishra, going by its past practice of rehabilitating inductees of rivals. This transactional politics benefits nobody much and parties looking to make a difference should, therefore, not go by cliches.

AAP, too, has sought to retain 46 sitting members even though a few incumbent MLAs — including former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri’s grandson Adarsh Shastri — have been dropped. AAP has injected a dose of seriousness by bringing in Lok Sabha faces Atishi Marlena and Raghav Chandra. Marlena is known for her work in education reforms, having stridently worked for it while Chandra, one of the youngest to take the political plunge, is perceived as a sincere worker. Simultaneously, a few incumbents have been replaced with newcomers. It has fielded 23 new faces, counting on their freshness of appeal and sincerity of purpose. This could work for a party which has demonstrated change and needs to take forward a new message and image. Yet, AAP has not been immune to turncoats either, fielding Congress’ Ram Singh Netaji and Vinay Mishra. What is common to both the AAP and the BJP is the lack of gender diversity. While the former has named eight women candidates, the latter has nominated just five. In the end, the hard-earned trust of Delhiites will be the only decider.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-surprises-here-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/no-surprises-here.html
10,20-1-20,Decoding the future of jobs,"India is facing a unique challenge owing to new job opportunities, reduced employability due to archaic education, changes in the workplace and poor learning capabilities caused by malnutrition

Goal 8 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals looks at decent work and economic growth. One offshoot of this should be an improvement and sustained growth in the country’s state of jobs. But India is facing a unique challenge on this front, owing to a combination of evolving job opportunities across sectors, reduced employability due to the gaps between the education system and the dynamic changes in today’s workplace and deficient learning capabilities due to legacy nutrition challenges. Even though the NSSO data estimating India’s six per cent unemployment rate at a 45-year high was contested due to its narrow sample-size, the labour force participation rate and work participation rate (those in working-age looking for work and finding it, respectively) declined between 2012 and 2018, as per a paper by the Azim Premji University. The Grameen Foundation India’s (GFI’s) State of the Jobs in India report underscored the urgency to create jobs for over 15 million youth who are expected to enter the workforce each year. The question is which avenues can create net new jobs?

A more enduring challenge is the fact that our educated workforce often lacks the requisite employability skills to meet the emerging demands of today’s jobs, be it on knowledge, competencies, technologies, processes, critical thinking and analytical abilities. Our archaic education pedagogy is not making our youth employable. This is causing a mismatch between aspirations and abilities, between income and consumption and a delay in realising India’s demographic dividend. The need to push the right skill set and education to meet the evolving nature of jobs is perhaps even more imminent.

The investment in human capital for most of our population has been low from infancy which has caused legacy nutrition issues like stunting and undernutrition. Research suggests stunting and undernutrition impacts the brain’s development and thus abilities to learn new knowledge and skills which renders us unemployable. No quick-fix skill training can address this vexed issue.

The GFI recently brought together corporates, policymakers, researchers, think-tanks, innovators, skill-developers, financiers, NGOs and the youth to deliberate on the current situation, identify trends and opportunities and seek the best recourse as the way forward. One priority was to address the issues surrounding the major employers of the workforce, i.e. agriculture and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The discourse on these sectors often gets shadowed by the buzz surrounding start-ups and technology as the new engines of job growth; however, these two remain the mass employers.

With net income growth from farming moving south — a minuscule growth of 0.44 per cent per annum between 2011 and 2016 as per a NITI Aayog paper — coupled with chronic debt due to expensive chemical inputs and natural phenomena like varying rainfall, floods and droughts, it is no surprise that sectoral employment declined by 27 million between 2012 and 2018. This is manifesting in mass migration from rural regions, led by youth. While the Government’s efforts to bridge the knowledge-gaps of new farming methods and technologies with extension and technical training have been in the right direction, there is a need to devise a reverse-migration strategy to bring back the youth to the farms. This can be done by incentivising low-cost, sustainable farming, setting up rural-based industries, facilitating farmer producer organisations (FPOs), ramping up social collateral-based rural credit, introducing technologies to scale up crop productivity, reduce damage, facilitate storage and transport and encourage the agri-entrepreneur ecosystem. That would also help revive the Bharat consumption story, a selling point of India’s growth story that has hit headwinds.

The manufacturing sector, where MSMEs dominate in terms of people employed, saw employment decline by 3.5 million between 2012 and 2018. While this was led by a sluggishness in the construction sector, it is also worth noting that only about 50 million out of the 62-63 million MSMEs are said to be operational and most are struggling to scale up. The challenges include their inability to adopt new technologies, digitalisation and production processes and the failure to reinvent their competitiveness given the new sources of competition and trade-wars. A concerted mix of technology influx, policy support and funding measures is needed to build their long-term competitiveness and create better outcomes through sustained business and job growth. That presupposes their workforce is also made capable on skills to leverage the new technologies.

The debate on sustainability and climate change is turning loud following the increasing awareness of consumers and investors. Stakeholders are concerned how these risks impact businesses, economies, natural and social ecosystems, and that is driving a new category of jobs, i.e. green jobs. Most of these did not exist till some time back, ergo their existing workforce migrated from other roles. That implies a demand for upskilling to fill their knowledge gaps. New graduate courses dedicated to these avenues are also required.

Renewable energy, circular economy, waste recycling, water treatment, sanitation, green transport and so on are the avenues picking up speed. Social enterprises that seek broader social goals and not just shareholder returns, are another. While these are still in their infancy, they could be instrumental in creating much of the new jobs the country needs. Since these sectors still require partnerships between corporates, Governments and communities to establish scalable operating models, these linkages could create job opportunities even with other stakeholders.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution, led by breakthrough technologies, is changing the way we work. That means new types of jobs, replacement of erstwhile jobs and new skills. It is important to understand that technology is becoming a job-enabler across sectors and not just a job by itself. Thus, to grow in any sector or function, the workforce will need to build technology skills. This includes sectors which we rarely associate with technology, like agriculture and textiles. It is also important to understand that upskilling on technology is not only to save oneself from the discomfort of becoming redundant but to make one competent to leverage newer opportunities of business (and job) growth. We not only need more people to devise innovative technologies, we also need thinkers to devise how those innovations can help us redefine our target market, expand customer base and markets. That means building our critical thinking and analytical skills as well.

A growing awareness among working professionals to remain relevant and avoid layoffs is driving the demand for upskilling. Institutionalising upskilling programmes that are quick, low-cost and convenient for all would depend on the employers’ initiatives and the strength of public-private partnerships. A frequent method of upskilling are skill programmes by the employers themselves. This may need partnerships with state authorities to develop content or recognised certifications. The employers’ role enables relevance of the pedagogy. Such programmes could also be revenue-generating if they enrol outsiders. Certification courses could be developed separately by specialised skill providers as well, leaving employers free to focus on their core business.

This upskilling and critical thinking would also boost growth of startups as many ventures are still in the red despite several years in operations. The era of startups delivering me-too products without a distinct competitive advantage is ending. Critical thinking and innovations would be instrumental in making their business models competitive, generating operating cash flows and turning their books black.

Inclusiveness in the workforce by bringing in more women and specially- abled could help the job market incrementally, while driving economic gains. Almost half of India’s specially-abled are literate and in employable age, a potential workforce India could leverage with market-based vocational training and appropriate roles. Addressing the socio-cultural challenges that women face at homes, on the streets and at the workplace could help reduce the gender gap.

Several sectors hold promise to create new jobs, provided the necessary policies, technologies and funding converge in time. In the near-term, there is a need to drive relevant skilling and education content that must be monitored, measured and backed with appropriate apprenticeships, entrepreneur-incubation or job functions so that the migration from skilling to relevant jobs occurs. That presupposes measures to improve the nutritional status of our households, especially in the rural and peri-urban regions. One has to watch how India addresses all these requirements. Without these investments in human capital development, the going would only get tough.

11,20-1-20,Modi needs to make a decision,"The benefits of e-commerce far outweigh the negatives. But it is vital that the Government formulates a policy which benefits all the stakeholders, says Javvadi Rao

The tone and tenor of Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal’s remarks about Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was certainly scornful and will please the politically-important trader lobby, the core constituency of the BJP, ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections. The Amazon boss was in India last week but received a frosty reception, with the billionaire being ignored by top Government officials and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alike. In fact, Bezos’ most high-profile interactions were in Mumbai where he celebrated the success of Amazon’s video streaming service Amazon Prime with Bollywood’s elite and the honchos of several Indian conglomerates.

Meanwhile, not disheartened by the Government’s apathy, Bezos lauded India for its potential and even promised to invest $1 billion in the country in the days to come, by creating one million jobs over the same period. This is indeed a big positive for the country as well as to the Modi Government, coming as it is at a time when unemployment has rocketed to a four-decade high. Significantly, as Bezos concluded his three-day visit to India on Saturday, he announced that Amazon had partnered with thousands of kirana (grocery) stores across the country, which will now act as delivery points. This, incidentally was in response to a demand raised by Goyal in a meeting held in November 2019 with Amazon, where the Minister had emphasised on the need for propping up India’s kirana stores through partnerships with e-commerce marketplaces and platforms.

Meanwhile, Bezos’ statement, which gracefully steered clear of any reference to Goyal’s distasteful swipe, suggests he is fully aware of the Modi Government’s Achilles heel and not unfamiliar with the subtle art of shadow-boxing. Even the common man understands that the BJP is venting its anger on the CEO due to the critical stand taken by the Bezos-owned newspaper The Washington Post, on the scrapping of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) which has sparked spontaneous protests across India.

Just before his visit, the country’s anti-trust authority the Competition Commission of India (CCI) had hauled up Amazon for “unfair” trade practices, a move hailed breathlessly by the Swadeshi Jagran Manch and trader/retailer associations. Over the last five-and-a-half-years the BJP, under Modi and Amit Shah, is returning to its protectionist, anti-multinational corporation, technophobic notions, underlining that strong Governments can also be more risk-averse.

While Bezos’ e-commerce platform, Amazon.in, has grown several times over in India, the Government — neither the previous one nor the current dispensation — has still not made up its mind whether this industry is good for the country or not. In some way, such dithering helps e-commerce players who happily chug along unfettered, unregulated expanding their businesses, much to the joy of consumers. Such procrastination only helps a set of stakeholders and not everyone as can be seen from the recent action of the CCI which can’t seem to make up its mind whether it should go after e-commerce players, Flipkart and Amazon for their alleged “unfair trade practices” or wait till the Government formulates a complete policy on these companies. The fact that businesses can sell their wares at any price below the minimum retail price is a point they miss out completely.

The e-commerce world and start-ups work differently from any other businesses. Valuations of these entities are based on the number of footfalls and conversions into actual sales. For that to happen, entities like Flipkart and Amazon offer discounts higher than those offered by offline players. Once the valuations go up, investors, primarily venture capitalists and private equities exit at a higher price offering their stakes to other similar investors.

In case the CCI rules against such practices, Amazon and Flipkart would be mere online stores who would offer only the convenience of shopping sitting at home without trudging to the brick and mortar stores. What the regulators and the Government should realise is that e-commerce is a reality and that it is also one among the enterprises which offers jobs and at the same time helps a wide section of the people, who do not have access to capital to set up physical stores, to sell their goods through these online stores.

There are benefits which far outweigh the negatives, though it is equally important that the Government formulates a policy which benefits all the stakeholders in this space. For a long time now, the Government has been dragging its feet on coming out with a robust e-commerce policy, or even a policy on online tech platforms like a Swiggy or a Zomato or an Uber or an Ola. Most of the statements from the Government are like knee-jerk reactions to certain situations.

However, the crux of the matter is that consumers are largely happy with the speedy delivery that is ensured by these e-platforms and love the addictive discounts that the e-commerce giants offer. On top of that, the Government needs foreign investment to grow a slowing economy. The takeaway for the anti-trust authority is that they can’t put up new restrictions on Amazon and Flipkart based on the seven per cent of a $1.2 trillion retail market that has gone online. Major changes are afoot in the remaining 93 per cent of the industry that’s currently offline. Meanwhile consumers are waiting for the churn that comes after JioMart goes live. Bezos, too, will be waiting, that’s a certainty.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/modi-needs-to-make-a-decision.html
12,20-1-20,The thin red line in Pak-Iran relations,"Since 1981, Pakistan’s relations with Iran have remained tense in contrast to their earlier warm ties. Yet not once have the two come close to fighting a war

The assassination of the controversial Major General of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard, Qassem Soleimani, by the equally controversial Government of US President Donald Trump, has sent Pakistan into a spin. A Minister in Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Government announced that Pakistan would side with Saudi Arabia, the oil-rich kingdom that is a firm American ally and strongly opposed to Iran. However, the spokesperson of the Pakistan military’s Inter-Services Public Relations wing and then Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi were quick to announce that the country would remain neutral in case hostilities intensify between Iran and the US.

Pakistan was a frontline proxy State in the US and Saudi-funded “Islamist” insurgency against Soviet troops in Afghanistan in the 1980s. By the time Soviet troops left Afghanistan in the late 1980s, the fallout of that war greatly impacted Pakistan, deepening sectarian fissures in the country and aiding the mushrooming of religious militancy and extremism, that eventually mutated and turned anti-state. Indeed, this must be on the minds of the state and Government of Pakistan for them to declare their neutrality. But there is a lot more to Pakistan’s ambiguity in this context. And I use the word ambiguity because relations between Iran and Pakistan have largely remained abstruse, especially in the last 40 years or so. Rand Corporation’s 2014 study Iran’s Influence in Afghanistan describes the relationship between Pakistan and Iran as “a complex mix of cooperation and peer rivalry.” Iran is a Shia Muslim-majority country headed by a powerful Shia clergy, which came to power through a revolution in 1979. According to Andreas Rieck’s 2016 book The Shias of Pakistan: An Assertive and Beleaguered Minority, Pakistan has a significant Shia minority. Estimates from 2018 suggest 20 to 25 per cent of Pakistan’s population is Shia. And according to Jacquelyn Davis, in Anticipating a Nuclear Iran, many of the Pakistani Shia support Iran’s post-1979 political and ideological set-up.

Until the mid-1970s, Pakistan enjoyed a seamless relationship with Iran. In fact, Pakistan was closer to Iran than it was to Saudi Arabia. Iran, a modern pro-US monarchy, was one of the first countries to recognise Pakistan when it was formed in August 1947. Also, the Shah of Iran became the first major foreign head of state to visit Pakistan in 1950.

During the 1965 Pakistan-India war, when the US had suspended all military aid to both India and Pakistan, Iran sent nurses, medical supplies and 5,000 tonnes of petroleum to Pakistan. As an oil-rich country, Iran also threatened to impose an embargo on oil supplies to India. In the 2015 edition of the journal International Affairs and Global Strategy, M Saqib Khan writes that, to sidestep the US and European arms embargo imposed on India and Pakistan during the war, Iran bought 90 Sabre fighter jets from West Germany and sent them to Pakistan.

Iran saw Pakistan as a modern extension of Persian culture in South Asia because of the role this culture and language had played during Muslim rule in India between the 13th and 19th centuries. But since the Shah’s Iran was known as “America’s policeman in Asia”, it also tried to insulate Pakistan from the Left-leaning “Third-Worldism” — an idea first formulated by the charismatic Arab nationalist leader Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and the “socialist” Indian PM Jawaharlal Nehru. Iran made sure that Pakistan remained firmly in the American orbit during the Cold War.

The state of Pakistan admired Iran’s economic and social modernity and tried to emulate it. In his essay, Pakistan As A Factor in Indo-Iranian Relations, for the December 1974 issue of The Indian Journal of Political Science, LK Choudhary wrote that, during the 1971 Pakistan-India war, Iran again sidestepped an arms embargo on Pakistan and supplied it with military equipment. The Times of India quoted the Shah as saying, “Pakistan and Iran are like one soul in two bodies.”

In 1973, when a Baloch insurgency broke out in Balochistan, which shares a border with Iran, the Shah provided lethal American-made combat helicopters to Pakistan so that Baloch insurgents operating in the remote areas near the border could be eliminated. This way Iran also eliminated the threat of the insurgency spilling into Iran’s Baloch-majority areas. Relations between the two countries began to somewhat recede when the populist Government of ZA Bhutto in Pakistan attempted to formulate an international “Muslim bloc” in 1974. The planned bloc also included “enemies” of the Shah, especially “radical” Soviet-backed Arab regimes, such as Libya, Iraq, Syria, Algeria and the erstwhile South Yemen. Therefore, the Shah was the only major Muslim head of state to decline attending the 1974 Islamic Summit in Lahore, organised by the Bhutto Government.

In 1977, the Bhutto regime was toppled in a reactionary military coup by General Zia-ul-Haq. So when the Shah’s regime fell in 1979 and was replaced by a radical theocracy, Pakistan became the first country to recognise the new Government. But the refreshed relations between the two countries, on the basis of Islam, soon began to nosedive from 1981 onwards.

From the mid-1970s, Saudi Arabia, buoyed by increasing oil prices, had begun to aggressively expand its circle of influence with the power of the so-called “petrodollar.” It also started to outpace Iran in matters of providing economic aid to Pakistan, which came with the condition of adopting the Arab culture and faith as prescribed by Saudi Arabia.

Iran’s Shia theocracy began to be seen as a threat by the puritanical Saudi political and religious establishment — especially when Iran initiated the rather unabashed export of its version of anti-Saudi and anti-US “political Islam” to other Muslim countries.

In the 1980s, Pakistan accepted hefty financial and military aid from the US and Saudi Arabia during the anti-Soviet insurgency in Afghanistan. This money was also used to form radical Sunni indoctrination outlets and militant outfits to supplement Afghan militant groups. But many such outfits eventually turned anti-Shia and thus anti-Iran. This saw Iran bankroll militant Shia groups within Pakistan. The result was deadly violence, clashes and riots between Saudi and Iranian proxies in Pakistan.

Even though Pakistan declared neutrality during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, the Zia regime increasingly galvanised Pakistan towards the Saudi and American orbit. Pakistan sent 40,000 soldiers to Saudi Arabia in case the conflict spread to the kingdom. A cultural consequence of this was the “Saudization” of Pakistan and the steady erosion of Persian culture; after the 1979 revolution in Iran, it began being seen as “Shia culture.”

Ever since 1981, Pakistan’s relations with Iran have remained tense and enigmatic. Iran has often accused Pakistan of backing radical anti-Iran Sunni groups operating near the Pak-Iran border, and Pakistan has expressed concern that anti-Pakistan groups backed by India have been allowed by Iran to operate near the same border. Yet, not once have the two countries come close to fighting a war against each other. Soleimani was understood by Islamabad as being an ‘anti-Pakistan hawk.’ Pakistan, having frenzied borders with India and Afghanistan, and only recently managing to vanquish the extreme consequences of its participation in the anti-Soviet Afghan insurgency, has wisely decided to declare neutrality in the US-Iran conflict. More so, it has downplayed the fact that Soleimani was no hero to Pakistan.

13,20-1-20,India’s first anti-aging international conference talks of benefits of preventive health.,"In order to create awareness about healthy life style, India’s first anti-aging International conference was organized in the National Capital which was attended by more than 300 doctors and featured the most cutting edge and futurists innovations in healthcare.

Preeti Malhotra, president of organising committee said that medicine has taken an exponential leap this century. Preventive health has had a profound effect on human longevity, awareness and mental wellbeing of the people.

“I wish more people discover the benefits of preventive health, and can lead happy and healthy lives. This technique has gained attention for its incredible effects on both weight loss and on diseases. Since weight loss is a long journey for some, it is seen quite often that people who opt for healthy lifestyle be it by changing their diet or incorporating exercises in their day to day life, people tend to continue the healthy practice and hence we have seen people continuing the practice.” said Dr M (BK Modi) founder and Chairman of Smart Group.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/india---s-first-anti-aging-international-conference-talks-of-benefits-of-preventive-health-.html
14,20-1-20,"CAA not against any Indian citizen: Yogi ‘Congress, SP spreading lies’","Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, spearheading the campaign in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, asserted that it has been the ancient tradition of India to give shelter to the persecuted people, and at the same time, it is our responsibility to explain to the people that the CAA is a law to grant citizenship not to divest it.

“It (CAA) is not a law against any citizen of India. It is against those intruders who are responsible for terrorism, extremism and separatism. The Congress and the Samajwadi Party are behind the vicious propaganda against the CAA and are hurting the interests of the country,” Yogi Adityanath said while addressing a rally at Gorakhpur on Sunday.

“The anti-CAA campaign is being run by vested interests by keeping women in the forefront. We cannot remain mute spectator to this kind of situation. It is our constitutional obligation to reach out to people to explain them the reality of the CAA,” the chief minister said.

“The citizenship law was made during the tenure of India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.

Now the Congress finds it inconvenient to own that law,” the chief minister said.

Lashing out at the Congress and the SP, Yogi Adityanath said the conduct of these two parties was “condemnable and irresponsible”. He said both these parties had financed troublemakers for opposing the CAA.

The chief minister addressed the rally in support of CAA at MP Inter College Grounds in Gorakhpur on Sunday as part of the awareness campaign launched by the ruling party to make people aware of the new citizenship law and clear their doubts.

He said that after Independence, the Left parties in the country had misled the people and now Congress, SP and other opposition parties were following in their footsteps.

“The way the people of the country understood the lies of the Left and buried them forever, on the same lines, these parties are also waiting to be buried into political oblivion,” he said.

Yogi Adityanath said the citizenship law gave the Congress an opportunity to repent for its sin, but it missed the opportunity.

“We all should write a postcard in support of this law and greet Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said.

The chief minister said that India was emerging as a major global power and the international community had recognised the growing stature of the country. He charged that political forces unhappy with the growing stature of India were running a malicious campaign to malign the country and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“Tension is on the rise between Iran and America and the international community wants mediation by India to ease the situation. The Congress is unwilling to accept this new India and is conspiring to incite violence by sponsoring violent agitations,” Yogi Adityanath charged.

The chief minister said that Prime Minister Modi was fulfilling the promise of providing potable water to the houses of every poor by 2024. “Article 370 was fraudulently implemented by the Congress in Kashmir, and the demand for its abrogation was being raised since 1952. No government dared to repeal this Article but Prime Minister Modi showed the courage and abrogated it,” he said.

The chief minister said that had Article 370 not been in the Constitution, no one would have dared to oust Kashmiri Pandits from Kashmir. “Now the people of the country say that the day the government gives orders, the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir will be a part of India. If the Indian government has given shelter to the oppressed people, the Congress should have welcomed this step,” he said.

Yogi Adityanath said that for the last 500 years, every Hindu wanted a temple of Lord Ram to be built in Ayodhya. “First the Mughals, then the British continued to keep this issue unresolved. The Congress followed in the footsteps of the invaders .The Supreme Court gave its historic verdict and finally resolved the Ayodhya issue. People used to say that if the decision came there would be blood bath, but not even a mosquito was killed,” he said.

Earlier, addressing the gathering, BJP state president Swatantra Dev Singh said that politics was a mission and not a business.

“Workers entrusted with responsibilities in the party should take care of the lower rung workers,” he said.

Singh said that during their 10-year tenure, the Congress got Shankaracharya arrested, denied the existence of Ram Setu and Lord Ram and maligned Hindus by coining the term saffron terrorism.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/caa-not-against-any--indian-citizen--yogi-----congress--sp-spreading-lies---.html

16,20-1-20,Hear voices of Himalayan youth,"Uttarakhand recently celebrated its Youth Leaders’ Conclave with a lot of fanfare. Though, it was Swami Vivekananda’s vision that was sought to be celebrated at the conclave, the event ended up being another political jamboree, mismanaged and sans any vision for the mountain state and its youth. Many young people who did attend the conclave, came out disillusioned, saying that the event had nothing to offer except propaganda. This is a predictable pattern in a state that is staring at the twin specters of economic and ecological disaster, where dams continue to ruin our rivers and roads tear through the very fabric of our venerated pilgrimage sites. What is even more surprising about such events is that in their haste to please the powers that be, our authorities fail to even acknowledge young leaders that have recently brought glory to the state.

Since the conclave was organised in honour of Swami Vivekananda, let me begin by saying that his message of karma combined with the zeal to protect all that is spiritual, needs to be deeply imbibed. He advised us to, “…act on the educated young men, bring them together, and organise them. Great things can be done by great sacrifices only. No selfishness, no name, no fame, yours or mine, nor my master's even! Work, work the idea, the plan, my brave, noble, good souls - to the wheel, to the wheel put your shoulders!”

But how will our youth put their shoulders to the wheel, when they are made to worship false gods? Today, the need of the hour is to celebrate role models who have shown us the path out of the quagmire of migration that our mountains seem to be afflicted with. Uttarakhand faces a crisis of not only losing its jal, jangal, jamin (water resources, forest wealth and land), but also its jawani (youth). In an atmosphere of gloom, few young people have not only created employment opportunities for themselves and their peers, but they have also helped preserve the ecological balance of the communities they work with. Let me introduce you to two young men, Arun Gour from Devalsari and Taukeer Alam from Laldhang, who have emerged as the leaders we should have actually been celebrating.

Arun Gour is a livelihoods creator, mountain protector, community tourism advocate and traditional bee-keeping trainer. He is a messiah of sustainable eco-tourism in the Himalayan villages of Devalsari, Bangseel and Untadh. Founding the Devalsari Ecotourism and Research Centre, he nurtured a culture of conservation in his community. The eco-tourism model he created benefits both people and the forest and is a living example of the solutions needed for a secure tomorrow. By training his community in beekeeping, conducting nature and heritage trails, bird-watching, butterfly walks, homestays, and of course, the sale of honey, he has provided purpose and income to several pahadi families. His work to protect the Indian honeybee, Apisceranaindica, has helped protect the forests of his community. His support to the Forest Department in combating forest fires, reporting poaching incidents, and more, has built a strong bond between the Forest Department and his community. With his combination of innovation and ethics, Arun is creating livelihoods while protecting a breathtaking slice of the Western Himalaya.

As a child of the nomadic Van Gujjar community, Taukeer Alam grew up in the lap of nature, around the Rajaji National Park, Uttarakhand. His profound interest in wildlife saw him dropping out of school to work as an apprentice-cook with a group of researchers from the Centre for Ecological Sciences. His passion, curiosity and innate understanding of the forest led researchers from the Nature Science Initiative to take him under their wing. Soon, he became an expert naturalist, indispensable to his scientist mentors. One of Uttarakhand's top e-birders on an online global database of bird observations, he can remarkably identify virtually every Indian bird! His love for the wild has inspired the youth of his community to learn from him, to protect the forests he cherishes so dearly. He is actively working with schools in the Laldhang area and nurturing young wilderness experts. He is a generation-next green warrior, the kind that gives us hope for the future.

While Arun Gour recently won the prestigious Sanctuary Asia Wildlife Service Award, Taukeer Alam was the proud recipient of the Sanctuary Asia’s Young Naturalist Award. Both these young people are role models for not just the state but the entire country. They are the true sons of the soil that need to be projected as role models. However, their achievement has gone largely unnoticed in their home state.

We need many more such good Samaritans working for our environment while also combating migration. We need more Aruns and Taukeers, walking the jungles of Uttarakhand, protecting the fragile economy of the state while also generating livelihoods for its peoples.

17,20-1-20,Man-eater leopard shot dead in Haridwar,"A leopard believed to be responsible for killing at least two people, injuring one and digging up graves to scavenge on the human remains in Haridwar region was shot dead by authorised hunters on the weekend. The authorised hunters Dr Prashant Singh and Zahid Bakshi shot the leopard at about 8 PM on Saturday.

It is pertinent to mention here that two persons had been killed and partially eaten by a leopard while a third person was seriously injured in a leopard attack. The leopard also dug up graves near BHEL in Haridwar and reportedly dug out a child’s corpse.

After this, the Haridwar divisional forest officer had written to the chief wildlife warden asking that the big cat be declared a man-eater. After the leopard was declared a man-eater, authorised hunters arrived in the area on the weekend.

Doctor Prashant Singh, who is a dentist by profession in Dehradun, said that he had shot the leopard along with his partner Zahid and his team.

They began tracking the leopard on Saturday morning and managed to shoot it by 8 PM on the same day. Identifying and tracking the big cat with its pug marks, they shot the leopard in the night. It was a male leopard aged about eight years.

Talking to this correspondent, Dr Singh said that the leopard had become fearless. “He saw us with cars and weapons but didn’t stop. Instead, he continued moving towards us, which only shows that he had lost fear of humans after preying on them.”

The Haridwar DFO Akash Verma said that the leopard killed on the weekend was responsible for killing two and injuring one person. The leopard had been identified earlier by the team after which the operation was carried out to eliminate him. It had also started to rain on Saturday evening, after which it seemed that the operation would have to be abandoned. However, the authorised hunter managed to track and shoot the big cat dead.

It will be recalled that this leopard was synonymous with terror in the BHEL and its surrounding areas. His movement in the residential area was cause of major concern for the locals and department officials.

However, observers point out that though the locals and officials may breathe a sigh of relief for now, the problem of human-wildlife conflict is very much alive. Factors like habitat fragmentation, increasing human pressure and leopards being pushed out from Rajaji national park by other big cats will continue to move around in the residential areas.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/man-eater-leopard-shot-dead-in-haridwar.html
18,20-1-20,MCD: Garbage to be cleaned within five hours of complaint,"While the Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) is focusing on optimising the level of sanitation in the city in view of the ongoing Swachh Survekshan 2020, garbage in the open and litter is still a common sight in various parts of the city.

According to deputy municipal commissioner Rohitash Sharma, “Approximately 400 banners have been placed in different parts of the city to spread awareness about sanitation among people.

Sanitation workers are working day and night for the city’s cleanliness and if still, somebody finds garbage lying around in the city or has any kind of complaints concerning the sanitation; they can click the photo of the site and upload in our app or call our helpline number, and within five hours the area will be cleaned.”

He further added that the garbage accumulated on private lands is also getting clean by MCD across the city.

It is pertinent to mention here that in view of the Swacch Survekshan 2020, MCD is making all possible efforts to improve the ranking of Dehradun.

Last year, the city was not able to secure a rank even in the first 100 clean cities in the country.

Therefore, the mayor Sunil Uniyal ‘Gama’ and municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey have also appealed everyone to contribute to this survey by giving feedback on Swachhata app to uplift the ranking of the city as the positive feedback from the citizens helps in the alleviation of the ranking.

The mayor has also requested the councillors in the last meeting to motivate people in their respective areas to give feedback on Swachhata app.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mcd--garbage-to-be-cleaned-within-five-hours-of-complaint.html
19,20-1-20,ONGC & PCRA hold Saksham Cyclothon,"The ONGC and PCRA Dehradun organised Saksham Cyclothon from ONGC Kendriya Vidyalay Sports Ground here on Sunday.

The Dehradun mayor Sunil Uniyal ‘Gama’ along with the Indian Military Academy (IMA) deputy commandant Major General GS Rawat flagged off the cyclists in the presence of ONGC corporate communications head and executive director Preeta Pant Vyas.

According to the event organisers, the chilling winter winds at 6:30 AM on a cold January Sunday could not deter the enthusiasm of more than 1,000 cyclist including 50 IMA cadets, members of ONGC Cycling Association, Maitri Group, students from various schools and families of ONGCians.

Addressing the gathering on the occasion, the Dehradun mayor appreciated the joint effort of ONGC and PCRA for organising the Saksham Cyclothon with a large number of participants. Further, he motivated all the participants to cycle more to keep oneself fit and at the same time conserve environment and fuel. He said that today the cycle is also a symbol of status and health whereas once it was the poor man’s need.

The IMA deputy commandant major general GS Rawat thanked ONGC and PCRA for organising the Saksham Cyclothon. He highlighted that cycling is a good means to stay healthy and also avoid traffic congestion on road while also keeping the environment clean.

Earlier, executive director Preeta Pant Vyas welcomed the chief guest, guest of honour and all the participants.

Deputy Director, State Co-ordinator of PCRA Neeraj Gupta and other officials were also present on the occasion. The cyclothon which commenced from ONGC Kendriya Vidyalaya passed through Chakrata Road, Bindal Bridge, Clock Tower, Rajpur Road, Dilaram Chowk, GarhiCantt and KDMIPE Chowk covering an approximate 12 kilometre route before concluding at the ONGC Kendriya Vidyalaya sports complex.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ongc---pcra-hold-saksham-cyclothon.html

However, when asked by this correspondent about the notice, Dhyani said that she had not yet received any such letter form the party till Sunday evening.

It is worth mentioning that an altercation took place between the two councillors in which Sumitra Dhyani allegedly slapped Komal Bohra when she was just trying to offer her a seat. Though Dhyani had denied all the allegations in the past saying nothing serious happened, Komal Bohra was enraged and wanted justice for the embarrassment she had to face in board meeting.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/congress-seeks-explanation-from-councillor-dhyani-for-violence.html

“The festival’s opening will coincide with the foundation day celebration of AJIT that was launched 20 years ago by several students of eminent film and theatre actor and director Ajit Das. The students, who studied theatre under Das at the Utkal Sangeet Mahavidyalaya decided to celebrate his birthday in a unique way and, thus, AJIT was born on his birthday,” said festival director Maya Das, wife of Ajit Das, who is also a noted scholar on theatre arts.

“Tata Niranjana”, the immensely popular play penned by famed playwright Bijay Mishra and directed by Ajit Das would be staged by host AJIT as the opening presentation of the festival. The play, a poignant portrayal of Buddha’s life and final realisation of life, has been a milestone in the journey of Odia theatre, maintained Maya Das.

“Sons of Mother Earth”, the play slated for Tuesday evening, is in Rabha language. It would be presented by Badungduppa Kalakendra from Gopalpara district of Assam. Rabha is an indigenous community that is spread over India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal and Thailand and its culture is distinct and distinguished as well. Sukracharya Rabha, the playwright and director of the play besides being the founder of the Kalakendra, has earned much reputation with production of 20 plays in Rabha language during the past 20 years.

“Sons of Mother Earth” draws characters from mythology and brilliantly puts it in contemporary context to sensitise the audience about the endangered nature and environment.

The third and final evening of the festival would feature Hindi play “Swapnalok” by young and acclaimed director Nitesh Dubey of Bhopal-based Karmayogi Creative Group. Nitesh, who started his theatre group as a teenager 12 years ago, has already acted in more than 100 plays and has stepped into direction with much promise.

29,20-1-20,Residents’ associations can play meaningful role,"City planning is a highly complex process that tries to focus the necessities of life. This calls for the widest kind of participation among the stakeholders.

Cities have a wealth of talent and experience. Given the complexity of city life, participatory planning immediately enriches the process and quality of plans.

There is a need to define the roles of different community stakeholders along with Governmental functionaries and work out coordination plans leading to the preparation of a community-based strategic plan. For the training of trainers programme, the urban local bodies can plan, monitor, and evaluate area based developmental work for each ward and organize training for Residents’ Welfare Associations (RWAs). An expert committee should be constituted at municipality level to assist and guide the RWA members.

Training programme for the RWAs must take into account the local area based cultural, local, linguistic and social factors. By this way, they will enable them to understand their rights and responsibilities. Inter-district exchange visits of the RWAs must become a regular feature of the capacity building exercises.

An all Odisha annual conference of the selected RWAs can be organized. This will lend a sense of institutional solidarity and enhance the motivation of the RWAs to articulate their problems to the public, the media and the political leadership.

Each local authority can enter into a dialogue with its citizens, local organisations and private bodies through a consultative process. Only then, city planning can be fruitful. The opening of civic body meetings to public is a further avenue of ensuring transparency in planning and execution in cities It starts with creating a concept of a local community which combines the municipal ward/district into a cohesive unit of basis local Government. The immediate needs of the residents have to be focused.

RWAs can do the works like water harvesting, keeping a watch on consumption and supply of electricity, solid waste management, sanitation, community policing, women safety, citizen safety, civic issues, education, sports, youth affairs and above all promote development of local area.

It is always encouraging to find a synergy between urban civil society and non-Governmental organizations. Non-Governmental organizations can also play a healthy role in cities to raise the voices and demands of the less privileged. The deprived communities are low in self-confidence and motivation and require a stimulus of external participation.

In Odisha, RWAs should participate fruitfully in resolving civic issues because these associations are crucial in day -to -day delivery in civic amenities. It’s the RWAs which look after crucial civic duties and local law and order issues of the residents. Therefore, the Government of Odisha should give them legal rights on line of village gram sabhas so that they can function effectively with requisite authority.

The 73rd Constitution amendment gives gram sabhas and panchayats legal sanctions. Similar provisions are there for local bodies in urban areas in the 74th constitution amendment. It is important they are included and consulted with in all matters pertaining to civic amenities and new policies by the administration affecting residents.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/residents----associations-can-play-meaningful-role.html

37,20-1-20,State to boost fish output through cage culture,"The Odisha Government is mulling to open up major reservoirs for cage culture by the eligible investors for fish production.

For this, the Government of Odisha is finalising the cage culture guidelines by March 2020.

Odisha has huge potential for fish production through cage culture from freshwater reservoirs. There are 138 reservoirs with about 2 lakh hectares of water spread area in Odisha.

Promotion of cage culture by the State with proper guidelines can quickly ramp up the fish production in a sustainable manner and help in achieving self-sufficiency in domestic fish demand.

A high-level delegation led by Agriculture Production Commissioner Pradipta Kumar Mohapatra has recently made an exposure visit to reservoir cage culture sites in Pune, Maharashtra.

Secretary, Fisheries and ARD Raghu Prasad, Director of Fisheries N Thirumala Naik, president, FISHFED, Odisha T Prasad Rao Dora and Additional Director of Fisheries Umesh Kumar Mohanty were in the delegation.

WorldFish had organised the exposure visit under the existing technical collaboration with the Government of Odisha.

The delegation interacted with officials of Maharashtra State Commissionerate of Fisheries, visited cage culture unit of a major private sector player, Vaidika Group in Kasarsai Dam in Pune and the cage net manufacturing factory of Garware Wall Ropes Ltd., which is a major global producer of fish cages, at Wai Industrial Area, Pune.

In 2016, the National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB), Ministry of Fisheries and Animal Husbandry, Government of India, had brought out guidelines for cage culture in inland open water bodies in India.

Accordingly, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana have speedily promoted cage culture in their respective States with Centrally sponsored Blue Revolution and RKVY schemes.

So far about 10,000 cages have been installed in reservoirs across India. Pangasius and GIFT Tilapia are major species grown in these cages. Also, marine cages are installed in places such as Rameshwaram, Tamil Nadu and Karwar in Karnataka and fishes such as Bhetki (Seabass), Red Snapper and Cobia are farmed in these marine cages.

Odisha started promoting cage culture in reservoirs since 2015 under the Centrally sponsored Blue Revolution and RKVY schemes and also under State plan scheme. However, so far, only 320 rectangular cages have been installed in 13 reservoirs across the State. Most of them have been handed over to the Primary Fishermen Cooperative Societies (PFCS) and a few of them have been leased out to private entrepreneurs. All of them are farming Pangasius fish (Jalanga), which has limited market potential in Odisha.

At present, about 50,000 metric ton of major carps such as Rohu and Catla are imported from neighbouring States, mainly from Andhra Pradesh. Therefore, Odisha targets to achieve self-sufficiency in fish production on war footing basis.

To grow Indian major carps (Catla and Rohu), there is a need for large circular cages. In this direction, Fisheries and ARD Department has already installed two large circular cages (Norwegian design) in Hirakud reservoir and the carp production by local PFCS is under progress on pilot basis.

At its full potential, Odisha can instal a minimum of 40,000 rectangular cages or 4,000 circular cages and produce a minimum 1.25 lakh metric tons of fish from its 8 medium and major reservoirs.

In order to boost the fish production through cage culture, the Government of Odisha has drafted guidelines for taking up cage culture in reservoirs by PFCS, private entrepreneurs and private companies.

Stakeholder consultation is under progress, especially by involving PFCS, local elected representatives and concerned Government departments for their suggestions and inputs to finalise the draft guideline.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-to-boost-fish-output-through-cage-culture.html

It is a failure that reflects deteriorating law-and-order situation and chaos.

Daily new crime chapters are being added in the state that sometimes raises the question whether a state government and home minister exist in the state, he said.

He said the statement reflects inefficiency on the part of the state government to control the crime.

He said if home minister acknowledges that he is not able to protect any citizen of the state then he does not have any moral rights to continue in the post.

The BJP leader further condemned that on daily basis the state government and their ministers are giving irresponsible statements. Instead of making such comments, the chief minister and home minister should concentrate on their work, Kaushik demanded.

The BJP leader said if the ministers are unable to tackle the situations in the state, then it should read what is written on the wall, that such situation would not continue for long.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-citing-failure-as-success-is-unfortunate--kaushik.html

44,20-1-20,2nd edition of ‘Circle’ launched to understand innovations in architecture,"Indian Institute of Architects (IIA) Bhopal Centre launched the second chapter of ‘Circle’ on Saturday at Hotel Cotyard by Marriott.

Under the series of “Circle”, this time the famous Architect Nuru Karim from West Zone was present in the programme. At the beginning of the program, IIA Bhopal Chapter Chairman Vinay Shrivastava gave detailed information about the activities related to Bhopal circle. SPA’s Professor Sandeep Sankat was felicitated for a research based book on universal design.

In this sequence, presentations were given on Rathi Sons, Deconic PVC Window. A large number of members of IIA Bhopal Center, including architect Akshay Selukar, attended the programme.

The main aim of the program was to understand contemporary and sustainable techniques, restrictions and solutions of designing space based on various local parameters worldwide.

Approach, discussion on challenges: During the event, while sharing his experiences, Architect Nuru Karim described about the impact on architect approach, project handle, challenges, and architecture impact on society through photos and presentations. Nuru Karim said that India’s climate is different. Coastal cities are being set up here. Not only this, the major focus is being made on building energy efficient buildings along with working on western modern concept. Referring to Holland country as an example, he said that Holland is a very small country.

The best thing is that the people there do not drive a four wheeler. Mostly people commute by bicycle because such an architect has been designed that walking on the road develops energy for commuters. Apart from this,

Nuru Karim said the usage of local materials in construction has been increased these days. He said that we have a temperature of 45 degrees most of the time during summer. Thus, there is more focus on use of local materials. There is just a need for awareness, to increase knowledge in this regard as development is necessary at the time of globalisation.

The greatest responsibility of an architect is that whenever he is designing a structure, he must take care of his social responsibility, so that the designed structure must be in use to all people.

On this occasion, IIA Bhopal Center Chairman Vinay Shrivastava said that the objective of this circle programme is to introduce the youth to innovation and new thought process in the field of architecture.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/2nd-edition-of----circle----launched-to-understand-innovations-in-architecture.html

48,20-1-20,CS chairs emergency meeting on power failure,"Following directives of Chief Minister Hemant Soren, Chief Secretary DK Tiwari on Sunday called for an emergency meeting with officials of Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited (JBVNL) and asked them to ensure uninterrupted power supply in Ranchi Monday onwards.

The meeting comes as an aftermath of a long period of frequent power failures and load-shedding reported from cities and towns across the State. “Ensure uninterrupted power supply from Monday. And stop all maintenance works that lead to long hours of power cut,” Tiwari told electricity officials.

The Chief Secretary also asked officials to ensure that no maintenance work is done after 4pm as power failures after sunset causes more inconvenience. “You all should keep an eye on the situation of electricity supply across the State and take immediate steps to address any glitch in the process,” said Tiwari.

Electricity Department’s Additional Chief Secretary L Khyangte and Managing Director of JBVNL Rahul Purwar attended the meeting along with other officials of electricity department.

Power failure has affected many areas of the State capital, including the VIP localities such as Kanke Road, in the past few days. However, the JBVNL had earlier denied any major lapses in the supply system, claiming that the power supply was obstructed only last Tuesday due to maintenance in Hatia Grid 2.

However, there was a striking contrast between the JBVNL’s take on power supply situation and the reactions of Ranchi-ites. “There was no electricity supply for several hours last weekend. Our area suffered from a power failure from around 9am till 2pm,” said Rekha Tripathi, a resident of Jawaharnagar in Ranchi.

Poor electricity supply also haunted residents of Upper Bazaar – the commercial hub of Ranchi – in the past one week or so. Many residents and shopkeepers in the area had to rely on generators and invertors as hours of power crisis, mostly during the day, disrupted life.

Other busy residential areas such as Ratu Road, Morhabadi, Harmu and Ashok Nagar also faced major power crisis on Tuesday, residents said. Usually, power failures hit the city during summers due to the additional burden of air conditioners. The untimely and unexpected power crisis during winter has become a cause for concern among residents here.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cs-chairs-emergency-meeting-on-power-failure.html
49,20-1-20,JVM’s notice to Tirkey for supporting Cong candidate,"Jharkhand Vikas Morcha-Prajatantrik (JVM-P) president Babulal Marandi has started preparing ground for merger of his party with BJP. JVM-P, after not assigning any important posts to two senior party leaders and legislators Pradeep Yadav and Bandhu Tirkey in the recently constituted party working committee, has decided to take action against Tirkey for his alleged anti-party activities.

JVM-P chief general secretary Abhay Singh has issued a show-cause notice to Tirkey for supporting Congress candidate from Hatia, Ajay Nath Shahdeo against party’s authorized candidate Shobha Yadav in the Assembly elections.

In the light to the written complaint made by Shobha Yadav to Marandi against Tirkey, Abhay Singh has asked Tirkey to reply to the show-cause notice issued to him within 48 hour.

The letter said that on December 8, a public meeting was organized on behalf of the party in Agdu village of Ratu block. Party leader Bandhu Tirkey was to attend the meet, but he failed to attend the event as he was busy campaigning for Congress candidate. Sobha Yadav in her letter alleged that she was projected as outsider against local Shahdeo by Tirkey and his supporters.

The JVM-P leader claimed that Bandhu Tirkey had held meeting on December 11 at Madhukam in support of Shahdeo. Similarly, a day before (December 10) Bandhu had called 200 workers at his residence in Banhora who were instructed to vote for Shahdeo, as claimed by Yadav.

Meanwhile, Bandhu Tirkey said, “I have received show cause notice from party. I will reply it at appropriate time. Whatever decision the party president Babulal Marandi takes, is paramount. I have done nothing party's principle.”

On Friday Marandi constituted new working committee leaving two other elected MLAs (Pradeep Yadav and Bandhu Tirkey) without any important posts. Both Yadav and Tirkey found place in 151 member working committee, but they have been not assigned any important post such as vice presidents, principal general secretary or general secretaries. Party insiders claim that sooner or later JVM’s merger with BJP is inevitable.

A senior JVM leader on condition of anonymity said, “JVM merger with BJP is certain. The delay is mainly due to process and formalities, which has to be taken ahead of merger.

As Marandi is not single person who has join BJP but entire party is to be merged a lot of process is to be taken ahead of merger.” Sources said that it is win-win situation both for Marandi and BJP if both parties decide to join hands.

Sources said that in 2000 Marandi became first Chief Minister of State scaling new height, however in 2003 when he was asked to step down from his post due to implementation of Domicile policy his political career started doing down. In 2006, Marandi formed his own party and since then he has been trying to find a base in the State. In 2009, his party won eleven Assembly seats, which were reduced to eight in 2014. In 2019, his party managed to win only three seats.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jvm---s-notice-to-tirkey-for-supporting-cong-candidate.html
50,20-1-20,BJP attacks Soren for frequenting Delhi,"State BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo on Sunday attacked Chief Minister Hemant Soren for visiting Delhi regularly. Shahdeo said that Soren in his 22 day tenure had spent nine days in the national capital visiting ‘Delhi Darbar’ five times.

Shahdeo said, “Chief Minister Hemant Soren used to say that this is the Government of Jharkhand and will run from Ranchi. But contrary to his sayings he had spent nine days in Delhi.” Shahdeo said Chief Minister on Sunday left for Delhi where he will receive Champion of Change Award 2019’ by former President of India Pranab Mukhrjee, but that is just an hour program. The rest of his time will be spent in the Delhi Darbar of Congress, added Shahdeo.

Chief Minister Hemant Soren will be awarded for doing excellent work as a public representative in Dumka and Barhait Assembly constituencies.

Pratul said that Congress has just shown the trailer of JMM Government. Congress will show complete picture to Jharkhand Mukti Morcha in next five years. “The politics of pressure for getting creamy portfolios has been an old habit of the Congress. In Jharkhand too Congress is repeating this history,” added Shahdeo. Shahdeo said that there is an atmosphere of fear in the entire state and the legal system has gone awry. But due to the blackmailing of the Congress, the entire focus of the government has shifted to Delhi. Shahdeo said, “Chief Minister has been summoned to Delhi five times only to decide the departments. It can be easily estimated how many times he will have to attend the Delhi Darbar during his tenure.”

Speculations are rife that Soren will also meet senior Congress party leaders during his New Delhi and discuss about the expansion of his Cabinet.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-attacks-soren-for-frequenting-delhi.html

61,20-1-20,Swamy considering PIL against Devsthanam Act,"Rajya Sabha MP and senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy is considering the option of filing a Public Interest Litigation challenging the Char Dham Devsthanam Management Act which was recently accorded approval by the Governor Baby Rani Maurya. Though the State Government has been repeatedly stating that this Act will not affect the traditional rights and position of the priests and various other stakeholders, many in the religious fraternity are still not convinced and continue to oppose this Act.

Recently, a delegation of Teerth Purohits and traditional stakeholders in the Char Dham shrines met the BJP MP. Swamy also tweeted, “The Uttarakhand Government has got a new law passed by the Assembly. On the face of it, one can say that it is unconstitutional. Many sadhus came to see me to ask me to file a PIL. Will consider.”

Ever since talk of the Char Dham Devsthanam Management Board started, the Teerth Purohits and other stakeholders have been opposing this idea. Protest rallies were also staged in Dehradun and other parts of the State against this. After the bill was passed in the Assembly, the Raj Bhawan recently granted its approval to it. The Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, Culture and Tourism minister Satpal Maharaj and others have been stressing that this Act will not affect the rights or position of the various stakeholders. The State Government has been maintaining that this Act was brought to further improve the facilities for devotees from across Indid and abroad visiting the Char Dham and other shrines in the State. However, some have continued to oppose this. Recently the Char Dham Mahapanchayat vice president and priest in Gangotri shrine, Ashok Semwal led a delegation which called upon the BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy. In the memorandum submitted by the delegation to Swamy, it was stated that many are opposing the Act and that a protest will also be organised in Delhi on this issue.

62,20-1-20,One-way system trial elicits mixed response,"The police conducted a trial of the one-way system on various city roads here on Sunday.

The system is slated to be enforced in view of the various works to be undertaken in the city as part of the Smart City project. However, on the day of the trial, the people faced various problems and gave mixed response to the system.

“It is Sunday so somehow we managed, but our kids have school on the same route and the one-way will make it harder for us to go extra miles to drop them every morning. This will double the time it takes us to drop out children to school,” added Akriti Sahni.

According to Jeetram Sahni, “On normal days it hardly takes me five minutes on a motorcycle to reach Parade Ground from my place even during dense traffic but today I had to cover extra distance to reach the same place.

How it is helping anyone? It just wasted my time, energy and fuel. It might be helpful for pedestrians, but for bike riders and drivers, it is an inconvenient situation.”

Kedar Bhandari, an auto-rickshaw driver said, “Routes are undoubtedly longer than the usual ones and that is why the vehicles are taking more time to reach a destination. I do not know if this plan can help to reduce traffic in other days but it is certainly not going good for us today.

Commuters are not paying extra to go extra miles to reach the destination which is taking more time too besides extra fuel.”

However, some people found it helpful for commuters. “I am not saying that it is not causing inconvenience to the public, but I can also see less traffic jam than on other days. I come almost every Sunday towards Clock Tower and the intersection is always congested with vehicles.

Today the traffic here is about three times less than usual traffic. If it can work this way on other days too then I have no problem to cover a few extra miles without getting stuck in traffic,” said Vedant Tiwari.

According to Dipaneeta Sharma, “I had to ride some extra distance just to reach the place which was at a walking distance. We can go walking to such places but we can’t leave our vehicle on the road, so we’ll have to go extra miles. However, if this system can reduce the traffic then it is bearable, otherwise, it is a waste of fuel, time and effort.”

It is pertinent to mention here that traffic on Rajpur Road, Chakrata Road, Subhash Road, EC Road and some other roads in the core area of Dehradun city was affected by the one-way plan of the police.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/one-way-system-trial-elicits-mixed-response.html

65,20-1-20,Cong to start State-wide protest against Govt,"Accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party government at the State and Centre of “duping” Uttarakhand, the Congress is planning to undertake a state-wide protest rally.

Addressing media persons here on Sunday, former cabinet minister and senior Congress leader Mantri Prasad Naithani said that during the past three years, the Central and State Governments had been duping the state and imposing anti-people laws.

Due to this, the people who had voted overwhelmingly in favour of the BJP in the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections are now feeling cheated.

He said that the Congress party had been consistently undertaking movements against the objectionable decisions and actions of the Government since 2017.

However, the Central and State Governments are suppressing the public agitations instead of resolving the issues causing problems to the public. The women, farmers, members of the business fraternity, unemployed persons and even government employees are suffering due to Government policies. Naithani said that the party will undertake a 15-day ‘Uttarakhand Bachao Dev Yachna’ rally in the State from February 15.

The rally will be in protest against the Devsthanam management Act, shifting of NCC Academy from Tehri, disinvestment of THDC and NTPC, formation of district authorities in various districts, failure to clear pending dues of sugar cane farmers, fee hike in medical colleges, discontinuation of public-welfare schemes started by the previous Congress government and about a dozen other issues.

The rally will also be extending support to the protesting Anganwadi workers, protest against failure to meet the valid demands of government employees, Central Government cutting the budgetary allocation for the Kumbh Mela to be held in Haridwar during and against the continued price rise, added Naithani.

Before the protest rally, the Congress will submit memoranda to the Prime Minister and various union ministers in the national capital from February 5 to 10. In the second stage of the protest, the party will start from the Rampur Tiraha and travel to various shrines in all the 13 districts of the state, seeking justice and help from the deities. If the Government fails to respond, the Congress will lock down the Vidhan Sabha during the budget session. After that the party workers will lock down the secretariat.

If still the desired results are not achieved, the Congress will undertake the fifth stage of its planned protest by taking out a ‘Jawab Do Sarkar’ rally from Narayan Ashram in Pithoragarh which will pass through all the districts and conclude at Gangotri.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-to-start-state-wide-protest-against-govt.html
66,20-1-20,Capt gets another letter from own MLA,"Days after senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP from Punjab Partap Singh Bajwa threw a letter bomb on the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh demanding State Advocate-General Atul Nanda’s expulsion, the Patiala Royal on Sunday received another letter from his party legislator raising issues concerning human resource development.

Congress MLA from Ferozepur City Parminder Singh Pinki has shot off a letter to the Chief Minister raising several issues concerning the physically challenged, besides the people’s health, expressing hope that Capt Amarinder would prioritise the same.

Pinki, in his letter, has sought monthly allowance for the physically challenged persons, along with organising district wise camps for them, issuing certificates to access certain facilities like travel, among other things.

“I am inviting your attention to an issue that is concerned with the society at large….It is about the disabled persons in Punjab,” said Pinki.

He added, “I recently organised a camp for the handicapped in Ferozepur during which I realised the extent and depth of their problem and cater to the needs of 1,562 such disabled persons. They virtually are a neglected section of the society going by their unmitigated problems.”

Underlining that the number of handicapped in Punjab is more than six lakhs as per official figures, Pinki said that such camps should be organized in every district from time-to-time.

“The persons certified as handicapped should be given monthly allowance. This is all the more important in case of those who belong to the weaker sections of society,” he suggested adding that they have a right to dignified life and the allowance would be just one step in that direction.

He suggested that the physically challenged should be issued certificates that would enable to access certain facilities like travel. They should have better access to education and employment opportunities, he added.

Pinki added another significant issue that needs to be given proper focus is the “health” of the people. “Open Gyms should be set up in the public parks in every city and towns of the State,” said Pinky pointing that this facility has been provided only in some areas and the same should be available to the people at large, especially in rural areas.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/capt-gets-another-letter-from-own-mla.html
67,20-1-20,Independent MLA threatens to quit Haryana Govt,"An Independent legislator in Haryana, who has been booked for cheating, on Sunday gave an ultimatum to the Manohar Lal Khattar led State Government on withdrawing his support.

Indirectly hitting out at Chief Minister, Meham legislator Balraj Kundu said he has extended support to the CM for his clean credentials and not to a person who is supporting the corrupt.

Police had on Friday booked Kundu and his brother Shivraj Kundu for allegedly cheating Rohtak resident Narender Dhankhar.

While talking to the mediapersons, Kundu said that if the CM is not taking action against his leader Manish Grover, I will be forced to withdraw my support to this Government.

“I am giving a month’s time to the Chief Minister to act against Grover,” he said, adding “I know that the withdrawal of my support will have no impact on the Government stability as without me it has the support of 56 legislators, but my fight against the corrupt would continue”.

Kundu had alleged irregularities in sugar mills in the state since the BJP came to power in the state in 2014. He had sought a probe against former state Cooperatives Minister Manish Grover.

Earlier, Kundu, along with the supporters, reached the police station and dared authorities to arrest him for the case registered against him. The police told him that the case was under investigation.

The Meham legislator, a BJP turncoat, had won polls as an independent after being denied a party nomination.

In October last year, the BJP had won 40 seats and was six short of a majority in the 90-member Assembly. Besides the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), seven independent MLAs had also extended support to the BJP, helping it reach a tally of 57 seats.

Kundu’s allegations are likely to be raised by the opposition during the year’s first session of the Haryana Assembly beginning January 20.

This will be a special assembly session to pass a resolution ratifying the SC/ST quota Bill for another 10 years.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/independent-mla-threatens-to-quit-haryana-govt.html

71,20-1-20,Tata Steel subsidiary TCIL hits a century,"The Tinplate Company of India Limited (TCIL), a subsidiary of Tata Steel will complete 100 glorious years of its existence on January 20, 2020 following the ideals and philosophy laid down by Tata groupRs s founder, JN Tata.

The journey of TCIL began in 1920. Started as joint venture between TISCO (now Tata Steel) and BOCL (a British company – Burmah Oil Company Ltd.), the Company rolled out the first tinplate in December 1922 from its facility in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand (erstwhile Bihar).

TCIL is a manufacturer of Tinplate, an environment-friendly packaging material. The steel base with coating of Tin suffice the need of packaging, i.e. strength and food compatibility. Worldwide two-thirds of tinplate produced goes into food packaging. Process improvement, Innovation and continual improvement has helped the company to sustain a market share of about 45% in India with 18-20% of its production being exported.

The technology with which production started primarily involved Hot Pack Rolling of steel sheet bars followed by tinning by Hot Dip technology. In 1950s, the product was highly profitable with more than 100% value addition over basic raw material. Designed to produce 28,000 tonnes of tinplate, the facility went on to produce 60,000 tonnes, through sheer dedication and hardwork of the employees. The 1950s also saw the advent of efficient process to produce tinplate, using the electrolysis process.

To be aligned with market needs, the company set up its 1st Electrolytic Tinning Line (ETL) in 1979. Since its indigenous raw material (TMBP – Tin Mill Black Plate) sourcing plan did not work out, company was left with no choice but to import the same.

High duties of import, erratic supply conditions and quality issues due to high lead time of supply could not support the new technology and lead to ineffective operations of the new tinning line.

During late 70s, BOCL, due to its financial difficulties wanted to sell off its equity holdings. During the same time TISCO stopped production of steel bars (raw material for the hot dip facilities) due to strategic reasons leading to loss of production. The new tinning line could not sustain the vagaries of imported raw material due to high cost and fluctuation in supplies. All put together, the company carried a negative worth at the end of 1980.

In 1981, TISCO got the preferential rights to purchase BOCL’s shares and, subsequent multiple initiatives saw the company moving ahead from mid 80s.Key strategic decision was taken during this period, backward integration of TCIL (Cold Colling Mill Complex - CRM) to set up its own TMBP making facility (raw material for tinning line) and reinforcement of TISCO’s flat products business by setting up the Hot Strip Mill (HSM) at Jamshedpur which would provide raw material to TCIL’s CRM complex. This brought in a lot of excitement in the organisation. However, the dark side of the moon was taking the inevitable decision of closure of the old facilities, due to obsolescence of technology and non-availability of raw material.

The late 90s saw coming up of the state of art CRM complex and phasing out of the old hot dip technology and plant.

Standing today, the company has a capacity to produce 379,000 tonnes per annum of tinplate and the journey continues with options being explored for further capacity addition at Jamshedpur.

While the turf has changed and challenges are many, the team is committed to uphold the foundation laid in its journey towards a sustainable future. TCIL is working for the next level of organic growth of tinplate production and further reinforcement of downstream presence.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/tata-steel-subsidiary-tcil-hits-a-century.html

The era of the softs began just a decade ago. Instead of zero tolerance, more and more schools and institutions now advocate expanded tolerance-discipline reform. The age old adage of ""Spare the rod and spoil the child"" has become redundant. ""Restorative justice"" is now in vogue. Students who indulge in fights or who cursed out a teacher are asked to ""circle up"" and work their problems out with words. 'Positive behaviour intervention"" is considered to be a good practise -meaning students sometimes get incentives for not acting up.

These new policies have to be adopted with varying degrees of buy-in, professional development, resources and success. Schools have to be cautious not to fall prey to a ""culture of tolerance and leniency that allows habitual offenders to fly under the radar in a way that puts other kids at risk"". I think it is humane that if pupils make mistakes they are given a second chance. However, we have gone far from over disciplining to under disciplining. The pendulum looks poised to swing back from ""softs"" to ""hards"". Policymakers have been making enough noise for a long time to get smaller class sizes, more money for school counselors but implementation has been a major issue.

Outside the home and classroom, strong education policy is critical to an excellent education system. Education polices in various countries and India too, dictate everything from length of a school day to staff requirements to curriculum. As educators it is our mission to ensure that all children receive an excellent education, regardless of their background, so much so that every student grows up to be a responsible student. The solution shouldn't be draconian rather with lot of compassion and hope we have to direct our attention and adopt the middle path. It is essential for us to understand that children are in some way savages, untrained in the ways of society, the need is to make them stand tall and stop worrying about test scores.

As the board examinations are knocking at the door, it is vital for parents and teachers to ensure a congenial atmosphere of learning for the young ones. By doing this we build self-confidence in students, thereby safeguarding the most important ingredient to success that is motivation. Some of the simple strategies to be used to improve confidence at this crucial juncture can be by

* Focussing on achievements

* Sharing positive experience

* Making minor personal changes in communication

*Enabling learners to practice self-acceptance

* Lending unconditional support and reward

* Lessen fear and anxiety

* Build resilence

* Exhibit improved bonding

*Help set manageable goals

* Give useful feedback at regular intervals

Let the learners see possibility instead of limitation, and help them see very failure as an opportunity to improve and excel. Grow and bloom everyday to spread your sheen all around.

""Listen o my lovely students leave all fear In any situation never leave your cheerMistakes do occur in reality realmNever lose your heart and don't shatterLearn from your mistakes and improviseBecome more and more wiseAdmiration and success will follow suite Never lose your confidence and don't fear.""

75,20-1-20,JP Dalal: Haryana Govt working on doubling farmers’ income,"First-time BJP MLA Jai Prakash Dalal who is a Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Fisheries and Law and Legislative says that the State Government is effectively working on doubling the farmers’ income and several steps have been taken in this direction.

The Agriculture Minister said the State Government is making policies to strengthen the rural economy. He said along with fruits, flowers and vegetables, farmers are being motivated for animal husbandry and fisheries, pointing out that the State Government is making proper arrangements so that farmers can get a fair price for their crops.

The 66-year old Dalal contested 2019 Assembly polls on BJP ticket and won by defeating Somvir Singh of Congress from Loharu constituency, which is a part of Bhiwani-Mahendragarh Lok Sabha constituency.

In the Assembly election-2019, BJP failed to attract Jat community as many Jat leaders of the party lost the election. His induction as a Cabinet Minister in the BJP-JJP coalition government by the BJP is viewed as an attempt to consolidate the Jat votes in Hisar, Sirsa, Fatehabad and other belts of the State.

In an exclusive interview with The Pioneer, Dalal reveals his political journey and priorities as a Minister of the State. Excerpts from the interview:

You have been in State politics over three decades. But you won the Assembly election for the first time in 2019 and became a Minister. How do you view this?

It is true that I had waited for around three decades to become an MLA and a Minister in the State despite being in active politics since 1990. I have been with the people throughout my political journey. I have given maximum time to public life. I believe that if your intention is good and work unbiased, people will support you and send you in the Assembly. I started as a Junior Engineer in the Irrigation department of Haryana and after resigning from the job in 1984, I set up my own business and later joined politics.

I was founding General Secretary of Haryana Vikas Party in 1990. I held key positions such as General Secretary, Haryana Vikas Party and Vice-President in BJP, Haryana and In-charge Kisan Morcha Haryana. I was in-charge of BJP’s Kisan Morcha, Haryana in the year 2018. I have also been involved in the promotion to join with modern farming activities, raising voice for safe drinking water, women empowerment and self-employment generation. In 2009, I contested as an Independent candidate against Somvir Singh of Congress (son-in law of ex-CM Bansi Lal) from Loharu constituency but lost by a margin of 623 votes only.

In 2014, I contested as BJP’s candidate from the same constituency but again lost by a margin of 2,065 votes.

More than two months passed after the formation of the coalition Government in the State. As a Minister, what are the steps you taken to facilitate the farmers to improve their income?

Haryana is a progressive State in the field of agriculture. Series of measures have been taken to improve the income of farmers ever since I took charge. I understand the actual situation of farmers as I hail from a farmer’s family and working for the upliftment of farmers since long. Being a Minister, my topmost priority is to double the farmers’ income. For this, Haryana will have to move in the direction of horticulture along with diversification. The department officers have been directed to work on to promote horticulture in a big way. Works are being executed in such a way that farmers’ produce are processed, packaged and branded and sold directly in the market, which will increase the income of the farmers. Ultramodern apple, fruits market will be set up in Pinjore. Our government has decided to set up an international vegetable market in Ganaur. Apart from this, flower market will be set up in Gurugram while a spices market will be set up in Sonipat. The schemes under which subsidies are given by the Central and State Government being monitored by the officials concerned from time to time.

What is your priority as a Minister?

As I pointed out, we are working on to improve the condition of farmers and want them to become self-reliant and make farming sector profitable. Lots of works are to be done in the departments allocated to me. I will try my best to live up to the expectations of the people.

You are one of the senior most politicians in the Council of Ministers of the new Government. People have huge expectations from you. What is your plan to address people’s concerns?

All Government benefits must reach the last person in the queue and I will continue to work in this direction.

As you said, your topmost priority is to double the farmers’ income. How you would be able to achieve it? In the meeting with the department officials, what did you instruct them?

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set the target of doubling the income of farmers by 2022. By adopting multi-pronged approach and with the implementation of central and state government schemes, we will be able to achieve the set target. The Agriculture Department officers have been directed to conduct awareness programmes with a vision to double farmers’ income by encouraging them to cultivate natural, organic and horticultural crops. Instruction has been given to provide training and information regarding horticulture, agriculture, and processing to farmers and their children so that they can become employable anywhere in the country and even abroad also. More centers of excellence will be set up under horticulture in order to increase the cultivation of flowers, fruits, and vegetables in the State. Separate wing for natural and organic farming will be formed under the Department of Agriculture which would only serve to train and make aware of the farmers on the subject. In today’s time, diversification of crops is very important and for this, farmers need to be aware so that they can grow crops like maize and instead of crops like paddy and wheat. To boost horticulture in the State, export of vegetables, fruits and flowers will be promoted. Export of these products will help in increasing the farmers’ income and would also add in the economic development of the State. I chalked out plan after meeting with the officers and deploy their expertise effectively. The officials were directed to implement the schemes with the best practices.

You must have made promises during elections for your constituency people.

What are priorities for your constituency?

I thank people of my constituency for showing faith and electing me for the first time. I would like to fulfill the promises made during the election. The officers have been directed to speed up the completion of the ongoing development works for the betterment of the life of people. Instructions have also been given to the officers to ensure that all the public related complaints are taken seriously heard apart from taking necessary actions.

Farmers are directly involved in stubble burning and your Government is struggling to stop it through several measures have been taken. Please share your ideas as a Agriculture Minister to stop stubble burning?

We are concerned about it. Multi-purpose approach needs to be taken and one of them is to create awareness among the farmers. Several other measures have been taken in this direction. I have also directed to make liaison with industrial units for the management of the stubble. Along with this, steps are being taken to ensure that the farmers do not burn the stubble instead can get extra income by selling that for its usage in cow-shelters. From this year onwards, we will be able to reduce it at the minimum level or completely be able to stop stubble burning in the State.

Unemployment is a big issue and large numbers of people are connected with agriculture and allied departments directly or indirectly. What are steps you taken to create employment through your departments?

The State Government approved the plan to construct a Spice Market in Sersa village of Sonipat. With the setting up of this Market, along with the development of the area around 50,000 people will also get employment opportunities. Horticulture related skills training will also be provided to the youth so that they can get employment opportunities in aboard. The State Government will also help the youth in providing loans for occupations such as agriculture, horticulture and animal husbandry. To promote horticulture-based industries and cold supply chains in the State, the government has decided to subsidise the electricity rates for the industrial units of this sector. While, with this decision, Framers, Farmer Producer Organization (FPO) listed with Small Framers Agri-Business Consortium Haryana, Cooperative Societies and other Micro and Small Enterprises related to horticulture will get electricity on almost half the price.

What are the steps you taken to remove corruption in your departments?

We are working on to eliminate corruption and for this a special number has been issued, on which any person give information related to corruption and strict action will be taken on every complaint. With the help of latest technologies, corruption will be curbed completely.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jp-dalal--haryana-govt-working-on-doubling-farmers----income.html

80,20-1-20,Beggar engineer rescued by siblings,"An engineer, who had come to public notice for sitting with a begging bowl on the Bada Danda (Grand Road) here to earn his living, was rescued and taken back home by his brother and sister on Sunday.

After some verbal exchanges with him, they lifted him from ground picking his hand and then took him by a bike.

They didn’t divulge their names as they did not like others to know why their brother chose begging for livelihood and was living in exile for over last two decades.

Reportedly, Girija Shankar Mishra, an engineer in Plastic Technology from the CIPET, had been spending life as a beggar for about 20 years after leaving home. Earlier, he was working in a multinational plastic company in Mumbai.

He came to be known as an engineer after he lodged a police complaint in English. The matter was widely published in the media. Aged about 50, Mishra is unmarried.

82,20-1-20,Girl raped by 3 persons along with husband,"A girl of Raighar block was gangraped in village UV 52 under the Umarkote police limits on January 13.

Reports say that last year the victim against the consent of her family had married one Saju Harijan of village Chadheiguda under the Umerkote police station. For this reason, her family members had severed relationship with her.

The girl and her husband Saju stayed in a rented house in village Raighar. As their marriage was not recognised by both their families, the relationship between them began collapsing day by day. Five months after their marriage, the girl lodged a complaint of mental and physical harassment against her husband in the Raighar police station but withdrew the FIR after the dispute was compromised.

On January 13 evening, Saju asked the girl to go Umarkote with him but took her to an isolated pond situated in village UV52. At night, three persons came there by a bike and tied her hands and mouth with the help of her husband. Then, her husband and the three other persons, one by one, raped and left her deserted on the spot.

Next morning, the girl managed to come to the Umarkote police station and reported the matter. Police took her to the Umarkote medical for treatment. On Saturday (January 18) evening, the girl lodged a written complaint against her husband and the other three persons.

83,20-1-20,‘Fake Taksalis starts mission of Safar-e-Cong’,"Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Sunday said that the “fake” Taksalis had proved that they had started on their mission of “Safar-e-Congress” by joining hands with the Congress party and their radical sympathizers in a desperate attempt to weaken the sword arm of the panth — the SAD and Sikh religious institutions.

“A bunch of opportunists, who are dancing to the tune of the Congress party by betraying Akali values could not challenge the leadership of party president Sukhbir Badal who had been democratically elected by 47 lakh strong members of the Akali Dal,” said SAD’s senior leaders — MP Balwinder Singh Bhundur, MP Naresh Gujral and former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra, former Minister Jathedar Tota Singh and former Minister Maheshinder Singh Grewal, in a joint statement.

Stating that no ‘safar’ for the rights of people could be started by traitors of the panth from a quarter full 400-seat auditorium in the national capital, SAD leaders said that it was “disgusting” that the so-called Taksalis had insulted the core Akali ideology by sharing the stage with Congress stooges.

“The cat is out of the bag. Now it is clear that all these fake Taksalis have become unofficial members of the Congress party. They might as well have cemented this relation completely by inviting former Congress president Rahul Gandhi or his mother Sonia Gandhi to their show,” they said.

Chandumajra and Tota Singh asked that all the Taksalis to first clear the air about their own conduct before pointing questions at the SAD president.

The leaders said that Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa’s own track record was such that he did not even contemplate resigning as Secretary General when he lost the assembly election during an Akali wave in 1997. “In direct contrast, SAD had performed splendidly in the past by winning back to back elections and forming a government for 15 out of the last 20 years. Sukhbir Badal has made an immense contribution in these victories and has even been credited by party workers and the entire senior leadership for bringing the party back to power in 2012,” they said.

Stating that the Congress party was behind the so-called Taksalis, Bhundur, Gujral and Grewal said that whenever the Congress faced problems in Punjab and stared at a wipe-out like it was doing now, it tried to form a front of disgruntled leaders like the “Taksalis” to weaken the SAD. Grewal said that the “main front man” of yesterday’s event was Paramjit Sarna whose close links to the Congress and its president Sonia Gandhi were known to all.

“He is the Religious Advisor of Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh,” said Grewal adding that discarded leader Ravi Inder Singh, who was Capt Amarinder’s chum, had been unsuccessfully used earlier also to sow discord in the SAD.

“Bir Devinder Singh, who had recently tested his popularity on the Taksali ticket from Anandpur Sahib and secured 7000 votes, is better known for showcasing the bodies of the martyrs in Sri Harmandar Sahib to Indira Gandhi post Operation Bluestar,” he added.

Reiterating that the panth would reject this anti-Punjab move to push it back into a state of turmoil as per the conspiracy hatched by the Congress party, the senior Akali leadership said that the fraudulent Congress B-team would not be allowed to succeed in its nefarious designs by the people of Punjab.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---fake-taksalis-starts-mission-of-safar-e-cong---.html
84,20-1-20,CM to get ‘Champion of Change’ award today,"A day before getting the ‘Champion of Change - 2019’ award from former President Pranab Mukherjee in New Delhi, Chief Minister Hemant Soren dedicated the award to the people of Jharkhand and thanked them for bestowing their trust upon Soren – a son of the soil who has promised to work for the common people in every nook and corner of Jharkhand.

“It is an honour to get felicitated by a statesman like Pranab Mukherjee. He is not only a political stalwart, but also one of the most intellectual personalities and a true visionary. This award is for the 3.25 crore people of Jharkhand,” Soren said at his residence in Ranchi on Sunday.

Soren will receive the award at Vigyan Bhavan in New Delhi on Monday.

Since taking charge as the Chief Minister of the State, Soren has not shied away from meeting commoners at his residence – a practice that has not only grabbed headlines but also made him a popular face on social media across the country.

Even on Sunday, commoners formed a beeline at his residence to meet Soren. While most of them congratulated him for his achievements, some shared their problems and sought his help in addressing them.

Taking a subtle jibe at the former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led Government in Jharkhand, Soren on Sunday said that his Government was people’s Government, and it believed in listening to the people of Jharkhand. “Our Government will listen to every citizen of the State and take everyone along in the path of development. We have to repair the damage done in the past five years. I have been meeting people and trying my level best to solve their problems in my capacity as the Chief Minister,” Soren said.

In less than a month since taking charge as the Chief Minister, Soren has won hearts across the country for his affability and simplistic approach towards his job. He has been arguably one of the most easily accessible Chief Ministers in the State so far.

This is the second time that Soren has occupied the chair of the CM here, and the beginning of his second term has unveiled version 2.0 of Soren, say political experts.

Speculations are rife that Soren will also meet senior Congress party leaders during his New Delhi visit for receiving the award and discuss about the expansion of his Cabinet.

The current Government is a coalition of three parties – Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). Congress party, which has 16 legislators, has demanded at least five berths in the Cabinet, sources said. On the other hand, RJD has only one legislator and JMM has 30 MLAs – the highest from a political party in the current Assembly.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-to-get----champion-of-change----award-today.html

“We convinced the parents and they gave undertakings that they will not get their daughters married till they attain the age 18 years,” coordinator of Childline NGO Sai Prasad Samal said.

Earlier in the first week of this month, the district administration had stopped at least seven such proposed child marriages. And the district administration had foiled as many as 42 such cases in 2019, sources said.

More awareness is needed to prevent child marriages in the district, child rights activist Sudhir Sabat said.

The district administration has launched an initiative called ‘Nirbhaya Kadhi’ to prevent child marriages. Besides, a ‘Mu Sachetan’ (I am aware) programme has also been launched in the schools by the administration to create awareness against child marriage.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/five-more-child-marriages-foiled-in-ganjam.html

He held a meeting with senior police officers of Western Range (Rourkela, Sundargarh and Keonjhar) at the District Police Office, Rourkela. The focus point of the meeting was how to minimize the criminal and Maoist activities in the area.

To strengthen the police activities, the DGP inaugurated 25 new PCR vans in the Uditnagar parade ground. He said with these vehicles, police would be more strengthened and accessible to the public.

However, the DG preferred to keep mum over a question regarding introduction of Commissionerate police system in the Rourkela Municipal Corporation area.

Notably, in 2016, a proposal was mooted for introduction of Commissionerate police system here with inclusion of 13 urban and two adjoining rural police stations which is still in cold storage.

Similarly, almost all the police stations under the Rourkela police district are running with manpower crunch. In such a situation, how it would be possible to operate the PCR vans and carry out other policing activities to curb crimes in the district is a big question. But instead of giving a suitable reply to this, the DGP put the ball in the court of DIG, Rourkela Kavita Jalan to respond while the latter also preferred not to reply on the issue.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/dgp-unveils-25-pcr-vans-in-rourkela.html

93,20-1-20,Hope Amarinder understands Sibal’s language: Chugh,"Bharatiya Janata Party on Sunday stated that after the clarification of legal and technical position of Centre and States by none other than senior Congress leaders Kapil Sibbal and Salman Khurshid, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh will behave responsibly on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

“Sibal, one of the top legal experts of Congress, has made it clear that that stand taken by Capt Amarinder and the resolution passed by the Congress Government in Punjab is unconstitutional,” said BJP national secretary Tarun Chugh.

Chugh said that Sibal’s statement gains significance as his own party, including its top leaders Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi were opposing CAA tooth and nail and urging the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA Government to withdraw the decision.

“The Amendment has been made after getting it through from both the houses of Parliament and now no state can say no to it. It will not only be impossible not to implement the same in any state. But if any state decides to go ahead, it will be unconstitutional as the right to citizenship is not a state subject,” said Chugh adding that an Act or amendment passed by the Parliament is binding for all the States as well as UTs under Article 254 of the Constitution.

Allaying unnecessary fears being spread by the opposition parties, Chugh said that the CAA won’t affect any Indian citizen. “The resolution passed in Punjab Assembly by Capt Amarinder-led Government was not the true representation of the wishes of people of the State but a unilateral decision against their wishes,” he said.

Chugh has urged Punjab Governor VP Singh Badnore to reject the unconstitutional resolution and direct the State Government to get the CAA implemented in the state to uphold the constitutional provisions.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hope-amarinder-understands-sibal---s-language--chugh.html

95,20-1-20,Gyan Yoga — The Path of Knowledge,"Gyan yoga, also known as gyan marga, is the way of gaining true knowledge of the self. It is the art of union with the Divine, through pursuit of spiritual knowledge. A gyan yogi explores some very basic questions of life such as ‘who am I’ and ‘how am I related to the world as a whole’. Wisdom so gained helps him in getting freedom from the cycle of births and deaths.

Apart from gyan yoga, the other two paths prescribed in Bhagavad Gita are karma yoga and bhakti yoga. Though it is not possible to draw a clear-cut demarcation, but broadly speaking karma yoga and bhakti yoga are suitable for the men of action and men of emotion respectively ; and gyan yoga is pursued by the men of contemplation. One can choose the path of his spiritual freedom depending upon his interest, aptitude and inclination.

Gyan or the spiritual knowledge is not the the same thing as philosophical musings or scientific statements. Whereas the knowledge of any other discipline relates only to the subject matter of that particular branch of knowledge, the truth of spirit relates to whole of the existence. It is not the knowledge which is pursued for the sake of power and pelf ; but it is the wisdom the aim of which is to realise the ultimate truth.

Wisdom is not something which is to be acquired. It is inherent in the self. But it remains covered by avidya, the ignorance. The aim of gyan yoga is to pierce the veil of this ignorance. It is not soul but the mind which has to overcome the ignorance and let the wisdom of the soul be revealed. Once the ignorance is overcome, wisdom of the soul shines like a self-luminous source of light. When one experiences such wisdom, he is united with the Supreme.

While experiencing the mortal world, the immortal soul is deluded by the three modes of material nature. He is attracted by objects of the physical world and gets entangled in them. As a result, he forgets his essential nature. He forgets that he is an eternal fragment of the Supreme.

Gita has described in

detail as to how one can understand the ultimate truth and also realise his essential nature, the self.

One must have firm determination and a clear goal, avoid bodily excesses of indulgence or abstinence, develop equanimity of mind, subdue all the senses ; and control the mind through constant practice and detachment. One must free himself from the clutches of fear, lust, anger and greed. One must be free from enmity to any of the creatures. One must regulate his breath and focus his mind on one point, to attain concentration of mind. One must do his prescribed duty without any attachment ; and without any expectation in return. One must dedicate all his actions to the Supreme Lord and receive the results with an attitude of glad acceptance. Full of love in

his heart, one must worship Ishvara, the Supreme Lord with great devotion.

In this manner, he obtains liberating insights into the nature of his own self and also his relationship with the ultimate reality. The wisdom so gained by him is not only a theoretical knowledge but also an inward experience.

As a result, one understands that the body and the soul are distinct. Whereas the body, the mind and other objects of the physical world are transient, the self is indestructible and remains unchanged by the events of the material world. He then is freed from the good and evil influences of gunas, the three modes of material nature. As a result, the false ego gets dissolved and the embodied soul regains his pristine glory of perfect knowledge and pure consciousness. One realises the self and discovers the Supreme Self within.

Chapter 4 of Bhagavad Gita has given a detailed description of Gyan Yoga. It is stated that yagya for knowledge is superior than the one done for material gains because all works, without any exception, ultimately culminate, in wisdom (Shloka 4.33). The one who is full of faith, is sincere in his pursuit of wisdom ; and who has mastered his senses - such a person gains this wisdom and having obtained it, quickly he attains to the supreme peace (Shloka 4.39). After gaining this wisdom, one shall never be deluded again because such wisdom would enable him to see the entire creation in the self, and consequently in the Supreme Lord (Shloka 4.35). Nothing in this world is as purifying as this wisdom. The one who is perfected in yoga, he himself experiences that wisdom in his own self, in due course of time (Shloka 4.38).

Even if one is the most sinful of all sinners, still he can cross over the ocean of misery by this boat of wisdom (4.36).

To conclude, when one obtains equanimous wisdom, he is liberated from the bondage of works. He gains complete self-awareness. As a result, insight of the soul is born and the apparent ego merges with the divine consciousness. The soul is united again with the Supersoul. One then experiences the presence of the indwelling God. One becomes the master of his life.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/gyan-yoga-----the-path-of-knowledge.html

‘The Chief Minister is making new promises to mislead the people. One can easily understand the difference between the prophecy and practice of Kejriwal from the fact that he is giving the guarantee card for the works which could not be completed during the last five years,” he said, adding that it clearly shows that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is apprehensive of its defeat in the upcoming Assembly elections.

“Before promising to remove all over head cables in the next five years and ensuring water supply in unauthorized colonies, Kejriwal should explain why it failed to do it in its tenure of five years,” he said.

Tiwari said that the Chief Minister who claims to have made revolutionary changes in education must answer where are those 500 new schools and 20 new colleges?

“The Government also claimed to provide free medical care but it even failed to improve the mohalla clinics and the hospitals of Delhi Government during the last five years,” he said.

He also accused the AAP dispensation of creating hindrance in expansion of Delhi Metro again and again is giving guarantee of providing public transport of international level.

The Chief Minister is also giving guarantee of removing the garbage mountain but during the last five years, he could not do anything to get rid of it, he said, adding that the Municipal Corporations have already installed machines for removing the garbage mountain and these garbage mountains will be removed from Delhi in the near future itself.

Tiwari further said that the promise of installing CCTVs and street lights was made in 2015 also but has not been fulfilled. “

The Chief Minister announced guarantee of providing roads, drains, sewers, water supply in the unauthorized colonies but the fact is that these amenities will be provided by the Central Government as these colonies have been regularized, he said, adding that Jahan Jhuggi Wahan Makan is also a scheme of Prime Minister Narender Modi under which the process of registration of forms after the survey of jhuggi clusters has already kicked in but the Chief Minister is misleading the people by including this scheme under his guarantee card.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aap---s-pack-of-10-new-lies--tiwari.html

Delhi Congress president Subhash Chopra said that Kejriwal wasted his time scuffling with the officials, the Central Government, the Lieutenant Governor and the Municipal Corporations of Delhi without fulfilling the promises made to the people.

Criticising the ten promises of the guarantee card launched by Kejriwal, he said Kejriwal, who is now talking to provide world class education in Delhi, could not create a new university or establish the 20 colleges he had promised.

Accusing the AAP Government of supplying “dirty” water, Chopra said that the Kejriwal Government is now talking about the issue of water after noticing the overwhelming public support in favour of Congress’ ‘cashback’ incentive scheme to encourage people to save water.

“The AAP Government has not set up any new water treatment plant or UGR (Under Ground Reservoir) to address the shortage of potable water supply in unauthorized colonies. The Government also failed to set up any new hospital or ensured proper functioning of the existing Government hospitals,” he said.

Chopra said that the Kejriwal Government had terribly neglected public transport in the last five years and that was one of the primary reasons for pollution levels went beyond dangerous marks several times in the past few years. “Over 3200 buses of ‘Delhi Transport Corporation’ have vanished from Delhi roads due to which the common people had to bear inconvenience.

The Congress president also blamed the AAP Government for not only delaying the third phase of the metro works by three years and the fourth phase by nearly five years, but also hiking the metro fares twice in one year to make metro travel beyond the reach of the common people.

Party Chief Spokesperson Mukesh Sharma criticized the Kejriwal Government for the promise of constructing flats for those living in JJ clusters, saying that the irony is that in-situ flats constructed for resettling JJ Cluster residents at Kalkaji and Narela have not yet been allotted to them.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/promises-another-jumla--cong.html

In a tweet on Friday, Jaising has said, while she fully identifies with the pain of Nirbhaya’s mother, she urges her “to follow the example of Sonia Gandhi who forgave Nalini and said she didn’t not (did not) want the death penalty for her”.

Tiwari claimed that the Tihar prison comes under the Delhi Government, and the convicts, who should have been informed about the 2017 verdict soon after, were informed two years later in 2019.

“It shows that first the AAP-led Government delayed the hanging and now trying to save the four convicts,” he alleged. And, then Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia holds a press conference to say, “Police is delaying” the proceedings, he said.

Tiwari said “No political party in the country has done something like this, as the AAP installing the justice for which Nirbhaya’s family has been waiting for eight years,”

With the arrest of three members of this gang, the NCB claimed to have seized over 7 lakh tablets and more than 1,400 vials of injection and bottles of cough syrup.

The seizure was made from a godown in the Shahganj area of Agra, NCB said on Sunday. The seized tablets also include over 2.87 lakh Tramadol tablets, a regulated drug as it is a psychotropic substance. The NCB is now probing the role of pharma companies, dealers and retailers to unearth the entire nexus, a senior official said.

According to NCB Delhi zonal director KPS Malhotra, “Three people have been arrested as part of an operation that began early this month and spanned across Agra in Uttar Pradesh, Ludhiana in Punjab and in the national Capital, “A total of 7,24,840 tablets and capsules, 1,400 injections and 80 CBCS (codeine based cough syrup) bottles have been seized. “These medicines are suspected to have been diverted from lawful channels into the trafficking network,” he said.

Incidentally, the Union government had brought the drug under the control of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act in 2018 banning it from being sold freely over the counter. The synthetic opiate was stated to be abused on a wide-scale by ISIS terrorists to suppress pain and boost strength during injury and hence, is also known as ‘fighter drug’ among international anti-narcotics authorities.

NCB officials said the seized drugs are of schedule H/H1/X category, which require a medical prescription to procure from the pharmacist.

Seized drugs are used for anti-anxiety, as sedatives and pain killers, and lead to habit forming and dependence in victims, the official said.

119,20-1-20,Woman lawyer who torched police bike identified: Cops,"The Delhi Police have identified a woman lawyer who was the first to torch the motorcycle of a policeman during a clash between lawyers and police at Tis Hazari Court Complex in November last year but no action can be taken against her, officials said on Sunday.

They said the High Court has made it clear no “coercive action” can be taken against any lawyer in connection with the violent clash on November 2, adding police cannot take action also because a judicial inquiry is in progress into the incident.

The crime branch identified the lawyer after scanning through multiple CCTV cameras. In one of the footage, the lawyer is seen setting the police motorcycle parked outside the lock-up in the Tis Hazari Court premises on fire at 4.14 pm. She is surrounded by other lawyers.

Within five minutes of it, more police bikes are set on fire. In another footage, an advocate is seen bringing a sack full of stones at 4.19 pm. Shortly hereafter, a group of lawyers start pelting stones on police personnel as the fires rage.

Thirteen police motorcycles were torched during the clash that day.The CCTV footage also showed a senior DCP-rank officer entering the court complex at 4.21 pm through Gate No 1A. With folded hands, she requests the crowd to calm down as vehicles torched during the clash are seen in the background. At 4.22 pm, she is manhandled.

Twenty-one police personnel and several lawyers were injured during the violence and 17 vehicles, including the 13 police motorcycles, were vandalised. The Delhi High Court ordered a judicial inquiry by one of its retired judges, S P Garg, into the clash and following its direction, Special Commissioner Sanjay Singh and Additional DCP Harendra Singh were transferred during pendency of the investigation.

The high court also made clear that no “coercive action” would be taken against any lawyer. A special investigation team was formed by Delhi Police to probe the clash and the seven FIRs, which included the charge of attempt to murder, lodged in connection with the incident. One assistant sub-inspector was suspended and another police officer was transferred for their alleged involvement in the incident.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/woman-lawyer-who-torched-police-bike-identified--cops.html

He was present in the court from where he was sent to jail. Meanwhile, some Congress leaders have alleged that this action is politically motivated.

According to information provided by sources, Noida resident Mukesh Joshi had filed a complaint regarding fraud and verbal abuse in the Rajpur police station during February 2017. He had stated in the complaint that he had lodged a case against Sachin Upadhyay accusing him of fraud in Delhi during 2012. It is alleged that Upadhyaya had used forged signatures in a property deal. After the case was lodged, he sought to settle the case with the complainant and reportedly spoke of paying him Rs 26.50 lakh.

Till the payment of the said amount, Upadhyaya reportedly kept a property of his as security with the complainant. However, later Joshi came to know that this property had already been mortgaged with a bank. When the complainant approached Upadhyaya regarding this, he allegedly refused to return the amount and verbally abused him. After this Joshi lodged a complaint against Upadhyay with the Dehradun police. After various subsequent developments, the state government ordered the formation of a special investigation team to probe the case. After the SIT probe was successful in finding various substantial proofs against the accused, a non-bailable warrant was secured from the court.

121,20-1-20,"RSS follows Constitution, does not want to be another power centre: Bhagwat","Stressing that the RSS follows the Constitution, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said the organisation does not have any agenda and it does not want to become another “power centre”.

He was addressing a gathering at Rohilkhand University on the topic ‘Bharat ka Bhavishya: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh kaa Drishtikon’ (Future of India: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s point of view).

“The Sangh follows the Constitution of India. It does not have any agenda and it does not want to become another power centre. A number of misconceptions about the RSS are being spread, and they can be cleared only when it is understood from close

quarters. The Sangh does not have any remote control and it does not want that anyone should function according to it,” he said.

Bhagwat said that if there is a power centre barring the Constitution, the Sangh will oppose it.

Seeking to clear the air over his reported remarks in Moradabad about the implementation of two-child policy, the RSS chief said,

“Due to misunderstanding, some people are saying that the Sangh wants to restrict families to two children. We are of the view that the Government should make a policy on it after deliberation. The policy should be made after getting consent from all sections of the

society.”

He said that when they say that there are 130 crore Hindus in this country, then it does not mean that they want to change anyone’s religion, caste or language.

The RSS chief said that they did not want any power centre apart from the Constitution in which they had faith, and added that

people should build India in a united manner despite the diversity of caste, community and region.

“A handful of people used to come and used to make us slaves. This used to happen because of our shortcomings. Whenever we have forgotten ‘Hindu bhaav’ (Hindu spirit), problems have come,” Bhagwat said. Referring to followers of other religions, he said, “We do not believe in Ram-Krishna, no issues. But despite all these diversities, we all are Hindus. Those whose ancestors were Hindu, they are Hindu still today. “",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/rss-follows-constitution--does-not-want-to-be-another-power-centre--bhagwat.html

Police took the action on Saturday after a video clip of the molestation, shot by the two minor accused, went viral on social media, police said.

The accused driver has been identified as Avinash Shejul (19), an official said.

“Shejul picks up and drops mentally-challenged girls to and from their school at Valadgaon area in Aurangabad. Last week, he picked up the girls from their school.

124,20-1-20,States opposing Act unconstitutional: FM,"Dubbing as “unconstitutional” the stand of some States that the CAA would not be implemented, Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday said all have the responsibility to ensure a law passed by parliament is enforced.

Defending the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, she maintained there was no necessity to mix up the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register with the CAA and appealed to those opposing the act not to make allegations that would lead to unrest among the public.

The Finance Minister also rejected allegations that the Narendra Modi Government was selective in granting citizenship and said Pakistani singer Adnan Sami and over 3,900 others from neighbouring countries had been given citizenship in the last six years.

Speaking at an interactive event here on the controversial CAA organised by the Chennai Citizens’ Forum, she said the resolutions passed by some State Assemblies, including Kerala, against the law was a political statement.

“We can understand that.But saying they will not implement it, then it is against the law. It is unconstitutional to say that... Everybody in this country has the responsibility to implement the law which has been passed in Parliament,” she said.

The Kerala and Punjab Assemblies have adopted resolutions demanding repeal of the CAA which has triggered widespread protests across the country. Kerala Government has also moved the Supreme Court against the law.

Several State Governments, including Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Maharashtra have voiced their disagreement with the CAA, as well as the NRC and the NPR.

Sitharaman said that during the last six years, a total of 2,838 Pakistan nationals, 914 from Afganisthan and 172 from Bangladesh have received Indian citizenship. This included 566 Muslims.

“Besides, 4.61 lakh Tamils from Sri Lanka during the period 1964-2008 have received citizenships,” she said.

“This data is for those who comment that the Government has not given citizenships for Muslims. For example, Adnan Sami, he is a singer of prominence. He received citizenship in 2016 when the same Prime Minister was there then”, she said.

The Minister also pointed to Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen, who has been given residence permit since 2004.

These figures would deny allegations made by the Opposition that this Government was giving citizenship only to some people and not for everyone. “There is no truth in it and that is not the right allegation,” she

said.

Appealing to those who oppose the CAA with folded hands, Sitharaman said if you have any objection speak and raise questions in the Parliament.

“Please do not make any allegations which are not true and that would create unrest among the public”, she said.

Noting that the CAA was a sensitive issue and needed to be handled carefully, she said there was no necessity to link NPR or NRC with this.

“NPR is taken every 10 years and it was not brought in by Modi Government in 2010. It was by the then Home Minister and senior leaders (of Congress),” she said.

They had then spoken in support of NPR, but, were opposing it now, Sitharaman said adding it was not right.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/states-opposing-act-unconstitutional--fm.html
125,20-1-20,Women protest in Assam,"Hundreds of women hit the streets here on Sunday protesting against the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act, even as public rallies were held across the State.

Artistes, journalists, writers and women from other fields joined in large numbers at Latasil playground and marched to Chandmari area of Guwahati and vowed to continue their agitation till the CAA is repealed.

“Women have been at the forefront in Assam protests. Today also we have come out in large numbers for the state. The Government is trying to lure us through various means. But they should withdraw the Act and then all the protests will end,” film actress Barsha Rani Bishaya said.

The Government is stating that five lakh people will benefit through CAA, but the people of Assam are not ready to accept a single Bangladeshi after 1971, she added.

Senior journalist Ratna Bharali Talukdar said: “We will not accept this Act at any cost. It will endanger the culture, identity and history of Assam as well as North East. So, we all have to be united in our fight against this Act.”

In Bengali Hindu dominated Hojai, a huge gathering took place during a protest rally, in which senior journalist Ajit Bhuyan urged people to continue their movement till the “anti-people” Act is withdrawn.

Thousands of people in Tezpur participated in an agitational programme organised by the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) and Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chhatra Parishad (AJYCP).

A large number of people participated in similar protest rallies in Simaluguri, Moran, Duliajan, Nagarbera, Doom Dooma, Rupai, Rangia and many other places.

Sarma, who is also convenor of the NDA’s regional wing North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), said that it is not possible for the person to go back to his country of origin and collect a copy of police report to show that he was subjected to religious persecution.

Assam has been witnessing protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act with the people apprehending that it will hurt their interests.”It is not possible for an applicant to prove that he had been subjected to religious persecution in his country of origin.

Because if he has to prove it, then he has to go to Bangladesh to collect an FIR or police report,” Sarma said after a party function on Saturday.

“You cannot prove fear of religious persecution or religious persecution itself. How can you prove it? Somebody will challenge it.

“That is what my assessment is. You will ask a person to go back to Bangladesh and ask him to collect videographic or photographic evidence of religious persecution?” he asked. The Assam Government has requested the Centre to include submission of evidence by an applicant that he was in the State prior to 2014 in the rules of the CAA, which are under preparation, the NEDA convenor said.

“Our firm view is that in order to prove that you have come to Assam before 2014, you have to prove it through documents like a bank account opened prior to 2014 or name in the electoral roll prior to 2014 or NRC application before 2014,” the BJP leader said.

127,20-1-20,"Cong, TMC, LF betrayed Hindu refugees: BJP","The BJP has slammed the Opposition Trinamool Congress and Left Front for betraying the Hindu refugees from Bangladesh by keeping them in stateless State and batting to the Muslim gallery of infiltrators in order to pursue their dirty vote bank politics.

Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh on Sunday fired a fresh volley of salvos at the TMC, Left and Congress by promising and then keeping the “Hindu refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan deprived of citizenship for the past 70 years.”

And “when Prime Minister Narendra Modi showed the courage of finishing their unfinished job these TMC, Left and Congress people have descended on the streets to protest against the move with the so-called bunch of civil society who are nothing but parasites in their trail.”

Not a single drop tear was shed when the Hindus were tortured, persecuted and hounded out of their mother lands, he said reminding how their ancestors played an important role in the freedom struggle. “Did their ancestors fight for freedom, receive bullets and sacrifice their lives and property so that their successors would be left in a state less situation?” he said recalling how till recently Hindu girls were being lifted at gun point in Pakistan.

“Those who had to leave their home and hearth in Bangladesh are living here like beggars and when the BJP Government is feeling honoured to provide them citizenship Mamata Banerjee, Biman Bose and Adhir Chowdhury are feeling hurt burns…. But come what may we are determined to provide them citizenship,” Ghosh who was reelected to the post of State party president for the second term last week said.

Ghosh on Sunday led two massive rallies (Abhinandan Yatra) in North 24 Parganas congratulating the central government for enacting the Citizenship Amendment Act.

“We know in whose interest Didi and the Left leaders are doing this. We know in whose interest the Chief Minister is walking the streets for the past one month. It is in

the interest on one crore Muslim infiltrators from Bangladesh who form the bulk of her vote bank and but for whose she will lose all the elections. But we will not allow this game anymore,” Ghosh said adding how the Bangladeshi infiltrators were igniting riots and blasting bombs everywhere.

“They have triggered riots and Basirhat, Asansol, Baduria, Uluberia and many other places, they have set up bomb factories which the TMC use during the elections … one after the other accidents occur at bombs factories and the TMC Government call it blast of crackers…. This won’t be tolerated and the infiltrators will have to leave this country,” he said.

Attacking the civil society members including top Bengali cine stars, writers, poets and painters for descending on the streets against CAA he said “these so-called intelligentsia who are nothing but parasites living on the alms of the Government say that they will not show their papers but I warn them that days are coming when they will not be able to show their faces… I ask the people to identify and remember those who are protesting against the CAA for an appropriate time in future.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cong--tmc--lf-betrayed-hindu-refugees--bjp.html

129,20-1-20,Devotees visit Shirdi temple amid Saibaba birthplace row,"Thousands of devotees managed to have darshan of Saibaba amid considerable inconvenience in the temple town of Shirdi in Maharashtra’s Ahmednagar district on Sunday, as the local residents and people from the neighbouring villages resorted to an indefinite bandh over a controversy on the birthplace of the 19th century saint.

Despite the bandh called by the local residents and people from 30 villages surrounding villages, the Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust (SSST) has decided to keep the famous temple open for the visiting devotees. “The devotees are free to take darshan of Saibaba, while prasadalaya and accommodation facilities, will continue to operate as normal,” SSST’s CEO Deepak Muglikar said.

Being a Sunday, there were huge crowds of devotees at the temple queuing up for darshan. However, with shops, hotels and all other establishments remaining closed in the temple town, the devotees were inconvenienced. “Because of the bandh, we have made more than adequate arrangements for food and accommodation for the devotees,” Muglikar said.

The people of Shirdi and neighbouring 30 villages have for the past few days staging protests against Chief

Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s announcement to develop Pathri village in Parbhani district of Marathwada region as the birthplace of Saibaba, a decision that they fear will erode the importance of their town associated all along with the memories of Saibaba.

Taking cognisance of the protests by the people of Shirdi against the State Government’s decision to develop Pathri as birthplace of Saibaba, the Chief Minister has called a meeting with the leaders of the aggrieved people in Mumbai on Monday. At Monday’s meeting, Uddhav is expected to clarify the State Government’s stand on the issue and request the people of Shirdi to call off their agitation.

The raging controversy over the birthplace of Saibaba should be seen in the context of that a delegation of people from Pathri village had met the chief minister, during the latter’s recent tour of Marathwada. They had claimed that Pathri was the birthplace of the 19th century saint revered by people of different communities and urged the chief minister to make financial allocation for developing the place into a pilgrim centre.

During his interaction with the delegation, the chief minister had announced that the state government had prepared a development plan for Pathri and it would soon perform a bhoomi pooja for developing a pilgrim centre there.

Following the announcement, the people of Shirdi and neighbouring villages have gone on an agitation against the state government’s Pathri development move. What has surprised as to how the claim of Pathri being birthplace of Saibaba has come up all of a sudden. Though there is not much of evidence or documentation as to the date or place of borth of Saibaha, available historical evidence suggests that he came to Shirdi when he was about 16 years’ old in 1858 and he remained there till his death in 1918.

Three months ahead of his death on October 15, 1918, Saibaba told his devotees he would soon be “leaving his mortal body” (dying). By the end of September 1918, he had high fever and stopped eating. As his condition deteriorated, he asked his disciples to recite holy texts to him and continued to meet visitors. On 15 October 1918 which happened to Vijayadashami, he breathed his last.

His mortal remains were interred at “Buti Wada” in Shirdi, after which it has now become place of worship known today as Shree Samadhi Mandir or Shirdi Sai Baba Temple.

The claim that Saibaba was born in Pathri village in Parbhani district of Marathwada region is based on a reference made in the eighth edition of “Sai Charitra” (history of Saibaba), a Hindi publication brought by the Sai Sansthan between 1972 and 76. So far, the Sai Sansthan has brought out 36 editions of “Sai Charitra”.

“The reference to Saibaba being born in Pathri village has been made in the eighth edition. Incidentally, this edition has gone missing. We have ordered an inquiry into the missing edition of Rs Sai Charitra’,” a leading Marathi television channel reportedly quoted SSST’s chairman Dr. Suresh Kashinath Haware as saying.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/devotees-visit-shirdi-temple-amid-saibaba-birthplace-row.html

Also, he urged them to focus on issues of public good that need immediate attention rather than instigating people for petty reasons on such emotive issues that have already been decided upon.

The Karnataka and Maharashtra border issue has already been settled by the Mahajan commission report, so they(political leaders) should stop repeatedly instigating the people on the issue with political motive,”Ashwathnarayan told reporters here.

He said, We all are Indians, boundaries between States have been fixed and decided upon. Instead of repeatedly dwelling on the issue, there are many good work to do. There are no boundaries for humanity and good work...”

“... Sanjay Raut (Shiv Sena leader) raking up such an issue is making things awkward for himself,” he added.

Ashwathnarayanwas reacting to visits by Shiv Sena leaders Raut and Maharashtra Minister of State Rajendra Patil Yadravkars to Belagavi allegedly with an intention to bring the border issue up.

Raut, during his visit to Belgagavi, has reportedly said the 70-year-old border issue between two States can be resolved by a ‘strong’ Union Home Minister like Amit Shah, who abrogated Article 370 related to Jammu & Kashmir.

He said the chief Ministers of Maharashtra and Karnataka and NCP supremo Sharad Pawar should meet to resolve demands of Marathi-speaking people of Belagavi and nearby areas.

Last month, Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa had declared that not even an inch of the State’s land would be given away and accused his Maharashtra counterpart Uddhav Thackeray of stoking the Belagavi issue for political gains, as there were protests by the ruling Shiv Sena workers.

Maharashtra claims the border district of Belagavi was part of the erstwhile Bombay Presidency, but is currently a district of Karnataka, on linguistic grounds.

Uddhav Thackeray had, in December, appointed ministers Chhagan Bhujbal and Eknath Shinde as co-coordinators to oversee his government’s efforts to expedite the case relating to the boundary dispute with Karnataka.

The Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES), which has been fighting in the border areas of Belagavi for the merger of 800-odd villages with Maharashtra, had also recently submitted a memorandum of their demands to Uddhav Thackeray.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/k---taka-dy-cm-flays-shiv-sena-leaders.html

133,20-1-20,Shivpal launches veiled attack on Mulayam for siding with Akhilesh,"Former UP Minister and president of Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party Shivpal Yadav on Sunday launched a veiled attack on his brother and SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav for siding with his son Akhilesh Yadav and said that he was not going to look back.

Shivpal, who has never been openly critical of his brother before, said he had formed his party “only with the consent” of Mulayam.

He was answering a reporter’s question on whether Mulayam betrayed him by being seen more with his son these days.

“The Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party was formed only with the consent of Mulayam Singh Yadav. Why is Mulayam today standing with Akhilesh, its answer can be given by him (Mulayam) alone. But this is certain that I will not look back,” he said.

Mulayam was seen with his son at the SP headquarters in Lucknow on Saturday when former chief of Hindu Yuva Vahini (HYV) Sunil Singh, once considered close to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, joined the Samajwadi Party.Shivpal said that his efforts will be to unite people who believe in the

philosophy of Ram Manohar Lohia, Chaudhary Charan Singh and Mahatma Gandhi.

The PSP chief said that he always gave respect to Mulayam, who is also his elder brother, and listened to everything he said.

“Not giving importance to what Mulayam said led to the split of the Samajwadi Party in 2018. This is the reason that the SP could not form the Government in UP again, otherwise Akhilesh would have been the Chief Minister,” Shivpal said.

Shivpal had formed his new party in October 2018 after parting ways with the Samajwadi Party.

Simmering discontent in the Yadav family came to the fore in January 2017 when Akhilesh became the national president of the party by replacing Mulayam. Shivpal lost the battle for control of the party for which the uncle and nephew were fighting since August 2016 when Akhilesh was the Chief Minister and he was a key minister in then SP Government.

Replying to another another question, Shivpal discounted the possibility of entering into any alliance with the BJP.

“From the BJP side, there were talks about coordination, but we did not enter into any sort of alliance,” he added. PTI",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/shivpal-launches-veiled-attack-on-mulayam-for-siding-with-akhilesh.html

“It is not right... There are no issues, he said. Asked whether he would travel to Delhi to meet Shah after returning from Davos, Yediyurappa merely said, “It is natural for me to meet Amit Shah.”

According to the Chief Ministers tour programme, he will be back in the city on January 24.

Yediyurappa, along with Union Ministers Piyush Goyal and Mansukh Mandaviya, as well as Chief Ministers Amarinder Singh of Punjab and Kamal Nath of Madhya Pradesh, are among those expected to join over 100 Indian CEOs at Davos in the coming days for the WEF’s 50th annual meeting.

investments to the state, he said interactions have been fixed with 38 industrialists and investors.

“There is a large

possibility of investments coming to the state from meetings during the WEF meet. I will assure industrialists and investors that the government will give all necessary facilities within our limits and also clear all the doubts that they have,” the Chief Minister said.

He said employment opportunities in Karnataka would increase due to all these efforts.

Claiming that the economic situation in Karnataka was stable despite the global economic slowdown, he said the state was also organising the Global Investors Meet in November to attract industries and create employment opportunities.

The delegation led by Yediyurappa includes Industries Minister Jagadish Shattar, Chief Secretary T M Vijaya Bhaskar and top officials of the state government.

The Chief Minister,who was anxiously waiting for the high command’s nod to expand his ministry amid intense lobbying by the aspirants, was keen on getting approval for it from Shah, but was asked to visit Delhi after returning from Davos, party sources said.

They also said that with J P Nadda all set to take over as BJP National President, he would have final discussions with Yediyurappa on the Ministry expansion exercise.

S R Vishwanath,Political Secretarytothe Chief Minister too said that Yediyurappa would go to Delhi after his return from Davos and immediately expand the Ministry.

He said the Chief Minister has been asked to hold discussions with Nadda, who is currently BJPs National Working President and finalise things.

As the Chief Minister has already made it clear that 11 of the disqualified JDS-Congress MLAs who got re-elected in the bypolls on BJP tickets will be made ministers, lobbying has been on in the party for the remaining ministerial berths.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/had-discussions-with-shah-on-cabinet-expansion--bsy.html

137,20-1-20,NCST to ask C’garh to probe if refugee resettlement led to changes in tribal areas,"The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) will ask the Chhattisgarh Government to probe if the resettlement of Bangladeshi refugees has led to demographic changes in tribal areas, according to officials.

It will also ask the Chhattisgarh Government to probe complaints of the refugees “displacing” a large number of tribals from their land in the Bastar region and “inflicting atrocities” on them, an NCST official told PTI.

A number of tribal representatives raised these issues during the commission’s visit to the State last month, the official said.

“The Government resettled a large number of Bengali refugees, who came to India from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) after Partition, in Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and the Northeast under the Dandakaranya project that started in 1958. Many more came after the 1971 India-Pakistan War,” the official said.

In Chhattisgarh, the Bengali refugees were resettled in the Bastar region, especially Kanker district.

“During our visit to Chhattisgarh, tribal representatives claimed that the influx of refugees over the years has led to demographic changes in tribal areas,” the official said.

The commission has also received complaints about the refugees “displacing a large number of tribals from their land and inflicting atrocities on them”, he said.

NCST chairman Nand Kumar Sai said, “The matter pertains to the Bastar region. We have told the Chhattisgarh government that it is a serious issue and a thorough investigation is needed.”

“Tribal areas are special areas as per the Constitution and a demographic change is a serious threat to the rights of the indigenous people,” he said. The commission will ask the State Government to furnish the number of Bangladeshi refugees resettled in the State initially and their current population.

“The State Government will be asked to find out if the number of refugees has exceeded the tribal population, and how many cases of Bangladeshi refugees displacing tribals from their land have been reported,” the official said.

The commission has apprised Chhattisgarh Governor Anusuiya Uikey, who has also served as the vice-chairperson of the NCST in the past, of the issue, another official said.

When contacted, Chhattisgarh’s Scheduled Tribes Department Secretary DD Singh said, “The commission has informed us that certain issues have surfaced during their visit to the state and that they are preparing a report. We are awaiting a formal communication from the NSCT.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ncst-to-ask-c---garh-to-probe-if-refugee-resettlement--led-to-changes-in-tribal-areas.html

Addressing a gathering at MP Inter College ground here as part of a public awareness campaign being run by the BJP on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, he alleged that after Independence, the Left parties had lied a lot to mislead the people and now the Congress and the Samajwadi Party were doing the same thing.

“The Citizenship (Amendment) Act is not a law against any citizen of India. It is against those intruders who are responsible for terrorism, extremism and separatism. The country is being ripped apart due to propaganda against CAA, and this is being done by keeping women at the forefront,” Adityanath said.

“We cannot remain silent. It is our constitutional obligation to reach out to people regarding the issue. Citizenship law was made during Nehru’s time, but now the Congress is not ready to accept it. The conduct of the Congress and SP is condemnable and irresponsible. These parties have financed the miscreants for opposing the CAA,” he said.

The way people of the country understood the lies of the Left and have buried them forever, on the same lines, these parties are also standing at the fag end of their political ladder, Adityanath said, adding the Congress was “unable to accept a new India”.

“The citizenship law gave the Congress an opportunity to repent for its sin, but it missed this chance. In support of this law, we all should write a postcard and greet Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” the Chief Minister said.

148,20-1-20,"Sorry, but I was misquoted: NITI member","NITI Aayog member VK Saraswat, who courted controversy with his remarks that the shutdown of internet services in Jammu & Kashmir did not have any significant effect on its economy as people there only use it for “watching dirty films”, on Sunday apologised for his utterance.

“I have been quoted out of context. If this misquotation has hurt the feelings of the people of Kashmir, I apologise and would not like them to carry this impression that I am against the rights of the Kashmiris to have internet access,” Saraswat maintained.

His comments defending the suspension of internet in J&K drew strong reaction from trade body Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) which demanded his immediate removal for uttering “this nonsense”, while CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury also hit out at Saraswat, saying he needs to read the Indian Constitution.

Saraswat made the controversial remarks in Gujarat’s Gandhinagar on Saturday after attending the convocation of the Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology.

“What difference does it make if there’s no internet there? What do you watch on internet there? What e-tailing is happening there? Besides watching dirty films, you do nothing there,” he told reporters on a query about suspension of Internet services in Jammu and Kashmir over five months ago following abrogation of its special status.

“If there is no internet in Kashmir, it does not have any significant effect on the economy,” he said.

He also said internet services were suspended in Jammu & Kashmir to prevent certain elements from “misusing” information that could affect law and order situation there.

“If Article 370 had to be removed, and if Kashmir had to be taken forward, we knew there were elements there which will misuse this kind of information in a manner that will affect the law and order situation,” he said.

Condemning Saraswat’s remarks, KCCI president Sheikh Ashiq said it is unbecoming of a person entrusted with serious responsibilities to make such statements that “malign the population of Kashmir”. Ashiq said the Valley is suffering due to the internet shutdown and the losses to the business sector here have amounted to over Rs 18,000 crore.

The KCCI recently submitted a detailed report about the business losses in the Kashmir valley to Lieutenant Governor GC Murmu and Union minister of Commerce Piyush Goyal as well as MoS PMO Jitendra Singh.

Internet services, landline and mobile phones were snapped across Jammu and Kashmir on the eve of Centre’s announcement to scrap special status of the erstwhile state and its bifurcation into Union Territories on August 5.

While tagging Saraswat’s remarks, Yechury said on Twitter: “This man is a member of the NITI Aayog. He needs to read the Indian Constitution to update himself, and can start with the Preamble. There are numerous anti-CAA/NRC protests in every town and city across the country, and he will easily come across the Preamble in them.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sorry--but-i-was-misquoted--niti-member.html

We have also submitted a series of proposals for their development,” he said inaugurating the 42nd Kokborok language day here.

The Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TAADC) constitutes two-third of the state's territory and is home to the tribals, who constitute 32 per cent of the state's population.

Deb later told reporters that a private members resolution to increase the number of seats in the TTAADC from 30 to 50 was passed unanimously in the Assembly on Friday, The State Government is also considering to hand over 42 departments to the TTADC administration.

151,20-1-20,Steel industry seeks duty cut on key raw materials in Budget,"The domestic steel industry is seeking reduction in basic customs duty on key raw materials such as coking coal, pet coke, limestone and dolomite in the upcoming Budget.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the Budget for financial year 2020-21 on February 1.

“Anthracite coal, coking coal, coke, limestone, dolomite are vital inputs for the steel industry. The availability of these items in good quality is declining in the country and the industry has to depend on imports on regular basis,” industry body Ficci said in its Budget recommendations for Indian steel sector.

The basic customs import duty on anthracite coal is 2.5 per cent. Since ferro alloy industry plays a vital role in steel manufacturing, it is necessary to make available these reductants at international competitive price to make Indian steel mills more competitive, it said while recommending that customs duty on anthracite coal be reduced to zero from 2.5 per cent.

Met coke, another vital input for the industry, had always attracted lower and concessional rate of customs duty, it said.

However, the basic customs duty was enhanced from 2.5 per cent to 5 per cent with effect from March 1, 2015. Additionally, anti-dumping duty was also imposed on its imports with effect from November 25, 2016.

“As a result, the cost of this (met coke) vital input in steel manufacturing has gone up necessitating increase in price of steel which is acting as deterrence to the competitiveness of domestic products in international markets vis-à-vis similar products of other countries like China,” it said.

“Moreover, high inputs costs have led to an inverted duty structure in the domestic industry and are acting as a deterrent to government’s Make in India initiative, as domestic producers have less incentive to import met coke. Rather, imports of finished steel goods are preferred,” it said and suggested that duty on metallurgical coke be reduced to zero.

The industry body said exemption available to coking coal was also removed by the government in 2014-15 Budget by bringing it at par with other types of coal and imposing 2.5 per cent basic customs duty.

This amendment has adversely affected steel manufacturers in India. Coking coal is one of the principal raw materials used in steel manufacturing and predominantly used for making coke for use in steel making and thus forms a major part of the final price of the steel, it said.

“Levy of 2.5 per cent of duty on coking coal and simultaneously fixing the import duty of 5 per cent on coke has adversely affected the costing of steel. It is requested to restore the exemption of nil rate of duty allowed earlier to coking coal without any technical definition of coking coal,” it said.

Ficci also recommended zero customs duty on steel grade limestone and dolomite as increase in steel production has led to rising demand for SMS (steel melting shop) and BF (blast furnace) grade limestone.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/steel-industry-seeks-duty-cut-on-key-raw-materials-in-budget.html

154,20-1-20,DoT examining if Jan 23 legal deadline for AGR payment applies to non-telecom PSUs,"The telecom department is examining the legal applicability of January 23 deadline for payment of over Rs 2.4 lakh crore statutory dues in the case of non-telecom PSUs which were not originally party to AGR matter in the Supreme Court, according to sources.

Sources in the Department of Telecom (DoT) told PTI that while the PSUs too have been asked to make payments related to statutory liabilities (after the SC in October upheld government’s position on calculation of non-core revenue for AGR dues), the larger question is whether the January 23 deadline is legally enforceable on state-owned companies that were not direct party to the dispute.

The current view that is emerging in the DoT appears to be that the court-imposed timeline may not apply to PSUs, but the matter is being legally examined for clarity.

“Of course, the court has decided the issue of principle of what is AGR, so they (PSUs) have to pay but if they do not pay by January 23 it will not be contempt as it will be in case of the parties to the case. So PSUs have to pay and we have raised demands, but if they do not pay by January 23 it will not amount to contempt of court on their part because they were not party to the case, but they have to pay,” a source added.

155,20-1-20,Interim dividend issue may come up in next RBI’s board meeting,"The issue of interim dividend may come up for discussion in the next Reserve Bank board meeting as the government struggles to meet its ambitious fiscal deficit target of 3.3 per cent amid revenue shortfall, sources said.

Government finances have come under pressure due to moderation in revenue collection and a slew of measures taken to lift growth from over six-year-low of 4.5 per cent in the second quarter of the current fiscal.

As per the government’s estimate, the country’s GDP growth is seen dipping to an 11-year low of 5 per cent in the current fiscal as compared to 6.8 per cent in 2018-19.

There would be at least one board meeting of RBI before this fiscal comes to an end, the issue of interim dividend could be raised by government nominee directors in the meeting, sources said.

However, the board meeting would be preceded by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman customary address to the central board of RBI to explain vision of the Budget to be presented on February 1. This traditional exercise takes places a few days after the Budget presentation every year.

According to sources, it has been an exceptional year during which several extra-ordinary measures including slashing corporate tax rate outside Budget were announced putting government finances under stress.

If the RBI board agrees to interim dividend based on their six-month performance, it would provide some financial relief to the government, sources added.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) follows July to June financial year.

The RBI largely earns profits through its trading of currencies and government bonds. Part of these earnings are set aside by the RBI for its operational and contingency needs while the rest is transferred to the government in the form of dividend.

In the past, the government has taken the route of seeking interim dividend from the RBI to balance its account. Last fiscal, the RBI paid Rs 28,000 crore as interim dividend. During 2017-18, the government received Rs 10,000 crore as interim dividend from the central bank.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/interim-dividend-issue-may-come-up-in-next-rbi---s-board-meeting.html

The statement assumes significance in view of recent developments in the sector where the government recently brought an ordinance to amend laws to open up coal mining to firms other than those in the steel and power sectors, removing restrictions on end-use of the fuel.

Terming the promulgation of the ordinance as “one of the major reforms”, the coal minister in an interview to PTI said that “whatever the substitutable shortfall is there...We want to achieve it in the coming three-four years.

157,20-1-20,Investment in equity MFs drops 41% to Rs 75K cr in 2019,"Investors pumped in nearly Rs 75,000 crore in equity-oriented mutual fund schemes in 2019, a sharp plunge of 41 per cent from the preceding year, mainly hit by extreme market volatility amid slowing economic growth.

Experts, however, are of the view that equity schemes will attract investor interest this year as the market is expected to perform well.

“While volatility in the market may continue for some more time going forward, we believe investors will want to benefit from this volatility and use it to create and growth their wealth. As we expect industry inflows to rise, we believe that all categories of mutual funds including equity funds to see a steady rise in flows,” said Ashwani Bhatia, MD and CEO at SBI Mutual Fund.

According to data with Association of Mutual funds in India (Amfi) equity and equity-linked saving schemes (ELSS) attracted an inflow of Rs 74,870 crore in 2019, much lower than Rs 1.2 lakh crore seen in 2018.

In 2017, such schemes had witnessed an impressive inflow of around Rs 1.33 lakh crore as compared to Rs 51,000 crore in 2016.

Equity schemes have seen a little bit of a slowdown in 2019 as compared to the past few years because of extremely volatile markets, L&T Mutual Fund chief Kailash Kulkarni said.

The pace of inflows in equity funds tapered off towards the end of the year with the inflow in such schemes hitting a 41-month low of Rs 1,312 crore in November as investors did not see the index returns in their own funds. Besides, weakness in the mid and small-cap space dented the investor confidence, said Vidya Bala, co-founder of Primeinvestor.In.

Equity flows have two components — systematic investment plan (SIP) and non-SIP. Flows through SIPs have consistently grown over the years and have touched more than Rs 8,000 crore on a monthly basis, while the non SIP flows are volatile based on the investor’s need for money and view on the market.

Overall, fund houses have garnered Rs 82,453 crore through SIPs — a preferred route for retail investors to invest in mutual funds as it helps them reduce market timing risk.

The industry added over 9.55 lakh SIP accounts each month in the year with an average SIP size of about Rs 2,850 per SIP account.

“SIPs have been the bedrock of equity flows and we think this will continue to the case in the coming year too. As and when there is are greater signs of economic turnaround, we can see equity flows surge further through lumpsum flows,” Kaustubh Belapurkar, Director Manager Research at Morningstar Investment Adviser India said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/investment-in-equity-mfs-drops-41--to-rs-75k-cr-in-2019.html

Vijayan, addressing a massive anti-CAA rally, made it clear that the Left-ruled state would never implement the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR).

“Many people had doubts when Kerala declared that we will not implement the CAA. We all need to understand that all laws of the country must be in accordance with the Constitution. If a law is ultra vires, it won't stand,” he said.

“We are required to implement the matters concerned with the Constitution of the country and not the whims and fancies of the RSS,” Vijayan said.

The agitation across the country was to protect the Indian Constitution and secularism.

“We have seen such protests during the independence struggle. We are witnessing a similar uprising now. Kerala is united in this fight. The joint protest organised by the ruling and opposition fronts of the state gave out a strong message to the whole country that we are united,” the Left leader said.

Kerala would continue its fight to uphold the Constitution, but would keep away the communal forces and the extremists from the movement, he said.

“To those in the state who are worried about the CAA, I would like to tell them, fear not. Worry not. You are living in one of the most secure places. You are living in a fort. The name of the fort is Kerala. There is no reason to worry here. The state government will stand by you,” Vijayan said.

The chief minister came down on the Oppostion Congress-led UDF, which has decided not to participate in joint protests with the LDF against the CAA, and said some “narrow-minded” people never want to join hands.

162,20-1-20,Converge all corporate tax rates to 15% in Budget: CII,"The Confederation of Indian Industry has urged the Centre to converge multiple corporate tax rates to 15 per cent by April 2023 without any exemptions, and make the announcement in the upcoming Budget to facilitate investment decisions.

“The Union Budget could announce a roadmap for convergence of all corporate tax rates to 15 per cent, with no exemptions and incentives,

by April 1, 2023. A signaling to this effect could help further boost investor sentiment and encourage investments,” CII President Vikram Kirloskar said.

According to the industry body, the desired impact of the reduction in corporate taxes on the ground is still far from satisfactory.

It said one of the reasons behind this has been the multitude of tax rates, which have created tax rate inequalities across manufacturing and service sectors.

The government last year reduced corporate tax rates to 22 per cent, plus surcharge and cess. However, companies will not be allowed to avail any tax exemptions or incentives.

Further, manufacturing facilities that start production before 31 March 2023 and are incorporated on or after 1st October 2019 would be taxed at only 15 per cent, plus surcharge and cess.

The new rates have catapulted India to a very competitive position against many of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) and BRICS countries, and others like Indonesia and Philippines.

Over time, the lower rates will reduce the cost of capital and catalyse investments.

The announcement of convergence of all these rates to a single rate of 15 per cent by 2023 will provide a line of sight to industry and investors to take decisions now, CII said.

163,20-1-20,Govt considering specific excise duty on ATF,"With no sight of including jet fuel in Goods and Services Tax (GST) in near future, the government is considering levying specific rate of excise duty on aviation turbine fuel (ATF) in place of current ad valorem rates to insulate its prices from cascading effect in times of volatile prices.

ATF presently is chargeable at 11 per cent ad valorem rate of excise duty.

Concessional rate of 2 per cent is applicable for ATF sold under Regional Connectivity Scheme. Ad valorem rate means that the impact of an increase in price of the fuel because of global rate hike translates into an even higher price for airlines as the tax incidence also rises.

To insulate airlines from such volatility, the government may in the forthcoming Budget for 2020-21 fiscal year may bring specific excise duty expressed in Rs per kilolitre, sources aware of the development said.

Petrol and diesel already attract a specific rate of excise duty and so ATF naturally qualifies for such a shift, they said.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present her second budget on February 1.

Explaining the duty structure, sources said if cost of production of ATF is Rs 100 per kilolitre, the fuel at exit from the refinery will be priced at Rs 111 per kilolitre after levying 11 per cent excise duty. If the cost rises to Rs 110, the ex-refinery rate would attract an excise duty of Rs 12. A specific duty of say Rs 11 per kilolitre would mean that even if the cost goes up the tax incidence would remain the same.

Petrol and diesel already attract specific excise duty for the same purpose. Excise duty on petrol currently is Rs 21.16 per litre and that on diesel is Rs 15.83 a litre.

This, they said, would ensure correct payment of duty at the initial clearance stage itself and will eliminate complexities and difficulties in redetermination of duty on further stock transfers which sometime result in avoidable litigation.

Specific excise duty would address part of the concerns of oil companies and airlines of not being able to set of tax paid on inputs against the tax on final product as ATF has been kept out of GST regime.

When the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was introduced on July 1, 2017 amalgamating 17 central and state levies, five commodities namely crude oil, natural gas, petrol, diesel, and ATF were kept out of its purview given the revenue dependence of state governments on this sector.

Under the existing structure, both natural gas and ATF attract the Centre’s excise duty and a state’s value-added tax (VAT). Both these and all other levies will get subsumed under GST if they are brought under its ambit.

The decision on their inclusion depends on the financial position of States as revenues from these five petroleum products constitute a substantial chunk of state government finances.

The aviation ministry has time and again sought inclusion of ATF under GST as any surge in international oil rates gets reflected in domestic jet fuel prices, leading to costlier air tickets. Oil Ministry too has favoured including ATF along with natural gas under the GST regime to help companies set off tax that they paid on input.

ATF makes up for almost half of the cost of an airline and rates vary from state to state depending on local VAT.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-considering-specific-excise-duty-on-atf.html

165,20-1-20,Air India unions to demand voluntary retirement scheme,"Air India trade unions are likely to demand a VRS package at their second meeting with Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri in New Delhi on Monday.

The minister is set to meet over a dozen Air India unions, including unrecognised ones, on Monday for the second time in a month over the airline’s privatisation plans.

The government is planning to float Expression of Interest (EoI) for selling its entire 100 per cent stake in the loss-making flag carrier some time next week.

At the first meeting on January 2, the minister had made it clear that privatisation was the only option before the Government to keep the airline afloat and sought employees cooperation in carrying out the disinvestment process.

Puri had also told the unions that he will call them again after the meeting of the ministerial panel on Air India disinvestment.

“Initially, we were told that Government would protect our jobs if airline gets privatised and therefore we did not think about voluntary retirement.

“But off late, our members have been approaching us and want us to discuss a voluntary retirement scheme package with the government as it is expected that our job will be protected only for one year post privatisation. We are going to raise this issue at the meeting with the minister on Monday,” an airline source told PTI.

The source said that if the government agrees “in-principle” on their demand, the unions will work out the contours of the VRS package, including the service cut-off period and the quantum of monetary compensation.

167,20-1-20,80 Yemeni soldiers killed as Huthis attack mosque,"More than 80 Yemeni soldiers have been killed and scores injured in a missile and drone attack blamed on Huthi rebels in central Yemen, medical and military sources said Sunday.

Saturday’s strike follows months of relative calm in the war between the Iran-backed Huthis and Yemen’s internationally recognised government, which is backed by a Saudi-led military coalition.

The Huthis attacked a mosque in a military camp in the central province of Marib — about 170 kilometres (105 miles) east of the capital Sanaa — during evening prayers, military sources told AFP.

A medical source at a Marib city hospital, where the casualties were transported, said that 83 soldiers were killed and 148 injured in the strike.

Death tolls in Yemen’s grinding conflict are often disputed, but the huge toll in Marib represents one of the bloodiest single attacks since the war erupted in 2014 when the rebels seized Sanaa.

The drone and missile strike came a day after coalition-backed government forces launched a large-scale operation against the Huthis in the Nihm region, north of Sanaa.

Fighting in Nihm was ongoing on Sunday, a military source said according to the official Saba news agency.

“Dozens from the (Huthi) militia were killed and injured,” the source added. Yemeni President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi condemned the “cowardly and terrorist” attack on the mosque, Saba reported.

“The disgraceful actions of the Huthi militia without

a doubt confirm its unwillingness to (achieve) peace, because it knows nothing

but death and destruction

and is a cheap Iranian tool in the region,” it quoted Hadi as saying.

The president also stressed the importance of increasing military vigilance “to foil hostile and destructive plans and maintain security and stability”.

The Huthis did not make any immediate claim of responsibility and the Saba report did not give a death toll.

The uptick in violence comes shortly after United Nations envoy Martin Griffiths welcomed a sharp reduction in air strikes and the movement of ground forces.

“We are surely, and I hope this is true and I hope it will remain so, witnessing one of the quietest periods of this conflict,” he said in a briefing to the UN Security Council on Thursday.

“Experience, however, tells us that military de-escalation cannot be sustained without political progress between the parties, and this has become the next challenge.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/80-yemeni-soldiers-killed-as-huthis-attack-mosque.html
168,20-1-20,Officers beaten after police disband HK democracy rally,"Two police officers were beaten bloody by pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong on Sunday as violence erupted at a rally calling for greater democratic freedoms in the heart of the city.

Trouble flared when police ordered the authorised gathering to disperse after officers conducting stop and searches on nearby streets had water bottles and paint thrown at them by angry crowds.

A group of plainclothes officers who were speaking with organisers were then set upon by masked protesters, who beat them with umbrellas and sticks, an AFP reporter on the scene said.

Two officers were seen with bloody head wounds as colleagues shielded them from further attacks.

“We strongly condemn all the rioters and violent acts,” police spokesman Ng Lok-chun told reporters.

Video posted online showed an organiser with a microphone asking the officers to show their warrant cards which they did not do, a frequent gripe among protesters.

Rally organiser Ventus Lau said he believed police should “shoulder the greatest responsibility for the clashes” because they took too long to show their warrant cards.

Lau was later arrested for obstructing officers, police and rally organisers confirmed.

Soon after the officers were attacked, riot police swept into the area and fired tear gas to disperse the crowds.

Brief cat and mouse clashes ensued with police making multiple arrests, including one protester who had blood streaming from the back of his head.

Hong Kong’s protests have raged for seven months after being sparked by a now-abandoned proposal to allow extraditions to the authoritarian mainland, where the opaque legal system answers to the Communist Party.

169,20-1-20,Iran backtracks on plan to send flight recorders to Ukraine,"The Iranian official leading the investigation into the Ukrainian jetliner that was accidentally shot down by the Revolutionary Guard appeared to backtrack Sunday on plans to send the flight recorders abroad for analysis, a day after saying they would be sent to Kyiv.

Hassan Rezaeifar was quoted by the state-run IRNA news agency as saying “the flight recorders from the Ukrainian Boeing are in Iranian hands and we have no plans to send them out.” He said Iran is working to recover the data and cabin recordings, and that it may send the flight recorders — commonly known as black boxes — to Ukraine or France. “But as of yet, we have made no decision.” The same official was quoted by the semi-official Tasnim news agency on Saturday as saying the recorders would be sent to Ukraine, where French, American and Canadian experts would help analyze them. Iranian officials previously said the black boxes were damaged but are usable.

It was not immediately possible to reconcile the conflicting accounts. Iran may be hesitant to turn over the recorders for fear that more details from the crash — including the harrowing 20 seconds between when the first and second surface-to-air missiles hit the plane — will come to light.

The Guard’s air defenses shot the plane down shortly after it took off from Tehran on Jan. 8, killing all 176 people on board. Hours earlier, the Guard had launched ballistic missiles at U.S. Troops in Iraq in response to the U.S. Airstrike that killed Iran’s top general in Baghdad. Officials say lower-level officers mistook the plane for a U.S. Cruise missile.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/iran-backtracks-on-plan-to-send-flight-recorders-to-ukraine.html

The deal, which comes into effect by spring in a few weeks’ time, means the couple will no longer be representing the Queen in an official capacity.

“The Sussexes will not use their HRH titles as they are no longer working members of the royal family,” Buckingham Palace said in a statement on Saturday night.

173,20-1-20,Commerce Ministry for restricting duty-free alcohol purchase to one bottle,"The Commerce Ministry has recommended restricting purchase of tax-free alcohol to one bottle at duty-free shops as part of steps to reduce import of non-essential goods, sources said.

The ministry has also recommended to its finance counterpart that purchase of cigarette cartons at duty-free shops should be prohibited, they said.

These recommendations are part of proposals made by the commerce ministry for the forthcoming Budget, which would be unveiled by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1.

Currently inbound international passengers are allowed to buy two litres of alcohol and a carton of cigarette from these shops.

According to sources, there are countries that allow only one litre of liquor to international passengers and the same practice can be adopted in India.

This suggestion assumes significance as the Government is looking at various ways to curtail import of non-essential goods into the country to rein in trade deficit.

A duty-free shop is where an inbound international passenger can generally purchase goods worth about Rs 50,000 without paying any import duty. The commerce ministry has also suggested increase in customs duty on several products like paper, footwear, rubber items and toys to promote ‘Make in India’ and boost manufacturing growth, sources said.

The ministry has proposed rationalisation of basic customs or import duty on over 300 items from different sectors, including furniture, chemicals, rubber, coated paper and paper boards.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/commerce-ministry-for-restricting-duty-free-alcohol-purchase-to-one-bottle.html

175,20-1-20,Restricting Huawei in 5G may cause min GDP loss of $4.7 bn to India by 2035: Study,"Blocking Huawei from rolling out 5G technology may cause loss of up to $63 billion in the GDP of top eight technology markets, and at least $4.7 billon in case of India, by 2035, a report of Oxford Economics commissioned by the chinese telecom gear maker has claimed.

The US and Australia have blocked Huawei from deploying 5G infrastructure alleging security concerns and several other markets including Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the UK Governments have announced they are either considering exclusion or have imposed partial restrictions.

The Chinese telecom firm, however, has been allowed to participate in 5G trials in India and the Indian government has not taken any stand yet to bar the company from building 5G network. The report compiled in December 2019 estimates three impact scenario based on low, medium and high-cost 5G gear deployment in the eight technology market covered in the study and projected that the investment cost in India will increase in the range of 8 per cent to 27 per cent and GDP may suffer loss in the range of $4.7 billion to $27.8 billion in case Huawei is restricted in the country.

“Lower economic growth due to delays in 5G rollout and the associated slower technological growth reduces GDP by between $4.7 billion and $27.8 billion in 2035,” the study said.

Oxford Economics has assumed that in low cost scenario 5G will be only used for enhancing broadband speed and support access to content that will require high bandwidth. In medium scenario, 5G will be used to deploy internet-of-things infrastructure where all machines can be controlled using internet while high cost scenario will see use of 5G in transport like driverless cars, healthcare, energy etc.

In the medium technology cost scenario, Oxford Economics estimated that restricting competition in the network infrastructure market may significantly reduce economic growth in India over the next 15 years.

“We estimate this could reduce GDP in 2035 by $15.5 billion,” the report said.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India in one of its reports mentioned that 5G is expected to be launched in India by 2020 and is predicted to create a cumulative economic impact of $1 trillion in India by 2035.

Oxford Economics said that in medium infrastructure cost scenario restriction on Huawei could increase the cost of building the 5G network by $500 million per year over the next decade, $200 million additional in low-cost scenario and $700 million per year in high cost scenario.

“This increase in prices would translate into delays in rollout. We estimate that these delays would leave between 15.9 million and 45.3 million more people (1.1 to 3.2 per cent of the population) without access to 5G by 2023,” the study said.

The government is planning to conduct spectrum auction by April after which companies will have access to airwaves that can be used for rolling out 5G services.

According to Oxford Economics, Huawei leads the eight markets in 4G revenues covered in the study with 29 per cent market share followed by Ericsson with 27 per cent share and Nokia with 25 per cent.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/restricting-huawei-in-5g-may-cause-min-gdp-loss-of--4-7-bn-to-india-by-2035--study-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/restricting-huawei-in-5g-may-cause-min-gdp-loss-of--4-7-bn-to-india-by-2035--study.html
176,20-1-20,India ranks low at 76th place on global Social Mobility Index,"India has been ranked very low at 76th place out of 82 countries on a new Social Mobility Index compiled by the World Economic Forum, while Denmark has topped the charts.

The report, released ahead of the 50th Annual Meeting of the WEF, also lists India among the five countries that stand to gain the most from a better social mobility score that seeks to measure parameters necessary for creating societies where every person has the same opportunity to fulfil his potential in life irrespective of socioeconomic background.

Increasing social mobility, a key driver of income inequality, by 10 per cent would benefit social cohesion and boost the world's economies by nearly 5 per cent by 2030, the WEF said.

But, few economies have the right conditions to foster social mobility.

Measuring countries across five key dimensions distributed over 10 pillars – health; education (access, quality and equity); technology; work (opportunities, wages, conditions); and protections and institutions (social protection and inclusive institutions) – shows that fair wages, social protection and lifelong learning are the biggest drags on social mobility globally.

In the case of India, it ranks 76th out of 82 economies. It ranks 41st in lifelong learning and 53rd in working conditions.

The Areas of improvement for India include social protection (76th) and fair wage distribution (79th).

The inaugural Social Mobility Report showed that across the Global Social Mobility Index, only a handful of nations across the 82 countries covered have put in place the right conditions to foster social mobility.

The top five are all Scandinavian, while the five economies with the most to gain from boosting social mobility are China, the United States, India, Japan and Germany.

""Creating societies where every person has the same opportunity to fulfil their potential in life irrespective of socioeconomic background would not only bring huge societal benefits in the form of reduced inequalities and healthier, more fulfilled lives, it would also boost economic growth by hundreds of billions of dollars a year,"" the WEF said.

""The social and economic consequences of inequality are profound and far-reaching: a growing sense of unfairness, precarity, perceived loss of identity and dignity, weakening social fabric, eroding trust in institutions, disenchantment with political processes, and an erosion of the social contract. The response by business and government must include a concerted effort to create new pathways to socioeconomic mobility, ensuring everyone has fair opportunities for success,” said Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the WEF.

The most socially mobile societies in the world, according to the report's Global Social Mobility Index, are all European.

The Nordic nations hold the top five spots, led by Denmark in the first place (scoring 85 points), followed by Norway, Finland and Sweden (all above 83 points) and Iceland (82 points). Rounding out the top 10 are the Netherlands (6th), Switzerland (7th), Austria (8th), Belgium (9th) and Luxembourg (10th).

Among the G7 economies, Germany is the most socially mobile, ranking 11th with 78 points, followed by France in 12th position. Canada comes next (14th), followed by Japan (15th), the United Kingdom (21st), the United States (27th) and Italy (34th).

Among the world's large emerging economies, the Russian Federation is the most socially mobile of the BRICS grouping, ranking 39th, with a score of 64 points. Next is China (45th), followed by Brazil (60th), India (76th) and South Africa (77th).

The report also examines which economies stand to gain the most from increases in social mobility. The economy with the most to gain is China, whose economy could grow by an extra USD 103 billion a year, or USD 1 trillion dollars over the decade.

The US is the economy that would make the second-largest gains, at USD 87 billion a year. Next is India, followed by Japan, Germany, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, the UK and France.

Most importantly though, the returns are intangible in the form of social cohesion, stability and enhanced opportunity for more people to fulfil their potential.

The report also makes a powerful case for stakeholder capitalism. The most socially mobile economies all share an emphasis on effective social policies that benefit communities as well as provide a platform for healthy, competitive economies. By comparison, economies that are organized more on “shareholder value maximization”, or “state capitalism”, tend to perform less well.

It calls for a new financing model for social mobility: Improving tax progressivity on personal income, policies that address wealth concentration and broadly rebalancing the sources of taxation can support the social mobility agenda.

Most importantly, however, the mix of public spending and policy incentives must change to put greater emphasis on the factors of social spending.

“Improving social mobility must be the fundamental imperative of this new decade: As long as an individual's chances in life remain disproportionately influenced by their socioeconomic status at birth, inequalities will never be reduced,"" growth, the green transition, trade and geopolitics,"" said Saadia Zahidi, Managing Director, New Economy and Society, WEF.

""In a globalized world where there is transparent information on the gulf between the ‘haves and the ‘have-nots', we will continue to see discontent, with far-reaching consequences for economic,"" she added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-ranks-low-at-76th-place-on-global-social-mobility-index-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/india-ranks-low-at-76th-place-on-global-social-mobility-index.html

178,20-1-20,‘Brazen attempt to overturn 2016 mandate’,"US President Donald Trump’s legal team filed its first response to impeachment summons from the Senate, calling the two articles passed by the House of Representatives a “brazen and unlawful” attempt to overturn the will of the American people.

“This is a brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election and interfere with the 2020 election-now just months away,” Trump’s lawyers said on Saturday in a six-page fiery response filed with the Senate.

“The highly partisan and reckless obsession with impeaching the President began the day he was inaugurated and continues to this day,” they said and urged the Senate to reject the two articles of impeachment.

The House of Representatives, controlled by the Democratic Party, on Wednesday voted to send articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate, in a major development to remove him from office for his alleged abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

In a 228-193 vote, which was mainly on party lines, the House appointed seven impeachment managers who will argue the Democrats’ case for removing Trump from the office. The managers — Congressmen Adam Schiff, Jerrold Nadler, Zoe Lofgren, Hakeem Jeffries, Val Demings, Jason Crow, and Sylvia Garcia - were named by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

The 435-member House on December 18 charged Trump with “high crimes and misdemeanors” and impeached him for pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential Democratic rival for the current president in the 2020 elections.

“The evidence overwhelmingly establishes that he is guilty of both. The only remaining question is whether the members of the Senate will accept and carry out the responsibility placed on them by the Framers of our Constitution and their constitutional Oaths,” the brief said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/---brazen-attempt-to-overturn-2016-mandate---.html

180,20-1-20,Russian activists take aim at Putin in march against repression,"More than a thousand Opposition activists of various stripes marched in central Moscow on Sunday after President Vladimir Putin proposed re-drafting the constitution, unleashing political upheaval.

Protesters — mostly young anti-fascist activists — chanted “Revolution” and “No to dictatorship” and some carried copies of the constitution.

The annual sanctioned march was called to commemorate the memory of lawyer Stanislav Markelov and journalist Anastasia Baburova who were gunned down in Moscow by ultra-nationalists in 2009.

A number of independent local deputies including Yulia Galyamina and opposition-minded Russians joined the march, carrying copies of the constitution and chanting “Putin leave!”.

About ten people including a protester who carried a placard urging Putin to quit power were detained by police.

Pyotr Alyoshin, a 54-year-old lawyer, said at the march he was against changing the country’s basic law.

“The constitution that I hold in my hands protects our rights and basic freedoms,” he told AFP.

Galyamina, who had earlier said it was important to protest against Putin’s attempts to cling to power and urged ordinary people to join the march, acknowledged the meagre turnout but said average Russians were confused.

“We will explain it to them,” she told AFP. “I think people will be joining the fight to prevent a state coup in Russia.” More than 1,400 people took part in the march, said the White Counter group which monitors political protests.

The march took place after Putin stunned the nation on Wednesday by proposing sweeping amendments to the constitution, the first major changes to the country’s basic law since it was adopted under Boris Yeltsin in 1993.

The move triggered the resignation of his government.

Observers say Putin’s proposals are designed to ensure his grip on power after he leaves the Kremlin and his critics have accused him of orchestrating a “constitutional coup”.

But Sunday’s turnout paled in comparison to the protests of last summer when tens of thousands took to Moscow’s streets to protest against the exclusion of opposition candidates from local elections, leading to wide-scale arrests and long jail terms for a number of demonstrators.

Russia’s top opposition leader Alexei Navalny said on Friday he did not support rallies in “defence of the constitution”.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/russian-activists-take-aim-at-putin-in-march-against-repression.html
181,20-1-20,Different yet one,"We forget that we are the children of the same father. This awareness fosters love and respect for humanity and leads to cooperation and sharing, says Rajyogi Brahmakumar Nikunj Ji

As per the World Population Review (WPR), there are 197 countries all over the world inhabited by people who are believed to follow about 4,200 religions and speak more than 6,900 languages. Thus, it is needless to say that the differences of nationality, race, language and religion have lead to various conflicts over centuries. People of the same nationality fight over language; those speaking the same tongue fight over religion; those with the same religion kill each other over sectarian differences; and those of the same race fight over class or ideological differences.

In all such strife, people identify themselves with their nationality, religion, race or section, forgetting who they really are. However, as per spiritual principles, it is the spirit or soul that is the core of a human being. The soul has consciousness about a person’s existence and identity. It is in the form of an infinite small point of light. Within itself, it carries a record of everything it does through thoughts, feelings, words and actions.

The souls take birth in different places, communities and circumstances. According to these factors, it acquires labels of nationality, race, religion, sect, class, community and gender. In other words, the souls can be identified as Australian, Indian, Chinese, Hindu, Christian, White, Black, rich, poor, male or female. However, the fact is that the soul is above all these classifications, which are applied in relation to the body. But, since most of us are ignorant about our souls, we take these labels to be our true identity. And once we identify ourselves with such labels, we begin to think accordingly. Thus, if we define our identity by our nationality, we tend to see those with a different nationality as “others,” focussing on their different habits, appearances and culture. The same happens when we identify ourselves with our religion, race or any other label. As a result, we create a distance with those who have different circumstances. And when we dwell too much on the differences we have with others, it leads to feelings of being superior or inferior and creates likes and dislikes. It even leads to animosity and hatred for those different from us. It is this negative feeling that fuel religious, racial, international and class conflicts.

And what is the root cause of all this? We forget that we are all souls from the same abode and children of the same father whom we call the supreme soul. As we forget our true identity, we get trapped in body consciousness and end up making our as well as others’ lives miserable. Hence, to be happy and peaceful, it is necessary for us to be rooted in soul-consciousness and be aware of the fact that all human souls are our brothers and we are one family, being the children of one god. This awareness fosters love and respect for our fellow humans and leads to cooperation and sharing. If everyone recognises their true spiritual identity and follow mutual brotherhood, all boundaries of nations, races, religions, classes would become meaningless, and humanity would be able to live in peace and harmony as one family.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/different-yet-one-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/different-yet-one.html
182,20-1-20,Think unconventional,"Here are some gardening trends for 2020 based largely on market observations and feedback from people

Gardeners in 2020 will veer from the beaten path, opting for unconventional varieties and eco-conscious surroundings, according to a plant trends study by horticulturalists with the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF/IFAS). Their forecast is based largely on market observations and feedback from people seeking information from extension offices.

Interest is strong for native plants, dwarf hybrids, “re-wilding’’ gardens, edible settings, wildlife-friendly landscapes, dark foliage, succulent, novel greens, landscaping for natural disasters, and softer, leafier floral arrangements, the horticulturists said.

“More and more folks are wanting to think about sustainability,’’ said Mark Tancig, a UF/IFAS agent based in Leon County. They’re wanting to plant things that don’t require as much water or fertilizer. Plants that resist disease and insects. Plants that provide for wildlife use and need less maintenance and input. That not only saves money but it looks good, too. It’s restorative to the environment,” he said.

Breaking down the study’s trending Top 10:

Native Plants: These plants original to a specific place generally are lower maintenance, requiring less water, pruning and fertilizer.

Dwarf Hybrids: Gardeners without a lot of living space increasingly are choosing the dwarf varieties of their favorite plants. They also require less pruning.

Re-Wilding Gardens: To encourage beneficial insects and the health of your garden, allow shrubs to return to their natural shapes, let grass grow longer and permit a few weeds to flower, said Theresa Badurek, horticulture agent for Pinellas County. ``Some of those volunteer weeds may be great wildflowers.”

Edible Settings: Fruit-bearing plants, ornamental vegetables and edible flowers do double duty, adding beauty as well as nutrition to the home landscape.

Plants for Wildlife: “Most contemporary landscapes lack diversity, so gardeners should choose a variety of plants that flower and fruit,” Badurek said. Plants with berries attract birds, and layering plants of varying heights provides hiding places for other species.

Dark Foliage: Plants with red, purple or black leaves are striking additions to any landscape, making them attractive to gardeners looking for something new in 2020, said Marguerite Beckford, a horticulture agent in Sarasota County.

Succulent: People are reaching out for lesser-known succulent that offer interesting shapes, textures and growth habits, the University of Florida horticulturists say.

Novel Greens: Vegetable gardeners will be looking to diversify their harvests with leafy greens generally grown outside the United States — bok choy, mizuna and komatsuna among them, according to the horticulturists.

Landscaping for Natural Disasters: “Storms are becoming more erratic and more feared,” Tancig said. “Plant the kinds of trees around your home that reduce risk.”

Softer, Leafier Floral Arrangements: Flowers combined with foliage are gaining in popularity. “We are going away from the bundle bouquet of solitary flower blooms to the soft, organic feel of greenery,” said Karen Stauderman, an Extension horticulture agent for Volusia County. —AP",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/think-unconventional-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/think-unconventional.html
183,20-1-20,"Bajrang, Ravi claim Gold medals in Rome","Bajrang Punia was far from his fluent best but still claimed Gold while Ravi Kumar Dahiya showed sparkling form in his Gold-winning effort as the two Indians kicked off the Olympic year in style at the Rome Ranking Series here.

The 25-year-old Bajrang staged a comeback to secure a 4-3 win against USA’s Jordan Michael Oliver in the summit showdown of the 65kg freestyle category on Saturday night.

Ravi, who competed in the 61kg category instead of his regular 57kg, bagged the gold after getting the better of Kazakhstan’s Nurbolat Abdualiyev 12-2 in his final bout late on Saturday night.

The 23-year-old from Sonepat had made the final round after securing impressive wins over Moldova’s Alexaandru Chirtoaca and Kazakhstan’s Nurislam Sanayev in the four-wrestler draw.

India, thus, returned with seven medals from the tournament.

Vinesh Phogat and Anhsu Malik winning a gold and a silver respectively in the women’s competition. In Greco-roman, Gurpreet Singh (82kg) won a Gold, Sunil Kumar (97kg) a Silver while Sajan Bhanwal (77kg) settled for a Bronze.

Bajrang admitted that he was not at his best.

“Yes the bouts were close, it’s just first tournament of the season so I was a bit rusty. I had a feeling going into this tournament that the performance will be a bit up and down,” Bajrang told PTI.

“But having close bouts is not a worry, it’s good. It keeps me alert and gives ne chance to ponder over my shortcomings,” he said.

Bajrang’s personal coach Shako Bentinidis was not with him in Rome and that too affected the Indian wrestler.

“He had some visa issues, so he could not be with me. His absence also impacted my performance. I badly missed his guidance during the bouts,” he said.

Up against one of India’s biggest medal prospects in the Tokyo Olympics, Oliver conceded that it was not his night against Bajrang.

The American lauded the competitive spirit of Bajrang.

“I have fond memories of winning the title for the Chennai franchise in the second season here. I thoroughly enjoy the love and support every time I play here. I am excited for the new season and I hope people will come and watch us play,” said the Hyderabad Hunters star.

The fifth season of world’s most popular badminton league, organized by Sportzlive held under the aegis of Badminton Association of India (BAI), will see a lot of promising talent taking the court. Lakshya Sen, who won a staggering five titles in 2019, headlines the men's singles department in Chennai Superstarz along with the youngest player in PBL5, S. Sankar Muthusamy and K. Sathish Kumar. Former World Championships bronze medallist Tommy Sugiarto, who was the MVP in the first season of PBL, will be another key attraction in the Chennai squad.

“I made my PBL debut last season and this time I hope to win ties for Chennai Superstarz. I am really looking forward to the new season,” said Lakshya Sen.

The Chennai crowd will also get to witness the fiery smashing skills of one half of India’s No. 1 men’s doubles team, Satwiksairaj Rankireddy, who is donning the Chennai jersey this time. With veteran Sumeeth Reddy being in the team along with upcoming talent Dhruv Kapila, the men’s doubles side in Chennai looks robust.

For the former champions Hyderabad Hunters, Vietnam Open and Hyderabad Open winner Sourabh Verma will look to bring his sterling form from last year. Along with Malaysia’s former World No. 10 Daren Liew and India's rising star Kiran George, the Hunters will be ready for the challenge.

Seven teams - Awadhe Warriors, Bengaluru Raptors, Mumbai Rockets, Hyderabad Hunters, Chennai Superstarz, North Eastern Warriors and Pune 7 Aces — will slug it out for a prize of Rs 6 crore. The PBL season 5 will be telecast live on Star Sports and streamed live on Hotstar.)",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/pbl-5-start-from-today.html
185,20-1-20,India shootout Netherlands 3-1,"India made a dream debut at the FIH Pro League, beating world number three Netherlands 3-1 in the shoot-out after both the teams were locked 3-3 at the end of regulation time in the second match of the two-leg tie here on Sunday.

World number five India had earlier defeated Netherlands 5-2 in the opening match of the tie on Saturday.

India are now atop the leaderboard with five points from two games, but the Manpreet Singh-led side conceded a point to the Netherlands after drawing (during the regulation time) the second match of the contest on Sunday.

As per the new rules implemented by the International Hockey Federation (FIH) in the second edition of the Pro League, every match of a tie has to produce a result.

In case of a draw, the match would be decided by shoot-out and the side which wins will garner two points and the losing team will get one point.

Mink van der Weeden (23rd minute) scored from a penalty corner, while Jeroen Hertzberger (26th) and Bjorn Kellerman (27th) scored two field goals for the visitors in the regulation time.

Lalit Upadhyay (25th), Mandeep Singh (51st) and Rupinder Pal Singh (55th) were the goal getters for the home team.

In the shoot-out, Vivek Sagar Prasad, Akashdeep Singh and Gujrant Singh were on target for the Indians but Harmanpreet Singh and Rupinder missed.

Mirco Pruijser was the lone scorer for the Dutch as Glenn Schuurman, Thierry Brinkman and Jeroen Hertzberger missed their targets during the shoot-out.

The Indians started from where they left on Saturday and created a lot of chances from the beginning but it was Netherlands who stunned the capacity crowd by taking the lead in the second quarter.

Netherlands took the lead when Van der Weerden converted a penalty corner, flicking into the roof of the net from the top of the circle in the 23rd minute.

The Indians bounced back within minutes when Lalit scored from close range to level the scores.

But India’s joy was shortlived as Netherlands restored their lead a minute later through Hetrzberger, who scooped home from close range.

To make matters worse for the hosts, the Netherlands extended their lead a minute later when Kellerman fired home from close range to go into half time with a commanding 3-1 lead.

After the change of ends, India pushed hard in search of goals and in the process created a few bright chances, including a few penalty corners but to no avail as the third quarter yielded no goal.

Trailing by two goals, India continued to step up the pressure on the Netherlands defence and finally managed to beat it in the 51st minute when Mandeep fired from a rebound from a penalty corner.

India continued in the same vein and within three minutes secured another penalty corner which was dully converted by Rupinder to level the scores.

Thereafter, both the teams pressed hard for the winner and the Dutch came close two minutes from final hooter when they secured another penalty corner but it was well defended by the Indians as the match went into shoot-out.

After the Netherlands, India will host world champions Belgium on February 8 and 9 followed by two more home ties against Australia on February 22 and 23.

The Indian team will then leave for the away games in Germany (April 25 and 26) and Great Britain (May 2 and 3).

India will return to play on home soil on May 23 and 24 against New Zealand before travelling to Argentina to play on June 5 and 6.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-shootout-netherlands-3-1.html
186,20-1-20,PL title heading towards Anfield,"Liverpool stretched their commanding lead at the top of the Premier League to 16 points and advantage over Manchester United to 30 as goals from Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah earned a 2-0 win over their historic rivals at Anfield.

A 13th straight league win since the sides last met at Old Trafford in October continues Liverpool's relentless run towards a first league title in 30 years, while United remain five points off the top four in fifth.

Liverpool also have a game in hand to come on closest challengers Manchester City and could have been more comfortable winners after seeing two first half goals ruled out and a host of clear chances go astray.

United are the only team to take Premier League points off the European champions this season, but it rarely looked like lightning would strike twice once the hosts went in front on 14 minutes.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's game plan was undone by a simple set-piece as Van Dijk rose highest to power home Trent Alexander-Arnold's corner.

The Norwegian had set up with a back five, with Luke Shaw forced to deputise out of position as a third centre-back, and only a great challenge from the former Southampton left-back denied Sadio Mane a certain second as he burst onto Roberto Firmino's pass.

Jurgen Klopp's men did have the ball in the net twice more before the break, but VAR and the offside flag came to United's rescue to keep the score down.

Firstly, Firmino's brilliant strike was ruled out as Van Dijk was penalised for an aerial challenge with David de Gea after a VAR review.

Georginio Wijnaldum then slotted past the Spaniard after a brilliant through ball from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, but the Dutchman had strayed marginally offside.

Shorn of injured top scorer Marcus Rashford, United failed to even muster a shot in anger for the first 40 minutes until Anthony Martial pulled his effort wide of the near post.

However, they could easily have been level against the run of play moments later when Andreas Pereira could not stretch to turn home Aaron Wan-Bissaka's ball across the face of the goal.

At the other end, De Gea had one more key intervention before the break as he saved with his feet from Mane's driven effort.

United rode their luck even more at the start of the second half as Salah somehow skewed wide from point-blank range before Jordan Henderson smashed a shot off the post.

But Liverpool's failure to put the game to bed could have cost them when Martial blazed over United's best chance of the game after a well-worked one-two with Pereira just before the hour mark.

Just like in the 1-0 win at Tottenham last weekend Liverpool tired in the final 20 minutes, with Klopp forced to withdraw Mane and Firmino to bolster the midfield.

However, the hosts held out for a seventh consecutive clean sheet in all competitions and took another giant step towards the title as Salah secured the three points with virtually the last kick of the game.

The Egyptian was picked out by goalkeeper Alisson Becker and ran from inside his own half before slotting under De Gea.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/pl-title-heading-towards-anfield.html
187,20-1-20,Gattuso 'scared' as Napoli hit ‘rock bottom',"Gennaro Gattuso said he was “worried and scared” as Napoli fell 2-0 at home to Fiorentina on Saturday leaving last season’s Serie A runners-up scrambling to save their season.

A third consecutive defeat saw the southern giants slump to 13th position as they sit closer to the relegation zone than the Champions League places.

Napoli are without a league win at their San Paolo Stadium since October 19 ahead of hosting Barcelona in the Champions League in a month’s time.

For Gattuso the “soulless, unwatchable and embarrassing” defeat was his fourth in five league games since replacing Carlo Ancelotti on December 11, with the club then in seventh spot.

“I’m very worried,” admitted the 42-year-old former AC Milan coach.

“We have hit rock bottom and we need to understand what we are going towards.

“We’re not looking at the Champions League, we’re looking at the scary ranking. We’re playing with fire.”

Federico Chiesa and Dusan Vlahovic scored in either half to give Fiorentina a valuable win in Naples.

“The performance was embarrassing, we must apologise to the fans and the city,” continued Gattuso.

“We only did a little bit in the first 20-25 minutes, then we were unwatchable. We tickled the opponents, without competitive fury.”

Gattuso said the team had agreed to head straight to a training retreat at Castel Volturno, northwest of Naples, before hosting Lazio in the Italian Cup quarter-finals on Tuesday and welcoming champions Juventus to Naples next weekend.

“We have to look at each other, be together, let off steam and look for solutions. What we are doing is not enough,” explained Gattuso.

“I was convinced that we would have a great performance today but I saw a team that did the opposite of what we had prepared.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/gattuso--scared--as-napoli-hit----rock-bottom-.html
188,20-1-20,Japan’s leader vows to boost nation’s role in US alliance,"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged Sunday to bolster his country’s role under its security pact with the US in “outer space and cyberspace,” as the allies marked the 60th anniversary of a treaty that has been the basis for their postwar defense alliance.

Abe’s grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, who was prime minister at the time, signed the treaty in Washington on January 19, 1960, with President Dwight Eisenhower.

The treaty allows for the stationing of tens of thousands of US troops and the deployment of American warships in Japan. In exchange, the US is obligated to protect Japan in case of enemy attack.

“We have elevated the relationship to one in which each of us, the U.S. And Japan, protects the other, thereby giving further force to the alliance,” Abe said in his opening remarks.

“Going forward, it is incumbent upon us to make it even more robust, to make it a pillar for safeguarding peace and security in both outer space and cyberspace.”

The anniversary comes as Washington adds pressure on Japan to shoulder more of the financial cost and play a greater defense role in the Asia-Pacific region to make up for a receding US presence.

“As the security environment continues to evolve and new challenges arise, it is essential that our alliance further strengthen and deepen,” President Donald Trump said in a statement marking the anniversary.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/japan---s-leader-vows-to-boost-nation---s-role-in-us-alliance.html
189,20-1-20,Philippines looks for safer homes for volcano residents,"Philippine officials said Sunday the government will no longer allow villagers to return to a crater-studded island where an erupting volcano lies, warning that living there would be “like having a gun pointed at you.”

Taal volcano has simmered with smaller ash ejections in recent days after erupting on January 12 with a gigantic plume of steam and ash that drifted northward and reached Manila, the capital, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) away.

While the volcano remains dangerous, with large numbers of local villagers encamped in emergency shelters, officials have begun discussing post-eruption recovery.

Interior Secretary Eduardo Ano said officials in Batangas province, where the volcano is located, have been asked to look for a safer housing area, at least 3 hectares (7 acres) in size, for about 6,000 families that used to live in four villages and worked mostly as tourist guides, farmers and fish pen operators on Volcano Island.

The new housing site should be at least 17 kilometers (10 miles) away from the restive volcano to be safe, he said.

The island has long been declared by the government as a national park that’s off-limits to permanent villages. The government’s volcano-monitoring agency has separately declared the island a permanent danger zone, but impoverished villagers have lived and worked there for decades.

“We have to enforce these regulations once and for all because their lives are at stake,” Ano said, adding that closely regulated tourism work could eventually be allowed on the island without letting residents live there permanently.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has approved a recommendation for the island to be turned into a “no man’s land,” but he has yet to issue formal guidelines. After an initial visit last week, Duterte plans to return to hard-hit Batangas province on Monday to check conditions of displaced villagers, Ano said.

Although it’s one of the world’s smallest volcanoes, the 311-meter (1,020-foot) -high Taal is the second most-active of 24 restive Philippine volcanoes.

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology has placed Taal and outlying cities and towns at alert level 4, the second-highest warning, indicating a more dangerous explosive eruption is possible within hours or days due to fewer but continuous earthquakes and other signs of restiveness.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/philippines-looks-for-safer-homes-for-volcano-residents.html
190,20-1-20,"They stop, you shop","Entrepreneurs are launching flexible, cost-saving fashion trucks, loading their inventories with accessories and apparel, which deliver door to door and halt at high-traffic areas across cities, says Chahak Mittal

After food trucks, which have redefined the way millennials eat on the go, it is the turn of fashion trucks. Mobile, eye-catching and a smart business model in stressed times, it is slowly capturing the youth market.

Pune-based Ravi Yadav, an IIT-Kharagpur alumnus and founder of Fabulo Fashion Truck, says that the trend is on the rise because other than being convenient, it is also unique and catchy. He adds, “It attracts more customers because of its conceptual novelty.” Experts also claim that while one would have to take out separate time off their regular routines to visit a complex or showroom to shop, a fashion bus beside the street would just make them stop and look at the collection while on the go.

Ravi had earlier talked about why he chose to start the venture, “The idea came to me post a poor experience at online shopping. I had ordered t-shirts from a shopping website, which turned out to be of very poor quality. Post that, exchanging them became a hassle as it took more than two weeks.” This was when he thought about creating smoother delivery options and zeroed down on the idea of a fashion truck through which deliveries to people’s doorstep could become hassle-free and viable.

“Initially, we thought of having a doorstep shop idea, where the customers can try and purchase at their home or office but due to its grand size and structure, we faced the challenge of reaching into narrow lanes and areas. Hence, we started parking and covering different locations of an area,” adds Ravi.

Ankit Shukla, co-founder of Truck and Mortar along with Roopika Srivastava, points out that the trend is also on the rise because fashion trucks help them reach out to a larger audience. “You are not located at one place or limited to only the kind of crowd who visit your store frequently,” says he.

Experts say that fashion trucks carry a good potential to cater different kinds of audience. The sellers are able to sell a variety of clothing — from representing the local designers’ fashion to your organic line of apparel.

Ankit, who is also the founder of two London-based high fashion brands — Adamo London and Evah London — under the English Closet, has stocked the truck with Adamo and Evah apparel too along with other top brands. It is an AC store complete with bright signage and changing rooms, which delivers at the doorstep. “Fashion trucks will go to people unlike a physical store. Also, our fully equipped retail trucks can be hired by the brands to do their offline sales, which isn’t possible in other physical stores. The truck is also equipped with technology-driven marketing tools,” says he.

Kolkata-based Gravity Gearr’s fashion truck is another example of how wheels have brought style and fashion brands to the busy Mirza Ghalib street (near the Park Street).

Talking about how a portable fashion studio is different from a physical store or even online shopping, Ravi says, “In today’s world, where everything is going digital, at mobile studios, the customers, most importantly, are able to touch and feel the clothes physically before purchasing. They will get new apparel after every visit at any particular location because we are constantly on the go. Fashion trucks can categorise their kind of collection as per location requirements. But in studios, categorisation depends only on one location.”

Ankit highlights some drawbacks of studios, the top one being the high investment and fixed monthly expenses in opening and running physical stores. There are also long-term commitment requirements with shops; the risks of not achieving the minimum sales to cover the expenses; financial and logistical challenges of operating at multiple demographic locations; the challenge of not getting desired space in premium malls or important spots. On the other hand, fashion trucks allow flexible working hours and less walk in over the weekdays.

Even though founders of mobile fashion studios may argue that they have a unique feature of combining the online and offline sales, which helps promote sustainability too, there are certain challenges which can’t be ignored. For instance, the space restrictions. As compared to an apparel showroom or a studio, a fashion truck has less space for customers to roam and look around for their choice of garments.

However, the Truck and Mortar team have made sure that this doesn’t become a challenge for them. Ankit tells us, “Our truck is not very small in size. It is 20x8 ft with smart displays, through which customers can explore more options if they want. And they will be delivered to them next day.”

On the other hand, Ravi looks at keeping a huge collection in a confined space as a bigger challenge. He says, “The first challenge comes when there are more customers inside the truck than it can hold and sometimes, also waiting for their turn outside. The next comes while showing the variety of clothes, which could get difficult at times. But the positives are many. It enables the customers select a dress faster as compared to wasting hours at malls.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/they-stop--you-shop-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/they-stop--you-shop.html

192,20-1-20,Fix the flaw,"NSA finds major security glitch in Windows 10, issue amended

The National Security Agency has discovered a major security flaw in Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system that could let hackers intercept seemingly secure communications.

But rather than exploit the flaw for its own intelligence needs, the NSA tipped off Microsoft so that it can fix the system for everyone.

Microsoft released a free software patch to fix the flaw and credited the intelligence agency for discovering it. The company said it has not seen any evidence that hackers have used the technique.

Amit Yoran, CEO of security firm Tenable, said it is “exceptionally rare if not unprecedented” for the US government to share its discovery of such a critical vulnerability with a company.

Yoran, who was a founding director of the Department of Homeland Security’s computer emergency readiness team, urged all organisations to prioritise patching their systems quickly. An advisory sent by the NSA on Tuesday said “the consequences of not patching the vulnerability are severe and widespread.”

Microsoft said an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by spoofing a code-signing certificate so it looked like a file came from a trusted source. “The user would have no way of knowing the file was malicious, because the digital signature would appear to be from a trusted provider,” the company said.

If successfully exploited, attackers would have been able to conduct “man-in-the-middle attacks” and decrypt confidential information they intercept on user connections, the company said.

“The biggest risk is to secure communications,” said Adam Meyers, vice president of intelligence for security firm CrowdStrike.

Some computers will get the fix automatically, if they have the automatic update option turned on. Others can get it manually by going to Windows Update in the computer’s settings.

Microsoft typically releases security and other updates once a month and waited until Tuesday to disclose the flaw and the NSA’s involvement. Microsoft and the NSA both declined to say when the agency privately notified the company.

The agency shared the vulnerability with Microsoft “quickly and responsibly,” Neal Ziring, technical director of the NSA’s cybersecurity directorate, said in a blog post.

Priscilla Moriuchi, who retired from the NSA in 2017 after running its East Asia and Pacific operations, said this is a good example of the “constructive role” that the NSA can play in improving global information security. Moriuchi, now an analyst at the US cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, said it’s likely a reflection of changes made in 2017 to how the US determines whether to disclose a major vulnerability or exploit it for intelligence purposes.

The revamping of what’s known as the “Vulnerability Equities Process” put more emphasis on disclosing vulnerabilities whenever possible to protect core internet systems and the US economy and general public.

Those changes happened after a mysterious group calling itself the “Shadow Brokers” released a trove of high-level hacking tools stolen from the NSA, forcing companies including Microsoft to repair their systems. The US believes that North Korea and Russia were able to capitalise on those stolen hacking tools to unleash devastating global cyberattacks.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fix-the-flaw-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/fix-the-flaw.html

194,20-1-20,A mother’s gift,"Women share their victories, struggles and trends across generations while breastfeeding babies, writes Urvashi Sarkar

When 45-year-old storyteller and author Aparna Karthikeyan gave birth to her daughter two decades ago, her grandmothers advised her not to rely on breastfeeding alone as a source of food and nutrition for the baby.

“Amul milk was also considered a good source for the Indian middle class then. My grandmothers said that if I was breastfeeding my daughter, I should top it up with bottled Amul formula milk or diluted cow’s milk,” says Karthikeyan. Their argument was that the bottle would allow her to monitor the quantity of milk the baby consumed, whereas the baby might not get enough milk through breastfeeding.

The only person who supported Karthikeyan in her quest to breastfeed was her paediatrician, with whose encouragement she breastfed her daughter for five months and does not regret it. “My daughter never fell sick during breastfeeding. She built up her immunity. And the exercise also helped me bond with her. Weaning off was a challenge because it results in cold, fever and even upsets her stomach,” says Karthikeyan.

Breastfeeding babies for six months is a widely recommended practice. According to The Lancet, the first 1,000 days between conception and a child’s second birthday are crucial for health, nutrition and development of the child.

But for expecting and new mothers, breastfeeding can be a mix of conflicting advices, emotional turmoil and never-ending anxiety about whether the baby is being adequately fed. Moreover, the fact that breastfeeding isn’t easy for many women, and rather a technique that needs to be learned, is often swept under the carpet. The experience differs for various mothers. Take the case of 32-year-old Dr Nandini Hebbar, an academic scholar of gender studies. She has been committed to the idea of breastfeeding even before her son was born. She attended an orientation programme at a Delhi hospital and watched YouTube videos on proper positioning to achieve the correct latch for the baby. And yet, despite all the preparation, she struggled with the experience.

“A couple of days after giving birth to my son and starting to breastfeed, I was terribly sore, bleeding, and struggling. My son was crying inconsolably, looking jaundiced and losing more weight than what was average — all signs that he was not being fed enough. I had to resort to formula milk,” recalls Hebbar.

As she struggled with the dilemma of whether or not to persevere with breastfeeding, Hebbar, began reading up on the matter and found that “an overwhelming number of women worldwide give up exclusive breastfeeding within days of childbirth for reasons described as insufficient milk, painful and sore nipples or baby refusing the breast.”

Hebbar knew that poor latch and breastfeeding technique was the root cause of not being able to feed the baby, causing distress to both mother and infant. She was simultaneously aware that exclusively breastfeeding for six months reduces the rate of infant mortality and is linked to lower rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and improves neurocognitive development. The mother would also benefit through lowered risks of breast and ovarian cancer, osteoporosis and heart disease.

There was no dearth of advice from family for Hebbar. While elders suggested her to feed sugar water and dilluted cow milk to the baby, others encouraged her to continue breastfeeding. “My family knew my problems but did not know how to help me. My gynaecologist suggested over the counter nipple butter. But even that didn’t help,” she says. Then Hebbar turned to a private lactation consultant who taught her to position herself and to ensure that the baby was fed well. After this she managed to exclusively breastfeed her son for six months.

Art critic and journalist Blessy Augustine too sought advice from a lactation consultant two weeks after her daughter’s birth. “My nipples were very sensitive and my daughter would keep biting hard causing them to bleed. She would cry for hours because she was hungry and had lost weight too.”

The lactation consultant advised her that it was more important that the baby gets milk in general, opposed to its variety. Augustine realised that a mix of breastfeeding and bottle feed worked best. “Once I switched to bottle feeding, my daughter was calmer and I was able to breastfeed her better. I think the conclusion of the advice was that you have to see what works best for you and the baby,” she says.

For 31-year-old Shrutika Bhat, an IT professional and mother to a five-month-old, breastfeeding was difficult only for the first two or three days when the baby was not latching on. But things smoothened soon. She doesn’t feel that there are major differences in practices or mind-sets about breastfeeding across generations. “Old is gold”, she says, with regard to the advice she received on breastfeeding by older members of the family who encouraged her to breastfeed.

Even as mothers, grandmothers and obstetricians continue to play an important role in providing guidance, new mothers usually prefer referring to professional lactation consultants. Social media also plays a role in helping women prepare for breastfeed.

Though breastfeeding is wholly considered a woman’s and a mother’s job, but the wider community plays a crucial role in providing a supportive and enabling environment. Augustine says, “I think I would have done better if people around me were not stressing me out so much about it.”

Workplaces also need to chip in with support for both mother and father. “If my spouse had a longer paternity leave, that would have really helped. He just had five days off,” she says.

According to the Maternity Benefit Amendment Act, 2017, women are entitled to 26 weeks of paid maternity leave from their workplace. Six months of paid maternity leave enabled Bhat to exclusively breastfeed. But Shrutika isn’t sure how frequently she will be able to breastfeed after six months since she wants to return to work.

However, exclusive breastfeeding is not available to all women, except for those who are financially well-off to avail paid maternity leave, lactation consultants and internet access. But this does not apply to vast swathes of women across India. For example, the 2017 Act that enables paid maternity leave is only applicable to commercial establishments that employ 10 or more people.

A vast number of women (over 90 per cent as per estimates) work in the unorganised or informal sector and are not covered under the law. And the entitlements provided by laws which cover women in the unorganised sector are insufficient. For example, under the National Food Security Act and accompanying Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, `6,000 needs to be given to every expecting and new mother for the nutritional needs of both mother and child. A report by Down to Earth showed that there were many cases where women did not receive any money. Hence, the policy has failed to include the needs of poor women and the ones engaged in casual employment in the unorganised sector. These women then have to look for alternatives.

“Take the case of female farmers,” says Karthikeyan, who writes about rural livelihoods in Tamil Nadu. “It is hardly possible for them to take their babies along with them to the fields. They try to breastfeed as much as possible but it isn’t as often or regular as they would like to. Before six months, they give them food like ragi porridge in Tamil Nadu and banana mash in Kerala. This is to offset the dependence on the mother for milk,” adds she.

Breastfeeding babies is important for both mother and child but there are various challenges that still need attention from the government, lawmakers and the wider community including family, workplace and medical practitioners to ensure they lead a healthy life.

195,20-1-20,"Djokovic, Williams lead tennis old guard into new decade","Old stagers Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams will aim to keep the younger generation of players waiting in the wings as Grand Slam tennis enters a new decade at the Australian Open on Monday.

After recent bushfire smog largely cleared in Melbourne, the view is all too familiar with Djokovic and Williams, who is seeking a record-equalling 24th Major title, installed as the bookies' favourites.

Top seed Rafael Nadal, 33, is celebrating becoming world number one in a third decade while Roger Federer, 38, is trying to defy the ageing process and stay ahead of his rivals with a 21st Grand Slam win.

The start of 2020 is not dissimilar to 2010, when Federer and Nadal shared the four Grand Slam titles and Williams won in Melbourne and Wimbledon.

Ten years later, the men’s Big Three — who have won all but two Australian Open titles since 2004 — occupy the top three rankings, and Williams is one step away from Margaret Court's record for Grand Slam victories.

The men’s dominance is stark: since Federer won his first Grand Slam title in 2003, only five Major finals have not featured one of the Swiss, Nadal or Djokovic.

Several challengers have come and gone but there is increasing hope for the men's up-and-comers, while nine women have won Grand Slam titles since Williams, 38, claimed her 23rd in Melbourne in 2017.

‘They’re very close’

While Djokovic and Nadal split last year’s Grand Slams, Dominic Thiem, Daniil Medvedev and Fabio Fognini won their first Masters trophies and Stefanos Tsitsipas, 21, became the youngest ATP Finals champion in 18 years.

“They’re very close. I don’t think that’s miles, miles away maybe as it was some years ago,” Djokovic of the NextGen winning a Major title.

The clash between old and new will be epitomised in the first round on Monday, when Venus Williams, who turns 40 this year, plays 15-year-old rising star Coco Gauff —who wasn't even born when her fellow American lifted her first Grand Slam trophies in 2000.

Japan’s Naomi Osaka, 22, is defending a title for the second Grand Slam in a row after her repeat bid at last year’s US Open fell flat in the fourth round.

World number one Ashleigh Barty, fresh from winning the Adelaide International on Saturday, carries Australian hopes of seeing the first home-grown women’s winner since 1978.

“Obviously it’s the perfect preparation. But regardless of whether I won the title or not last week, I feel like I’m well-prepared,” Barty said.

“I’m happy, I’m healthy. I'm coming into the first Grand Slam of the year with a smile on my face. That’s all I can ask of myself.”

The tournament is taking place against the backdrop of a bushfires emergency that has swept the nation and ramped up fears over global warming — and billowed choking smog across Melbourne and other cities.

After player anger during qualifying and practice, when several were hit by coughing fits and breathing problems, air pollution returned to 'moderate' levels over the weekend, with rain forecast for the start of the tournament.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/djokovic--williams-lead-tennis-old-guard-into-new-decade.html
196,20-1-20,Serena 'concerned' over Australian Open pollution after past lung problems,"Serena Williams voiced concern over pollution from bushfire smoke at the Australian Open on Monday, saying that lung problems in the past could make her more vulnerable.

The 38-year-old American, who is pursuing a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title, said it was a waiting game to see how conditions develop over the next fortnight.

The poor air that disrupted qualifying eased by Monday -- when Williams made a winning start against Anastasia Potapova -- and instead gave way to spells of heavy rain.

""I definitely was concerned, and am,"" said Williams, who suffered a lung blood clot during labour while giving birth to daughter Olympia in 2017 -- the second time she has needed emergency treatment for the problem.

""That (haze) is still a concern for, I think, pretty much everyone.""

Many players have hit out at organisers for ploughing ahead last week with qualifying matches, despite pollution levels hitting some of the worst on the planet in Melbourne.

Asked if she feared she might be more sensitive to the pollution because of her past problems, Williams replied: ""It definitely crossed my mind.

""I'm, like, 'Oh no, I'm already playing a little down than most people.'""

But Williams, who gave her USD 43,000 Auckland winners' cheque to a bushfire relief fund last week, said she felt no particular problem in her opening victory against Russian teenager Anastasia Potapova.

The American said tournament organisers had been keeping the players informed of the latest conditions each day.

""That's been really good to see that the Australian Open take that stance on that,"" she said.

""So it's literally every day, we are just waiting every day to see how the air quality would be.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/serena--concerned--over-australian-open-pollution-after-past-lung-problems-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/serena--concerned--over-australian-open-pollution-after-past-lung-problems-serena--concerned--over-australian-open-pollution-after-past-lung-problems.html
197,20-1-20,"Kohli, Rohit consolidate top batting positions; Bumrah leads bowlers pack in ICC ODI rankings","India captain Virat Kohli and his deputy Rohit Sharma consolidated their top two positions in the batting chart, while pace ace Jasprit Bumrah continued to lead among bowlers in the ICC ODI Rankings issued on Monday.

Following their stellar performances against Australia in the just-concluded series, which India won 2-1, Kohli (No.1) and Rohit (No.2) have strengthened their positions.

With 183 runs under his belt against Australia, Kohli was the player-of-the-series while Rohit was a close second, garnering 171 runs in the rubber, including a match-winning 119 in the deciding ODI in Bengaluru on Sunday.

Kohli (886 points) and Rohit (868 points) have gained two and three ratings points, respectively to occupy the top two positions in the batting rankings.

Pakistan's Babar Azam is in third position with 829 points, the ICC said in a statement.

Left-handed opener Shikhar Dhawan has also gained seven slots to reach 15th position with 170 runs in two innings, missing a chance to bat in Bengaluru after injuring his shoulder while fielding.

K L Rahul, who opened in his place in the final ODI, has gained 21 slots to reach 50th position with an aggregate of 146 runs.

Bumrah, who returned from injury in the Australia series, is atop the bowlers chart with 764 points, ahead of New Zealand left-arm pacer Trent Boult and Afghanistan's Mujeeb Ur Rahman. South Africa's Kagiso Rabada and Australian Pat Cummins complete the top five.

India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja has moved up two slots to be 27th among bowlers after finishing with four wickets in the series.

He also scored 45 runs in two innings and has gained four places in the all-rounders' list to be ranked 10th.

Australian Steve Smith, who topped the series with an aggregate of 229 runs including a knock of 131 in the final ODI, has been rewarded with a four-place jump to 23rd position.

David Warner, a formerly top-ranked batsman in the format, has also moved up one place to sixth while captain Aaron Finch has moved up one place into 10th. Wicketkeeper Alex Carey is in 31st position after gaining two slots.

Leg-spinner Adam Zampa's five wickets in the series saw him advance 20 places to reach 37th position, while Kane Richardson has moved from 77th to 65th.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kohli--rohit-consolidate-top-batting-positions--bumrah-leads-bowlers-pack-in-icc-odi-rankings-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kohli--rohit-consolidate-top-batting-positions--bumrah-leads-bowlers-pack-in-icc-odi-rankings.html
198,20-1-20,Ishant sustains ankle injury before Test squad announcement,"India's senior-most pacer Ishant Sharma hurt his ankle badly while bowling during a Ranji Trophy game here on Monday, just before the announcement of the Test squad for the New Zealand tour.

Spearheading the Delhi attack against Vidarbha, the extent of the 31-year-old's injury is not known, but Ishant looked in real pain as he hobbled off the ground with the help of support staff.

The injury happened in the fifth over of Vidarbha's second innings and Ishant's third over.

It was a short delivery, which rival skipper Faiz Fazal tried to pull but the ball hit the pads, as Ishant vociferously appealed on the follow through before slipping suddenly.

He was writhing in pain and needed immediate medical help. Ishant had taken three wickets for 45 runs in Vidarbha's first innings.

The veteran of 96 Tests is expected to be in the Test squad for the New Zealand tour and this is his last Ranji game of the season.

His next outing is supposed to be a practice match in Hamilton but in case the injury turns out to be serious, he will be going to the National Cricket Academy (NCA) for rehabilitation.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ishant-sustains-ankle-injury-before-test-squad-announcement-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ishant-sustains-ankle-injury-before-test-squad-announcement.html
199,20-1-20,Speak to me 'hashtag without filter': PM to students during 'Pariksha Pe Charcha',"Reaching out to students across the country in exam season, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said good marks in exams are not everything and also suggested that homes should have a ""technology free"" room where those entering can't carry any gadgets.

Addressing students during a ""Pariksha Pe Charcha"" programme, the prime minister sought to speak to them in their own language and said his conversations with them will be ""hashtag without filter"".

""Speak to me hashtag without filter,"" he said at the interaction held at the Talkatora Stadium here.

In the event, telecast and streamed live, Modi said everyone should keep abreast of the latest technology but stressed that it should not be allowed to govern lives.

""We should have the strength to keep technology under our control and ensure it does not waste our time. One room in our homes should be technology free. Whoever enters will not carry any gadgets,"" he told students.

Assuring students of his complete focus, Modi said they could speak to him openly.

The prime minister also urged students to spend their spare time with the elderly.

He said students should not be afraid of failure and take it as a part of life.

""I was told I shouldn't attend Chandrayaan landing as there was no guarantee of success but I needed to be there,"" the prime minister said, recalling the failed landing of the Chandrayaan-2 mission's Vikram lander.

Good marks in exams are not everything, he told the students.

""We have to come out of the thinking that exams are everything,"" the prime minister said.

The prime minister highlighted the importance of taking on extra-curricular activities and said there is a growing tendency among parents to push their children into activities considered ""glamorous"".

""Parents should take time out to find out what their children want to do instead of pushing them into activities that are considered glamorous which they can discuss in their conversations with their friends,"" he said.

Modi also said children should be ""pursued not pressured into studies"" and recommended that students read his book, ""Exam Warriors"", to get over the stress of appearing for exams.

""The way ahead lies in pursuing, not pressurising children. Inspire children to do things that bring out their inner potential,"" he said.

He urged the students to be confident about their own preparation.

""Do not enter the exam hall with any sort of pressure. Do not worry about what the others are doing. Have faith in yourself and focus on what you've prepared,"" he said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/speak-to-me--hashtag-without-filter---pm-to-students-during--pariksha-pe-charcha--2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/speak-to-me--hashtag-without-filter---pm-to-students-during--pariksha-pe-charcha-.html

The top court, however, refused to grant an interim stay on the electoral bond scheme.

A bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant asked the Centre and the Election Commission to file their responses within two weeks to the interim application filed by NGO 'Association for Democratic Reforms' for staying the scheme.

Lawyer Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the NGO, alleged that the scheme is a means for channelising unaccounted black money in favour of the ruing party.

Bhushan also referred to a document of the RBI while seeking stay of the scheme.

201,20-1-20,Nirbhaya case: SC commences hearing on convict's plea against HC order rejecting juvenile claim,"The Supreme Court on Monday commenced hearing on the plea of a death-row convict in the Nirbhaya case against a Delhi High Court order dismissing his claim that he was a juvenile when the crime was committed.

A bench headed by Justice R Banumathi is hearing the plea of convict Pawan Kumar Gupta.

Gupta's counsel told the bench that the convict was minor at the time of commission of offence in December 2012 and the high court had wrongly dismissed plea.

The bench said the claim of being a juvenile was not taken initially during trial in the Nirbhaya case. However, Gupta's lawyer contended that it was taken as a 'mitigating circumstance' at the time of sentencing in the case.

Gupta had moved the apex court on Friday. He has also sought a direction restraining the authorities from executing the death penalty, scheduled for February 1.

A Delhi court on Friday issued fresh death warrants for February 1 against the four convicts -- Vinay Sharma, Mukesh Kumar, Akshay Kumar Singh and Pawan -- in the case.

A 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was gang-raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012, in a moving bus in south Delhi by six people before she was thrown out on the road.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nirbhaya-case--sc-to-hear-at-12-45-pm-convict-s-plea-against-hc-order-rejecting-juvenility-claim-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/nirbhaya-case--sc-commences-hearing-on-convict-s-plea-against-hc-order-rejecting-juvenile-claim.html

203,20-1-20,Shaw slams 150 as Ind A hand NZ XI defeat,"Prithvi Shaw slammed a 100-ball 150 in India A’s 12-run victory over New Zealand XI in the second practice game here on Sunday, coming back from an injury in the manner that matched the hype around him.

Eyeing a return to the Indian senior team, the 20-year-old Shaw struck 22 fours and two sixes during his blazing knock at the Bert Sutcliffe Oval.

Shaw’s knock will certainly excite the selectors as they pick the squad for the Test series in New Zealand.

The first Test will get underway on February 21 at the Basin Reserve in Hamilton and the second match is scheduled to be played at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch, starting February 29.

Batting first, India A were all out for an imposing 372 in 49.2 over before restricting the home side to 360 for six to register their second win of the tour.

Shaw was in sparkling touch since returning from his eight-month doping ban, but a shoulder injury on the opening day of Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy game against Karnataka cut short his run, ruling him out of India A’s first practice match here.

Mayank Agarwal (32) and Shaw stitched an 89-run opening stand but the former was dismissed by pacer Andrew Hazeldine.

Skipper Shubman Gill (24), Suryakumar Yadav (26) and Ishan Kishan (14) alongside Shaw kept the scoreboard ticking, helping India reach 241 in 31 overs.

After the dismissal of Shaw in the beginning of the 35th over, all-rounder Vijay Shankar stamped his authority with a 41-ball 58.

Chasing 373, New Zealand suffered an early blow with opener Katene Clarke (1) departing in the second over. Josh Clarkson (14) soon followed, leaving the home team struggling at 2-27.

Opener Jack Boyle (130) and Finn Allen (87) kept New Zealand in the fight before the hosts ran out of overs.

For India, right-arm medium pacer Ishan Porel (2/39) and spinner Krunal Pandya (2/50) grabbed two wickets each.

Having recovered from the injury, Shaw has straightaway set his sights on his immediate goals, with a fine knock.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/shaw-slams-150-as-ind-a-hand-nz-xi-defeat.html
204,20-1-20,Masvaure fifty helps Zim to solid start against SL,"Prince Masvaure struck his maiden Test fifty while opening partner Kevin Kasuza approached a half-century on debut as Zimbabwe reached 108 for 1 at tea on the first day of the first Test against Sri Lanka in Harare.

Masvaure, playing in his third Test, made 55 before he was caught by Sri Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne off the slow left-arm bowling of Lasith Embuldeniya.

Kasuza was unbeaten on 48 following the afternoon session, having survived a dropped chance after he miscued a hook off Suranga Lakmal.

Zimbabwe captain Sean Williams elected to bat first despite overcast skies at the Harare Sports Club, where the African nation are playing their first home Test since 2017.

The hosts handed debuts to three players — opening batsman Kasuza, left-arm spinner Ainsley Ndlovu and seam bowler Victor Nyauchi — in their first Test match in 14 months.

Fast bowler Lakmal returned for Sri Lanka, having missed the entire Pakistan series, while Angelo Mathews was also included in an experienced side. The two-Test tour was only announced by the Sri Lankan cricket board earlier this week.

Zimbabwe were readmitted as an ICC member last October following a three-month suspension over political interference.

The Sri Lanka games represent their first Tests since a 1-1 series draw in Bangladesh in November 2018. Zimbabwe last played a Test at home against the West Indies in October 2017.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/masvaure-fifty-helps-zim-to-solid-start-against-sl.html
205,20-1-20,SA close to humiliating defeat,"England captain Joe Root produced a Test-best bowling performance to send South Africa hurtling towards a humiliating defeat on the fourth day of the third Test at St George’s Park on Sunday.

Root took four for 31 as South Africa slumped to 102 for six after being forced to follow on.

They were still 188 runs short of avoiding an innings defeat, with England seemingly assured of taking an unbeatable 2-1 series lead into the final Test starting in Johannesburg on Friday.

England dominated the day despite a second lengthy rain break in two days.

They needed only 28 balls to dismiss South Africa’s last four batsmen for the addition of a single run at the start of play, with Stuart Broad picking up three of the wickets without conceding a run.

South Africa were all out for 209 and Root immediately enforced the follow-on.

Rain early in South Africa’s second innings threatened to thwart England’s push for victory but fast bowler Mark Wood struck twice when play resumed more than three hours later.

Wood used his extreme pace to send Dean Elgar’s off stump flying out of the ground before he had Zubayr Hamza feeling for a ball outside his leg stump to present a catch to wicketkeeper Jos Buttler.

Then it was over to Root, who in 90 previous Tests had never taken more than two wickets in an innings.

Bowling from the end where fellow off-spinner Dom Bess took five wickets in the first innings, he trapped Pieter Malan leg before wicket in the last over before tea. Root took three more wickets after the interval.

South Africa captain Faf du Plessis was sixth out after making 36, his highest score of what has been a poor series for him. He was another bat-pad victim, giving Pope his fifth catch of the match.

In overcast conditions at the start of play, Broad and Sam Curran achieved some swing with a ball which was almost new, but they were aided by some poor shots by the South African batsmen.

Broad struck with the fourth delivery of the morning when Vernon Philander missed a drive against a full delivery which swung in between bat and pad. He was out for 27.

Curran uprooted De Kock’s middle stump with the fifth ball of the next over with the left-hander missing an extravagant drive against a ball angled in from the left-armed bowler.

De Kock had not added to his overnight score of 63.

Keshav Maharaj was bowled off a bottom edge when he tried to pull a ball from Broad before Kagiso Rabada, who scored the only run in the collapse, hit a simple catch to mid-off to give Broad his third wicket.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sa-close-to-humiliating-defeat.html
206,20-1-20,Pollard's 4 wicket went in vain,"Captain Kieron Pollard produced the best bowling spell by a West Indian in Twenty20 International cricket on Saturday before rain forced the second match of a three-game series against Ireland to be abandoned.

Pollard took 4-25 as Ireland were limited to 147-9 in a clash reduced to 19 overs a side.

Set a rain-revised target of 152 to win, the West Indies reached 16-1 after 2.2 overs before rain caused another in a series of stoppages.

Umpired eventually called the game off as a no result. Ireland lead the series 1-0 after their dramatic four-run win in the opener in Grenada on Wednesday.

The third and final game is also in St Kitts on Sunday.

Pollard ripped the heart out of the Irish middle order by removing top scorer Gareth Delany, whose 44 included five sixes, skipper Andy Balbirnie (36) as well Gary Wilson (five) and George Dockrell (two).

Fast bowler Sheldon Cottrell also starred with two wickets, including dangerous opener Paul Stirling who was caught in the deep for just 17.

Stirling had smashed a 47-ball 95 in the first game.

Ireland lost three wickets on the last three balls of their innings Saturday, two of them off run-outs as they desperately scrambled to get past 150.

The West Indies would have been confident of chasing down the target although wary of their recent record at St Kitts.

In 2019, they were bowled out for just 45 and 71 against England.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/pollard-s-4-wicket-went-in-vain.html
207,20-1-20,"Aksh, Rinku give UP upper-hand against Mumbai","Uttar Pradesh batsman Aksh Deep Nath stuck an unbeaten hundred, which not only pulled his side out of trouble but also gave them an upper hand, on the opening day of their Elite Ranji Trophy Group B match against Mumbai here on Sunday.

Following an unbroken 137-run fifth-wicket stand between Nath (115 not out off 215 balls) andRinku Singh (71 not out off 134 balls; 7x4), UP ended the day at a decent 281/4 after being 48/3 at one stage at the Wankhede Stadium.

Mumbai pacers Akash Parkar (2-67) and Royston Dias (2 -48) initially dominated proceeding but later Nath stuck a patient hundred to ensure Mumbai could not capitalise on the early advantage.

Vidarbha take control vs Delhi

New Delhi :Veteran Wasim Jaffer’s masterclass was a purists’ delight as Delhi's strategy of preparing a result-oriented seaming track boomeranged with defending champions Vidarbha taking control on the opening day of the Ranji Trophy encounter.

On a track where players half his age were not able to cross 20-run mark, the former India opener, who is a month shy from being 42, scored 83 in his team's meagre total of 179.

With ball jagging around all day in cold and windy conditions, former India U-19 seamer Aditya Thakare (4/14) polished the Delhi top-order in a five-over burst to reduce the hosts to 41 for 4 at stumps.

The match is expected to get over inside three days and Delhi will have to depend on the pair of Nitish Rana (3 batting) and Lalit Yadav (0 batting) to at least ensure a respectable first innings total.

Thakare got the bowl to swing both ways as the likes of captain Dhruv Shorey was deceived by away movement and Jonty Sidhu squared up by late swing.

The day belonged to Jaffer, who showed the technique to bat on a track where the trio of Ishant Sharma (3/45 in 14 overs), Simarjeet Singh (4/39 in 16.5 overs) and Kulwant Khejroliya (2/50 in 18 overs) made life miserable for other players.

Tiwary put Bengal in command

Kalyani (WB): Former skipper Manoj Tiwary hit an unbeaten 156 and Shreevats Goswami a combative 95 as Bengal recovered from a shaky start to end the day one of their Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match against Hyderabad at a commanding 366 for five, here on Sunday.

Desperate for an outright win to keep their qualifying hopes alive, Bengal, who chose Kalyani over Eden Gardens, found the going tough early on to be reduced to 60 for three inside 15 overs.

Opener A Raman fell for a duck in the fifth ball of the day, edging Ravi Kiran (2/47) behind the stumps after Bengal elected to bat.

Skipper Abhimanyu Easwaran (12) continued his poor run while debutant Kazi Saifi, who was drafted in after his stupendous show at the U-23 level, could not convert his start to be dismissed for 27.

But it was Tiwary who showed a class act as he paced his innings beautifully to lead Bengal's recovery.

Number five Anustup Majumdar (59) also gave a fine support with 86-ball 59 (8x4) as the duo put on 112 runs for the fourth wicket.

TN take upperhand

Chennai: A superb performance by bowlers R Ashwin and M Siddharth and a ton by Abhinav Mukund gave Tamil Nadu the upperhand on the opening day of its Ranji Trophy Group B match against Railways here on Sunday.

Electing to bat, the visiting team folded for 76 in 39.1 overs as the experienced Ashwin (4/26) and left-arm spinner Siddharth (4/32) ran through the railways batting order.

At stumps, the hosts were sitting pretty putting up 236 for 4.

From 15 for no loss in the 8th over, the Railways batsmen came a cropper against Ashwin and Siddharth to be bundled out in the opening session of the game.It was a dismal display by the Railways batsmen as only three managed to reach double figures with Saurabh Singh (22) being the top-scorer.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/aksh--rinku-give-up-upper-hand-against-mumbai.html
208,20-1-20,"win More satisfying as Smith, Warner and Labuschagne are there: Kohli","India captain Virat Kohli was ""very satisfied"" with his team's comprehensive come-from-behind series win against a formidable Australian side that had Steve Smith, David Warner and rising star Marnus Labuschagne in its ranks.

""Australia were even better than last time. There's Steve (Smith), David (Warner)and Marnus (Labuschagne). A quality bowling attack, and really intense in the field too.

""We just want to go upwards and onwards. Getting one back given that we lost the series at home last year is really satisfying,” said Kohli.

The skipper was confident that an experienced side like theirs would pull off a tricky run-chase even in absence of an injured Shikhar Dhawan.

“We are quite experienced, Rohit and I, and we were short of Shikhar's experience. We got a good start. We expect openers of the quality of Rohit and KL to give us starts like that. When KL got out it was a tricky situation.

209,20-1-20,Dominant India take series,"Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli paced a tricky run chase with sublime knocks as India wrapped the series 2-1 with a comfortable seven-wicket victory in the decisive third ODI against Australia, here on Sunday.

Rohit (119 off 128) was due for a big score in the series and he delivered in the all-important game for his 29th ODI hundred.

India had a point to prove against Australia, having lost the home series to them in March last year. The 10-wicket drubbing in Mumbai did not deter India as they posted emphatic victories in Rajkot and here at the Chinnaswamy Stadium.

Following Rohit’s fall, Kohli (89 off 91) anchored the chase as India cantered to a the win in 47.3 overs. Shreyas Iyer remained unbeaten on 44 off 35 balls.

The 137-run stand between Rohit and Kohli effectively won the game for India, who overhauled the 287-run target with 15 balls to spare.

Steve Smith’s hundred helped Australia score 286 for nine after Aaron Finch opted to bat. Indian bowlers, led by Mohammad Shami (4/63), did well to limit Australia to under 300.

Rahul, who batted at three in Mumbai and five in Rajkot, came out to open alongside Rohit. He began with a beautiful punch on the off side but lasted only 27 balls after Australia took a successful LBW review off Ashton Agar.

Rohit scored bulk of runs in their 69-run opening stand.

Rohit became the third fastest to 9000 ODI runs while Kohli became the fastest batsman to score 5000 runs as skipper.

Earlier, India bounced back in the last 10 overs, conceding just 63 runs for five wickets.

Smith (131 off 132) rose to the occasion but did not get much support from the other batsmen. Shami was brilliant in the death overs striking thrice. The other substantial knock in the Australian innings came from Marnus Labuschagne (54 off 64).

Batting first Australia lost their in-form openers - David Warner (3) and Aaron Finch (19) — rather early. Targeting the off-stump channel initially, Shami induced an outside edge from Warner's bat with an away going delivery.

Smith was responsible for Finch's run out as he called his skipper for a run before changing his mind. Finch, who is usually calm and composed, was furious and used cuss words while walking back to the dressing room.

By the first powerplay, Australia reached 56 for two with Smith and Labuschagne in the middle. It was once again evident why they love batting together.

They both had stitched a 96-run stand on Friday and batted in a similar fashion, rotating the strike regularly and picking up an odd boundary enroute to their 127-run partnership.

Labuschagne, who made 46 in his first ODI innings during the Rajkot game but got out at the wrong time, went on to score a half-century on this occasion.

Alongside Smith, he looked set for a big knock until a diving Kohli sent him back with a stunning catch at cover.

Jadeja, who got the ball to turn on a dry pitch, got his second wicket of the over when he had Mitchell Starc, who was sent ahead of Alex Carey, caught at deep midwicket.

Smith was going along nicely at the other end but the team needed another substantial contribution to go past 300. He shared 58 runs for the fifth wicket with Carey (35) but the latter departed when the innings needed a move on.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dominant-india-take-series-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dominant-india-take-series.html

212,20-1-20,Nirbhaya case: SC rejects death row convict's plea claiming juvenility,"The Supreme Court on Monday rejected the plea of a death row convict in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case challenging the Delhi High Court order which had dismissed his claim of being a juvenile at the time of commission of offence.

A bench comprising Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bushan and A S Bopanna dismissed the plea of the death row convict, Pawan Kumar Gupta, and upheld the Delhi High Court verdict.

The apex court said there was no ground to interfere with the high court order that rejected Pawan's plea and his claim was rightly rejected by the trial court as also the high court.

Advocate A P Singh, appearing for Pawan, said that as per his school leaving certificate he was a minor at the time of the offence and none of the courts, including trial court and high court, ever considered his documents.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Delhi police, said that his claim of juvenility was considered at each and every judicial forum and it will be a travesty of justice if the convict is allowed to raise the clam of juvenility repeatedly and at this point of time.

He said the convict was 19 years old at the time of offence and there is a certified copy of his birth certificate as well as school leaving certificate which was taken on record by each and every judicial forum.

Pawan had moved the apex court on Friday. He has also sought a direction restraining the authorities from executing the death penalty, scheduled for February 1.

A Delhi court on Friday issued fresh death warrants for February 1 against the four convicts -- Vinay Sharma (26), Akshay Kumar Singh (31), Mukesh Kumar Singh (32) and Pawan (25) -- in the case.

A 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was gang-raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012, in a moving bus in south Delhi by six people before she was thrown out on the road.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nirbhaya-case--sc-to-pronounce-at-2-30-pm-order-on-death-row-convict-s-plea-claiming-juvenility-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/nirbhaya-case--sc-rejects-death-row-convict-s-plea-claiming-juvenility.html

214,20-1-20,Nadda elected BJP president,"J P Nadda was elected unopposed as the BJP's national president on Monday, taking over the reins from Amit Shah whose tenure of five-and-a-half years saw the party turning into a formidable election-winning machinery despite occasional setbacks.

The 59-year-old leader from Himachal Pradesh is seen as an affable and low-key politician who enjoys the trust of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the RSS -- the BJP's ideological mentor. He is largely expected to continue with the course it took under Shah with Modi laying out the broader agenda.

The Delhi assembly election is the first challenge for Nadda, who has been touring the capital extensively as the Bharatiya Janata Party works overtime to oust the Aam Aadmi Party from power.

BJP leader Radha Mohan Singh, who was the incharge of the organisational election process, made the announcement of Nadda's election as the party's 11th president after he emerged as the only nominee in the fray.

Modi later arrived at the party headquarters to felicitate the newly-elected president at a ceremony that was attended by members of the BJP parliamentary board, its highest body, and veterans like L K Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi.

Earlier, Shah was joined by senior party leaders, including Union ministers Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari, besides several functionaries from state units in filing nominations in support of Nadda.

BJP chief ministers like Yogi Adityanath of Uttar Pradesh and Vijay Rupani of Gujarat were also at the party headquarters to endorse his bid.

Nadda's elevation was on expected lines since his appointment as the BJP working president last June after Shah joined the Modi government as the home minister. The BJP has traditionally abided by the norm of 'one party one post'.

BJP leaders hailed the appointment, expressing confidence that the party would achieve new successes under his leadership.

Shah congratulated Nadda and expressed confidence that under the new BJP president and the guidance of Modi, the party will scale new heights of success and grow from strength to strength.

Wishing Nadda a successful tenure, Rajnath Singh said: ""I am confident the party will achieve new glory and success under his leadership. Known for his organisational experience Naddaji has always been an asset to the party.""

Gadkari said the elevation of Nadda, who started as a common party worker and rose through its ranks, shows that the BJP was an organisation of workers unlike parties run by dynasties.

Nadda, considered an affable and accessible politician, enjoys good rapport with all top party leaders.

He is seen as seasoned organisation man, who was associated with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) from his college days before joining the youth wing of the BJP and rising through its ranks.

Nadda has also served as a minister in the BJP governments in Himachal Pradesh and at the Centre.

He has also been in charge of his party's campaigns in a number of states, including in Uttar Pradesh during the 2019 Lok Sabha election.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nadda-elected-bjp-president-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/nadda-elected-bjp-president.html

222,20-1-20,Wealth of India's richest 1% more than 4-times of total for 70% poorest: Oxfam,"India's richest 1 per cent hold more than four-times the wealth held by 953 million people who make up for the bottom 70 per cent of the country's population, while the total wealth of all Indian billionaires is more than the full-year budget, a new study said on Monday.

Releasing the study 'Time to Care' here ahead of the 50th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF), rights group Oxfam also said the world's 2,153 billionaires have more wealth than the 4.6 billion people who make up 60 per cent of the planet's population.

The report flagged that global inequality is shockingly entrenched and vast and the number of billionaires has doubled in the last decade, despite their combined wealth having declined in the last year.

""The gap between rich and poor can't be resolved without deliberate inequality-busting policies, and too few governments are committed to these,"" said Oxfam India CEO Amitabh Behar, who is here to represent the Oxfam confederation this year.

The issues of income and gender inequality are expected to figure prominently in discussions at the five-day summit of the WEF, starting Monday. The WEF's annual Global Risks Report has also warned that the downward pressure on the global economy from macroeconomic fragilities and financial inequality continued to intensify in 2019.

Concern about inequality underlies recent social unrest in almost every continent, although it may be sparked by different tipping points such as corruption, constitutional breaches, or the rise in prices for basic goods and services, as per the WEF report.

Although global inequality has declined over the past three decades, domestic income inequality has risen in many countries, particularly in advanced economies and reached historic highs in some, the Global Risks Report flagged last week.

The Oxfam report further said ""sexist"" economies are fuelling the inequality crisis by enabling a wealthy elite to accumulate vast fortunes at the expense of ordinary people and particularly poor women and girls.

Regarding India, Oxfam said the combined total wealth of 63 Indian billionaires is higher than the total Union Budget of India for the fiscal year 2018-19 which was at Rs 24,42,200 crore.

""Our broken economies are lining the pockets of billionaires and big business at the expense of ordinary men and women. No wonder people are starting to question whether billionaires should even exist,"" Behar said.

As per the report, it would take a female domestic worker 22,277 years to earn what a top CEO of a technology company makes in one year.

With earnings pegged at Rs 106 per second, a tech CEO would make more in 10 minutes than what a domestic worker would make in one year.

It further said women and girls put in 3.26 billion hours of unpaid care work each and every day -- a contribution to the Indian economy of at least Rs 19 lakh crore a year, which is 20 times the entire education budget of India in 2019 (Rs 93,000 crore).

Besides, direct public investments in the care economy of 2 per cent of GDP would potentially create 11 million new jobs and make up for the 11 million jobs lost in 2018, the report said.

Behar said the gap between rich and poor cannot be resolved without deliberate inequality-busting policies, and too few governments are committed to these.

He said women and girls are among those who benefit the least from today's economic system.

""They spend billions of hours cooking, cleaning and caring for children and the elderly. Unpaid care work is the 'hidden engine' that keeps the wheels of our economies, businesses and societies moving.

""It is driven by women who often have little time to get an education, earn a decent living or have a say in how our societies are run, and who are therefore trapped at the bottom of the economy,” Behar added.

Oxfam said governments are massively under-taxing the wealthiest individuals and corporations and failing to collect revenues that could help lift the responsibility of care from women and tackle poverty and inequality.

Besides, the governments are also underfunding vital public services and infrastructure that could help reduce women and girls' workload, the report said.

As per the global survey, the 22 richest men in the world have more wealth than all the women in Africa.

Besides, women and girls put in 12.5 billion hours of unpaid care work each and every day -- a contribution to the global economy of at least USD 10.8 trillion a year, more than three times the size of the global tech industry.

Getting the richest one per cent to pay just 0.5 per cent extra tax on their wealth over the next 10 years would equal the investment needed to create 117 million jobs in sectors such as elderly and childcare, education and health.

Governments must prioritise care as being as important as all other sectors in order to build more human economies that work for everyone, not just a fortunate few, Behar said.

Oxfam said its calculations are based on the latest data sources available, including from the Credit Suisse Research Institute's Global Wealth Databook 2019 and Forbes' 2019 Billionaires List.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/wealth-of-india-s-richest-1--more-than-4-times-of-total-for-70--poorest--oxfam-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/wealth-of-india-s-richest-1--more-than-4-times-of-total-for-70--poorest--oxfam.html

225,20-1-20,IMF lowers India growth estimate to 4.8% for 2019,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday lowered growth estimate for India to 4.8 per cent for 2019, citing stress in the non-bank financial sector and weak rural income growth as the major factors for the downward revision.

While providing an update on the global economy ahead of the start of the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual summit, the IMF cut its India growth forecast to 4.8 per cent for 2019.

It expects growth to be 5.8 per cent in 2020 and rise to 6.5 per cent in 2021.

India-born IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said growth in India slowed sharply owing to stress in the non-bank financial sector and weak rural income growth.

China's growth has been revised upward by 0.2 per cent to 6 per cent for 2020, reflecting the trade deal with the United States, she added.

In India, the IMF said domestic demand has slowed more sharply than expected amid stress in the non-bank financial sector and a decline in credit growth.

India's growth is estimated at 4.8 per cent in 2019, projected to improve to 5.8 per cent in 2020 and 6.5 percent in 2021 (1.2 and 0.9 percentage point lower than in the October WEO), supported by monetary and fiscal stimulus as well as subdued oil prices, it added.

Gopinath also said the pickup in global growth for 2020 remains highly uncertain as it relies on improved growth outcomes for stressed economies like Argentina, Iran, and Turkey and for underperforming emerging and developing economies such as Brazil, India, and Mexico.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/imf-lowers-india-growth-estimate-to-4-8--for-2019-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/imf-lowers-india-growth-estimate-to-4-8--for-2019.html

While four persons were gored to death by the charging bulls in the arena itself, one person succumbed to injuries later in hospital. But this has not prevented the organisers from going ahead with the controversial sport in different venues in the State.

Three bull tamers were killed in Madurai’s Avaniiyapuram village, while two deaths were reported from Alanganalloor village and Tiruchirappalli district.

All those who lost their lives were of below 30 years of age. A six-year-old girl, Vinoba, has been admitted to hospital with grievous injuries she suffered when a bull which came out of the arena hit her. She was watching the sport with her father when the mishap occurred.

More than 50 persons have been admitted to different hospitals with serious injuries.

“The situation in Tamil Nadu is serious. It is like the gladiators fighting the bulls in the coliseums in Rome. People cheer up the bulls as they charge into the people from the vadivasal (narrow gate separating the bulls from the bull tamers). The sad thing is that though the human beings know that it is a sporting event, the poor animals are ignorant about the sports and pastime,” said an animal rights activist.

She pointed out that those who died in the event are people in the prime of youth.

Though Jallikattu was banned by the Supreme Court, the Tamil Nadu Government brought in an amendment to bypass the court verdict through an Ordinance so that the sporting event could be held without hindrance. Though the district administrations claim that Jallikattu was being held under stringent security measures, it has not helped in bringing down the death rate. The year 2019 saw 50 persons losing their lives in the sport.

“That’s the official figure. We do not have the count of people succumbing to the injuries suffered in the fight. Since the taming of bulls are held in different venues, the fate of persons suffering injuries are forgotten immediately. In most of the cases, it’s the breadwinner of the family who ends up as the martyr,” said Mangombu Gopalakrishnan, who watches the sport without fail.

Gopalakrishnan, a film director-cum-lyricist, is of the view that the event should be banned with immediate effect to prevent the death of the bread winners of the families. The animal rights activist and Gopalakrishnan also said that though the organisers claim that Jallikattu is held in connection with the harvest festival of Pongal, the sport lasts up to October every year.

“This means that there is no let up in the number of deaths happening in villages. In most cases, the venues are remote villages which are inaccessible,” he said.

Dr S Kalyanaraman, Indologist, is of the view that the modern day Jallikattu is nothing but the distorted version of Eru Thazhuthal (hugging of bulls) by farmers as part of showing respect to the animals that help them in farming operations,” said Kalyanaraman.

The initial days of Jallikattu which were held amidst tight security resulted in the death of five persons. Animal rights activists are tight-lipped about what is in store for the people as the rules become lax in coming days as the number of Jallikattu events spread out across the State.

In another development, the number of rooster fights which are held as part of Pongal festivities too have gone up. Rooster fights are games involving high stake gambling and are a rage among the rural folks.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/5-die-still-jallikattu-all-the-rage-in-tn-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/5-die-still-jallikattu-all-the-rage-in-tn.html
227,20-1-20,JNUSU to move HC against hike in hostel fees,"Refusing to accept the hike in hostel fees by the Jawahar Lal Nehru University administration, the JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) on Sunday said it will approach the Delhi High Court on January 20 to seek a direction for quashing the new hostel manual which has provisions for fee hike. The petition shall also seek registration at “old rates without late fines”, they said.

In a statement issued on Sunday, the JNUSU said it will file the plea on Monday against the Inter-Hall Administration manual which, it claimed, was passed “illegally” in October without taking the feedback of the Union.

The JNUSU, which has been on strike on the issue for close to three months, urged the remaining students to boycott of registration.

Early this month, the university had witnessed tussle between student groups over the issue of registration. Amid the stir, masked men had gone on a rampage on January 5 in the campus assaulting students and teachers and storming hostels, drawing widespread outrage.

The JNUSU also appealed to students to boycott exams and classes till they get “buffer time” to complete the academic backlog of the Monsoon Semester 2019. “Furthermore, taking exams and/or classes at this juncture will only create more chaos and ruckus and lead to another bifurcation in the student community that has been resolutely and unitedly fighting tooth and nail against this draconian VC and his political masters,” the JNUSU said.

They also demanded that the JNU administration should “annul and completely quash all punitive actions on students who have been struggling against the exorbitant fee hike”.

According to the agitating students, they were not invited to the meeting where the IHA Manual was passed, which according to them has provisions for hostel fee hike and no reservation policy for students from marginalised sections for getting hostel accommodation.

The university had offered a partial rollback of fee hike by offering relaxation for students belonging to below poverty line (BPL) category in November. When the agitation by students refused to end, the administration had formed a high-level committee to discuss the revised hostel manual and hostel charges.

The committee had recommended that the utility and service charge be reduced from Rs 2,000 per month to Rs 1,000 a month for all students.

The Human Resource Development Ministry had also intervened and held negotiations with the administration and students. It had said that the UGC will take care of the service and utility charges.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/jnusu-to-move-hc-against-hike-in-hostel-fees.html

229,20-1-20,Indian-American Prof calls for action against CAA,"An Indian-American Professor has called fro actions against India's Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), saying it was not just about the Muslims but effected anyone who is attached to the country, the media reported.

Anjali Arondekar, Director of the Center for South Asian Studies, University of California, Santa Cruz, was among the 300 signatories opposing the recent attack on the students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi, the implementation of CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Speaking to to Indica news, Arondekar said the CAA and the JNU attack were ""clearly connected"", and the escalation of unhitched violence against students at the varsity ""makes it even more pressing for us to link the two events together, which they obviously were"".

The professor added that the situation at JNU carries great weight for her precisely because of the threat it poses to the future of public education in South Asia, and in the world at large.

""The unprecedented attack against students at JNU amplifies the concerns scholars have been expressing since the discriminatory citizenship registry efforts began in Assam,"" said Arondekar, who has a Ph.D., from the University of Pennsylvania and a B.A., from Cornell University

When asked if this was a new India, Arondekar told Indica news: ""No, not at all. This is not a new India. This is the India that has always been around, but the last 10 years of the rise of BJP has made it impossible for this India to shine.""",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/indian-american-prof-calls-for-action-against-caa-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/indian-american-prof-calls-for-action-against-caa.html
230,20-1-20,This blood test may predict onset of tuberculosis,"Researchers, including one of Indian-origin, have revealed a blood test could predict the onset of tuberculosis three to six months before people become unwell, a finding which could help better target antibiotics and save countless lives.

For the findings, published in the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine, researchers at University College London sought to identify which, if any, gene expression signatures in blood could be used to predict the disease at a very early stage and before symptoms

Gene expression signatures are single or combined measurements of levels of specific gene products and are being tested in a range of diseases to aid diagnosis, prognosis or prediction of the response to treatment.

Some are already being used to support the management of cancers, but none have reached the clinic in infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB).

""Our findings establish the gene signatures in blood which show most promise for identifying people who are at risk of disease,"" said study author Mahdad Noursadeghi, Professor at University College London.

""Future development of a blood test based on these findings could make an important contribution to efforts to reduce the impact and spread of this deadly infection,"" Noursadeghi added.

For this study, researchers initially conducted a systematic review of published gene signatures found to be present in blood samples from people with TB, compared to healthy individuals.

From this, 17 candidate gene expression signatures for TB were identified, and tested in more than 1,100 blood samples in published data sets from South Africa, Ethiopia, The Gambia, and the UK. Scientists analysed samples from people who had no TB symptoms at the time they gave blood.

Those people were then followed up to identify which participants developed TB in the subsequent months.

Researchers found that eight of these signatures, including measurement of expression of a single gene, could predict the diagnosis of TB within three to six months, which falls within the accuracy required by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for new diagnostic tests.

This accuracy was achieved, by revealing the patients' immune responses to bacteria before the symptoms of the disease develop.

""The emergence of gene expression signature tests, which can aid diagnosis and early treatment, provides real hope for the management of infectious diseases,"" said Indian-origin researcher and the study's lead author Rishi Gupta.

""In this study we identify multiple signatures to identify the onset of tuberculosis, which is extremely encouraging, potentially providing multiple targets for early detection,"" Gupta added.

Further development of these tests could help identify people who will benefit most from preventative antibiotic treatment, in order to reduce the occurrence of tuberculosis, the researchers said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/this-blood-test-may-predict-onset-of-tuberculosis-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/this-blood-test-may-predict-onset-of-tuberculosis.html
231,20-1-20,Novel blood test can predict onset of tuberculosis six months earlier,"A new blood test could predict the onset of tuberculosis (TB) three to six months before people become unwell, an advance that may help better treat the disease, and save countless lives, according to researchers, including one of Indian origin.

""In this study, we identify multiple signatures to identify the onset of tuberculosis, which is extremely encouraging, potentially providing multiple targets for early detection,"" said Gupta.

The researchers noted that gene expression signatures are being tested in a range of diseases to aid diagnosis, prognosis or prediction of the response to treatment.

Gene expression signature is a single or combined group of genes in a cell with a uniquely characteristic pattern of gene expression that occurs as a result of an altered or unaltered biological process or pathogenic medical condition.

Some are already being used to support the management of cancers, but none have reached the clinic in infectious diseases, such as TB, the researchers said.

For the latest study, the researchers initially conducted a systematic review of published gene signatures found to be present in blood samples from people with TB, compared to healthy individuals.

From this, 17 candidate gene expression signatures for TB were identified, and tested in more than 1,100 blood samples in published data sets from South Africa, Ethiopia, The Gambia, and the UK.

This accuracy was achieved by revealing the patients' immune responses to bacteria before the symptoms of the disease develop, the researchers said.

""Further development of these tests could help identify people who will benefit most from preventative antibiotic treatment, in order to reduce the occurrence of tuberculosis -- a disease which causes the greatest number of deaths worldwide due to any single infection.

""The availability of multiple signatures will help to broaden access to these tests,"" Gupta said.

Tuberculosis is a disease caused by a bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that most often affects the lungs, according to the researchers.

TB is spread from person to person through the air. When people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into the air, they said.

The researchers noted that worldwide, TB is one of the top 10 causes of death and in 2018 1.5 million people died from the disease.

""About one-quarter of the world's population is thought to have been infected with the bacteria that cause TB. The majority of these individuals remain well and cannot transmit the disease,"" said Professor Mahdad Noursadeghi from UCL.

232,20-1-20,Amazon India to include 10K EVs in delivery fleet by 2025,"E-commerce major Amazon India on Monday said its fleet of delivery vehicles in the country will include 10,000 EVs by 2025.

Amazon's rival, Flipkart had in June last year said it aims to replace 40 per cent of its delivery vans with electric vehicles (EVs) by March this year. The Walmart-owned company has deployed EVs in cities like Delhi, Hyderabad and Bengaluru.

Amazon, in a statement, said it piloted electric vehicles in several cities across India in 2019 and is now expanding this initiative across the country.

It added that learnings from the pilot have helped the company create scalable and long-term EV variants to build this large fleet.

The announcement comes days after the American e-tail giant had announced investment of USD 1 billion for digitising small and medium businesses, and creation of one million jobs by 2025.

""The fleet of 10,000 EVs - including three-wheeler and four-wheeler vehicles - has been designed and manufactured by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in India,"" Amazon noted in its statement.

In 2020, these vehicles will operate in over 20 cities of India - Delhi NCR, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune, Nagpur and Coimbatore, among others.

These EVs are in addition to the global commitment of one lakh EVs in the delivery fleet by 2030 announced in the Climate Pledge signed by Amazon.

As part of the pledge, Amazon had announced its plans to introduce 10,000 of EVs into its delivery fleet globally in 2022 and one lakh vehicles by 2030 – saving four million metric tonnes of carbon per year by 2030.

Amazon India said it has been working with several Indian OEMs to build a fleet of vehicles that ensure sustainable and safe deliveries of customer orders.

The government's focus to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles in the country, and steps towards setting up of charging infrastructure with the FAME 2 policy has helped the company accelerate and chart its vision for EVs in India, it added.

""At Amazon India, we are committed to building a supply chain that will minimise the environmental impact of our operations,"" Amazon Vice President, Customer Fulfillment - APAC and Emerging Markets Akhil Saxena said.

He added that the company will continue to invest in electrification of its delivery fleet, thereby reducing its dependence on non-renewable resources.

""During our meeting with the BJP, we were asked to reconsider our stand on CAA but we declined to do so. Shiromani Akali Dal is of the firm stand that Muslims cannot be left out of CAA.

234,20-1-20,"NPR dangerous game, states need to exercise caution: Mamata","West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday appealed to her counterparts in the northeast and non-BJP states to study carefully the NPR form, its questions and criteria, before arriving at a decision on updating it.

She also asserted that a resolution would soon be passed in the West Bengal Assembly against the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Dubbing the NPR exercise as ""a dangerous game"", Banerjee said the form, which seeks birth details and residential proof of parents, was nothing but a precursor to NRC implementation.

""I will appeal to all chief ministers, governments including those in BJP-ruled northeast states - Tripura, Assam, Manipur and Arunachal - and the opposition party-ruled states to read the law properly and consider the clauses in the NPR form before arriving at a decision.

""I request them not to participate in this matter because the condition is very bad,"" she said.

Banerjee also said that she came to know from the media that sections in the NPR form which seek birth details of parents were not mandatory.

""If the fields are not mandatory, why are they a part of the form? Efforts should be made to remove those questions. If they continue to exist on paper (form), those that do not enter birth details of parents might be automatically excluded. There is an apprehension..."" she claimed.

The Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo contended that the West Bengal Assembly would adopt a resolution against the amended Citizenship Act in three to four days.

""We have earlier passed a resolution against NPR. Next, the Assembly will take up a resolution against the citizenship law withing three to four days,"" she insisted.

Earlier this month, the TMC had prevented the passage of an anti-CAA resolution in the Assembly, even as the Congress and the CPI(M) pitched for it.

The CM reasoned that the House had already adopted a resolution against a pan-India NRC in September last year, which, in turn, denounced according Indian citizenship to people on the basis of religion.

Incidentally, Kerala and Punjab have passed a resolution against the citizenship law.

The chief minister, after inaugurating the Uttarbanga Utsab in Siliguri, later in the day, said she would not be able to provide all details sought in the form.

""Earlier, I had thought that NPR was only a regular exercise for census update. But after looking at the columns, which sought date of birth and address of parents, I realised that I will not be able to provide them that information... I do not have them,"" she said.

Justifying her decision of not participating in a meeting convened by the Centre on NPR, Banerjee said she was happy to be the only one to skip it.

""Many people, who had spoken on the matter (NPR update), went to participate in the meeting. I am the only one who did not go. At least one person protested. I would request you all to rethink..."" she said, reciting Rabindranath Tagore's patriotic song 'Jodi Tor Dak Shune Keu Na Ase Tobe Ekla Cholo Re' (If no one responds to your call, walk alone).

""They (Centre) have misguided you (participating CMs) by telling that the column to provide your parents' details is not mandatory. If it was so, why don't you pass a resolution to withdraw those fields from the NPR form,"" she said.

Apparently referring to the attacks on university campuses in several parts of the nation, she said, ""What is happening in the country at this juncture in not right. Students are our future.""

Banerjee, describing herself as the custodian of common people, iterated that NPR and NRC would not be implemented in West Bengal.

""Nobody will be able to snatch away our rights. This state is ours. Do not think we are there only when elections are around. I am the custodian of common people. I am not going to listen to them (Centre) unless the necessary changes are made in the NPR form,"" she added.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/npr-dangerous-game--states-need-to-exercise-caution--mamata-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/npr-dangerous-game--states-need-to-exercise-caution--mamata.html
235,20-1-20,'BJP rewards its common workers': Shah's message as he passes the baton to Nadda,"Handing over the party's baton to JP Nadda, outgoing BJP president Amit Shah on Monday said the party doesn't function on the basis of casteism and dynasty and has a vibrant democracy that rewards its common workers.

Addressing BJP workers at the party headquarters here after Nadda was elected as the saffron party chief, Shah looked back at his five-and-a-half-year tenure with satisfaction.

""In the last five years, the party expanded its footprint across the country, won the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and registered victories in many states where it never dreamt it will. The party become the world's largest political party,"" he said.

Shah emerged on the national scene after the BJP won 71 seats out of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh during the 2014 elections under his guidance as the party's general secretary and in-charge for the state.

Later, he was unanimously elected as the BJP president and the party won many states for the first time such as Haryana, Assam and Tripura among others under his stewardship.

While the BJP expanded to new territories under Shah, it also consolidated its presence and emerged as winner in Maharashtra, Uttrakhand and Jharkhand. The massive victory in politically crucial state of Uttar Pradesh also came during his tenure.

But BJP's electoral highs under Shah were interspersed with some setbacks as well, with the party facing defeats in Delhi and Bihar.

His most challenging year was the year of general election: 2019.

The party had lost three key states -- Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh -- as it headed for the Lok Sabha elections.

But it made a remarkable comeback and registered a bigger victory in 2019 Lok Sabha elections -- winning 303 seats on its own -- compared to 2014.

Shah, who is known as tough task master, on Monday said he might have been strict with the party workers at times but that was in the larger interest of the organisation.

On completion of his tenure, Shah said he might have made some mistakes but he got cooperation and support from all party workers across the country.

Shah, who is the party's most successful president till date in terms of electoral victories, has left an ever last impression on the BJP and it will be a tough task for his successor to replicate his successes.

Applauding Shah's contribution to the party as its president, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, ""His tenure will always be remembered.""

Modi said it is a challenging task for the party to keep fighting when it is in power, but under Amit Shah's leadership it remained active and worked day and night and expanded across the country, which is amazing.

Wishing Nadda well for the future, Shah said the party will touch newer heights under his leadership and urged the partymen to work hard to widen its base further.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-bjp-rewards-its-common-workers---shah-s-message-as-he-passes-the-baton-to-nadda-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/-bjp-rewards-its-common-workers---shah-s-message-as-he-passes-the-baton-to-nadda.html
236,20-1-20,Cong iffy on States’ CAA ambit,"Legal eagles Sibal, Khurshid say States can’t disobey Central law; party says they can’t be forced

With its own leaders citing the rulebook to press upon the fact that States cannot say no to implement a law passed by Parliament, in this case the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, a red-faced Congress on Sunday sought to undo the damage by calibrating its stance on the issue.

Until the Supreme Court takes a decision on the matter, States cannot be forced to implement the “unconstitutional law”, the Congress asserted even as it maintained that like Punjab, the other States ruled by it are thinking about bringing a resolution against the CAA.

It said repeated statements by Home Minister Amit Shah and the Governors on “forcing” States to implement the CAA was against constitutional federalism and the people’s movement against the legislation will “go on fearlessly”.

“Let the BJP Government and its Governors not forget that India is a Union of States. States can disagree with the Union and challenge the same by way of their constitutional right under Article 131 of the Constitution,” Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said in a statement that also came against the backdrop of an ongoing tussle between the Kerala Governor and the Pinarayi Vijayan dispensation over the CAA.

However, the Congress’ statement came not before another of its senior leader and former Union Minister Salman Khurshid backed party colleague Kapil Sibal’s remark earlier that States cannot say “no’’ to a law passed by Parliament. Sibal reiterated his assertion on Sunday too saying if the law is declared constitutional by the Supreme Court then it will be problematic to oppose it.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, meanwhile, rejected allegations that the Narendra Modi Government was selective in granting citizenship and said singer Adnan Sami and author Taslima Nasreen were among the over 3,900 people who had been given Indian citizenship in the last six years.

While senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel said party-ruled Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan too are contemplating to pass a resolution against the CAA to send out a clear message to the Central Government to reconsider the legislation, Khurshid said, “If something is on the statute book, you have to obey law, else there are consequences. If the Supreme Court doesn’t interfere, it will remain on the statute book.”

“It is a matter where the State Governments have a very serious difference of opinion with the Centre as far as this (CAA) law is concerned. So, we would wait for the final pronouncement made by the top court. Ultimately, the top court will decide and till then everything said, done, not done is provisional and tentative.”

Sibal, who was participating in the Kerala Literature Festival (KLF) at Kozhikode on Saturday, had said that “a State cannot say no to a law cleared by Parliament”.

Though he sought to play down the controversy saying every State Assembly has the constitutional right to pass a resolution and seek the amended Citizenship Act’s withdrawal, nevertheless, he reiterated, “When and if the law is declared to be constitutional by the Supreme Court then it will be problematic to oppose it. The fight must go on!”

His remarks had caused a flutter as several non-BJP Governments, including Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Maharashtra have voiced their disagreement with the CAA as well as National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

“If the CAA is passed no State can say ‘I will not implement it’,” Sibal said.

“It is not possible and is unconstitutional. You can oppose it, you can pass a resolution in the Assembly and ask the Central Government to withdraw it. But constitutionally saying that I won’t implement, it is going to be problematic and going to create more difficulties,” the former Law Minister had said.

Defending the CAA, Sitharaman maintained there was no necessity to mix up the NRC and NPR with the CAA and appealed to those opposing the Act not to make allegations that would lead to unrest among the public.

She was addressing a CAA event in Chennai as part of BJP’s nationwide ‘Jan Jagran Abhiyan’ campaign in support of the Act.

The CAA provides for granting citizenship to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian minorities who faced religious persecution and fled from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh, and came to India on or before December 31, 2014.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cong-iffy-on-states----caa-ambit-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/cong-iffy-on-states----caa-ambit.html
237,20-1-20,"I’m not mute spectator, Kerala Guv raps Govt","Arif seeks report from Govt for not informing him on anti-CAA petition

Amid escalation of war of words between him and the LDF Government, Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan made it clear on Sunday he will not remain a “mute spectator” as he sought a report from it over moving the Supreme Court against the Citizenship (Amendmend) Act, or CAA, without informing him.

Days after the Governor hit out at the Pinarayi Vijayan Government for not informing him before moving the apex court and declaring that he was not a “rubber stamp”, the Raj Bhavan sought the report from the State Chief Secretary on the matter. “The Governor’s office has sought a report from the Chief Secretary for not informing him about the State’s move to approach the apex court against the CAA,” a top Raj Bhavan source told PTI on Sunday.

Confirming that he had sought the report, Khan, who arrived here this evening from Bengaluru, told reporters that it should not be seen as a “personal fight”. “This is not personal fight. My only concern is that the Constitution and the law must be upheld and the business of the Government must be transacted in accordance with the law”, he said.

Khan’s stand had drawn the ire of ruling front with CPI (M) mouthpiece Deshabhimani slamming him for making “political statements” and alleging he was “threatening” the state in a “tough language”.

However, the Government has said it did not violate any rules and no deliberate attempts had been made to challenge the authority of the Governor’s office.

Law Minister AK Balan had said on Saturday the Government would clear all apprehensions raised by Khan.

Days after passing a resolution in the assembly against the CAA, the Kerala Government had on January 13 approached the SC.

An upset Khan had on Thursday said it was “improper” and protocol and courtesy demanded that he should have been informed by the Government prior to moving the court.

Khan, who has been at loggerheads with the LDF regime since it convened a special Assembly session to pass the resolution seeking scrapping of the CAA, on Sunday said the Government moving the court without his knowledge was an illegal act.

“This is in contravention of the rules. This is an illegal act. I am not fighting any personal vengeance. I am just pointing out that the law and Constitution must be upheld,” he said.

When pointed out that the Law Minister had said no rule had been violated by the state government, the Governor challenged him to show the law.

“Let him quote the Law. I am quoting here. Even after this, you are saying somebody has given his personal opinion. I am giving you the law. What the Government has done was illegal. Let them show me the provision. I will take everything back. I will not sit like a mute spectator. I have to ensure that the Constitution and the law are upheld”.

Khan further said, “Please do not make it as a personal fight. I am not important. What is more important is the Constitution and the law of the land. My only point is that the transactions of business of the state must be done according to the law.

Attacking Vijayan, the Governor had earlier said the public affairs and the business of the Government cannot be run in accordance with the “whims of an individual or a political party” and everyone has to respect the rules.

Khan had told reporters in Delhi on Friday that as per Rule of Business Sec 34 (2) sub section 5, the state government should inform the Governor regarding matters that affect the relations between the state and the Centre.

CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury on Sunday said in independent India the post of governor was superfluous.

“Now we are not subjects of the Central Government. We need to start the discussions whether the post of governor is required or not,” he said here.

The Governor’s role was that of a representative of the President, he said adding it was a continuation of the colonial era.

Meanwhile, CPI-M state secretary, Kodiyeri Balakrishnan alleged Khan was making “unnecessary interference” in the day-to-day affairs of the State Government.

“The Governor is defaming a State Government which was elected by the people of the State. The post of Governor is not to defame the State Government,” Balakrishnan said in an article in the party newspaper.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/i---m-not-mute-spectator---kerala-guv-raps-govt-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/i---m-not-mute-spectator---kerala-guv-raps-govt.html
238,20-1-20,"Protesters claim cops took away blankets, police reject rumour","A group of women protesting against the CAA at the Ghantaghar Park in Hussainabad area of Lucknow on Sunday alleged policemen took away their blankets and food stuff. However, police rejected the allegations.

On the lines of Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, the women along with children have been squatting near the Clock Tower (Ghantaghar) in Lucknow’s Old City since Friday night, protesting against the CAA and NRC.

The women protesters alleged that blankets provided to them by some organisations were taken away by the police. Rejecting the allegation, the Lucknow Police said, “During the illegal protest at Lucknow’s Ghantaghar Park (Clock Tower), some people tried to make a “gheraa” (cordon) using ropes and sticks, and also tried to put sheets. They were not allowed to do so. Some organisations were distributing blankets on the park premises as a result of which people living in the vicinity and not part of the protests were coming to take the blankets.”

“Police removed those persons and organisations distributing blankets there, and action is being initiated against them,” the Lucknow police said, and urged people not to spread rumours. Lucknow’s police commissioner Sujeet Pandey also dismissed the allegations levelled by the protesters.

However, a 27-second video clip emerged on social media which purportedly shows a policeman carrying blankets and sheets in a plastic bag and later putting them in police jeeps. A woman is seen in the video shouting at a policeman and calling him “thief”, but police personnel did not respond to it.

The protest at Lucknow’s Ghantaghar started on Friday night and later several others from different parts of the city joined it as the night advanced.

The BJP said the protest by the women was “sponsored by the Congress and the Samajwadi Party”.

The protest by women at the national Capital’s Shaheen Bagh against the CAA and NRC has been going on for over a month now. Besides Delhi, protests have unfolded in several parts of the country over the new citizenship law since it was passed on December 11 and have led to clashes at several places, including Uttar Pradesh.

According to the amended citizenship law, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 due to religious persecution there, will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/protesters-claim-cops-took-away-blankets--police-reject-rumour-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/protesters-claim-cops-took-away-blankets--police-reject-rumour.html
239,20-1-20,"CAA, NRC unnecessary but ‘internal matters’ of India, says Hasina","Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has termed as “internal matters” of India the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA, and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), but at the same time said the act was “not necessary”.

“We don’t understand why (the Indian government) did it. It was not necessary. “(Still), it is an internal affair,” Hasina told the Gulf News in an interview, referring to India’s new citizenship law.

Her comments came weeks after Bangladesh Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen said that the CAA and the NRC are India’s “internal issues”, but voiced concern that any “uncertainty” in the country is likely to affect its neighbours.

Hasina, who is in the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi, also said that there has been no recorded reverse migration from India. “No, there is no reverse migration from India. But within India, people are facing many problems,” she said.

“Bangladesh has always maintained that the CAA and NRC are internal matters of India,” Hasina said. “The Government of India, on their part, has also repeatedly maintained that the NRC is an internal exercise of India and Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi has in person assured me of the same during my visit to New Delhi in October 2019.”

She said the relationship between Bangladesh and India is currently at its best, with cooperation in a “wide spectrum of areas”.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/caa--nrc-unnecessary-but----internal-matters----of-india--says-hasina.html
240,20-1-20,Trump hails China trade deal as 'much better' than expected,"President Donald Trump on Sunday hailed the trade deal signed last week with China for dramatically improving relations with Beijing, saying it was ""much better"" than he expected.

The ""phase one"" deal marks a truce in the two countries' trade war after nearly two years of tensions.

But with tariffs still in place on two-thirds of more than USD 500 billion worth of imports from China, US consumers and businesses will be left to foot the bill.

""This is an incredible success for our entire country,"" Trump said Sunday evening at a rally in Austin, Texas. He was speaking to a convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation.

""I think China's gonna go all out to prove that the agreement that was signed is a good agreement. It's much bigger and much better than I ever thought we'd get,"" he said.

Trump also praised a new chapter in relations with Beijing, calling it ""the best relationship that we've ever had with China in many, many years."" ""China respects us now,"" Trump said.

""They didn't respect us. They couldn't believe they were getting away with what they were getting away with.""

The US and China signed ""phase one"" of their trade deal on Wednesday, bringing relief to stock markets after prolonged trade friction.

The deal is also a boon for Trump as he faces an impeachment trial in the Senate this week, followed by a tough re-election fight.

The agreement includes pledges from China to beef up purchases of US agricultural goods and other exports for two years, provides some protections for US technology, and new enforcement mechanisms that allow Washington to quickly impose penalties that Beijing cannot respond to.

Chinese state-run newspapers hailed the signing of the ""hard-fought agreement"", but warned that it would ""not take much to banjax the deal"" and bring tensions to a head again.

The most difficult issues remain to be dealt with in ""phase two"" negotiations, including China's massive subsidies for state industry.

And elements of the deal the administration has touted as achievements effectively take the relationship between the two powers back to where it was before Trump took office.

Additionally, a senior administration official told reporters on January 16 that China has not made any specific commitments to cut tariffs it has imposed on US goods in retaliation.

Trump has repeatedly touted the trade pact as a win for American farmers, who were hit hard by the tariff war.

Soybean exports to China plunged to USD 3 billion from more than USD 12 billion in 2017 and the Trump administration paid out USD 28 billion in aid to farmers in the past two years.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-hails-china-trade-deal-as--much-better--than-expected-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-hails-china-trade-deal-as--much-better--than-expected.html
241,20-1-20,"Police: 2 dead, 15 reportedly injured in Missouri shooting","Police in Kansas City, Missouri, say at least two people are dead and 15 people were reportedly injured in a shooting.

The shooting took place shortly before midnight Sunday, Kansas City police said at a press conference at the scene. A police spokesman said responding officers found “a chaotic scene” and had to call in help from around the city. Two people were found dead, including a woman in the parking lot.

Police believe the shooter is one of the deceased. The spokesman said the shooter opened fire on a line of people waiting to enter a bar, but the motive for the shooting wasn't immediately clear. The shooter was shot by an armed security guard, police said.

During the investigation, police heard that people — at least 15 — were showing up to local hospitals with injuries from the shooting. At least three people were in critical condition, police said.

The scene was near U.S. Highway 40. KSHB-TV, which had a reporter at the scene, identified the bar outside which the shooting took place as 9ine Ultra Lounge.

244,20-1-20,Iran says it may pull out of nuclear treaty over Europe dispute,"Iran said on Monday it will consider withdrawing from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) if a dispute over its atomic programme goes before the UN Security Council.

Britain, France and Germany launched a process last week charging Iran with failing to observe the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal, a move that could eventually see the Security Council reimpose international sanctions on the country.

Iran has accused the three EU member states of inaction over sanctions the United States reimposed on it after unilaterally withdrawing from the landmark accord in 2018.

The European move ""has no legal basis"" and if they take further measures ""Iran's withdrawal from the NPT will be considered,"" Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was quoted as saying by the Iranian parliament's website.

The landmark 2015 deal reached with Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States gave Iran relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.

Since the US pullout, Iran has progressively rolled back its commitments to the accord -- the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action -- in retaliation.

It has hit out at the three European nations that remain party to the JCPOA for failing to live up to their promises to ease the impact of US sanctions on its oil-based economy.

""If the Europeans return to the commitments, Iran will also stop reducing its commitments, but if the Europeans continue as they have been... We have different options,"" said Zarif.

The foreign minister said Iran's President Hassan Rouhani had warned former EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini about such consequences in three letters sent in 2018.

""It was stated in the president's letter that if this issue is referred to the Security Council, Iran's withdrawal from the NPT will be discussed but before that we can consider other (options),"" he said.

European officials have made it clear that the decision to trigger the dispute resolution mechanism was made in a bid to bring Iran back into compliance and save the accord.

But Iran's foreign ministry on Monday warned more measures could be taken in retaliation for the European move.

""If these talks continue, Iran is formulating a final and even more effective"" measure regarding the nuclear deal, spokesman Abbas Mousavi told a news conference in Tehran.

Asked by reporters to elaborate, Mousavi said it would be a ""serious"" measure, but he gave no further details.

""Different options are on the table for Iran that will be announced if a consensus is reached"" by its leaders, he said.

Iran has stressed the steps it has taken to roll back the nuclear deal can be reversed if its interests are realised.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/iran-says-it-may-pull-out-of-nuclear-treaty-over-europe-dispute-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/iran-says-it-may-pull-out-of-nuclear-treaty-over-europe-dispute.html
245,20-1-20,India takes big leap in gamma ray study,"Conceived in 2008, the much-awaited world’s second largest and indigenously-made MACE (Major Atmospheric Cherenkov Experiment) gamma ray telescope is all set to function from 2020 year-end. Once the MACE system is operational, India will find its place in the elite scientific community working in field of gamma ray study.

The telescope is next to the upcoming High Altitude Energy Gamma Ray (HAGAR) observatory at 14,000 feet at Hanle in Ladakh. It has a 21-metre diameter reflector and 45-metre height with 356 mirror panels.

The first and the biggest gamma ray telescope is in La Palma in Canary Islands set up jointly by Switzerland and Germany in 2011.

Scientists involved with the project said here that an array of seven telescopes for monitoring spectacular celestial events like explosion of stars, falling of matters into black holes and collision of extraterrestrial objects have already been installed. It will detect very high energy gamma rays in the energy range of 20GeV to 10 TeV using the earth’s atmosphere as part of its detection system.

“Commissioning trials of the MACE are being conducted presently,” said Nilay Bhatt from Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), which has played a lead role in setting up the project. He was sharing the details of the project at a curtain raiser for Vigyan Samagam to be held in the national Capital at National Science Centre where the MACE, one among various mega science projects being undertaken in India and abroad in collaboration with other countries, will be showcased.

Bhatt said, “Equipped with a large light collector consisting of 356 mirror panels of area 1 sqm each and 1,088 channel photomultiplier tube based imaging camera, MACE will detect extremely short (few nanoseconds) Cherenkov flashes generated by cosmic gamma rays.

“It is expected to start observations by the end of the year. To begin with it will observe a Supernova remnant called Crab to validate its performance and then it is open for explorations in space. We welcome Indian universities and institutes to make use of the facility,” he added.

MACE, which will be operated in the dark nights only, will also help understand the nature of cosmic accelerators and the radiation emission processes in extreme environments.

The telescope will help the scientific community enhance its understanding in the fields of astrophysics, fundamental physics, and particle acceleration mechanisms, explained Bhatt.

Fully designed and manufactured in India, the project is a collaboration of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TiFR ) from Mumbai and Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bengaluru besides Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC). It was manufactured by industrial partner Electronics Corporation of India Ltd (ECIL).",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-takes-big-leap-in-gamma-ray-study-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/india-takes-big-leap-in-gamma-ray-study.html

248,20-1-20,SpaceX in 'perfect' test of Crew Dragon emergency abort system,"SpaceX successfully tested its emergency abort system on an unmanned spacecraft moments after launch Sunday, according to a live broadcast of the event, the last major test before it plans to send NASA astronauts to the International Space Station.

""As far as we can tell thus far it was a picture-perfect mission,"" SpaceX founder Elon Musk told reporters.

He added that the first manned flight of the capsule will probably occur ""in the second quarter"", an event that would mark the first time in nine years that Americans have gone into space aboard an American rocket, rather than a Russian one.

The favourable outcome of the peril-filled test was good news for SpaceX and for NASA, which urgently needs to certify a vehicle to transport astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) this year.

""By all accounts, this was a very successful test,"" NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said.

The test launch began at 10:30 am (1530 GMT) at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida with the launch of a Falcon 9 rocket topped by SpaceX's new Crew Dragon spacecraft. The rocket was programmed to perform as if it were launching the capsule into orbit.

One minute and 24 seconds after launch, at an altitude of 19 kilometers (12 miles) over the Atlantic and as the rocket was travelling at a speed of more than 1,500 kilometers per hour, an emergency escape sequence was set in motion.

The spacecraft ignited its powerful SuperDraco thrusters, propelling it away from the rocket.

Shortly after the separation, the rocket disintegrated in a ball of fire, as planned.

On a manned mission, the maneuver is designed to rescue the astronauts if the rocket has a problem on ascent or veers off course.

Crew Dragon continued its upward trajectory alone reaching an altitude of about 40 kilometers before beginning its natural descent toward the Atlantic.

Four large parachutes opened to brake its descent and splashdown in the ocean, where recovery teams were pre-positioned. Nine minutes after launch, Crew Dragon was in the water, apparently without suffering damage.

Analysis of the spacecraft and flight data will confirm whether the test came off without a hitch, and whether the spacecraft is ready for manned missions.

Since 2011, the United States has had to rely on Russia's Soyuz rockets, the only ones capable of carrying astronauts to the space station once the US retired its space shuttle fleet.

NASA has a similar contract with Boeing, which has developed the Starliner spacecraft for manned flights.

In March 2019, SpaceX successfully made a one-week round trip to the ISS with an unmanned Crew Dragon.

American astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are slated to be passengers on the first manned SpaceX flight.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/spacex-in--perfect--test-of-crew-dragon-emergency-abort-system-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/spacex-in--perfect--test-of-crew-dragon-emergency-abort-system.html
249,20-1-20,"More than 100 killed in Yemen missile, drone attack","More than 100 people were killed and dozens wounded in a missile and drone attack blamed on Huthi rebels in central Yemen, officials said Sunday.

Saturday's strike follows months of relative calm in the war between the Iran-backed Huthis and Yemen's internationally recognised government, which is supported by a Saudi-led military coalition.

The Huthis attacked a mosque in a military camp in the central province of Marib -- about 170 kilometres (105 miles) east of the capital Sanaa -- during evening prayers, military sources told AFP.

""We strongly condemn the terrorist attack on a mosque by the Huthi militias... Which left more than 100 dead and dozens injured,"" the Yemeni foreign ministry said on Twitter.

An army spokesman said that the dead included soldiers and civilians, and that the Huthis would face a ""ruthless"" retaliation to the strike.

The victims were transported to a Marib city hospital, where a medical source earlier gave a toll of 83 dead and 148 injured.

Death tolls in Yemen's grinding conflict are often disputed, but the huge casualty list in Marib represents one of the bloodiest single attacks since the war erupted in 2014 when the rebels seized Sanaa.

The Huthis did not make any immediate claim of responsibility.

Saudi-owned Al-Hadath television broadcast a video that it said showed the gruesome aftermath of the attack.

Body parts can be seen on the floor among shredded debris. Blood is pooled on the carpet and spattered against the walls.

The drone and missile strike came a day after coalition-backed government forces launched a large-scale operation against the Huthis in the Nihm region, north of Sanaa.

Fighting in Nihm was ongoing on Sunday, a military source said according to the official Saba news agency.

""Dozens from the (Huthi) militia were killed and injured,"" the source added.

Yemeni President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi denounced the ""cowardly and terrorist"" attack on the mosque, Saba reported.

""The disgraceful actions of the Huthi militia without a doubt confirm its unwillingness to (achieve) peace, because it knows nothing but death and destruction and is a cheap Iranian tool in the region,"" it quoted Hadi as saying.

United Nations envoy Martin Griffiths condemned the aerial attack and what he said was the escalation of military activities in three governorates ""where airstrikes, missiles and ground attacks reportedly took place"".

""I have said before that the hard-earned progress that Yemen has made on de-escalation is very fragile. Such actions can derail this progress,"" he said in a statement.

EU foreign policy spokesman Peter Stano said in a statement late Sunday that ""all parties should show restraint and engage constructively with the UN Special Envoy to end the conflict.""

""The EU will continue supporting the UN in achieving this with all the tools at its disposal,"" he added.

Just last week Griffiths had welcomed what he described as ""one of the quietest periods of this conflict"", in a briefing to the UN Security Council in which he warned the lull could not be sustained without political progress.

A year after Yemen's warring sides agreed to a UN-brokered truce for the key Red Sea port city of Hodeida and its surroundings, fighting in the province has subsided, but the slow implementation of the deal has quashed hopes for an end to the conflict.

The landmark agreement signed in Sweden in December 2018 had been hailed as Yemen's best chance so far to end the fighting that has pushed the country to the brink of famine.

Tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians, have been killed and millions displaced in the war that has ravaged the country, triggering what the UN describes as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

Saudi Arabia and its allies intervened in the conflict to back the government against the Huthis in March 2015, shortly after the rebels seized control of Sanaa.

A senior UN official warned Thursday that certain key factors that threatened to trigger a famine in Yemen last year were once again looming large, including a plunge in the value of the national currency.

""With a rapidly depreciating rial and disrupted salary payments, we are again seeing some of the key conditions that brought Yemen to the brink of famine a year ago,"" Ramesh Rajasingham, who coordinates humanitarian aid in Yemen, told the UN Security Council.

""We must not let that happen again,"" he said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/more-than-100-killed-in-yemen-missile--drone-attack-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/more-than-100-killed-in-yemen-missile--drone-attack.html
250,20-1-20,Prince Harry expresses 'great sadness' after being stripped of royal title,"Prince Harry has said ""there really was no other option"" for him and his wife Meghan to step back from being a senior royal even as he expressed ""great sadness"" for them being stripped of their royal titles.

In his first public comments after the royal split, the Duke of Sussex on Sunday said, when he and Meghan were married they were ""excited"", ""hopeful"" and ""were here to serve"", the BBC reported.

""For those reasons, it brings me great sadness that it has come to this,"" Harry said at a fund-raising event here for Sentebale, a charity which he co-founded to help children living with HIV in Africa.

""Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth, and my military associations, but without public funding. Unfortunately, that wasn't possible. I've accepted this, knowing that it doesn't change who I am or how committed I am,"" he said.

Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, have signed up to a formal exit deal from the royal family, which will see them forsake their His and Her Royal Highness (HRH) titles and will no longer receive UK taxpayers' funding for their duties, the Buckingham Palace said in a statement on Saturday night.

The deal, which comes into effect by spring in a few weeks' time, means the couple will no longer be representing the Queen in an official capacity.

Harry said ""there really was no other option"" for him and Meghan to step back from being a senior royal and they have taken ""a leap of faith"" in doing so.

""We are taking a leap of faith...Thank you for giving me the courage to take this next step,"" he said.

However, the prince said he wanted to make it clear that he and Meghan were ""not walking away"", the CNN reported.

""I was born into this life and it is a great honour to serve my country and the Queen,"" he said.

""The UK is my home and a place that I love, that will never change,"" Harry added.

The UK royal crisis began on January 8 when Harry and Meghan's announced quitting their front-line roles to focus on the ""next chapter"", stunning the monarchy and drawing sharp criticism from the British media which has been reporting of a widening rift within the Royal family.

In an extraordinary statement released on the night of January 8, the couple announced plans to step back from their current roles and split their time between the UK and North America with their son Archie.

On January 13, after face-to-face talks with her grandson and senior members of the royal family, Queen Elizabeth II agreed to offer Harry and Meghan a ""period of transition"" during which the couple can divide their time between the UK and Canada.

On Saturday last week, the Buckingham Palace in a statement said, ""The Sussexes will not use their HRH titles as they are no longer working members of the royal family.""

The Queen said the agreement was a ""constructive and supportive"" way forward for her grandson and his family.

""Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family,"" the 93-year-old monarch's personal statement read.

""I recognise the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life,"" she says, thanking the couple for their work for UK and across the Commonwealth.

In a special message for Meghan, she said: ""I am... Particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family. It is my whole family's hope that today's agreement allows them to start building a happy and peaceful new life"".

The palace confirmed that the couple were required to withdraw from royal duties, including official military appointments.

""While they can no longer formally represent the Queen, the Sussexes have made clear that everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty,"" the palace said.

It added that the pair would continue to maintain their private patronages and associations.

The couple intend to repay 2.4 million pounds of UK taxpayer money for the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage, which will remain their UK family home as they split their time between Britain and Canada.

The palace has declined to comment on security arrangements and who would foot that bill for the couple in future, an issue that has been at the centre of much of the debate since they announced their decision to step back as senior royals earlier this month.

Harry and Meghan have issued their own update on their official Sussex Royal website, which has been updated to remove references to the HRH titles on the opening page.

""We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America, continuing to honour our duty to The Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages.

""This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity,"" the statement on their website reads.

Meghan is already in Canada with the couple's eight-month-old son Archie and some reports indicate she may fly back briefly for some pending royal engagements until the new agreement formally kicks in on an unspecified date in spring - which begins towards the end of March in the UK.

Meanwhile, Prince Harry will continue to perform royal duties until that time, which includes at a summit for African leaders in London on Monday.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/prince-harry-expresses--great-sadness--after-being-stripped-of-royal-title-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/prince-harry-expresses--great-sadness--after-being-stripped-of-royal-title.html
251,20-1-20,"Malaysia sends back trash, says won't be world's waste bin","Malaysia has sent back 150 containers of plastic waste to 13 mainly rich countries since the third quarter last year, with the environment minster warning on Monday that those who want to make the country a rubbish bin of the world can ""dream on"".

Shipments of unwanted rubbish have been rerouted to Southeast Asia since China banned the import of plastic waste in 2018, but Malaysia and other developing countries are fighting back.

Environment Minister Yeo Bee Yin said another 110 containers are expected to be sent back by the middle of this year.

Yeo said the successful repatriation of a total 3,737 metric tonnes (4,120 US tons) of waste followed strict enforcement at key Malaysian ports to block smuggling of waste and shuttering more than 200 illegal plastic recycling factories.

Of the 150 containers, 43 were returned to France, 42 to the United Kingdom, 17 to the United States, 11 to Canada, 10 to Spain and the rest to Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Portugal, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Lithuania, her ministry said.

She said the Malaysian government didn't pay a single cent, with the costs of sending back the waste fully borne by the shipping liners and companies responsible for importing and exporting the waste.

Yeo said talks were ongoing with US authorities to take back another 60 containers this year. Canada also has 15 more containers, Japan 14, the UK 9 and Belgium 8 from 110 more containers that are still being held at Malaysian ports, she said.

""If people want to see us as the rubbish dump of the world, you dream on,"" Yeo told reporters during inspection at a port in northern Penang state.

Yeo said the government will launch an action plan on illegal plastic importation next month that will help the different agencies coordinate enforcement and speed up the process of returning the waste.

""Our position is very firm. We just want to send back (the waste) and we just want to give a message that Malaysia is not the dumping site of the world,"" she added.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/malaysia-sends-back-trash--says-won-t-be-world-s-waste-bin-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/malaysia-sends-back-trash--says-won-t-be-world-s-waste-bin.html
252,20-1-20,Trump backers and critics clash as impeachment trial nears,"Donald Trump's defenders and supporters skirmished over the airwaves on Sunday a day after the US president's legal team dismissed his impeachment trial as unconstitutional and dangerous.

Coming two days before Trump's trial opens in the Senate, the clashing arguments offered an early taste of the historic drama to play out in coming weeks.

Beginning Tuesday, the chamber will meet six hours a day for six days a week in only the third impeachment trial of a US president, with lofty constitutional issues brushing up against raw partisan politics.

It will be a ""grueling exercise,"" Republican Senator John Cornyn said on CBS.

Celebrity attorney Alan Dershowitz, a recent addition to Trump's legal team, argued Sunday that even if every charge sent by the House to the Senate for the president's trial were accepted as true, it would not rise to the level of impeachable behavior.

""The (House) vote was to impeach on abuse of power, which is not within the constitutional criteria for impeachment, and obstruction of justice,"" Dershowitz, a Harvard law professor emeritus, said on ABC.

A politically motivated impeachment, he added, was the ""greatest nightmare"" of the country's founders.

Adam Schiff, the California lawmaker chosen by House Democrats as lead manager of the impeachment trial, dismissed the notion that abuse of power was not impeachable.

""That's an argument you have to make if the facts are so dead set against you,"" he said on ABC.

Another House impeachment manager, Jerrold Nadler, called Dershowitz's argument ""arrant nonsense.""

The House impeached Trump on charges that he abused his office to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden by withholding military aid and dangling a White House meeting with the Ukrainian president.

He was also charged with obstructing Congress.

For Republicans to argue that such behavior is not impeachable, Schiff said, ""would have appalled the founders, who were worried about exactly that kind of solicitation of foreign interference in an election for personal benefit.""

The two sides have been publicly fencing over whether the trial will be conducted quickly, perhaps in as little as two weeks -- Trump's clear preference -- or whether witnesses can be called and new evidence introduced -- as Democrats insist is needed for a full and fair trial.

The president has said he would like the Senate to almost immediately dismiss the charges, but Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump confidant, told Fox News: ""That is not going to happen. We don't have the votes for that.""

Dershowitz said Sunday, however, that calling witnesses would introduce major delays.

""The trial will take a much longer time, because the Democrats will call (former national security advisor) John Bolton, and the president will invoke executive privilege and it will have to go to the courts,"" he said on CNN.

Republicans say the House erred by not taking the time during its hearings to secure the testimony of key witnesses like Bolton before sending articles of impeachment to the Senate.

Schiff said that would have meant ""endless months or even years of litigation.""

He added, ""What the president is threatening to do is cheat in the next election; you cannot wait months and years to be able to remove that threat from office.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has yet to announce the rules for the trial, but has said he is cooperating with the White House and wants it done quickly.

Cornyn said he expected to see essentially the same rules as during the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1998. That would have both sides lay out their arguments before a possible vote by senators on whether to allow witnesses.

Underscoring the stark divide running through the Senate, Cornyn said Trump was being impeached ""for a non-crime for events that never occurred,"" while Nadler said ""any jury would convict him in three minutes flat.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-backers-and-critics-clash-as-impeachment-trial-nears-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-backers-and-critics-clash-as-impeachment-trial-nears.html
253,20-1-20,"Nine killed, one missing in Indonesia bridge collapse","Nine people drowned and another was missing after a bridge collapsed on Indonesia's Sumatra island, the disaster agency said on Monday.

Some 30 people, mostly students, were on the bridge Sunday afternoon in the town of Kaur when the newly built crossing suddenly collapsed, hurtling some teens into the water below while others clutched on to the railing.

The water level in the river below the bridge was higher than usual with strong currents after torrential downpours pounded the Bengkulu region at the southern end of Sumatra.

""Some managed to save themselves but 10 others could not fight against the current and drowned, they were swept away"" Ujang Syafiri, head of the disaster mitigation agency, told AFP, adding that the bridge may have collapsed due to excessive weight.

A search and rescue team scoured a 20-kilometre radius to find a teenager who is still missing, he said.

Another victim was rescued after falling into the river but is seriously injured and has been taken to hospital.

Parts of the Southeast Asian archipelago have received torrential downpours as the rainy season kicks into high gear.

In and around the capital Jakarta, some 67 people were killed this month as record rains triggered flooding and landslides.

255,20-1-20,Charlize Theron's kids consider Oscar nomination 'waste of time',"Actress Charlize Theron's children are not hopeful when it comes to her chances of victory at the 2020 Oscars.

Theron is nominated for the Best Actress prize for her role in ""Bombshell"" but, after already losing out at the Golden Globes and Critics' Choice Awards, her children aren't getting their hopes up for success, reports aceshowbiz.com.

""It's been a thrilling couple of weeks. I was nominated for a Golden Globe. I was nominated for a Critics' Choice...Spoiler alert: I didn't win,"" she told the US late night host Jimmy Kimmel.

Theron shared that her children felt ""a mixture of super sad and kind of angry"" when they found out she lost at both awards shows.

256,20-1-20,"Like last year, we will look to put NZ under pressure from ball one: Kohli","A series win against a strong Australia and the performance in New Zealand last year gives India a lot of confidence ahead of a fresh tour beginning on January 24, said skipper Virat Kohli whose team will be aiming to put the Black Caps under pressure from the word go.

India will be playing five T20s, three ODIs and two Tests in New Zealand. They had beaten the hosts 4-1 in ODIs before losing the T20 series 1-2.

""We are taking a lot of confidence from our performance (in NZ) last year. We were very positive in how we played, very sure of what we wanted to do. The thing about playing away is if you're able to put the home team under pressure, you can enjoy your cricket,"" Kohli said on Sunday night here after the seven-wicket win over Australia in the series-deciding third ODI.

""You have to win at home, there's that sort of feeling (for hosts). So if you bring out your A game, you can really put them under pressure. That's what we did last year, squeezed them in the middle overs, picked up wickets, spinners were outstanding. Looking forward to take that same intensity into the series.""

Ahead of the New Zealand tour, Kohli said it became even more important to win the home series against Australia here on Sunday. The team leaves for New Zealand on Monday night.

""We spoke of that at the huddle, that this is the last game we're playing in the series and if we win, you go on a tour on a happy note. If you lose, it can go under the radar, you can brush it aside as 'oh it's just one loss'.

""But when you win and win under pressure, the last two games were tough wins, it boosts your confidence which we're carrying forward,"" he said.

On the limited overs leg of the New Zealand tour, Kohli picked out the areas of improvement.

""Again, we want to bat well when we bat first and in case we're defending a low total, we should be able to do that as well. We can't afford to ease into the series after two games, because then it keeps getting tougher and tougher, so we'll look to make a mark in the first game that we play,"" he said.

Kohli did not win a toss in the Australia series but his team took that out of the equation by adapting to situations.

""We spoke after the World Cup the way we exited, you can't always look for a situation that should go your way at the toss. If we like chasing as a team, it doesn't mean we press the panic button if we lose the toss, we've to stay composed enough to put in strong performances.

""We've literally taken the toss out of context, and we're as prepared as possible to do something the opposition asks us to do,"" he said.

""That's been the difference, even if we lose the toss, we have the belief that we can play expressive cricket to get results our way. The last six or eight months have been a revelation and the younger guys stepping up is a very good sign for Indian cricket.""

The skipper loves playing against Australia as it brings the best out of him. He explained why he relishes the Australian challenge.

""Last year (at home) after 2-0 up, we thought we're definitely going to win one of the three at home, but they showed us that they understand these conditions very well now (to win 3-2), having played here a lot in the IPL and so many tours over the years,"" Kohli said.

""So, although they had a stronger side (with Steve Smith and David Warner back) than last time, we thought if we play good enough, we can beat this team. The only thing we needed to be wary of was our body language and intent because that's Australia's strongest point.

""All the teams in the world are skilled but these guys play with the intent of making things happen every over you play against them. So you can't take your foot off the pedal at all, that's what we've done in the last two games. The partnerships that I mentioned today, even the singles were taken with intent,"" said Kohli.

India raced to victory in the series-deciding third ODI against Australia, courtesy fine knocks from Kohli himself and Rohit Sharma. They both could not stay till the end but the finishing touches were provided by Shreays Iyer, who remained unbeaten on 44. And the skipper was all praise for Iyer.

""I don't think he's (Iyer) going to have any issues anymore because he really went after their best bowlers and got the results. It took pressure off of me as well not having to take risks and the other guy striking at 140-145. I think it was really smart how we went about it,"" Kohli added.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/like-last-year--we-will-look-to-put-nz-under-pressure-from-ball-one--kohli-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/like-last-year--we-will-look-to-put-nz-under-pressure-from-ball-one--kohli.html

Speaking at the launch of the 5G Demonstration Projects in Langkawi on Sunday, in Malaysia's northern Kedah state, Mahathir said 5G has the power to promote an array of new services, improve manufacturing efficiency and spur innovation nationwide, Xinhua reported.

""Since I launched the '5G Malaysia Showcase' in April 2019, preparations to deploy 5G have been progressing well, and I am glad to state that Malaysia is on track to commercially roll out 5G in the 3rd quarter of 2020,"" he said.

He added that Malaysia's enthusiasm for embracing 5G and new technology would prevent it from being left behind as the world was rapidly developing new technology and using it to boost economic growth.

""Economically, 5G can serve as the infrastructure for innovative growth. The convergence of 5G and different industrial sectors such as agriculture, education, healthcare, manufacturing, smart transportation, and tourism present new opportunities for industries, society, and individuals to advance their digital ambitions, and deliver new and better services,"" he said.

Due to its high bandwidth, low latency and boundless connectivity, 5G has opened up infinite possibilities for various fields, bringing tremendous changes.

Looking at the GeekBench listing itself, there sadly isn't any real additional info to extract.

The calculated benchmark scores are roughly in the right ballpark for the Google Pixel 4 and its Snapdragon 855 chipset. The 6GB RAM amount also checks out. And, that's about it. We just get the curious Android R string hanging out in the report document, GSMArena reported on Saturday.

Earlier, the tech giant had announced that it was dropping the customary desserts and alphabetic naming scheme for a more comprehensive numerical system.

It is pertinent to note that Android 10 was referred to as Android Q in the developer preview up until the introduction of the final build.

Thus, the Android R developer preview is most likely an early designation to Android 11 OS, according to Gizmo China.

263,20-1-20,"Kohli greatest ODI player of all-time, Rohit in top-five: Finch","Australian captain Aaron Finch has rated his Indian counterpart Virat Kohli as ""probably"" the greatest ODI player of all-time, while picking Rohit Sharma in the top-five.

Rohit (119) scored his 29th ODI hundred and Kohli made 89 off 91 balls as they shared a match-winning stand of 137 in the decisive third game against Australia here on Sunday.

For Finch, what stood out was that India overhauled the 287-run target with ease despite opener Shikhar Dhawan not coming out to bat due to a shoulder injury.

""They've got Virat who is probably the greatest ODI player of all-time, and Rohit who'd probably be in the top five batters of all-time. They're exceptional, and the thing with the Indian side at the moment is their experienced players are getting the job done in the big games,"" Finch said.

""Rohit's 100, especially without Shikhar there tonight, for them to shuffle and their two most dominant players to still get majority of the runs is a sign of a really settled and really quality top-order,"" said Finch at the post-match media interaction on Sunday night.

Australia could not get the final flourish they were looking for, mustering only 63 runs in the last 10 overs at the loss of five wickets, far too many in Finch's view.

""In the last two games we have had the bowlers batting for the majority of the last few overs. Which we saw in Rajkot the damage that KL (Rahul) could do in the back end because he was a settled batter. I think that's an area we just missed a couple of tricks. ""Just not having an in batter being in and having faced 20 or 30 balls to get us deeper and get us to the back end,"" Finch said.

He also praised India's death over bowling at the same time.

""But credit to India, their death bowling in the last few games was exceptional. (Mohammed) Shami was nailing his yorkers, (Navdeep) Saini in the last two games and (Jasprit) Bumrah. In both games they were exceptional. You can look at where we could have improved but also you've got to give some credit to India,"" said Finch.

Finch opted to bat at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, unlike the game in Rajkot where he chose to field. However, the pitch did not play as per his expectations.

""It probably played a little bit slower than we expected. It looked like it was really hard. It was probably just a little on the dry side. But it was a damn good wicket, it probably spun a bit more than we expected it to,"" he said.

""But I thought all four spinners for the game bowled exceptionally well. A little bit slow with the new ball but it seemed to slip on a bit towards the end there and there was a bit more dew than last night.""

Finch added there were enough positives for them to take from the series despite being on the losing side. One of them was Marnus Labuschagne making an ODI debut. Can Labuschagne also be an option in the shortest format?

""We'll have to juggle that. He probably hasn't played as much T20 cricket as he has one-day cricket throughout his career. He started really well in his two innings. To get 47 and 50-odd in his first two knocks on a little bit of a difficult wicket tonight,"" Finch said.

""He played really well and showed a lot of maturity. The Test summer and the Ashes has really made his confidence grow. He looked at home against a very good attack,"" he added.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kohli-greatest-odi-player-of-all-time--rohit-in-top-five--finch-2020-01-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/kohli-greatest-odi-player-of-all-time--rohit-in-top-five--finch.html
