2,11-3-20,Paraguayan judge orders Ronaldinho to remain in prison,"Brazilian football great Ronaldinho will remain in pre-trial detention in Paraguay after being refused bail or house arrest on accusations of entering the country with a fake passport.

A court rejected a request for conditional release for the 39-year-old World Cup winner and his brother, who were spending a fifth day in a police cell in Asuncion, said prosecutor Osmar Legal.

Judge Gustavo Amarilla cited the seriousness of the case and the discovery of new evidence, as well as the involvement of public officials and entrepreneurs who helped Ronaldinho get into Paraguay.

Amarilla acknowledged the harshness of the measures taken against the brothers but said it was his responsibility to ensure the they did not flee the country.

""There are many procedures that need to be done with the presence of both of them,"" the judge said.

Legal said he opposed house arrest because the property offered as a guarantee was only valued at $750,000 to $800,000.

""It's a tiny amount given the economic solvency of one of the (accused),"" he said.

The brothers arrived in Asuncion from Brazil on Wednesday and showed their passports to immigration police, who did not immediately notice any problem.

Hours later, when the passports were determined to be fake, investigators raided the football star's hotel room and seized the brothers' identity cards and travel documents.

- 'No crime' -

==============

Ronaldinho said the passports had been given to him by people who had invited him to attend conferences sponsored by charities working with disadvantaged children.

A Brazilian businessman has also been arrested in connection with the fake travel documents, while two Paraguayan women have been placed under house arrest and the country's migration director has resigned.

Ronaldinho's Brazilian lawyer Sergio Queiroz has said the brothers were carrying Brazilian documents and were given the Paraguayan passports ""to facilitate the possibility of doing business"" in Paraguay.

""Ronaldinho did not commit a crime because he did not know that the passport they gave him was faked,"" he said.

However, the body overseeing the creation of companies in Paraguay told AFP there was no regulation preventing Brazilians for applying for a business permit.

The administrator of the charity that invited Ronaldinho, Dalia Lopez, has admitted requesting the passports but said she didn't know they were forged.

A warrant has been issued for her arrest.

- Money laundering -

====================

Amarilla said the investigation is looking into possible criminal association and money laundering.

He said the brothers' phones needed to be examined, in order to ""know the true intention for their presence"" in Paraguay.

Ronaldinho, considered one of the greatest footballers of all time, was a star of Brazil's 2002 World Cup win and played for European giants Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and AC Milan, among others.

There had been rumors he needed to use the Paraguayan document because his real passport had been seized by Brazilian authorities in late 2018 after he failed to pay a $2.5 million fine for building a pier in a protected lake.

But it was returned to him a year later following an agreement with the public prosecutor in Rio Grande do Sul state.

As both countries are part of the MERCOSUR trade bloc, travelers between Brazil and Paraguay need only carry an identity document rather than a passport.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/paraguayan-judge-orders-ronaldinho-to-remain-in-prison-2020-03-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/paraguayan-judge-orders-ronaldinho-to-remain-in-prison.html
3,11-3-20,"Big talk is forgotten, it's performance which stays: Mary Kom after qualifying for Olympics","Indian boxing icon M C Mary Kom pulled no punches as she lambasted critics and challengers after securing her second Olympic appearance, saying those who bring politics into sports should remember that it's performance that creates legacy, not big statements.

Speaking to PTI from Amman, Jordan after booking her Olympic berth by making the semifinals of the Asia/Oceania Qualifiers, Mary Kom (51kg) also said her experience of over two decades will be her biggest weapon against younger opponents in Tokyo. She ended with a bronze at the qualifiers.

""It is huge for me. I feel as if I have proved myself. It really means a lot and a huge weight is off my shoulders. I hope it changes mindset of people who are against me, people who try to manipulate and bring politics into sport,"" the 37-year-old six-time world and five-time Asian champion said.

""...Talking outside the ring can only fetch headlines. Those headlines will be forgotten and after that, it's just the performance. If you talk big and the results don't add up, it will hurt you in the long run. So let your punches do the talking and create a legacy that won't be forgotten,"" she added.

Her reference was to the selection controversy that preceded the qualifiers when former junior world champion Nikhat Zareen sought Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju's intervention while demanding a trial bout against the Manipuri. The ill-tempered and hyped trial bout was won by Mary Kom.

""Politics should not dictate sports. It is not good for India. I am just thankful to god that I could prove that I am right, that I am worthy,"" said the boxer whose maiden Olympic appearance was in 2012 when women's boxing made its debut at the Games. She brought home a bronze that year.

""I have never done anything bad to anyone. I respect everyone, senior or junior, doesn't matter to me. But when I am questioned the way I was, it is irritating for me. There should be respect, that's all. Be nice and I will be nice to you,"" she added.

""Again and again and again, I am just dragged. I can say a lot but that negativity is behind me. I have proved myself inside the ring and I would let the matter rest. I am looking forward to my second Olympics,"" she further said referring to similar past furores involving Pinki Jangra and L Sarita Devi.

Talking about Olympics, Mary Kom feels her experience of over two decades will help her reach the podium for a better medal than 2012.

""Experience allows me to control the pace of bouts. I face a lot of aggressive and fast girls now but what they don't have is experience and I ensure that it becomes my biggest weapon.

""You can be the fittest and the fastest boxer around but I will always have the experience to dictate how the bout goes. This is what is going to be my biggest advantage at the Olympics,"" she said.

But what about the uncertainty looming on the fate of the Olympics due to the global novel coronavirus outbreak, which has left over 4,000 dead and more than 100,000 infected.

""Of course I am concerned, it has spread so widely. We have to be careful, not just me but all the athletes. I have heard about the speculation that the Olympics might be cancelled.

""But What can I say? It's not in my hands but I am confident that this will be brought under control and the Olympics will be held as scheduled. Let's see what happens,"" she said.

Will it have a bearing on her training plans given that travelling outside for it may not be an option due to the coronavirus threat.

""...I will see about that. I will have a discussion with my coach (Chhote Lal Yadav) and figure out my plan after that,"" she said.

The Tokyo Olympics will also be her last. Given the enormity of her achievements, it is bound to be an emotionally overwhelming campaign in Tokyo. But Mary Kom said there is lots to take care of before she can allow emotions to step in.

""It will be emotional no doubt. There will be lots of pressure as well and it will not be easy to deal with all that,"" she said.

""But I will try my best like always. In fact, I will rather just focus on getting the results I want, the emotions can wait for until after that,"" she added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/big-talk-is-forgotten--it-s-performance-which-stays--mary-kom-after-qualifying-for-olympics-2020-03-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/big-talk-is-forgotten--it-s-performance-which-stays--mary-kom-after-qualifying-for-olympics.html

Kohli has 239 innings under his belt in his career which means that if he crosses 12,000 in this series, he will break Sachin Tendulkar's record to become the fastest to the landmark.

Tendulkar had taken 300 innings to get to the landmark. Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting is currently second on the list having reached 12,000 ODI runs in 314 innings while former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara did so in 336 innings.

Kohli will be looking to break the shackles in the first opportunity he gets in the South Africa series as he has been going through a rare rough patch of form.

In the recently concluded three-match ODI series in New Zealand, Kohli's highest score was 51 and he scored 15 and 9 in the other two matches. In the subsequent two-match Test series, Kohli managed scores of 2, 19, 3 and 14 as India lost the series 2-0.

5,11-3-20,Team India 'unbelievable' but we are confident: de Kock,"South Africa captain Quinton de Kock believes India, under Virat Kohli, is an ""unbelievable"" team with great balance, but added that the visitors are also brimming with confidence and are ready for a fight in the three-match ODI series beginning Thursday.

India are coming into the series on the back of a series whitewash in New Zealand whereas the Proteas whitewashed Australia in their last ODI series back home.

""India is an unbelievable team, they have got great balance, but I am sure we are also coming here with a lot of confidence,"" de Kock said on the eve of the first ODI on Wednesday.

The skipper also urged the senior members of the team -- including himself, Faf du Plessis and David Miller -- to take up responsibility and guide the youngsters against the Men in Blue.

du Plessis is making a comeback after being rested for the Australia series and de Kock feels his presence in the team will be vital.

""Obviously, Faf (du Plessis) has come back. He plays a big role for us from the leadership point of view. He is here to help out the younger guys in the team. He adds a lot of value for us. He also knows he has lot of value to give to this team. His experience will be a big help for us in this series,"" de Kock said.

""We understand that we are coming here with quite an inexperienced side in these conditions but its important Faf, me, David Miller to help out these guys around, lead the way. Pass on our knowledge to the youngsters.""

du Plessis was rested for the ODI series against South Africa at home which the Proteas won 3-0 and de Kock feels that the former skipper needed that break to re-organise his thoughts.

""He (Du Plessis) was given a chance to have a break. It's been a long season so I think it was important to let him put his feet up for a while, just re-organise his thoughts,"" said de Kock

""Just glad to have him back with us. We are undecided where he is going to bat at the moment but we will come up with the decision later,"" he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/team-india--unbelievable--but-we-are-confident--de-kock-2020-03-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/team-india--unbelievable--but-we-are-confident--de-kock.html
6,11-3-20,Crisis-hit Cong to shift its MLAs out of Madhya Pradesh,"In a bid to keep its flock together, the crisis-hit Madhya Pradesh Congress has decided to shift its 92 MLAs either to Jaipur or some other place.

The move comes after 22 Congress MLAs loyal to former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia resigned on Tuesday, pushing the 15-month-old Kamal Nath government to the brink of collapse.

""We are going to take our 92 MLAs and those supporting our Madhya Pradesh government to a hotel,"" a senior Congress leader said on Wednesday.

The legislators would be taken either to Jaipur or some other Congress-ruled state like Chhattisgarh, a party source said.

Apart from its own MLAs, the Congress is also keeping a close watch on four Independents who are supporting the party-led state government.

On Tuesday, 22 Congress MLAs from Madhya Pradesh resigned soon after Scindia quit the party.

The development reduced the Congress government in the state to minority.

The state Congress unit is now making all efforts to save the Kamal Nath-led government.

The BJP on Tuesday night shifted its MLAs to Manesar at Gurugram in Haryana, sources in the saffron party said.

The Congress, whose tally before the rebellion was 114, has a wafer-thin majority in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly whose current effective strength is 228.

It also has the support of four Independents, two BSP legislators and one SP MLA, but some of them are now likely to switch sides to the BJP.

The plane crashed in a jungle near Shakarparian area of the capital, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) said in a statement.

The plane was carrying out routine exercises for the Pakistan Day parade when it crashed, it said, adding that the PAF has ordered an inquiry into the cause of the crash.

There was no immediate word on the fate of the pilot or co-pilot. Security forces have cordoned off the crash site.

Smoke was rising from the crash site and rescue efforts were going on to contain the fire, the statement said.

12,11-3-20,'Ominous phase' forced BJP to postpone Scindia's induction,"The stage was set and decks were cleared for Jyotiraditya Scindia's induction into the BJP at 12.30 p.m., but no leaders turned up at the given time. Sources say the induction has been delayed due to the ""Rahu Kal"", a phase considered ominous.

On Wednesday afternoon, the BJP media cell sent a message that read, ""An Eminent personality will join the BJP in the presence of BJP National President Shri J.P. Nadda today (Wednesday) March 11, 12:30 p.m. at BJP HQ, 6 A, DDU Marg, New Delhi."" Whenever, a high profile joining takes place, the BJP media cell refers to them as 'eminent citizens'.

But at 12.30 p.m., with a packed media auditorium, none of the BJP leaders turned up and neither did Scindia. While it was speculated that the Lok Sabha which was in session, to be the reason, soon it too got adjourned. Yet none of the BJP leaders turned up.

Sources in the BJP suggest that the BJP was told later about the Rahu Kal, an ominous phase, that starts at 12.30 p.m. Hence, the party which is very sensitive to such astrological findings, decided to postpone it by an hour and thirty minutes, till the phase was over.

Scindia resigned from the Congress on Tuesday, and is tipped to join the BJP on Wednesday. Earlier on Tuesday, Scindia met Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Welcoming him into the BJP, Nadda recalled the party's founder and Jyotiraditya's grandmother Vijaya Raje Scindia and said, ""he is joining his family and we welcome him.""

Thanking Prime Minister, Home Minister Amit Shah and Nadda, Scindia said they have given him the platform to serve the people.

""Pained"" and ""distressed"" for not able to serve the people in his previous organisation, he said the Congress is living in denial and it is not the same party what it used to be.

Hailing Modi for his leadership, Scindia said the country's future is secure in his hands.

Talking about Madhya Pradesh, the erstwhile Congress leader said the dream which he saw with his former colleagues for the state has been shattered in the last 18 months.

According to sources, the BJP is likely to name him as one of its candidates for the Rajya Sabha polls in Madhya Pradesh and is also confident of forming the government in the state with his help as 22 MLAs including Scindia's supporters have resigned from the state assembly reducing the Kamal Nath government to a minority.

Peeved with his marginalisation in the Congress, Scindia met Shah on Tuesday and then the two leaders went to the prime minister's residence where they held talks for over an hour.

Soon after meeting Modi, he tendered his resignation to Congress president Sonia Gandhi saying it was time for him to move on.

Scindia took the decision to sever his ties with the Congress on the day of his father Madhavrao Scindia's 75th birth anniversary.

A four-time MP, Scindia first got elected from Guna in Madhya Pradesh in 2002 after winning a bye-election necessitated by his father's demise. He was only 31 years old at that time.

The Shiv Sena is leading a coalition government in Maharashtra with the NCP and the Congress.

The Kamal Nath government in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh is on the brink of collapse as 22 Congress MLAs in the state resigned on Tuesday after former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia quit the party.

Amid the political developments in Madhya Pradesh, Raut said there was no cause of worry for the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.

""The Madhya Pradesh virus will not enter Maharashtra. Maharashtra's power is different. One operation flopped 100 days ago. The Maha Vikas Aghadi did a bypass surgery and saved Maharashtra,"" the Sena leader said in a tweet in Marathi.

After the state Assembly polls in October last year, the Shiv Sena-led MVA government came to power on November 28 after it parted ways with the BJP over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post.

Before that, BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis and NCP's Ajit Pawar took oath as chief minister and deputy chief minister, respectively, in a hush hush ceremony on November 23. But, the government did not last more than 80 hours.

During the hearing, the ED told the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court that Kapoor had sanctioned loans worth Rs 30,000 crore to different entities during his tenure.

Kapoor, 62, former MD and CEO of the private bank, was arrested by the ED here on Sunday under provisions of the PMLA as he was allegedly not cooperating in the probe.

He was earlier remanded in the ED custody till March 11. As his remand ended on Wednesday, he was produced before special court judge P P Rajvaidya.

The court extended his ED custody till March 16 as the central investgating agency had sought it for further probe.

While seeking his custody, the ED told the court that loans worth Rs 30,000 crore were given to various entities when Kapoor was on the bank's panel.

""Of this, Rs 20,000 crore turned into bad debts. We need to be probe in great detail how the money has travelled,"" the agency told the court.

25,11-3-20,Biden inches towards Democratic Party's presidential nomination,"Former US vice president Joe Biden inched towards Democratic Party's presidential nomination as the septuagenarian secured victories in the primaries held in three major states, including the key battleground Michigan, taking a substantial lead against his main rival Senator Bernie Sanders.

By late Tuesday night, he had 788 pledged delegates in his kitty as he won in the states of Michigan, Mississippi and Missouri as against 633 pledged delegates for Sanders.

Biden, 77, and Sanders, 78, are only the two major Democratic presidential candidates left in the race now.

Biden's win in Michigan is crucial as Sanders had clinched the victory in the state defeating Hillary Clinton four years ago.

Either of the candidates need at least 1,991 of the 3,979 pledged delegates to win the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party.

During his speech in Pennsylvania, Biden said that democracy is at stake in this election and the country cannot afford to have another four years of President Donald Trump who is seeking his second term in the November elections. “Winning means not only having a president who knows how to fight but how to heal,” he said.

""I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion. We share a common goal. And together, we will defeat Donald Trump,"" Biden said.

Confident of winning the party's presidential nomination, Biden said, ""tonight we are a step closer to restoring decency, dignity and honour to the White House.""

“We need presidential leadership that is honest, trusted, truthful and steady,” he said.

Biden said that Donald Trump's America First policy has made America alone.

""To all those who have been knocked down, to all those who've been counted out... This is your campaign,"" he told his supporters.

""Although there's a way to go, it looks like we're going to have a very good night,” he added.

Meanwhile, Brad Parscale, Trump's 2020 campaign manager in a statement said, the Democrat candidate for president will be running on a big government socialist agenda regardless of the name on the ballot.

“It is also clear that the Democrat establishment has rallied around the confused Joe Biden in an effort to deny the nomination to Bernie Sanders. Either way, President Trump is on an unstoppable drive toward re-election,” he said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/biden-inches-towards-democratic-party-s-presidential-nomination-2020-03-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/biden-inches-towards-democratic-party-s-presidential-nomination.html
26,11-3-20,UN Security Council endorses US-Taliban peace deal,"The UN Security Council has unanimously adopted a resolution welcoming the recent deal between the US and the Taliban to bring lasting peace in war-torn Afghanistan and allow US troops to return home from America's longest war.

The US-Taliban peace deal was signed in Doha on February 29.

All 15 members of the UNSC on Tuesday supported the resolution, tabled by the United States, which endorses the joint US-Afghan declaration on peace and the agreement signed between Washington and the Taliban.

""The developments endorsed by this resolution are the product of more than a year of unprecedented US diplomatic engagement with the Taliban, in coordination with our partners in Afghanistan, the region, and around the world,"" Acting Deputy Permanent Representative of the US to UN Cherith Norman Chalet said.

The agreement with the Taliban calls for the fundamentalists to severe ties with international terrorist groups and to prevent them from using Afghanistan to carry out attacks against the US.

Under the terms of the deal, the Taliban would also participate in an intra-Afghan dialogue. While negotiations were scheduled to begin on Tuesday, they were postponed due to renewed violence and political discord at the highest levels of the government.

Afghanistan's rival leaders -- incumbent President Ashraf Ghani and his former unity government partner Abdullah Abdullah -- claimed victory in the presidential election held last September and each sworn in as the country's new president in separate ceremonies on Monday, throwing plans for talks with the Taliban into chaos

The US has welcomed President Ghani's steps towards agreement on an inclusive government, and Abdullah's commitments to peace and inclusivity.

""We hope the people of Afghanistan seize the opportunity to achieve an historic peace settlement that ends the conflict in Afghanistan; preserves the gains of the last two decades in human rights, basic freedoms, and the meaningful participation of women in political and civil institutions; and ensures that the territory of the Afghan people will never again be used by international terrorists to threaten the world,"" Norman Chalet said.

The Security Council vote took place just hours after the Group of Friends of Women in Afghanistan met at the UN headquarters. The group, founded last year by the Afghan Mission to the UN, champion women's participation in the country's future. It is co-chaired by the UK and comprised of women representatives to the UN and its senior officials.

Group co-chair Ambassador Karen Pierce of the United Kingdom said the UN resolution sends a clear message on women's inclusion in Afghanistan's future.

""We expect to see the effective and meaningful participation in the peace process of women, as well as youth and other minorities. And while any peace deal is ultimately for Afghans to decide upon, we affirm that it should protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all,"" she said.

Prior to voting, Council members observed a minute of silence in honour of former UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who died last week at the age of 100.

27,11-3-20,Google forms COVID-19 fund to support temporary staff,"In view of the global spread of the novel coronavirus, Google is establishing a COVID-19 fund that will enable all its temporary staff and vendors worldwide to take paid sick leave if they have potential symptoms of the disease, or cannot come into work because they are quarantined.

""Working with our partners, this fund will mean that members of our extended workforce will be compensated for their normal working hours if they can't come into work for these reasons,"" Adrienne Crowther, Director, Workplace Services at Google, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.

Google said it is carefully monitoring the situation and will continue to assess any adjustments needed over the coming months.

As COVID-19 spreads, Google has advised all of its North American employees to work from home if their roles allow until at least April 10.

""All offices in North America are now on recommended work from home status, if roles allow,"" CNBC quoted a Google spokesperson as saying on Tuesday.

Google has over 100,000 employees based in North America.

The work from home recommendations were earlier given only to employees in the San Francisco Bay Area, Dublin, and Seattle.

The search engine giant last week committed that members of its extended workforce who are affected by reduced office schedules (such as closed cafes resulting from offices moving to work-from-home arrangements) will be compensated for the time they would have worked.

The coronavirus epidemic has spread to over 100 countries, infecting more than 1,18,000 people and killing over 4,200.

28,11-3-20,Virus locks down Italy amid global push to contain outbreak,"The boisterous hum of Rome dwindled to a whisper and police patrols kept people apart in cafes as Italy enforced an extraordinary, sweeping lockdown in hopes of not becoming the next epicentre of the spreading coronavirus epidemic now that life in China is edging back to normal.

Infections in Italy topped the 10,000 mark — more than anywhere but China — and the number of deaths from the virus rose Tuesday to 631 from 463 a day earlier, Italian Civil Protection authorities said.

Police across the country patrolled cafes to ensure owners kept customers 1 metre (3 feet) apart during daylight hours and then enforced a strict 6 pm closure order.

""It's bad. People are terrorised,"" said Massimo Leonardo, who runs a market stall. ""I've never seen anything like it.""

For most, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for a few, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illnesses, including pneumonia. More than 119,000 people have been infected worldwide and over 4,200 have died.

By encouraging many of Italy's 62 million people to stay home and further drying up what was left of the country's already battered tourism industry, the lockdown could increase the likelihood of a recession, dealing another blow to reeling global markets.

Italy's economy, the third-largest of the 19 countries that use the euro currency, relies heavily on industries requiring the physical presence and proximity of workers: tourism, manufacturing, and retail.

Italians shouldn't leave home unless for work, health care or ""necessities"" such as grocery shopping, the premier's office said. Early closures of shops, cafes and restaurants amounted to a seismic restriction in a country that prizes its gastronomy, luxuries and cafe culture.

""I'll do whatever they tell me to do,"" Rome florist Stefano Fulvi said. ""If I have to close, I'll close."" Italy also found itself increasingly sealed off as other countries sought to keep infections contained.

Malta and Spain announced a ban on air traffic from Italy. British Airways and Air Canada suspended all Italy flights. Austria barred travelers from crossing the border without a medical certificate. Slovenia closed its border with Italy, and Albania banned Italy air and ferry traffic.

Britain, Ireland, Hong Kong and Germany strengthened travel advisories and urged their citizens to leave. Even the Vatican erected a new barricade at the edge of St Peter's Square.

""Get out of northern Italy if you're there,"" said Erik Broegger Rasmussen, head of consular services for Denmark's foreign ministry.

But in China, the diminishing threat prompted President Xi Jinping to visit the central city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, on Tuesday and declare: ""We will certainly defeat this epidemic.""

It was the latest sign that China is edging back toward normal after weeks of extreme quarantine measures. A day after Xi's visit to Wuhan, China reported just 24 new infections Wednesday, down from thousands each day last month.

""Things are slowly returning to normal,"" said Yang Tianxiao, a finance worker in Beijing, where the city government is gradually easing restrictions.

In a reversal of positions, China is seeing new cases brought in from overseas. In Beijing, the capital, all the new cases of COVID-19 reported on Wednesday came from outside the country, five from Italy and one from the United States.

Improving reports continued to come from South Korea, too, with 242 new cases reported Wednesday, a considerable drop from its highs.

But in growing swaths of the globe, virus-related disruptions were increasingly the new normal. More than 100 countries — over half of the United Nations' membership — have now confirmed cases.

France's government advised voters to bring their own pens to local elections Sunday so they won't have to share. The United Nations announced the closure of its New York headquarters complex to the general public. Albania told its citizens to stay home — banning public gatherings and shuttering schools, entertainment centres, gymnasiums and public pools.

The virus reached into the corridors of power. In the United States, several senior politicians were self-quarantined, and in Spain, a leading member of a far-right party tested positive for the virus. A British health minister became the first UK lawmaker to be diagnosed with the disease.

Worldwide, growing numbers of children were being taught online as school closures spread. The outbreak has interrupted schooling for nearly 363 million students worldwide, with 15 countries imposing nationwide school closures and 14 implementing localised closures, the UN's education agency said.

The virus has shaken global markets. US stocks, oil and other financial markets around the world went on another wild ride on Tuesday, clawing back ground after their historic plunge the previous day.

Investors are likely to see more big swings until the number of infections slows down, and fear was still rampant that economies stood at the brink of recession, market watchers said.

29,11-3-20,Sri Lanka announces first coronavirus case,"Sri Lanka on Wednesday announced its first coronavirus case, a 52-year-old tour guide who had come in contact with a group of Italian tourists.

The man has been kept at the isolation ward of the Infectious Diseases Hospital in North Colombo, Director General of Health Services Anil Jasinghe said in a statement.

The man, a tour guide by profession, had worked with a group of Italian tourists and contracted the virus, according to a statement released by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's office.

COVID-19 has so far killed 631 people and infected over 10,000 in Italy.

The Lankan authorities are gathering information on the places visited by the Italian tour group.

The island nation has announced several measures in recent weeks to try and stop the spread of viral infection in the country.

It has started quarantining returnees from Italy, South Korea and Iran -- the countries experiencing major outbreaks of the coronavirus.

Sri Lanka on Monday suspended Buddhist pilgrimage tours to India, saying these trips are mostly undertaken by elderly people who are most vulnerable to COVID-19.

The religious tour, popularly known as 'Dambadiva Vandana', involves trips to Buddhist shrines in Bodhgaya, Varanasi and Sarnath in India and Lumbini in Nepal.

As part of the government's precautionary measures, the Sri Lankan Airlines suspended flights to China and Saudi Arabia indefinitely.

Last month, a female Chinese tourist, who was suspected of contracting COVID-19, was discharged from a hospital in Lanka.

30,11-3-20,"China reports 22 new coronavirus deaths, Xi makes first visit to epicentre Wuhan","China has reported 22 new coronavirus deaths, taking the death toll to 3,158, health officials said on Wednesday, as Chinese President Xi Jinping made his first visit to the worst-hit Wuhan city and lauded the authorities and medical staff for ""turning the tide"" against the deadly epidemic, saying that the initial success has been made in stabilising the situation.

Twenty-four new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus and 22 deaths have been reported on the Chinese mainland on Tuesday, China's National Health Commission (NHC) said on Wednesday.

All the 22 deaths were in Hubei Province and its capital Wuhan, the NHC said.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland reached 80,778 by the end of Tuesday, including 3,158 people who died of the disease in the last three months, 16,145 patients undergoing treatment and 61,475 discharged after recovery, it said.

Meanwhile, 31 new suspected cases were reported taking the total number to 285, it said.

With COVID-19 gradually abating in the country, China has now turned its attention to growing number of “imported cases” as more foreigners and locals started arriving in Beijing and different cities to join duties.

Also on Tuesday, 10 imported cases of novel coronavirus infection were reported on the mainland. Among them, six were reported in Beijing, two in Shanghai, one in Shandong Province and one in Gansu Province.

By the end of Tuesday, 79 imported cases had been reported, the officials said.

Xi, 66, on Tuesday made his first visit to Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, which along with the entire Hubei province with over 50 million people was kept under total lockdown since January 23, banning all movement of transportation.

The president visited a hospital treating severely ill COVID-19 patients and a residential community.

He visited patients, medics, community residents and workers, police officers, military personnel, officials and volunteers who have been fighting the novel coronavirus.

Wearing a protective mask and accompanied by a retinue of military and health officials, Xi visited a makeshift hospital and community residents and frontline workers in Wuhan.

Xi, who initially came under criticism for not acting in time to stem the virus when it emerged in December last year but later won praise for a decisive follow-up action, vowed to resolutely fight for a victory in the war against the virus, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Xi said the spread of coronavirus had been curbed in Hubei Province and its capital Wuhan where over 50 million people lived in total isolation since January 23 following a complete lockdown of the areas.

The initial success has been made in stabilising the situation and turning the tide in Hubei and Wuhan, Xi said.

Meeting medic representatives in the hospital, Xi said the spread of the virus has been basically curbed in Hubei and Wuhan, and attributed the achievement to efforts of the whole country and the whole society.

""But you are the biggest heroes,"" Xi told the medics.

This is the second visit by a top Chinese leader to Wuhan.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited Wuhan on January 26 when the COVID-19 virus spread at an alarming pace, prompting a lockdown of the city and the Central Hubei province with 50 million people.

Xi called for firm and meticulous prevention and control efforts to defend Hubei and Wuhan.

He said the situation in the province has shown positive changes with important progress, but the task of prevention and control remains arduous.

He stressed on taking epidemic prevention and control as a task of paramount importance.

Praising the people of Wuhan, Xi said the positive trend in epidemic control could not have been achieved without their sacrifice, devotion and perseverance.

With their concrete actions, the people of Wuhan have demonstrated the strength and spirit of China, as well as the Chinese people's love for their family and nation, which enables them to stick together through thick and thin, he said.

On behalf of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC), he condoled the death of people and medical staff who sacrificed their lives fighting on the frontline.

Over 3,000 medical staff were reportedly infected with 10 fatalities.

The frontline medical workers have taken on the most arduous missions, Xi said, calling them ""the most admirable people in the new era"" who deserve the highest commendations.

""I can confirm I have tested positive for coronavirus... And have been self-isolating at home,"" said the Conservative MP.

Health officials are now trying to trace where she contracted the virus and who she has been in contact with, she added.

Dorries, who helped craft the legislation to fight the bug, is the first British politician to be diagnosed with COVID-19, raising immediate concern about whether she has spread the infection.

The Times reported that she had been in touch with hundreds of people, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

She fell unwell on Friday while signing the document that declared coronavirus a notifiable disease, meaning companies could obtain insurance cover, said the paper, adding she was now believed to be on the road to recovery.

35,11-3-20,Be careful,"The water balloons used are the most dangerous as they can cause blunt eye injury. There is a risk of bleeding in the eye, lens subluxation, macular edema or retinal detachment. It can also result in permanent vision loss

The season of colours is here! Holi is a festival liked by people of all generations. The children must all set to play with colours and pichkaries. Often people ignore the side effects of these colours on the body. Our eyes are extremely susceptible during Holi. Wet colours easily dissolve in water and can easily enters into it.

Uses of synthetic colours that are composed of chemicals possess a great threat to one’s eyes. Colours contain chemicals like Mercury Sulphite, Lead Oxide and Copper Sulphate that are harmful. Exposure to these chemicals can result in eye allergy, temporary blindness and conjunctivitis (pink eye). Other health hazards due to exposure to heavy metals include skin allergies, dermatitis, drying and chapping of the skin, skin cancer, rhinitis, asthma and pneumonia.

In some cases, it may also result in partial vision loss. A gray patch appears on the retina and blocks the sight. It is a serious medical complication and therefore, should not be ignored. A delay in treatment can lead to complete loss of sight. Not only holi colours but also sprays or mace can result in temporary blindness.

Post the festival there is a rush of patients in hospitals because of skin, eye or general problems. The most common eye problems which present during the Holi include: allergic conjunctivitis, chemical burn, corneal abrasion and blunt eye injury.

The colours used in Holi if they go in the eye usually cause mild redness and irritation. This if does not go in a day or two will need treatment. The particles in colour powders (shining mica particles in gulal) can cause damage to the cornea. The patient will have pain and watery eyes and if not treated in time can cause ulcer/ infection in the eye. The corneal abrasion is an emergency and one should consult the doctor. One should always check if the clarity of vision is affected, then should rush to an eye specialist.

The balloons that are used are most dangerous and can cause blunt eye injury. There can be bleeding within the eye, lens subluxation, macular edema or retinal detachment. These can lead to loss of vision or loss of the eye. These are all eye emergencies and should be taken care of as early as possible.

36,11-3-20,Being overweight may up advanced prostate cancer risk,"Researchers have found that being overweight in middle age and later adulthood linked to a greater risk of advanced prostate cancer.

Using data from 15 large studies combined together, the research team examined associations between body fat, height, and prostate cancer risk in 830,772 men, 51,734 of whom had been diagnosed with prostate cancer.

""This study shows that adopting and maintaining a healthy weight in middle to late adulthood can especially reduce the risk of advanced prostate cancer,"" said study lead author Jeanine Genkinger from Columbia University in the US.

According to the researchers, prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer in men in the US. Fewer than one in three men with advanced prostate cancer live five years beyond diagnosis.

Before this study, only a few studies examined contributing factors to advanced prostate cancer.

There was an especially noticeable lack of research on the linkage between factors like weight in early adulthood, changes in weight during adulthood, and waist circumference, specifically with advanced prostate cancer risk, they said.

The current research took a life-course-based approach, examining survey data collected across respondents' lifespans to determine whether and at what age during adulthood excess body fat increased risk for advanced prostate cancer.

The researchers found that a body mass index (BMI) elevated above a healthy weight during the middle to late adulthood--median age range from 50 to 64--was linked to the greatest risk for developing advanced prostate cancer.

A ""healthy"" weight is defined as a BMI between 21 and 25 kg/m2, they said.

The study found that greater waist circumference was linked with an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer and death.

According to the researchers, although other studies have linked higher BMI with increased prostate cancer, this is the first study to find a positive association with waist circumference.

""These study results show that risk for advanced prostate cancer can be decreased by maintaining a 'healthy' weight and adopting healthy eating and exercising are factors that can help maintain a healthy weight,"" Genkinger concluded.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/being-overweight-may-up-advanced-prostate-cancer-risk-2020-03-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/being-overweight-may-up-advanced-prostate-cancer-risk.html

Rajasthan, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab have reported one case each, the ministry said.

Kerala has till now reported nine cases which includes the three patients who were discharged last month following recovery.

Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, who spoke to a few COVID-19 patients admitted at Medanta and Safdarjung hospitals through video calls on Tuesday, said all the people infected by the disease were stable and showing signs of recovery.

According to the protocol currently followed, a suspected case is tested at least twice before it is confirmed as 'positive'.

Amid rising cases of the COVID-19 pandemic globally, India on Tuesday barred entry of the nationals of three more countries -- France, Germany and Spain -- suspending the regular as well as e-visas granted to them till date.

38,11-3-20,Convicted rapist Weinstein to learn prison term,"Harvey Weinstein faces up to 29 years in prison when he is sentenced by a New York judge Wednesday, two weeks after he was convicted of rape and sexual assault.

The ex-Hollywood titan will be taken from the notorious Rikers Island jail to the Manhattan criminal court to learn his fate at a hearing starting at 9:30 am (1330 GMT).

Weinstein was found guilty of a criminal sexual act in the first degree and rape in the third degree on February 24, in a verdict hailed by the #MeToo movement.

Seven men and five women convicted him of raping ex-actress Jessica Mann in 2013 and of forcibly performing oral sex on former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006.

Mann, 34, and Haleyi, 42, are due to deliver impact statements in court.

Weinstein was cleared of the most serious charges of predatory sexual assault, as well as rape in the first degree, but will receive between five and 29 years behind bars.

Prosecutors called on Judge James Burke to issue a lengthy jail term, saying Weinstein engaged in a ""lifetime of abuse"" and had shown ""a total lack of remorse"" for his actions.

In a pre-sentencing letter, the prosecution asked Burke to consider 36 other sexual abuse and harassment allegations against Weinstein dating back to the 1970s that were not part of the trial.

""He has consistently advanced his own sordid desires and fixations over the well-being of others,"" lead prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon wrote.

""He has exhibited an attitude of superiority and complete lack of compassion for his fellow man."" In its own memo, Weinstein's team pleaded for the minimum sentence, suggesting Burke should take into account their client's achievements as a multiple-Oscar winner.

""His life story, his accomplishments, and struggles are simply remarkable and should not be disregarded in total because of the jury's verdict,"" the lawyers wrote.

They said anything longer than five years would mean a de facto life sentence for Weinstein who turns 68 next week.

The lawyers also cited the father-of-five's children, the youngest two of which are under ten years old.

Weinstein's counsel regularly clashed with Burke during the trial, even claiming at one point that he was biased against their client.

""My guess is that it's going to be a double-digit sentence,"" criminal lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman told AFP.

Weinstein, producer of ""Pulp Fiction,"" did not testify during his high-profile trial and it is not known if he will address the judge on Wednesday.

On the eve of the hearing, New York media published previously unsealed court documents which showed that Weinstein appealed to billionaires Jeff Bezos and Michael Bloomberg for help as allegations against him snowballed in October 2017.

The reports added that when Weinstein heard, incorrectly, that ""Friends"" star Jennifer Aniston had accused him of groping her, he wrote to his representative: ""Jen Aniston should be killed."" Following his conviction, Weinstein spent ten days in hospital where he had a stent inserted after complaining of chest pains.

He was transferred to the infamously violent Rikers, which once held Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols and rapper Tupac Shakur, on Thursday to await sentencing.

Weinstein is expected to be incarcerated outside New York City and will likely later be taken to Los Angeles where he faces other sex crimes charges.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/convicted-rapist-weinstein-to-learn-prison-term-2020-03-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/convicted-rapist-weinstein-to-learn-prison-term.html

43,11-3-20,Huawei's temporary license extended in US till May 15,"Huawei has got another breather as the Donald Trump administration has extended a license that allows companies in the US to do business with the Chinese telecom giant until May 15.

Ever since Huawei was put on a trade blacklist in May 2019 due to national security concerns, the US Department of Commerce granted a series of extensions of the Temporary General License (TGL) for the company which is a major producer of 5G equipment.

The license was previously extended until April 1.

The US Commerce Department on Tuesday said it was seeking public comments on whether it should issue future extensions of the temporary license for Huawei despite it being on the ""Entity List"".

At the same time, the US Commerce Department extended the license through May 15 to provide for this opportunity for public input.

People in the US can offer their comments from March 10-25.

The initial TGL from May 2019 and the three extensions that followed were intended to allow time for companies and persons to shift to alternative sources of equipment, software, and technology, the US Commerce Department said, adding that it is trying to find a permanent solution.

The TGL authorises specific, limited engagement in transactions involving the export, re-export, and transfer of items subject to the Export Administration Regulations to Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. and its non-US affiliates on the Entity List through May 15.

Huawei was added to the Entity List after the US government concluded the company poses a ""significant risk of involvement in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States"".",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/huawei-s-temporary-license-extended-in-us-till-may-15-2020-03-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/huawei-s-temporary-license-extended-in-us-till-may-15.html

46,10-3-20,End the chemical epidemic,"The P and K nutrients supplied by non-urea fertilisers are as vital as N supplied by urea. Yet, India is facing an increasing imbalance in the NPK use ratio

For decades, farmers in India have been resorting to indiscriminate and excessive use of chemical fertilisers such as nitrogen (N), phosphate (P) and potash (K) besides a host of secondary and micro-nutrients. This is leading to deterioration in soil health, an adverse impact on the environment and imperiling public health. The mother soil is the repository of these nutrients and the precise quantum in any given location depends on their stock to begin with, i.e. when farmers started cultivating the land (say 100 years ago or even earlier), addition from application of chemical fertilisers (or organic manure) and their uptake by the crops grown. By conducting a soil analysis, it should be possible to find out the stock of each nutrient viz. “N”, “P”, “K” and so on.

Juxtaposed with the requirement for growing a particular crop, the farmer can deduce how much of each nutrient needs to be supplied externally albeit from chemical fertilisers (or not to be applied at all, a scenario when the soil itself is in a position to meet all the requirements for uptake by the crops). But, this procedure is rarely followed, which causes a serious mismatch, leading to either deficient or excessive use of a given nutrient.

There is excessive use of urea — a dominant source of ‘N’ vis-à-vis complex fertilisers such as diammonium phosphate (DAP) the main source of ‘P’ and muriate of potash (MOP), the main source of ‘K’. This has led to an increasing imbalance in the NPK use ratio. On an all-India basis, currently this ratio is 6.7:2.4:1 against an ideal 4:2:1 with the attendant adverse effect on crop yield, health of soil and humans. This has even pushed some States on the brink of a chemical epidemic. For instance, in Punjab, where per hectare fertiliser use is higher than the national average, chemicals have found their way into the soil, ground water, the food chain and are identified as a key factor responsible for cancer in the State. To arrest this trend, in February 2015, the Modi Government launched the National Soil Health Programme (NSHP) under which it distributed soil health cards (SHCs) to over 140 million farmers. Growers are encouraged to test their soil every two years in State-run mobile and village-station laboratories. The laboratories analyse the soil on various nutrients including secondary and micro-nutrients and then the SHCs offer customised recommendations on fertiliser use.

According to a study by the National Productivity Council (NPC) which was carried out in 76 districts, spanning 19 States and covered 1,700 farmers, growers have cut the use of chemical fertilisers by up to 10 per cent. Further, productivity has gone up between five per cent and six per cent on assessed crops, resulting in higher farm incomes. Another study by the Hyderabad-based National Institute of Agricultural Extension Management (NIAEM) covering 3,184 farmers cultivating cotton, paddy and soybean across 199 villages in 16 States, showed that agriculturalists who applied fertilisers and nutrients as per recommendations written on their SHCs reduced cultivation costs by four to 10 per cent and increased their net incomes between 30 to 40 per cent.

Considering that the study covers a fraction of farmers, one wonders whether these results are truly representative of all cultivators in the States concerned. Assuming that this is the case and even if the reduction in use of chemical fertilisers by up to 10 per cent (as per the NPC study) was entirely in urea use, this is nowhere near the target of a 50 per cent cut set by the Government for itself.

In the backdrop of the World Soil Day on December 5, 2017, while delivering his Mann Ki Baat radio address, the Prime Minister said, “Can our farmers take a pledge to reduce urea use by half by 2022? If, they promise to use less urea in agriculture, the fertility of the land will increase and the lives of farmers will start improving.”

This is not to suggest that the NSHP can’t play a potent role in guiding farmers towards a balanced fertiliser use. While, the Government should continue with the scheme, it needs to attend to an overarching factor that lies at the root of the increasing imbalance. This has to do primarily with the policy environment with regard to the pricing and availability of each of the fertiliser types. To make fertilisers affordable to farmers, the Centre controls their maximum retail price (MRP) at a low level unrelated to their cost of production and distribution, which is way higher. The excess of cost over MRP is reimbursed to the manufacturer as subsidy. In the case of urea, the subsidy varies from unit to unit and is administered under the New Pricing Scheme (NPS) whereas for decontrolled complex fertilisers, MOP and single superphosphate (SSP), a “uniform” subsidy fixed on per nutrient basis is given to all manufacturers under the Nutrient Based Scheme (NBS). The cost of transportation (it includes primary movement by rail from the plant and secondary movement from the unloading rake point by road to the retailer) is reimbursed to urea manufacturers under a uniform freight policy. On the other hand, manufacturers of decontrolled complex fertilisers like MOP (excluding SSP) get reimbursement of freight cost only towards primary movement on the basis of actual rail freight, as per the Railway receipts.

Thus, the manufacturers/importers of decontrolled complex fertilisers, MOP and SSP receive a stepmotherly treatment vis-à-vis manufacturers of “controlled” urea. In case of complex ones (MOP/SSP), even as the Government normally keeps the subsidy unchanged, increase in the cost leads to an ever-increasing MRP. In sharp contrast, it keeps the MRP of urea at a low level (the current price Rs 5,360 per tonne is more or less the same as it was nearly 20 years ago) even as all escalations in cost are absorbed by increasing subsidy.

This results in disproportionately low MRP of urea vis-a-vis that of complex fertilisers, prompting farmers to use more of the former and less of the latter. The discrimination against complex fertilisers and MOP is also evident in their not getting freight subsidy on secondary movement to retail point (manufacturers of SSP don’t even get primary freight for movement from plant to railhead) as also in denial of natural gas, the feedstock used for making of ammonia — an intermediate used in manufacture of complex fertilisers — to their plants. In short, in almost every aspect, be it subsidy support, reimbursement of movement cost or feedstock supply — non-urea fertilisers have been at the receiving end. Their woes are further exacerbated by high dependence on imports (100 per cent in K and nearly 90 per cent in P) and resultant exploitation by global cartels by way of charging a high price. This discrimination has persisted for close to three decades following their decontrol in 1992, even as urea remained under control with disproportionately-high subsidy all through. The P and K nutrients supplied by non-urea fertilisers are as important as N supplied by urea. Merely because, the Government decided to decontrol non-urea fertilisers even while retaining urea under control, does not render the former any less important. Yet, it is this flawed perception in the minds of our policymakers that has contributed to the present mess. The SHC can, at best, guide the farmers on proper fertiliser use but it can do little to stem the opposite impact of flawed policies.

These glaring anomalies can be addressed by dismantling controls on MRP and the existing system of routing subsidy through manufacturers for both urea and non-urea fertilisers. Instead, give subsidy directly to farmers via the direct benefit transfer mode.

With this, the grower will be empowered in the true sense and will be free to use subsidy for buying fertiliser types needed by the soil that would be based on the recommendation embedded in the SHC. There could not be a better way of reining in excess fertiliser use and reducing the imbalance in the NPK ratio. Modi should use his political capital to crack the whip on this long-pending reform.

47,11-3-20,Oil sinks on Saudi move as equities lose early puff on virus fear,"Oil prices tumbled on Wednesday after Saudi Arabia dialled up its price war by hiking production by one million barrels a day, while a rally in equities went into reverse as investors nervously await a US coronavirus relief plan.

Markets had been showing signs of much-needed stability in early trade following two days of wild gyrations, thanks to a pledge by US President Donald Trump to unveil measures to counter the effects of the disease on the world's biggest economy.

Crude had provided support, rising for a second day after Monday's meltdown that marked the commodity's worst selloff since the 1991 Gulf War.

But jittery investors slowly sold out of the oil market as Wednesday wore on and then slumped deep into the red after energy titan Saudi Aramco said it plans to raise its output capacity to 13 million barrels a day.

""Saudi Aramco announces that it received a directive from the ministry of energy to increase its maximum sustainable capacity from 12 million bpd to 13 bpd,"" the company said in a statement to the Saudi Stock Exchange.

The hike marks the next volley in a production standoff with Russia sparked by Riyadh at the weekend, when it cut prices, sparking fears of a war for market share.

Both main crude contracts fell more than one percent, having been up as much as five per cent earlier in the day.

The move also came after Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told state-run TV channel Rossiya 24 that Moscow was open to cooperation with the Saudis and OPEC to address the price crisis, saying: ""I want to say the doors aren't closed.""

The U-turn on oil markets reflected a similar move in Asian equities, which had been well in positive territory in early exchanges.

Tokyo and Seoul ended more than two per cent down, while Shanghai finished 0.9 per cent lower and Hong Kong shed 0.6 per cent.

Sydney sank 3.6 per cent, putting it into a bear market -- a drop of at least 20 per cent from a recent high -- just two weeks after hitting a record. The index has several firms that rely on trade with China, while energy stocks have also been hammered by the oil rout.

Singapore and Taipei each lost at least one percent. Bangkok, Wellington and Jakarta were also lower, though Manila and Mumbai eked out small gains.

In early trade, London rallied two per cent, Paris jumped 1.7 per cent and Frankfurt gained 1.8 per cent.

Trump on Tuesday promised ""major"" economic measures to combat the impact on the US economy and held talks with Republican lawmakers, with an eye on a cut in payroll taxes as well as help for airlines, the cruise industry and small businesses.

The announcement from the president came as other governments pledge to act against the outbreak.

Italy's leadership, which has put the entire country in quarantine, is eyeing a USD 16 billion package, while Japan has unveiled a multi-billion-dollar emergency package.

The Bank of England (BoE) slashed interest rates by 50 basis points, hours before Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak was due to deliver a much-anticipated budget that is expected to outline a huge support plan.

Australia and Canada are expected to unveil measures in the coming days.

""Expectations for a 'major' fiscal stimulus package by the US government have underpinned sentiment -- even if the volatility suggests the market still needs a bit of coaxing,"" said AxiCorp's Stephen Innes.

""Indeed, investors were in desperate need of leadership from policymakers. Central banks can do their bit, but in times of viral cataclysm, it's governments that must be seen as in charge of the proceedings... Trump's actions evidenced how little it takes for markets to respond favourably.""

But the White House has yet to produce any concrete plans and observers warned about a possible sell-off should investors be left feeling short-changed.

""Having decided President Trump will save the world... Financial markets could be setting themselves up for a severe disappointment should the promised fiscal goodies get bogged down on Capitol Hill,"" said OANDA's Jeffrey Halley in a note.

While leaders gear up to fight COVID-19, the disease continues to wreak havoc across the planet, killing more than 4,000 people and leaving close to 120,000 infected.

On currency markets the safe-haven yen edged back up against the dollar, having gone into retreat Tuesday, while the pound lost one US cent after the BoE rate cut, though it soon clawed back about half of those losses.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/oil-sinks-on-saudi-move-as-equities-lose-early-puff-on-virus-fear-2020-03-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/oil-sinks-on-saudi-move-as-equities-lose-early-puff-on-virus-fear.html

52,11-3-20,Harvey Weinstein wanted Jennifer Aniston killed,"Disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein once suggested that global icon Jennifer Aniston ""should be killed"".

A New York Times report revealed the statement, as mentioned in a previously sealed court documents that were made public on Monday, reports hollywoodreporter.com.

Weinstein made the statement about the ""Friends"" star in 2017, during the start of the #MeToo movement, which was created in response to the sexual misconduct allegations made against him.

It is being claimed that he was apparently furious when he learned that the National Enquirer was planning to report that he also sexually assaulted Aniston.

Several records show that a spokeswoman for Weinstein forwarded him an email from the Enquirer.

""Not sure if you saw this one. Jennifer Aniston,"" wrote Sallie Hofmeister, a senior executive at the public relations firm Sitrick and Company.

The Enquirer's email read: ""Jennifer confided to a friend that during the production of the 2005 movie ‘Derailed', Weinstein sexually assaulted her by pressing up against her back in, grabbing her buttocks... Through the years he would frequently stare at her cleavage/breast and move his mouth around making Jennifer uncomfortable.""

""We also quote a source close to Jennifer who tells the Enquirer: 'Harvey was infatuated with Jennifer Aniston. He had a massive crush on her and constantly talked about how hot she was',"" further read the email.

After 45 minutes, Weinstein replied to the Hofmeister's email.

""Jen Aniston should be killed,"" he wrote.

The Enquirer never published the claims. A representative for Aniston denied them, and Weinstein's spokesperson declined to comment.

The emails were included in previously sealed documents filed in Manhattan Supreme Court. They were made public before Weinstein's sentencing on Wednesday for raping a hairstylist and forcibly performing oral sex on a production assistant for ""Project Runway"".",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/harvey-weinstein-wanted-jennifer-aniston-killed-2020-03-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/harvey-weinstein-wanted-jennifer-aniston-killed.html
53,11-3-20,'Black Widow' wouldn't have been as substantial 10 yrs ago: Scarlett Johansson,"Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson believes time is right for her stand-alone ""Black Widow"" film as she believes the movie wouldn't have been as ""substantial"" if it released a decade ago.

After 10 years and seven films of playing the Russian superspy Avenger Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow, Johansson is set to star in a solo film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

The film, directed by Cate Shortland, is a prequel set before the events of 2019 tentpole, ""Avengers: Endgame"".

Black Widow was the only female in the original Avengers. Johansson made her debut as the character in 2010's ""Iron Man 2"".

""For anyone who said to me, 'Oh, this should've happened five or 10 years ago,' I'm like, it would not have been as substantial.

""We just would not have been able to do it. This film is happening now as a result of what's going on in the zeitgeist, and I think it's pretty cool,"" Johansson told Entertainment Weekly.

After ""Captain Marvel"", the film is the second female superhero-led project in the MCU.

Johansson said the world was ready for ""Black Widow"" while she was filming a fight scene alongside fellow female actors Brie Larson (Captain Marvel), Danai Gurira (Okoye) and Elizabeth Olsen (Scarlet Witch), among others in ""Endgame"".

""I hope that this film continues pushing that boundary, so that we can actually have more female superheroes who are inherently female, and aren't just Batman in heels or whatever,"" she added.

Also starring Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz and David Harbour, ""Black Widow"" hit the screens on April 30.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-black-widow--wouldn-t-have-been-as-substantial-10-yrs-ago--scarlett-johansson-2020-03-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/-black-widow--wouldn-t-have-been-as-substantial-10-yrs-ago--scarlett-johansson.html
