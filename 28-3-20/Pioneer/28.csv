0,28-3-20,Lockdown: Medicines to reach at doors,"After successfully ensuring delivery of vegetables, milk and bread, district administration has made efforts to ensure delivery of medicines at doorsteps amidst lockdown.

East Singhbhum deputy commissioner Ravi Shankar Shukla said that the administration has divided the city into 10 zones and issued Whatsapp and mobile numbers of two-three medicine shops in those zones who are ready to ensure delivery of doorstep.

The service will start from tomorrow. The objective is to enforce lockdown so that people do not come out on roads even for essential needs.

The administration wants people to stay inside so that social distancing can be remained. The deputy commissioner also informed about starting of the Mukhya Mantri Canteen Yojana so that daily wage earners and poor get food. “Under the scheme, packed vegetarian food would be given free of cost during the period of lockdown at three points (auto-rickshaw stand – Sakchi, Mango Chowk and Sonari from Friday.

Usually foods should be given at Rs 5 per packet but we would not be charging any amount during lockdown period. However, we will deploy magistrates would ensure that beneficiaries maintain social distance of one meter while taking food,” the deputy commissioner said.

The administration has also planned to distribute sanitizers at minimum cost to the masses.“We are going to rope in Rakshak sanitizers that are made at laboratory of Adityapur-based NIT will be available for the masses in next three-four days. Each packet of 200 ml would be priced at Rs 20 to masses and those having ration cards will only have to pay Rs 5 for availing the sanitizers,’ the deputy commissioner added.Meanwhile, CM Dal Bhat Yojana is also reaching people in different areas. Meals on wheels is feeding people at Rs 5 only. To provide best benefits for those people who are suffering from poverty, Government of Jharkhand had introduced the scheme of providing food through low cost hotels. The scheme, which was initiated by the Chief Minister of Jharkhand during the year 2011, has been opened across various places.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lockdown--medicines-to-reach-at-doors.html
1,28-3-20,Lockdown: Vehicle checking drive adds to coffers,"Amidst lockdown around Rs 95,000 was collected as fines from traffic rule violators in checking drive launched in various parts of Jamshedpur on Friday.

The crackdown, carried out by the traffic wing of East Singhbhum police, is catching over 100 bikers, mostly youths, riding without helmet daily. The drive is conducted simultaneously across four traffic police stations - Sakchi, Bistupur, Golmuri and Jugsalai - around 10 am and continued till 7 pm.

""Despite lockdown commuters continue to flout orders. We want them to remain inside. However, we have found that even if they are out they are not following traffic rules,"" said an official.

The administration wants people to remain inside but despite orders bikers are spending time on road. Concerned over the prevailing situation, the district traffic police have decided to embark on a drive checking the helmets of riders and pillion-riders too.

“Considering the rising cases of Carona taking place the two-wheeler riders will have to wear helmet along with the pillion-rider. We are conducting random helmet checking drive, and if found any pillion-rider without a helmet, then he or she will have to pay a penalty as per the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act,"" said an official.

""We have taken the decision for making the pillion-rider too wear a helmet because the number of pillion-riders falling victim to fatal road mishap in and around the steel city is increasing. The decision to enforce wearing helmet on the pillion-rider is in accordance to the Motor Vehicle Act,"" said he.

Speaking about the measures being taken for curbing the mishaps on the city roads, the official said that they have put up about 200 hoardings across the city so as to create awareness for riding by wearing helmets, not to do drunk driving, tighten seat-belt while driving and avoid triple-riding.

He said apart from the hoardings, the department has put speed-breakers at wherever they felt necessary.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lockdown--vehicle-checking--drive-adds-to-coffers.html
2,28-3-20,"Street movement, essential services under shadow of confusion","It is confusion more than any fear or apprehension of coronavirus as Palamu has tested negative for a couple, who was kept in isolation in the community health centre in Hussainabad and as per the version of civil surgeon Palamu John F Kennedy this couple will be released to lead a normal life today.

Sources said the confusion is more in regard to the coming on to the streets. Who to come? Why to come? How many to come for providing essential services. There are many answers to it and more in conflict with each other. First confusion started with first concession given to bikers. Administration allowed bikes and people began to abuse and misuse it as well. Joy riding was done by youths to see how streets look deserted.

A few Romeos made their sweet hearts sat behind them and took a detour of the streets said sources.

DC Shantanu Kumar Agrahari said, “We had allowed bikes only to see that reaching essentials home by bikes will be easier, less time taking but some people began to misuse it and now we want no bikes on streets here.”Agrahari further said, “People are coming on to streets citing flimsy pretext and with lame excuses which cannot be heard or believed.” SP Palamu Ajay Linda’s contention is that a single rider cannot reach home any bagful of food grains/ vegetables/ gas cylinders/ essentials but Linda too has a stern note for such people who roam around in bike spinning ridiculous and fake pretexts/reasons.

HP gas agency proprietor A K Pandey said, “On Friday two of my staff were coming on a bike who were beaten by police for riding two on one bike and when my staff showed HP gas paper the police just brushed it aside.”

SP Ajay Linda on knowing of this complaint directed SDPO Sadar Sandip Kumar Gupta to look into the matter. Gupta later told the Pioneer “ Cops have been warned to act decent with people doing essential services.”Second confusion is in regard to water jar suppliers as when one operator of bottled water Manoj Jain approached the officials for pass for him and for his staff was curtly asked to bring ISO certificate in this time of distress.

Manoj Jain told this correspondent, “ My plant is too small. I have trade licence and registered with industries office here. I give water free to many dalit families every day.

There should be ease of pass for better deliverance of water which is of high quality and low priced 30 rupees for 20 litres.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/street-movement--essential-services-under-shadow-of-confusion.html

7,28-3-20,A mixed bag,"While some of the relief measures announced by the FM are just financial jugglery, the remaining items offer some concrete benefits to the poor

In his address to the nation on March 19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the setting up of an Economic Response Task Force (ERTF) under the Union Finance Minister (FM), Nirmala Sitharaman to come up with a package of measures to alleviate the problems faced by industries, sectors, businesses and workers due to the economic disruption caused by Covid-19.

The most seriously affected sectors, such as aviation, transport, hospitality, tourism, retail, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), are looking for a host of concessions such as additional interest subvention (for instance, MSMEs are demanding three-five per cent over and above the two per cent that they are already getting), moratorium on repayment of loans and interest dues, relaxing the repayment schedules and liberalising the norms for declaring a loan a non-performing asset (NPA). At present, a loan is classified as a NPA if it is not paid within 90 days and now the demand is for increasing this to 180 days.

The industries are also seeking reduction in policy rate, the interest rate charged by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on loans given to banks, by 50 basis points and reduction in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) to inject more liquidity into the economy and so on.

However, the worst-affected are tens of millions in the “informal” sector such as street vendors, craftsmen, construction workers, domestic workers, agricultural labourers, the self-employed and so on. They are in need of immediate financial relief and in substantial measure. What should be the relief amount per person? What will be its impact on the Budget?

India’s working population is about 40 crore. Of this, 94 per cent or 37.6 crore are in the informal sector. The national minimum wage of an informal worker is approximately Rs 175 per day or Rs 4,550 per month (26 working days) and when s/he doesn’t get to work, s/he loses this much income. For 37.6 crore workers, this comes to about Rs 1,70,000 crore per month. If the lockdown continues for three months, the loss will be Rs 5,10,000 crore. This should be the quantum of Direct Income Support (DIS). What has the FM offered?

On March 24, for the industries and businesses, Sitharaman announced reliefs which are largely “procedural.” These include extending the date for filing returns (income-tax, Goods and Services Tax, customs, excise and statutory filings under the Companies Act), reducing interest chargeable on delayed payments, exemption from penalty, increasing threshold of insolvency filing and so on. She also indicated that the financial package for affected sectors will be separately notified based on recommendations of the ERTF.

On March 26, apart from providing insurance cover worth Rs 50 lakh for doctors, nurses, paramedics and sanitation workers, she announced the PM Gareeb Kalyan Scheme (PMGKS) aimed at providing immediate assistance — in both cash and kind — to millions of poor. The scheme entails a total expenditure commitment of Rs 1,70,000 crore.

The package includes giving five kg of rice/wheat per person per month for “free” to around 80 crore people through the Public Distribution System (PDS) plus one kg of preferred and region-specific choice of pulse per household for three months (this is in addition to the five kg of rice/wheat already being given to them per month); ex-gratia of Rs 500 per month for three months to Women Jan Dhan account holders to benefit 20 crore women; release first installment of Rs 2,000 under the PM-KISAN scheme to 8.69 crore farmers in the first week of April; an ex-gratia amount of Rs 1,000 for the next three months in two instalments to three crore widows and senior citizens; free gas cylinders to 8.3 crore women Ujjawala scheme beneficiaries for three months; and an increase of Rs 20 in wage rate of workers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) to benefit five crore people.

For construction workers, State Governments have been directed to use the welfare fund for building and construction labourers (it has around Rs 31,000 crore) to help people face economic disruption because of the lockdown.

Likewise, the funds available under the District Mineral Fund (DMF) can be used for testing activities, medical screening and providing healthcare to fight the pandemic.

Besides, under the Deen Dayal National Livelihood Mission (DDNLM), Women Self-Help Groups (SHGs) will get collateral-free loans up to Rs 20 lakh (up from Rs 10 lakh earlier) to benefit 630,000 SHGs.

For the organised sector, the Government will pay the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) contribution of both the employer and the employee or 24 per cent for three months. However, this is only for those establishments with up to 100 employees, 90 per cent of them earning less than Rs 15,000 per month.

Further, the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) regulation will be amended so that workers can withdraw up to 75 per cent for contingency expenditure as non-refundable advance or three months of wages in advance, whichever is less. This is expected to benefit 4.8 crore workers.

Of the 10 items, payment under PM-KISAN is merely a rehash of what is already being done. The proposed relief for construction workers and healthcare from the respective funds is not amenable to any precise quantification.

The increase in loan limit for Women SHGs is not a cash transfer or grant. The 24 per cent contribution to EPF may sound attractive but is hamstrung by a rider; thus, even if the number of employees earning less than Rs 15,000 per month is 89 per cent of the total, the concerned establishment won’t be eligible. The change of EPFO regulation merely allows the worker to withdraw his own money.

The remaining items offer some concrete financial benefit. Let us attempt to arrive at a number by putting relevant pieces together.

For a woman Jan Dhan account holder, who is also the head of the household, the value of 35 kg rice (for a family of five people at five kg per person) and one kg pulse is Rs 955 (market price of rice: Rs 35 per kg and pulse Rs 80 per kg); Rs 500 ex-gratia; Rs 500 value of subsidised gas cylinder and Rs 600 increase in wage under MNREGA. All put together, the benefit comes to Rs 2,555 per month.

This is a good sum, though far below the amount required to offset the loss of income resulting from the lockdown. Besides, an overwhelming numbers of workers in the informal sector will be left out; their benefit may at best be restricted to five kg of free wheat/rice and one kg pulse (that too subject to the capability of the existing distribution network to supply these grains to the needy).

However, we should also not be oblivious of the fiscal implications of even a limited package. The nerve-shattering Covid-19 has come at a time when the Government is staring at a big shortfall in tax collection. As it is, at Rs 15,75,000 crore, the target for 2020-21 (increase of 31 per cent over the likely actual during 2019-20 at Rs 12,00,000 crore) — fixed prior to the crisis — was highly unrealistic. Post-crisis, this may look like daydreaming. With the inevitability of global recession and lack of market appetite, the target for proceeds from disinvestment of its shareholding in Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) i.e. Rs 2,10,000 crore (a major source of non-tax revenue) is clearly out of reach.

Some experts have suggested that the Government may relax the fiscal deficit (FD) target for 2020-21 by one percentage point to release about Rs 2,00,000 crore. But this can’t be viewed in isolation from the existing fiscal position. If, deferred subsidy payments (DSPs), extra-budgetary resources (EBRs) are included, already the FD should be six per cent (as against the budgeted 3.5 per cent). The steep decline in both tax and non-tax revenue (courtesy the Coronavirus) will increase it further.

On top of this, a further relaxation of one per cent to meet expenditure commitments under PMGKS will lead to a fiscal catastrophe. We may defeat the Coronavirus eventually but the vast majority of the poor will be crippled by resulting high inflation (for the first time in decades, the Centre is asking the RBI to buy its bonds which in plain words means “print new currency” and is inflationary), high interest rates, high cost of capital to industry, plummeting real wages and so on.

All this points to a dire need for expediting reforms in all crucial areas viz. food, fertilisers, fuel, power, irrigation, credit, taxation, banking and PSUs so as to result in a “sustainable” reduction in spending and achieve the desired buoyancy in tax revenue. But, for now, it seems all reforms have been put in the deep freezer.

8,28-3-20,Humanity united like never before,"China's response to the Coronavirus outbreak is a lesson on how to stay strong in times of a global community crisis

With nations being plagued by the alarming spread of Covid-19, the concept of world unity has acquired a new meaning and dimension. The world is unitedly trying to stop the march of the Coronavirus and scientists, researchers and doctors are looking for solutions on a war footing. Spreading and multiplying with exponential spikes, the Covid-19 has claimed 24,863 lives and affected 5,49,220 people around the world till date and the numbers are growing by the day. These are tough times and many world leaders are also in the grip of the Coronavirus, with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson being the latest addition to the list.

It is times like these that make us question the idea of free movement across boundaries and borders. Though, over the decades, global connectivity has contributed to the exponential growth of trade, commerce and technological developments, such pandemics make us rethink and measure the perils of having superior transportation networks. However, a snag in the fabric of humanity is far from what it will take to make us abandon our collective consciousness and human integrity.

Given China’s rampant growth and the high population density based on the millions of businesses operating here, it is no mystery why the containment and arrest of the Covid-19 outbreak was difficult to manage. To add to this, China’s booming economy and industrial network made the virus travel and assault other nations faster than anticipated. Having no real history to speak of and completely based on hygiene checks and regular sanitisation, there is no tangible measure to hold on to. This has quite naturally spread panic and hysteria among people, who are majorly concerned about the collapse of aid and governance with time.

China, on the other hand, has been lauded for its determined response in fighting and containing the epidemic. Being the epicentre of a mortifying disease with unknown capabilities, it must have been an uphill task. But, despite the world slamming the nation for bringing the Coronavirus epidemic upon it and being fixated on how Beijing tackles this crisis, what China has done, as a community, is spectacular. Right from proactively locking down its borders and suspending travel from and into the country — which seems like a huge decision to take considering how deeply-entrenched trade and business is in Chinese functioning — the response has been fast and competent.

Having an established reputation for being miles ahead in technology and development, discipline and excellence, China has indeed lived up to the world’s expectations by rapidly acting against the spread of the Coronavirus, taking drastic measures to lock down and isolate its population. When every major Virology expert is stressing on the need to quarantine and restrict movement among citizens, the complete shutdown of Wuhan and other Hubei provinces within a few weeks of the outbreak of the Covid-19 contagion was a monumental factor in slowing down the virus’ spread.

It is almost unheard of, in the recent past, of a major superpower completely alienating itself and strictly imposing travel restrictions, effectively jeopardising its economy and trade relations, just to combat an illness. Not just this, being the flagbearer of human capital availability, China was able to construct two gigantic, 1,000-bed hospitals, with state-of-the-art facilities and test kits, within days. Such a dedicated and coordinated effort by the healthcare professionals, first responders and construction workers, is no mean feat. They stood by their nation and poured their hearts and souls into those developments, all the while being dangerously susceptible to exposure.

China has been called the fasting-growing economy for years. With its booming industrial markets, it has achieved stellar heights of business leadership. With the Covid-19 contributing to plunging stocks, decimated production chains and halted exchange of raw materials to industry leaders like Apple and Tesla, it is amazing how the country has managed to hold on to its nerves and not crumble under this onslaught.

Interestingly, while the number of Coronavirus cases has been growing across the world, it is on the decline in China. This goes to prove that suspending schools, offices, all major gatherings and eventually going into a lockdown, indeed turned the stakes in humanity’s favour. Having a responsive and watertight public healthcare system also nipped the problem in the bud, historically speaking.

It is hard to imagine what would have transpired if this decision had been delayed by Beijing. The pandemic, that is taking a new and aggressive shape each passing day, would have become an even bigger monster, impossible to fight.

The Coronavirus outbreak and China’s response to it is indeed a lesson on how to put barriers around panic and keep a strong face in times of a global community crisis. And finally, it is a sight to behold, how we humans have united against a common enemy and are fighting for mankind’s survival, shoulder to shoulder.

9,28-3-20,An ocean of opportunity in assistive products,"All that marketers need to do is deliver value in the form of access to an equal lifestyle at a reasonable cost to divyangs and they would find huge numbers of loyal and proud customers

It is often said that marketing is the link between (a segment of) society’s needs and its economic response patterns. However, one major group of customers that has largely been ignored by marketers is persons with disabilities (PwDs) or divyangs.

When the corporate strategy guru CK Prahalad exhorted companies in the late 20th century to alleviate poverty and profit from the “Bottom of the Pyramid”, the targetting horizon for corporates widened significantly. Thus was opened a new frontier which corporates had not thought of till then. On similar lines, today it might be worth looking at special needs groups like PwDs as profitable target segments in a focussed manner.

According to the World Bank, the size of this market is in the range of approximately 15 per cent of the global population. That is to say, approximately one billion people on the planet are in dire need of products that can help solve their problems of fitting in, holding down jobs, or simply surviving with dignity. In India, the number of divyangs is nearly 2.7 crore. Add to this another 150 million senior citizens who also face varying degrees of disabilities and impairments as they age. A further impetus comes from the knowledge that as lifespans increase due to better healthcare facilities, the proportion of senior citizens will only increase in the future. It might, therefore, be safe to surmise that it is a lucrative-enough market to pursue with earnestness. Are marketers scanning the demographic and divyang data well enough to aggressively chase this segment? Could it be a new frontier for early starters in this domain?

Intervention experts who work with PwDs have time and again exhorted industry doyens to design and develop assistive devices that will help an individual to do something that they otherwise might be incapable of doing. It often helps people overcome a handicap.

Some examples of assistive technologies are: Aids to help mobility like wheelchairs, scooters, walkers, canes, crutches, prosthetic devices, and orthotic devices. Devices that help hearing-impaired individuals hear/hear more clearly. Aids to assist cognitive functions in people with memory, attention or information processing challenges. Computer hardware and software that enable individuals with mobility and sensory impairments use computers and mobile devices. Tools to help learners with disabilities participate in educational activities with the help of automatic page turners, book holders and adapted pencil grips. Also, closed captioning via apps to help people with hearing problems watch visual content.

It can also include physical modifications in the built environment, including ramps, grab bars, wider doorways to enable access to buildings, businesses/workplaces and yellow strips to outline safe walking areas. Plus, high-performance mobility devices made with lightweight materials that enable divyangs to play sports and be generally active physically. Also, adaptive switches and utensils to allow those with limited motor skills to prepare food, consume it and accomplish other related activities, are the need of the hour.

PwDs have the same range of aspirations, preferences and attitude towards brands and products as people without. And yet this niche market is underserved. While the big companies focus on the vast majority of the market, smaller firms and entrepreneurs will do well to engage with this niche segment.

People like to buy from people who look like them. So divyangs may be engaged in advertisements to PwDs. Marketers should test-market products on PwDs and their family members or care givers to obtain precise feedback. Some researchers contend that when companies marketing to PwDs have divyang employees in their organisation, it helps in connecting with the target group as having a varied customer base appears to be more acceptable to PwD customers. Marketers must also exhibit genuine interest and concern for the PwD segment by engaging with disability-oriented organisations and non-profits in their activities. Marketing to PwDs needs appreciation of the fact that disabilities are varied and a one-size-fits-all approach will be counterproductive. For instance, a visually-challenged person’s needs would be quite different from that of a mobility-impaired one.

Marketers would also do well to bear in mind that instead of trying to bring new products, tweaking existing ones to improve accessibility could be quicker. For instance, a braille smartphone for the visually- impaired; Artificial Intelligence- based software that converts speech into text for the hearing-impaired; cars designed to allow wheelchair- bound people to enter the vehicle directly with the wheelchair and then drive sitting in the wheelchair itself; voice/gesture-activated home appliances for the mobility-impaired; medicine boxes with light/sound signals to help elderly and memory loss individuals remember to take/keep track of prescribed drug schedules; spectacles-mounted laser pointers for computer keyboards for cerebral palsy patients and so on.

There is an acute need for “assistive technology products”, much more than what marketers have cared to explore. With Government policies like Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan (Accessible India Campaign) in motion since 2015, marketers could deliver a better quality of life for PwDs because there is now a structured approach and framework available. Importantly, such marketing must not be pursued as a charity or philanthropic activity.

10,28-3-20,Costly skin in the game,"With the certainty that the Taliban will return to the corridors of power in some form or the other, it is a no-brainer to conclude that New Delhi needs dexterity than ever before

In 2001, General Abdul Rashid Dostum, then a fierce warlord, the first Vice President of Afghanistan and a key political figure for the northern Afghan provinces now, apparently said the following to the Captain of the US Army Special Forces ODA 595 fighting the Afghanistan war. The latter was on a classified mission in the wake of the September 11 attacks that led to the fight for Mazar-i-Sharif. “There are no right choices here. This is Afghanistan. Graveyard of many empires. Today you are our friend, tomorrow you are our enemy…You will be cowards if you leave. And you will be our enemies if you stay.”

With close to 100 attacks in Afghanistan post the signing of the US-Taliban deal, the decree by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to release 1,500 Taliban fighters and competing power axes in the country with Opposition leader Abdullah Abdullah and Ghani holding parallel inaugurals of the new Government in Kabul, Afghanistan threatens to come full circle from its Taliban-ruled days. Indeed, 18 years later, the US is caught between the coward-enemy binary, with the Taliban spokesman Za-bihullah Mujahid announcing, “As per the US-Taliban agreement, our mujahideen will not attack foreign forces but our operations will continue against the Kabul administration forces.” Moreover, as the Trump administration has deliberately concealed two written annexes of the deal from the public, much remains in the realm of speculation regarding the details of the pact. This would lead one to make assessments, whether or not the Taliban is living up to the end of the bargain, which is almost impossible.

The US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s latest dash to Kabul to reconcile warring parties in Afghanistan, to form a unity Government and begin intra-Afghanistan talks, did not see any progress. However, the Trump administration’s threat of slashing $1 billion in assistance to Afghanistan has yielded some result with the Ghani Government and the Taliban agreeing to prisoner-swap, starting March 31. There has been little progress on the issue of two parallel Governments in Kabul. As the US is dealing with one of the worst pandemics in its history right now, its resolve to leave Afghanistan in the next 14 months is going to further strengthen. To this end, there are a few questions that need clear answers from India’s point of view. What does the emerging situation mean for peace in Afghanistan and the larger regional stability in the region? How will the resultant geopolitical and geostrategic space in Afghanistan be used by external powers? What should be India’s role in a new Afghanistan, where the Taliban has gained renewed legitimacy?

Depicting a change from its earlier stance, New Delhi welcomed the pact between the US and the Taliban. During his first foreign trip, Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla reached Kabul for a two-day visit and met top Afghan political leaders a day before the US-Taliban peace agreement was signed in Qatar on February 29. The Indian Ambassador to Qatar, P Kumaran, was also an invitee of the Qatari Government to the signing ceremony.

In November 2018, two Indian representatives participated, non-officially, in the Moscow chapter of the Afghan peace talks, which included a high-level representation from the Taliban. Besides the fact that it doesn’t want to be in a camp opposite to the US, an increasingly close partner of India in global endeavours, there is an apprehension in New Delhi about being left out of the processes that are shaping Afghanistan’s politics if the latter continues strategic distancing from the Taliban.

Pakistan’s role as one of the facilitators in bringing the Taliban to the negotiating table has further shrunk New Delhi’s diplomatic heft, apropos Afghanistan at the global high table. As such, there are signs of greater skin in the game in Afghanistan for India to pre-emptively deal with an emerging politico-strategic dynamic over there.

Afghanistan has come full circle — first the ouster of the Taliban Government, then a democratic Afghan Government with security force, to the return of the Taliban as a legitimate political player. Despite the Americans calling it an agreement “between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, which is not recognised by the US,” there is no denying the fact that the peace deal has brought a sense of legitimacy to the Taliban. This compels a shift in New Delhi’s Afghan strategy.

There are at least three factors that point to India’s shifting policies in Afghanistan, albeit without an endgame. First, India’s improved relations with the US and its increasing convergences with Washington have left little room for it to be on a side that’s vehemently opposed to the latter. More so when China is becoming a key player in Afghanistan. US President Donald Trump, during his recent visit to India, is said to have solicited support from New Delhi for the Taliban deal. Second, America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan tacitly thrusts a greater regional responsibility on India. This is not just in correspondence to the emerging regional expectations on the part of Afghanistan but also a palpable realisation in its scheme of regional leadership. Finally, having a greater skin in the game for India in Afghanistan, albeit with deliberate moderations in its role over there, seems to be the best option for New Delhi as the choice is between being there and being left out.

India’s role in Afghanistan since 2001 has largely been focussed on the civilian reconstruction of the war-torn country, with involvement in the security sector limited to training Afghan officers in Indian military institutions, and a rather restrained willingness to supply military platforms and equipment. Owing to recent developments, questions over the nature of India’s role in Afghanistan are being acutely debated in the Indian strategic community.

The Ghani-led Afghan Government in Kabul has barely emerged from a divided election result and is faced with an uphill task in terms of thrashing out the future of the country with the Taliban, which has steadfastly refused to recognise its legitimacy, calling it a puppet of the US Government. Much is also contingent on the release of the remaining 3,500 Taliban fighters as promised by the Ghani Government. Therefore, while New Delhi, Washington and Kabul may still call for an Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process, it will be naïve not to consider the return of a full-fledged violence by the Taliban.

For India, the most pertinent question is: What kind of leverage has Pakistan gained in the entire gamble, in exchange for its role in the US-Taliban talks, given its influence over the Taliban leadership and intentions to maintain strategic depth in that country? Pakistan’s regaining of the “strategic depth” runs counter to all efforts to establish an influential Indian presence in Afghanistan.

The recent heinous attack at a gurudwara in Kabul that killed 28 Sikhs portrays the complexity of the challenge for India in Afghanistan as the only legitimate backer of the elected Afghan Government even as the US purposefully recedes. If India continues to guard its stakes, irrespective of the nature of the next Government over there, it should brace for a long resistance and fight with the Pakistani deep state. As was evident in the gurudwara attack, Pakistan will intensify the use of the Haqqani network and other terrorist factions that it has a leverage on, as a front to attack India.

The India-Afghanistan strategic partnership, among other things, is based on a resolute Afghan Government in Kabul. At this juncture, with the certainty that the Taliban will return to the corridors of power in some form or the other, it is a no-brainer to conclude that New Delhi needs dexterity than ever before. Add to this, the complex picture of China, which has shown its willingness to invest in Afghanistan. The US pullout, therefore, can be an opportunity for India to fill the strategic gap. But to do this effectively, it would either require an enhanced security apparatus in Kabul, whether by partnering with another country or by itself. Both will have tremendous and long-drawn repercussions.

11,28-3-20,States take charge,"They may not have the halo but some CMs are coming up with effective systems for managing the virus spread

This is a chilling reality. Fifteen lakh international travellers arrived in India between January 18 and March 23. And the Government is trying to find all of them with respective States to gauge the extent of infectivity they have set off. There is no doubt about the whole-heartedness of efforts by the Centre in tackling the COVID-19 and attempting a national lockdown on a colossal scale, the biggest in the world, to build a culture of social distancing as the only preventive. The economic relief package and foodgrains for the poor may still not be enough but India is a huge country with several challenges and this is the time when our federal structure is being tested. And while it is Prime Minister Narendra Modi who gets the national attention, the work done by some Opposition Chief Ministers in their respective States proves that unitedly each could learn from the other and forge a united front with the Centre. In the process, we are developing innovative models of crisis management that may hold us in good stead to manage not only this wave of the virus but future pandemics as well. One such Chief Minister is Kerala’s Pinarayi Vijayan, heading a State that has not only tamed the deadly Nipah virus but confined, choked and controlled it. Kerala’s model of testing, finding, isolating and contact-tracking with a round the year follow-up surveillance is paying off results. Even before a Central package, the Vijayan Government announced a Rs 20,000 crore relief measure and is the first to give some dignity to migrant labourers, who are homeless and without food post-lockdowns, by officially designating them State guests. Not only that, having learnt hard lessons in disaster management during the floods, Kerala is also opening community kitchens and shelters for the displaced. This inclusivity is not just a tokenism or a political plank to be used at opportune moments; the Vijayan Government has always tried to integrate migrant workers, paying them three times the minimum wage in other States, providing for their children’s education and enrolling them for several State schemes. The Arvind Kejriwal Government in Delhi has eased lockdown pressures, although the city is one of the hotspots of COVID-19 in India, and created a three-layered response model of preparedness. It has allowed e-tailers, 24X7 operation of shops selling essential provisions and medicines and is converting abandoned buildings as either shelters or quarantine areas. It even has a graded action plan for the spike in cases, from 100 to 500 and upwards, and has roped in voluntary services of private doctors to stem the tide once the cases rise. The four lakh community kitchens in school premises for the poor will hopefully stem the exodus of daily wagers. The Gehlot

Government in Rajasthan has set an example in Bhilwara, the State’s epicentre of the virus, by locking it down completely before the national diktat, aggressive contact tracing and now possibly testing every citizen in clusters. Captain Amarinder Singh in Punjab, the State which sees high international arrivals, completely cut it off before any other State had.

Meanwhile, Mamata Banerjee in Bengal, true to her style, took to the streets, distributing masks and drawing circles in public markets to educate people about the norms of social distancing. She has pledged no food shortage and is preparing for the surge with makeshift medical facilities. Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik may have been extremely low-key but has been one of the first to set up a network of quarantine and care centres, his post-flood management holding him in good stead. In fact, going by reports, States and Union Territories with more testing centres are reporting higher cases of incidence. In the end, this is a big test of endurance and leadership. If we pass this, then we might just go back to cooperative federalism than a competitive one. Welfarism could be shared.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/states-take-charge-2020-03-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/states-take-charge.html
12,28-3-20,Stepping up,"The Indian state is finally responding to the Coronavirus outbreak with more alacrity

The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) announcement that it will infuse close to Rs 3.74 lakh crore into the Indian financial system to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic is welcome. Alongside, its move to cut the repo rate and reduce the cash reserve ratio will give the economy the much-needed boost it will sorely require once the lockdown ends, hopefully without thousands of more victims. The reverse repo rate has been slashed by 0.9 per cent while the cash reserve ratio of lenders has been lowered by a whole percentage point. According to the Central bank’s own admission, the repo rate currently stood at 4.40 per cent, down from 5.15 per cent earlier. Given that the Indian economy was already reeling and now that the entire country has been put in lockdown, halting all commercial activities, such a move was all but essential and expected. We should all understand that the Indian economy, in fact, financial systems across the world, will take several months if not a few years to recover from the mess that the Chinese recalcitrance has wrought on supply chains, banking systems and even on the informal economy back home. In fact, we would be lucky if we register any growth this financial year. While the Government’s earlier relief package of Rs 1.70 lakh crore was meant to help the poor and dispossessed, the Central bank’s move makes it amply clear that India’s consumer economy is what keeps the wheels of the economy greased. It may include a minuscule number of Indians but they do matter. Making sure that they stay afloat after the crisis ebbs will help the poor in the long-term as well. This is not making light of the situation but simply stating a fact. Several industries will be badly impacted. Even after domestic and international flights are allowed again, it is unlikely that India’s aviation sector will resume with the numbers that it did before flights stopped. It is quite likely that the restrictions on flights will be lifted slowly but with the consumer economy devastated and the fact that there are bound to be thousands of white-collar job losses, it is unlikely that vacation travel will pick up anytime before 2021 at the earliest. Many people are likely to be holding onto cash reserves for a while and only pay essentials such as educational fees. People must be encouraged to spend because this is what keeps chefs, waiters, housekeeping staff and even pilots employed.

While the RBI has announced a moratorium for term loans, a lot will now depend on the banks and other lending institutions to act and pass on the benefits to the people. Instead of increasing Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates, may be the Government should consider reducing rates, particularly on high-value items such as automobiles, to encourage consumption. We should all understand that the year 2020 will be a dead loss in terms of economic growth. Projections of a two-three per cent growth might be too optimistic if the visitor from Wuhan stays on till the winter, when the entire economy could even regrow. We can only hope that there is a rebound of sorts when things get back to normal, whenever they do. And for that to happen, confidence has to be kept high. Therefore, the RBI’s decision is a positive for India. Now over to the Indian corporate sector and the consumer.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/stepping-up-2020-03-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/stepping-up.html

18,28-3-20,Labourers travel miles on foot to reach home,"Home returning of large numbers of labourers working in other states is continuing after the spread of Corona virus infection and complete lockdown across the Country.

People started returning their home when Prime Minister, Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced complete ‘Lockdown’ for preventing spread of Coronavirus infection. The Coronavirus pandemic has crippled the world including India.

With trains and buses shut, migrant labourer who build offices, home and roads have taken walking their way back home- hundreds of kilometers without proper food and water.A large numbers of people migrate from the State to work as daily wage workers in other State. When the Prime Minister announced ‘Lockdown’ then all the construction works were stopped and the labourer became jobless.

After announcement of ‘Lockdown’, trains and buses are not plying on their routes so that the labourers were forced to return their home on foot. Due to lack of vehicles, they are forced to travel on foot. About 9:30 pm late on Thursday, 30 such labourers traveled a distance of about 200 km from Rourkela in Odisha and reached the district headquarters on foot. The Gumla District Administration escorted everyone to their destination via bus.

All these labourers were residents of Palamu District. They were also going to leave Palamu on foot from Gumla. But in Tower Chowk, the Police Officers and Jawans stationed at a standstill stopped them. On questioning, the workers told that they all work in Rourkela. Work came to a standstill after the lockdown.

Vehicle owners discharged. Three days before the vehicles were not found, they left for Palamu.The workers told that they reached Gumla on foot after not getting water and food and they have to go even further from here, they have no option other than to walk. The security forces who stopped the workers at a barricading Gumla, informed this to their Senior Officers of the District. After this, all the labourers were medically examined.

They were then taken to Rain Basera in Khadia Pada of Gumla where food was arranged for all of them.

20,28-3-20,Punjab Police attacked for punishing violators,"Amidst reports from various quarters regarding Punjab Police using force against the violators, including women, to check curfew violations, about 16 incidents of assault on cops have also come to light from across the state since the curfew was imposed.

Working round the clock to ensure supply of all essential services including distribution of food items, even delivering medicines, contact tracing, and much more, the state police force has come under attack for punishing the violators and indulging in name and shame by making their videos.

“These are the testing times for everyone, including the cops. If we are asking the people to stay indoors and stopping them from venturing out, we are doing it for them so that they did not get infected…but people think that whatever the police do, is wrong. Alright, it is not right to beat someone, but what would one do if they don’t understand,” a senior police official said while talking to The Pioneer.

And when the Punjab Police was facing the heat for using excesses, numerous incident of assault on cops in the state were also reported during the lockdown period.

Sample this: One Mayank Sharma was arrested by the police after he assaulted a police constable Navjot Singh at Haibowal in Ludhiana city, and an FIR, under sections 353 and 186 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered against him. In another case, Khanna-resident Rahul Thapar and his brother assaulted Inspector Jaswinder Singh and Home Guard jawan Ajmer Singh while they asked them to close their shop in curfew.

Ludhiana’s Manjali Kalan village resident Hardeep Singh also assaulted an ASI Kans Raj and was booked under sections 353 and 186 of the IPC. One Gagandeep Bharadwaj assaulted police party of Anandpur Sahib police station, headed by Sub-Inspector Sarabjit Singh, and pushed a woman constable Amandeep Kaur and also tore the uniform of Home Guard jawan Jaswant Singh while they were on duty. He was booked under sections 353, 186, 354, 294, 279, 506 and 188 of the IPC.

And the list goes on

A total of 42,515 police personnel across ranks, along with volunteers, were on the ground on Friday to enforce curfew and maintain essential supplies as well as law and order.

A total of 79 FIRs were registered and 104 persons arrested in 24 hours till Friday evening for curfew violation and violation of quarantine guidelines, said the state DGP Dinkar Gupta.

He said that the 112 police emergency number, transformed into Curfew Helpline a day before, had received 17,000 calls in 24 hours, of which 10,699 calls related to queries regarding COVID-19 and or other information.

“COVID emergency-related calls were 1176, of which 406 related to violations of curfew, 531 to supply of essential commodities, 65 to medicines, 102 to reporting of suspected cases of Corona Virus and 10 to medical assistance, while 62 were miscellaneous calls and the rest of the calls related to issues not related to COVID,” he said.

To further streamline operations, all Commissioners of Police and SSPs of the districts have nominated designated officers for specific tasks, such as District War Room, District Control Room, maintenance of essential services, maintaining smooth flow of traffic in the district including the National or state Highways, District Police Media Liaison officer, and Hospital/Medical Liaison Officer.

In view of the serious threat posed by COVID-19 to the people of the State and the need to contain the spread of the decease, te DGP once again cautioned the citizens to show self-restraint and discipline, and strictly adhere to the curfew restrictions and the lockdown.

He warned that the police would have no choice but to book all those violating the lockdown under the stringent provision of Disaster Management Act, 2005, as well as suitable provision of the IPC.

Punjab Police on Friday scaled up its curfew relief operations across the State through the distribution of nearly 1.9 lakh food packets and set up medical camps in various districts, while facilitating the movement of about 3000 trucks and lorries carrying essentials into the State across various Inter-State border points in the past 24 hours.

Of the 1,88,317 food packets distributed, 1,34,815 lakh were of cooked food and 53,502 were dry food packets, said the state police chief Dinkar Gupta.

A maximum of 28000 food items was provided to 28,000 people in Mansa, while 1100 packets were given out in Moga, 7500 in Patiala, 15,000 in Pathankot, 3667 in Ropar, 8000 in Sangrur, 9000 in SAS Nagar, 1000 in SBS Nagar, 7000 in Sri Muktsar Sahib and 9600 in Tarn Taran.

INTRODUCING INTER-STATE CRITICAL EMERGENCY TRANSIT PASS, BADDI INDUSTRY PASS

Even as the police continued to clear 1600-odd applications received from individuals for e-pass under the facility launched a day before, it was also working on introducing new kinds of passes like Inter-State Critical Emergency Transit Pass, covering the states of Punjab, Delhi, UP, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and UT of Chandigarh, and the Baddi Industry Pass to facilitate travel.

“For a large number of 1600 applications received, passes had been granted. A few had been rejected while others are still under process,” said the DGP.

Notably, the Digital e-Pass facility, a web based application, was launched by Punjab Police on Thursday across the State for providing about nine different kinds of e-passes for different kinds of categories, such as hospital, medical related issues, mediapersons, movement of essential goods, essential services, health workers, government officials, vendors (fruits, vegetables, groceries), delivery workers (grocery, fruit, vegetable, restaurant, chemist).

FACILITATING SUPPLY THROUGH COMMUNITY KITCHENS

To facilitate supply of essentials, the DGP said that senior officers were initiating special measures in their respective districts. “Community kitchens have now been set up in three slum areas of Ludhiana (Rural) Police district. In Ludhiana (Rural) district, dry packets were distributed to around 1600 persons while cooked meals were served to around 12000 people,” he said.

“Under the guidance of Kapurthala SSP, medical camps were organized in area of Phagwara, Subhanpur and Begowal areas. In Bathinda, 1400 packets containing dry rations were distributed by the Police which included five kg atta, one kg Sugar, 100 gm tea, half kg ghee, hald kg dal, one kg rice, one kg namak, all necessary spices. In addition, 8140 cooked packets were distributed in Bathinda” he said.

RESTORING INTER STATE SUPPLY CHAIN OF ESSENTIAL GOODS

Gupta said that all-out efforts were being made to restore the supply chain of essential goods as well as all kinds of foodstuff and perishable commodities, which had been disrupted due to the sudden lockdown order of the Union Government.

“The movement of goods vehicles (trucks and lorries) across the inter-state border as well as within the State, especially those carrying essential goods and perishable commodities, have been restored completely, and at present, no trucks are stranded at any of the Inter-state borders,” said Gupta.

To ensure the smooth and uninterrupted operation of the Inter-State supply chain of goods, the supervision of the Inter-State Barrier on NH-1 at Shambu in Patiala had been given on 24/7 basis to Jatinder Singh Aulakh, IGP Patiala Range, he said.

CURFEW POLICE OFFICERS TO were also being made to enroll volunteers as ‘Curfew Police officers’, especially in villages and city or town mohallas, to enforce the curfew, especially in certain areas and villages where the police presence was thin on the ground.

Barnala SSP has enrolled 50 such volunteers while Bathinda SSP has engaged Village Chowkidars and Forest Guards for enforcement of curfew in the villages.

“Efforts are also being made to involve ordinary Rickshaw pullers to sell vegetables or milk etc in small areas of operation. This would facilitate delivery of vegetables and provide livelihood to the rickshaw pullers,” he said.

WON’T TOLERATE MISTREATMENT AGAINST WOMEN DURING CURFEW: PSCW

Taking suo-motu notice of “police excesses” against women during the curfew in the State, Punjab State Commission for Women chairperson Manisha Gulati on Friday cautioned the Police personnel to be more humane and sensitive in dealing with women.

Gulati said that curfew was imposed in the state on March 23 to contain the outbreak of Corona Virus which is a step taken in a right direction. But the reports are coming from different parts of the state through social media or other mediums that police personnel manhandled women in the name of restrictions,” she said.

“This is a matter of grave concern and taking serious notice of it, under the State Women Commission Act, 2001, I have written a letter to Punjab Home Secretary, DGP Punjab and all the Deputy Commissioners and SSPs of the state,” she said.

She said that safety and security of women should be ensured during restrictions, and that all possible help should be provide to women if the need. She also advised to take special care to elderly and sick women.

SAD ASKS CM TO INSTRUCT POLICE TO USE PERSUASION AND STOP HUMILIATING PUNJABIS

SAD president Sukhbir Badal on Friday strongly urged Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to immediately reign in those members of the police force who are subjecting Punjabis to humiliation, not sparing even the ladies and the elderly.

He also urged his party’s leaders, especially the legislators, to stand by the people in their respective areas and to coordinate between them and the administration to ensure the supply of essential commodities.

SAD chief also directed them to be vigilant against any emergency being faced by members of any family and to ensure that they are delivered the necessary help. “Contact me directly wherever they face difficulties in delivery of service to the people. Cooperate with the administration and seek their cooperation. But wherever you face resistance, contact me directly,” he said.

Sukhbir said that SAD would function as the responsible opposition in the State and back all constructive efforts of the government in dealing with a difficult situation.

However, Sukhbir asked the senior police officials to issue necessary instructions to ensure that the police officials down the line use persuasion and, wherever necessary, a show of firmness rather than use of brute force and utter insensitivity while carrying out their onerous task.“I fully realize that the police officials are themselves under tremendous strain and are performing a most challenging duty away from their families. I fully appreciate your contribution, especially at this difficult hour, but there is no need or justification in harassing and humiliating Punjabis as some officials have done at several places. No Punjabi will refuse to cooperate. Use persuasion and where necessary, firmness, but not brute force,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-police-attacked-for-punishing-violators.html

23,28-3-20,Cops double up as good Samaritans,"

|

Blasting the stereotypical image of cops being brutal, abrasive and insensitive, some police personnel have been doing yeoman’s service to needy people by either providing food or ensuring transit to their destinations or both. And yes, they did not wait for government funds to undertake the humane and charitable acts.

Ironically, these good Samaritans generally go unnoticed. In Lucknow, Kaiserbagh bus stand outpost in-charge Pawan Mishra emerged as the providential provider for over a hundred stranded people, including women and children in the true sense.

After trying two major bus stations in the city, some hapless workers and their families trudged from Sarojininagar to Kaiserbagh bus station late Thursday night. Most of them used to work in industrial units but did not leave for their native places fearing deduction of wages. Hoping against hope, they enquired about any possible mode of transport to reach their destinations only to be turned away by the Roadways staff.

And not without reasons. Their diverse places of nativity surfaced as a major problem. While a group had to go to Gonda, Bahraich, another group was headed to Siddharthnagar and Basti. The third batch wanted to reach Meerut, Bareilly, Rampur etc. while members of another group were residents of Kanpur Dehat, Mahoba and Banda.

It was then that one of the desperate youths approached Mishra and narrated their hopeless plight. Assuring to help them, Mishra arranged for some quick snack and tea and ensured that they slept under a roof.

On Friday morning, bus station outpost in-charge Pawan Mishra spoke to UPSRTC assistant regional manager of Kaiserbagh bus station, Sabita Singh, and requested her to arrange transit for the hapless people.

Later, Mishra set up a makeshift kitchen outside the small outpost and the cops with the help of some locals got busy preparing lunch for the marooned people.

On her part, the assistant regional manager promptly took up the process of sanction of special buses with her seniors and by 1 pm, five buses covering all the routes were sanctioned by the Roadways.

The police officer got the travel clearance fast-tracked and finally these stranded people were ready for their homeward journey.

But before they boarded their respective buses, Mishra ensured that the passengers had a wholesome meal of ‘poori-sabzi’.

Elsewhere, outside Charbagh railway station, at loco police outpost of Hussainganj, a kitchen has been started by SHO of Hussainganj, Anjani Kumar Pandey, since the night a national lockdown was clamped.

Cops on duty, men and women in uniform were seen distributing poori-sabzi and water bottles outside the outpost to about 70-odd destitutes, migrant workers and menial labours around 2 pm on Friday.

When enquired, Pandey said that most of these people depended on the railway station for their livelihood.

“While some did menial jobs, others just lived on alms. But now that trains have been suspended they do not anything to eat and nowhere to go. There are some who just could make it to the station before the lockdown and were stranded. As fellow humans we could not just allow them to starve. So we started a small kitchen at the outpost and started giving them two meals a day for sustenance,” he said.

On being asked about the funds needed for the work and the time frame of the charity, the inspector said, “We pooled some money and we will keep on taking care of them at least till the lockdown is over.”

Similarly in Varanasi, ADG Zone Braj Bhushan has started community kitchen from the mess of police stations and outposts and it is catering to poor people living in shanties and those who have been stranded.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cops-double-up-as-good-samaritans.html
24,28-3-20,Imam held for violating lockdown,"An Imam was arrested in Bulandshahr while cases were registered against about two hundred others for violating the lockdown orders enforced to maintain social distancing and prevent spread of coronavirus.

Top Muslim clerics had already appealed to the members of their community not to visit mosques and instead offered Friday prayers from their home.

According to reports from Bulandshahr, a case was registered against 22 people, including two imams, for offering prayers in mosques despite the nation-wide lockdown in Jahangirabad and Dibai areas of Bulandshahr district, police said on Friday.

Senior Superintendent of Police in Bulandshahr, Santosh Kumar, said that ignoring repeated warnings, around two dozen people were offering ‘namaz’ at a mosque in Mohalla Kayastha Bara of Jahangirabad.

On receiving information, when police station incharge reached the spot, the people fled.

Meanwhile, Imam Nazir Ahmed, who was offering prayers, was arrested and a case was registered against 21 people.

In a similar incident, several people were offering prayers at a mosque in Kaser Kala village in Dibai area of the district. When the police reached the spot, the people fled.

Police were bringing the imam after arresting him but due to strong resistance from people, the cops let him off to avert any untoward incident. However the police registered a case in the matter.

In another incident reported from Hardoi, as many as 150 people were booked for offering prayers collectively in a mosque despite the lockdown in the district, police said on Friday. Superintendent of Police Amit Gupta said that despite the order to not have gatherings or crowds at any religious place and cultural programmes in the country, incidents of prayers being offered collectively in three mosques were reported in Hardoi on Thursday.

Initiating action against all three mosques, a case has been registered against over 150 people and imams of the mosques.

Similarly, about 100 people were offering prayers at a mosque in Sandila town, 35 others at a mosque in the city Kotwali area and 20 at a mosque in Pali town after which police reached the spot.

The cops reprimanded the people after the prayers ended and then registered a case.

In Kanpur also, people gathered inside a mosque in Muslim dominated area and offered Friday prayers collectively.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/imam-held-for-violating-lockdown.html
25,28-3-20,Daily wagers braving lockdown and hunger,"

|

Unmindful of filth strewn around, Sonu Kumar Mishra rolls out a ‘roti’ as his three colleagues get ready for dinner at the pavement in front of a shop in Azad Market in Lucknow. Mishra is a mason, while his friends are helpers. They are natives of Bahraich and had come to the state capital to earn a living.

“There is no work. Construction work has stopped suddenly. We did not have any work for the last three days. Now that we want to return home, there is no conveyance. Buses, trucks and jeeps are off the road. We are stranded here,” Mishra said.

His friend Sonu interjected, saying that they had no money to purchase ration. “We will have to sleep empty stomach if we fail to get work or any transport to go home by tomorrow,” he said.

Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, promising relief to the poor. A few days back Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had launched a scheme to give Rs 1,000 per month to labourers, hawkers, rickshaw-pullers as maintenance allowance for those who lost employment because of the lockdown.

“I have not heard about the scheme,” Chhotu Yadav said.

All three have bank accounts in their villages. As per the announcement made by Yogi, registered labourers would get Rs 1,000 and over 20 lakh poor daily wagers would benefit from this initiative.

“We just want to go home. The assistance of Rs 1,000 is not enough. The government should provide us transport so that we may reach our homes safely,” Mishra said.

These are people who come from nearby areas to Lucknow and work at construction sites as labourers. Some of them are painters, some carpenters and the rest are menial workers. They earn anything between Rs 300 and Rs 800 per day depending on their skills. In normal days, they assemble at mazdoor mandi – also called mazdoor adda – where clients hire them.

“The adda is not working. No one comes there. In the morning, I went there but police shooed me away and asked me never to come there again,” Mishra said.

“Since morning, we are sitting here, contemplating how to return to our villages,” he said, looking around the area strewn with filth and waste.

“We are forced to stay here. Earlier we used to sleep on road dividers under metro line but the police have asked us to leave the place so we have decided to come here because police do not come here.

“Bagal mein kuda ghar hai na (it is a dumping ground),” Chhotu said.

All three have heard of coronavirus but do not know exactly what it is. “Koi bimari hai (It is some disease),” one of them said. But they were unaware of the precautions like social distancing and hand washing. They do not even have soaps, what to talk about hand sanitiser.

“It may be a killer disease but how long can we survive without food? We do not have money to buy provision and want to go back to our homes soon,” Mishra said.

Mishra and his ilk were not the only one facing the brunt of coronavirus. There are rickshaw-pullers, e-rickshaw drivers and tempo drivers who are finding it hard to make both ends meet. With railway stations, airports, bus stations, offices and schools closed, daily commutation has come down to a nought.

Dileep Nishad, a rickshaw-puller, had stayed home since March 22 but on March 27 he came out of his house to look for some work. “The has government allowed people to move out and purchase vegetable and daily provisions. I thought I will get some ‘sawari’,” he said.

But instead he was stopped by the police. Bhoothnath police outpost in-charge Dinesh Pandey shouted, “Go back home. They do not realise that this is a critical time. These rickshaws will carry two-three people which could be very dangerous.”

After Nishad pleaded saying he was left with no money and he be allowed to ply his rickshaw, the cop said, “Bus ek chakkar. (Just one round).”

Pandey looked at him, went inside his outpost and returned with a packet containing some rice and flour. “Take this,” the cop said.

As Nishad accepted the packet, the cop also took out Rs 200 from his wallet and gave it to him saying, “Ïse bhi rakh le. Par bahar mat aana, (Take this too, but do not come out),” he said.

Elsewhere in Lucknow, where people have money they crowd the place to purchase food and provisions.

“I am getting some rice, flour and vegetable oil as I am not sure how long this (lockdown) will continue. The situation is bad and will turn worse in coming days. I believe the government may even impose curfew after a few days. Hence I am stockpiling provision,” government employee Kamlesh Saxena said.

“I know it is risky and (one can) get infected. But I have no choice because the government guidelines are not clear about door-to-door supply of provisions,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/daily-wagers-braving-lockdown-and-hunger.html

Giving a big relief to farmers, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced that wholesale and retail shops of fertilisers, seeds and pesticides would remain open during lockdown,.

On the directions of the chief minister, directives have been issued to all divisional commissioners, district magistrates and district police chiefs in this regard, a government spokesman said here on Friday.

He said to ensure smooth supply in the farm sector, companies making fertilisers, seeds and pesticides and workers loading and unloading these inputs and vehicles transporting them would also be exempted from lockdown restrictions.

The spokesman added that combine harvesters used in harvesting and workers operating them would also be exempted from lockdown restrictions during this period.

It may be mentioned here that this year, the farmers are already in distress due to the unpredictable weather in February-March. At present, mustard, potato, pea and gram crops are either in the field or in barns. Wheat crop is also getting ready to be harvested.

“In such a situation, the farmers are worried that because of lockdown, they would be unable to safely shift their produce to their homes. At the same time, farmers, whose agricultural fields have been cleared or are about to be cleared, are also worried because they have to sow green fodder, urad, moong before kharif crop,” an official said.

This decision has given the much needed relief to farmers who sow vegetables as well as do traditional farming.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/fertilisers--seeds-and-pesticides-shops-to-open.html

30,28-3-20,Drones to power fight against corona in C’garh,"With the states across India pulling out all stops in the country's battle against coronavirus, a Chennai-based drone company too is using its technological innovations to tackle the scourge in Chhattisgarh capital Raipur and elsewhere.

""Our drones will spray disinfectant on areas specified by the Chhattisgarh government, usually hospital areas, government offices and buildings,"" Agnishwar Jayaprakash, Managing Director of city-based Garuda Aerospace, told IANS.

Jayaprakash, 29, has created quite a splash in the international swimming pools to win medals for India.

In his home state Tamil Nadu, he says, the government is doing pilot studies on spraying disinfectant with Garuda's drones on the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, as also Ripon Building that houses the Greater Chennai Corporation, and others.

The drone manufacturer has bagged orders from some private hospitals in Chennai for disinfecting their buildings as well, he added.

The challenge before him is to reach Raipur with his drones and pilots amid the national lockdown.

""We will spray disinfectant over 770 acres initially. We will send two drones and two pilots by road initially. We can finish the spraying task in two days,"" Jayaprakash said.

""The total order is of Rs 2.3 crore for sanitiser spray across 180 sq km,"" he added.

Interestingly, Jayaprakash was born with a lung ailment and will now be using drones to kill a virus that damages human lungs.

According to him, Garuda Aerospace is getting enquiries from various state governments for disinfecting public places by using drones.

On the business model, he said: ""It will be a sort of Drones as a Service (DAAS). We will provide our drones and the pilots to operate them. The customer has to provide the disinfectant.""

He pointed out that a drone could cover 20 km distance compared to a human's 4-5 km within specific time and that a fleet of 300 drones can cover 6,000 km linear distance in a day.

""During a pandemic, speed of disinfecting areas is important. Further, it is safe as health workers could be exposed to health risk while drones and their pilots are not. The speed, productivity, and precision of drones are better than human beings,"" he added.

Jayaprakash said that each drone can spray 40 litres of disinfectant every day, if deployed for 12 hours. The drones can fly up to a height of 400 ft and carry out spraying operations on even on tall buildings.

According to him, Garuda has manufactured and serviced drones for several government departments in Tamil Nadu, like forests, electricity, police, mining, agriculture, Indian Coast Guard and others.

As the company had used drones to spray pesticides on farm land, it occurred to him to use them to spray disinfectants also, he said.

Queried about the industry size in India, Jayaprakash said it is worth about $100 million and 15-20 organised players with all statutory licences.

According to him, officially there are about 16,000 drones in India.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/drones-to-power-fight-against-corona-in-c---garh.html
31,28-3-20,COVID-19: Cleanliness Commandos service extended,"Taking up cudgels against the coronavirus pandemic, thousands of ‘cleanliness commandos’ are quietly working round the clock to disinfect and cleanse the cities across the state.

Keeping in view of the instrumental role of the cleanliness warriors in battling against the infectious COVID-19, the state government has decided to extend their services for two more months.

State urban administration minister Shiv Kumar Daharia on Friday instructed all the concerned officials of the urban civic bodies across the state about the directive.

Daharia said as per the instructions of chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, a special cleanliness drive is going on in all the civic bodies across the state.

The cleanliness commandos are working day and night to ensure that disinfectants are sprayed and pure drinking water supply is uninterrupted across the state even during the lockdown, he said.

“Responding to a call of the chief minister, they are working tirelessly in shifts to reach every area of the urban civic bodies across the state,” the minister said.

The coronavirus outbreak has struck in the urban bodies more than the rural areas.

A control room has also been set up, from where monitoring of the 166 civic bodies of the state, especially spraying, cleanliness, disinfection and other work, is being done every day.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/covid-19--cleanliness-commandos-service-extended.html
32,28-3-20,Forces may halt anti-Naxal operation during corona pandemic,"In view of the humanitarian crisis that has erupted due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, security agencies are mulling over the option of halting all the counter-insurgency operations against armed Maoists in the Naxal belt of India.

Sources told IANS news agency that the security agencies in Chhattisgarh are exploring the possibility of a ""humanitarian ceasefire"" as the Covid-19 contagion is spreading in India, with around 700 infected and 14 people dead so far.

However, the top police officer of Naxal operations in Raipur, Inspector General of Police (Bastar range) P. Sundar Raj told IANS said that security forces do not have the authority or mandate to take such decisions.

""I am just a police officer. Bastar Police and security forces here have a mandate to ensure safety to life and property of the people. At present the entire world is fighting against Covid-19. Bastar Police is also committed to fighting this virus,"" he said.

The IGP said that hygiene is a major issue among Maoists since they all live together in a commune with hardly any healthcare. ""There is no social distancing in a commune and the villagers are worried about it at the moment. They are putting not only their lives at risk but endangering the lives of thousands of tribals living in the nearby areas. There is a lot of social pressure over the Maoists to shun violence during this global crisis,"" he said.

Also, due to the lockdown, the entire system, other than the essential services, outside the Maoist areas, has come to a standstill. ""Because of the terror created by the Maoists, it is generally difficult for healthcare workers to work in Naxal areas. Now with the country-wide lockdown, volunteers who are helping with essential services and distribution of relief packages, will find it even more challenging to help the tribals living in the Maoist controlled areas, if Naxals continue their violence,"" the counter-insurgency specialist said.

Just three days ago, police found bodies of 17 security personnel who had gone missing after an encounter with Maoists in Sukma district of Chhattisgarh.

Ceasefire, Sunder Raj said, is an option when the state launches a war. ""The state is not the aggressor or perpetrator of violence here. The state has always desired peace for its citizens. Our endeavour right now is that we maintain peace while fighting the coronavirus together with our healthcare system and essential services to cope with the humanitarian crisis. Now it is up to the Maoists to take a call to shun violence in the greater interest of the humanity,"" he said.

Incidentally, the Communist Party of the Philippines, in a direct response to the call of UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres for a global ceasefire between warring parties for the common purpose of fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, has ordered all its commands and units to observe a nationwide ceasefire from March 26 to April 15.

The convener for the new peace process in central India and activist who works with displaced tribals in Chhattisgarh, Shubhranshu Choudhary has also appealed to the government and armed Maoists to observe ceasefire and initiate a peace dialogue through the lockdown.

""Government figures in India say that in the last 20 years, more than 12 thousand people have died in this conflict. In 53 years, about 40 thousand people may have been killed here. I request the Indian government and the Maoists to follow Philippines at the moment. When a tsunami struck in Indonesia in 2004, a ceasefire that started between the rebels and the government in Aceh area, was finally successful in reaching a peace agreement in 2005,"" Choudhary said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/forces-may-halt-anti-naxal-operation-during-corona-pandemic.html

Khattar also discussed procurement arrangements with Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Jai Prakash Dalal and his Principal Secretary Rajesh Khullar through video conferencing.

He further said that keeping in mind that procurement of mustard and wheat is only five days apart, there is a possibility that both crops are procured together and in order to accommodate both the crops, separate procurement centers apart from the existing mandis are required to be built. For this, the sheds of Radha Swami Dera Satsang buildings will be used for purchase.

Khattar said that Mustard is procured through HAFED and Haryana Warehousing and Wheat is procured through Food Corporation of India.

This year, the minimum support price for Mustard has been fixed at Rs 4425 per quintal and Rs 1925 per quintal for Wheat. In the mandis, if the bid price of the crops is less than their minimum support price then the difference is compensated under the Bhavantar Bharpaii Yojana.

He said that the Government is committed to purchase each and every grain of the crops of farmers. He said that this time, the actual bid for crops in the mandis will be assessed from the headquarters at Chandigarh and for this, Siwani Mandi of District Bhiwani has been selected as a pilot project for online auction.

45,28-3-20,"Defeating corona, reviving economy: Challenges galore","The lockdown in India to contain the Novel Corona virus situation is the largest of such exercises in the world, even though it may not be enough to contain the spread of the virus in the country but undoubtedly, for now it is the wisest of the decisions taken.

However, it has affected 1.3 billion Indian population, at a time when the economy was struggling, when India's gross domestic product grew 4.7 percent in the last three months of 2019. Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has not been very kind towards this decision of the Government.

According to him, ""This is a serious concern because not only does the lockdown keep people from going to work, it keeps them at home which is not necessarily that pristine isolated place, but can also be a slum where people live together”. There can be no denying that this has paralysed businesses across the country and has put millions of people out of work, leaving them struggle with basic requirements like food.

One of the major challenges that India faces is providing money and other resources to people without livelihoods so that they have money to spend, have access to food and medicines and keep public services running. The Government has however taken a slew of measures to ease the burden of the citizens. After first easing tax deadlines and business regulations, the Fianance Minister announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore relief package for the poor.

On the other hand, India’s public health sector is hindered in tackling the corona virus pandemic as many healthcare organisations are facing a severe shortage of basic protective gear and ventilator support.

On a global front, amid such a situation the confusion and lack of coordination between countries is very obvious. But the real concern is, it has to be eradicated from all parts of the world, and it demands coherence among the countries in strategising to defeat the outbreak. This requires rich countries to mobilise resources to under-developed nations so that they have a better chance to fight the pandemic.

India, that is the Asia's third largest economy has shut borders and close down businesses; its equity market also witnessed massive selloff. It has now become clear that there is every chance that it shall be contributing to a global recession along with other nations. And now we have to worry, as this public health emergency and lockdown has made the revival of consumer demand and private investment a near difficult goal. It is quite clear now, that this lockdown will have serious implications for the country's economic growth, and the Government must take serious steps to free the economy and use its limited financial resources prudently.

The picture is quite saddening, from aviation, tourism to food, all sectors of industry are hit. Workers in the informal sector who comprise four-fifth of India’s workforce will suffer, mainly because, in view of huge revenue losses, the businesses will be either closed down or go for wholesale retrenchment of workers. Apart from that, roughly 350 million informal workers in service sector shall suffer, which includes waiters, truck drivers and taxi drivers. And there is no wonder the banks will suffer, as borrowers will postpone repayment or default. But with people keeping indoors, the internet companies and online shows shall continue to do some business.

The major challenge before the Government is now to deal with the corona-induced economic challenges, and it should ideally combine financial and non-financial measures to heal the economy, since the fiscal deficit for the year is almost 30 percent beyond budget. A national lockdown for 21 days may reduce the transmission of the deadly virus, but what is awaited to be seen is, what happens after 21 days? It is a fact that the virus won’t disappear after that, until and unless we have a vaccine in place. Even if we have a vaccine it shall take many months to vaccinate every Indian.

The 21-days national lockdown should be used to create a massive testing infrastructure, so that every asymptomatic person could be tested and quarantined. And this perhaps is the only way to manage the coronavirus outbreak before we get proper drugs and vaccines. The absence of widespread testing and dearth of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for doctors and medical staff is a real bad news, which should be ideally fixed in between this lockdown period.

The State Government had on Thursday decided to give six hours relaxation in curfew by maintaining proper social distancing, but it was felt that the people were misusing this relaxation and coming out unnecessarily thereby defeating the purpose of curfew.

Now, the State Government had decided to give three hours relaxation daily in the curfew so that people could purchase essential commodities nearer to their homes, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said in a video conference meeting with the Deputy Commissioners of the State from Shimla.

Thakur said Deputy Commissioners would be authorised to fix the relaxation time as per their suitability and requirements of the respective district. He asked the Deputy Commissioners that endeavours should be made on home delivery of essential commodities so that people could not come out from their homes for getting daily need items besides ensuring proper distancing between person to person.

The CM said DCs must evolve some mechanism particularly in urban areas by roping in big chains like mega mart, big bazaar and other wholesale sellers to ensure home delivery. He said that in rural areas also Panchayati Raj Institutions could be involved to provide delivery of essential commodities to the people at least nearer to their localities. He also urged the volunteers to come forward in providing home delivery of essential items to the people.

The Chief Minister said that it should also be ensured that no one is left without food and shelter and same should be provided in the urban areas to the labourers. He said that special thrust should be laid to provide all possible help to the industrial workers stranded in industrial areas and construction workers in various project sites. He said that lists of labourers in apple belt and other rural areas should be prepared so that they were provided food and shelter accordingly.

Thakur said it should be ensured that medicine shops were opened and supply of milk and vegetables was adequate in the State so that people do not face any inconvenience in getting these items during the period of relaxation of curfew. He also asked the Milkfed and Kamdhenu to ensure proper supply of milk and its items in the urban areas to facilitate the people.

He directed the Deputy Commissioners to identify such areas where people could be provided vegetables and milk without any inconvenience and proper social distancing could be maintained. He said that locations should also be identified for street vendors and urged the people to ensure that they purchase essential commodities during the relaxation in the curfew from their own locality and do not use vehicle for purpose.

Thakur also asked the Deputy Commissioners to make such arrangements that farmers and horticulturists do not face any problem in getting fertilizers, pesticides, insecticides and spray oils for their crops during relaxation of curfew.

Chief Secretary Anil Kumar Khachi apprised the Chief Minister about the steps taken by the Government to ensure effective implementation of curfew in the State and assured that an effective mechanism would be evolved to provide essential commodities to the people at their door steps.

Additional Chief Secretary Health R.D. Dhiman said that there was adequate availability of sanitizers and Personal Protection equipment (PPE) kits and medical and paramedical staff was kept on alert to tackle the situation.

Director General of Police S.R. Mardi said that essential commodities vehicles would not be unnecessarily harassed as this would hamper supply of commodities.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/curfew-now-to-be-relaxed-for-3-hours-daily-in-hp.html

In Haryana, the Manohar Lal Khattar Government announced to shut down all the liquor shops from the midnight of Friday till April 14.

52,28-3-20,Is having sex during corona safe?,"As social distancing and self-isolation practices during the lockdown due to COVID-19 scare have brought almost all activities to a standstill, many people seem to be now reconsidering sex lives with their partners.

For all those couples who have missed their shots of romance due to hectic daily schedules, the lockdown situation has catered them plenty of time to make it up, now that they are free from all professional obligations, except the ones who are into emergency services, until the lockdown restrictions are lifted.

The term ‘romance’ holds numerous definitions and yet, physical intimacy is considered quite a strong expression of love between couples. To add to that, it’s also an effective way to destress. So, in these times of utmost freedom, many couple choose to explore their sex-lives together.

But, amidst the scare of COVID-19 pandemic where even a handshake is discouraged, is it safe to have sex?

If a research by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is to be followed, there have been no traces of the COVID-19 virus in the semen or vaginal fluid yet. Also, it is known that other traits of coronaviruses don’t efficiently transmit through sex.

However, an advisory issued by the NYC’s Health Department said that one must avoid sex if their partner is a COVID-19 positive or shows any possible symptoms of it like fever, cough or shortness of breath. Though it said that physical intimacy with a regular partner was safer, a casual encounter could be a risky affair as anyone can be a carrier.

Recently, another article stated that amidst increasing anxiety due to the coronavirus pandemic and elevated intimacy among couples, who otherwise led a hectic life, the sales of condoms and contraceptive pills have soared in the market. Although there are no proven facts about transmission of the lethal coronavirus through sex, some people still choose to stay safe than sorry.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/is-having-sex-during-corona-safe-.html

The Government has only exempted the movement of essential services across the country after the Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced 21-day national lockdown.

Earlier, when the curfew for public safety was imposed, several employees of e-commerce firms had complained that police were not allowing them to ply on road.

On Wednesday, a meeting between senior police officials and e-commerce companies was held where police said they will allow these companies to deliver food and groceries.

However, on Thursday, Delhi Police Commissioner SN Shrivastava released another order withdrawing the online firms to re-start their services. Though the order also stated that the police will revise the guidelines for the online companies.

On Friday, the CP has again issued an order complying with the guidelines given by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). The MHA has said while the country needs to be in a “lockdown”, supply and storage of essential goods, including health infrastructure and food must be allowed.

The Delhi Police order has been forwarded to all the SpecialCP’s, Joint CP’s and Addl CP’s in Delhi. They will follow the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) that was given by MHA on Thursday, the order stated.

To prevent the spread of coronavirus, people must ensure social distancing while maintaining the supply of essential goods. Under the MHA’s order, a ration shop dealing with groceries, vegetables, fruits, dairy products, meat, animal fodder, seeds and pesticides will be allowed to sell.

It is also mentioned that home delivery of food, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment is also operational.

The Delhi Police said they will follow these orders and won’t restrict the movement of essential goods.

Under the SOP, restaurants delivering food will also be allowed to re-start their services. Storage facilities like godown will also bere-opened. Since the manufacturing and transport of many of the essential goods take place in different cities, the Delhi Police will also allow inter-city and inter-state transport of all the goods.

The guidelines for the companies providing essential goods include ensuring social distancing and showing valid documents and ID proof to police.

According to the SOP, police must not shut warehouses where non-essential goods are also stored. The order states that retailers and wholesalers store both essential and non-essential goods, hence, the warehouse facilities must not be shut.

The retailers will also have to give an undertaking saying they will only deal with essential goods and will also have to allow authorities to audit their records. The employees engaged in the supply chain of the goods must have ID proof along with e-pass, given by the government.

In the case of unorganised sectors, the employees need to take permission from the Delhi government. The companies have been directed to deploy minimum staff to deliver goods, conduct health check-ups of employees and provide them with protective gear.

According to the MHA order, the State Government can also open a 24x7 control room to register complaints of employees and people facing issues with food supply.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/movement-of-essential-goods-ok-d.html

85,28-3-20,Punjab corona cases reach 38,"Punjab’s first casualty of novel coronavirus till date — 70-year-old Nawanshahr-resident Baldev Singh — has infected at least 27 of the total 38 cases (amounts to 70 percent) reported in the State. The cases included his two daughters, three sons, two daughters-in-law, seven grandchildren, his relatives and friends and further their family members.

Punjab on Friday recorded five new cases, including four who directly or indirectly carried infection from Baldev Singh. “The new cases are reported from Jalandhar, Mohali and SBS Nagar districts. All five were cases of local transmissions, having acquired the infection from already identified cases,” said Vipul Ujwal, the member of the State Control Room.

The new cases include a 27-year-old man from Jalandhar who is Baldev Singh’s relative. The three more tested positive in Hoshiarpur’s Moranwali village were also in close contacts of Baldev Singh’s earlier contact Harbhajan Singh, who had previously been tested positive. Harbhajan Singh’s wife, his daughter-in-law and his neighbour have been tested positive.

The septuagenarian Gurudwara priest had travel history of Germany and returned to India via Italy on March 7. From New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport, he, along with two others, drove to his native Pathawala village the same day. Rather than self-quarantining himself, Baldev Singh continued to mingle with people, visiting places, and even attending religious events.

Baldev Singh, a priest at local gurudwara, even participated in the Hola Mohalla festival at Sri Anandpur Sahib from March 8-10, and then returned to his village. It was only a day after his death on March 18 due to cardiac arrest, that his positive status was known.

There are reports that he met nearly 100 people before being tested COVID-19 positive. Baldev Singh and the other two men, who had travelled with him, reportedly visited 15 villages across the State — spreading infection.

Nawanshahr Deputy Commissioner Vinay Bublani said that the administration has sealed the villages from where the patients hailed in a bid to prevent the COVID-19 spread.

Another case was reported from SAS Nagar (Mohali) which is also a contact case of a positive case.

Ujwal said that all the positive cases were stable, and all their close contacts have been put under quarantine and are being monitored. Their swabs have been taken for testing.

So far, samples of 789 suspected cases have been sent for testing, of which 480 came back negative, and reports of 271 cases are awaited.

The 38 confirmed cases are so far from five districts in Punjab — maximum 19 from SBS Nagar (Nawanshahr), six cases from Mohali, five from Jalandhar and six from Hoshiarpur and one each from Amritsar and from Ludhiana. No confirmed case has been reported the other 16 districts.

In another development, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh has announced that the state’s first coronavirus patient, who had travelled to Italy, has tested negative and will be discharged later today. He was undergoing treatment at Amritsar government hospital.

“Happy to share that our first case of COVID admitted to Government Medical College Amritsar has successfully recovered and tested negative,” he tweeted, adding that “The patient will be discharged today. It's a great moment for us. I am sure we will win this War Against #Covid19”.

With total lockdown in force due to coronavirus (COVID-19), power demand is on the wane and is likely to go down further, feel experts. In the country in general, energy consumption has slowed down.

In Odisha, energy consumption on March 17 was 79.56 Million Units, which dropped to 74.67MU on March 24, said official sources.

Energy Secretary Bishnupada Sethi held a review of power demand and availability situation vis-à-vis the approaching summer. It was revealed that the State’s average demand during March is 3,300 MW which fell to 2,750 MW till March 19-20 due to stormy weather condition in some parts.

The demand increased to 2,950 MW on March 21 but was again reduced to 2,770 MW on March 22 due to the Janata Curfew. On March 24, the demand increased to 3,064 MW. But it is expected to go down from now onwards due to the lockdown.

The lockdown has resulted in closure of small industries and market complexes, leading to less power consumption.

The State Load Dispatch Centre (SLDC) is forced to back down the State thermal generation even some times reduce the hydro generation. However, the backing down depends on the quantum of power exchanged through trading by the Gridco.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/consumption-falls--state-power-surplus.html
88,28-3-20,Community transmission fear looms large in State,"With the third confirmed case of coronavirus with multiple-contact history reported in Odisha on Thursday, there is now a fear of community transmission putting a large number of lives at a greater risk in the State.

The State Government observed this on Friday after the sample test report of the Delhi-return person was confirmed positive for the deadly virus.

Government Chief Spokesperson on COVID-19 Subroto Bagchi said the State is moving towards stage-III from stage-II of COVID-19.

“With the third confirmed case, now we see possibility of moving into stage-II to III, which is called as community transmission,” he said, terming the phase as the most sensitive period when every person needs to take all kinds of care to tackle spread of the virus.

Even as the third patient has no travel history to any foreign country in a past few days, the 60-year-old man had come in contact with multiple persons in Delhi, Haryana and Bhubaneswar.

“He had reached Bhubaneswar on IndiGo flight from Delhi on March 10. He had visited a dispensary of Odisha Assembly on March 16 after he developed COVID-19-like symptoms. As he did not recover from illness, he went to Kar Clinic at Unit-4 area to consult a doctor on March 21. Next day, he was admitted to this private clinic and was in ICU for pneumonia. On March 24, he was discharged from the clinic. He was admitted to the Capital Hospital on March 25. His sample tested positive on March 26,” Bagchi said.

As the patient has a contact history with many persons during the period, all have been asked to remain in home quarantine for a period of 14 days. “The person’s daughter, wife and driver have been told to put themselves in isolation as they were in the frequent contact with him,” Bagchi said.

“The contact tracing exercise is underway to identify the persons with whom he had come in contact.

The Government on Friday asked people not to visit the Kar Clinic and directed the clinic authorities to isolate all its staffs, including doctors, who came in contact with a patient who was found to be COVID-19-positive.

Notably, there are four stages of COVID-19. Stage-I is called when the persons with foreign travel history have contracted the infection. Stage-II is the local transmission in which people report infection after coming in contact with an infected person. In stage-III, a person with no travel history to foreign countries contracts through domestic sources. Stage-IV is when the disease is declared an epidemic.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/community-transmission-fear-looms-large-in-state.html

Later Vijayan, who is head of all civil service officials, suspended Mishra from service.

Mishra, a 2016 batch IAS officer, recently came to Kollam to take up the charge of Sub Collector. He informed his superior that he had been abroad and was asked to go for self-isolation at his official residence in Kollam, about 70 km from the state capital.

Nassar told the media on Friday that Mishra in his explanation has said that when he was told to go into self-isolation, he presumed it meant going to his residence in Kanpur.

“This is a violation of protocol and I will submit the report of his act to the state government, who is authorised to take further action,” said Nassar.

94,28-3-20,Scribes filming liquor ‘deal’ bashed up by CITU workers,"nLiquor has become a hot issue in Kerala, a State known for its passion for the ‘material’. Thursday morning saw a group of head load workers (porters) ruthlessly beating up a group of journalists who shot video of the former unloading crates of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) from trucks at Kozhikode under dubious situation..

Abhilash and Mithun, reporter and videographer of Janam TV, a private TV news channel, were covering the action live following a tip off from one of the head load workers when they came under attack.

“We were told by our sources among the porters that liquor meant for distribution through Kerala State Beverages Corporation (BEVCO) was being unloaded into a building near Beach Road. There were three truck loads of liquor and there was no reason for unloading the same as all BEVCO outlets have been shut down since Wednesday morning as part of the countrywide lock down,” said Abhilash.

The porters numbering 30 surrounded the TV crew and began assaulting them for shooting the pictures of the ‘action’. “The liquor was being transported to another destination for selling in black market for a premium as the stuff would not be available for the next 21 days,” said Abhilash.

He said though the porters wore the uniform of CITU, the militant trade union wing of the CPI(M), they were activists belonging to NDF and Popular Front of India who had switched over to the Marxist camp recently. The NDF and PFI are extremist Islamic organisations having strong presence in northern Kerala.

The police have registered a case following the complaint by Abhilash and Mithun. The camera has been damaged beyond repairing, said Mithun who had taken some sprightly good shots of crates of liquor being surreptitiously unloaded from the trucks.

GK Suresh Babu, Chief Editor, Janam TV, said he whole thing smacked of mystery. “The District administration had declared Section 144 as part of the total lock down. None of the porters were wearing masks and they were violating the prohibitory order. Moreover no police officials were present at the spot which itself was a violation pf the conditions for unloading the liquor. Even BEVCO’s staff were not to be seen,” said Suresh Babu.

Though a small posse of policemen arrived at the spot and saved the crew from further attack, none of the porters who attacked the journalists have been arrested. Later, the police registered case under sections 144, 147, 323, 324, 308, and 506 (1) of the IPC against six persons.

Abhilash who came under attack is a popular figure in the State because of the reporting he did from Sabarimala in 2018 about the police brutality on the devotees.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/scribes-filming-liquor----deal----bashed-up-by-citu-workers.html

116,28-3-20,Sale and distribution of anti-malarial drug ‘hydroxychloroquine’ restricted,"Amid Coronavirus crisis, the Government has restricted sale and distribution of anti-malarial drug ‘hydroxychloroquine’ declaring it as an essential drug to treat the COVID-19 patients and meet the requirements of emergency arising due to the pandemic.

This means that any preparation containing the said drug will have a warning label of ‘only prescription sale’ and against self-medication. Additionally, chemists would need to maintain records for name and address of the prescriber, the name of the patient, the name of the drug and the quantity supplied and such records shall be maintained for three years and be open for inspection.

The move to bring hydroxychloroquine under restriction category came after it was found that people had started hoarding the drug when a few days ago, the national task force for COVID-19 constituted by Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) had recommended as a preventive medication.

The Union Ministry of Health has now issued a notification in this regard.

In the order, the Government declared that the Central Government is ""satisfied that the drug hydroxychloroquine is essential to meet the requirements of emergency arising due to pandemic COVID-19 and in the public interest, it is necessary and expedient to regulate and restrict the sale and distribution of the drug 'hydroxychloroquine' and preparation based thereon for preventing their misuse"".

""Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 26B of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 (23 of 1940), the Central government hereby directs that sale by retail of any preparation containing the drug Hydroxychloroquine shall be in accordance with the conditions for sale of drugs specified in Schedule H1 to the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945.""

As per the notification, the drug specified in Schedule H1 is labelled with the symbol Rx which shall be in red and conspicuously displayed on the left top corner of the label, and with a warning displayed in a box with a red border.

A couple of days ago, the Government had banned the export of the anti-malarial drug to ensure sufficient availability of the medicine in the domestic market.

The ICMR has recommended the use of Hydroxychloroquine for treating healthcare workers handling suspected or confirmed coronavirus cases and also the asymptomatic household contacts of the lab-confirmed cases.

The treatment protocol recommended by the ICMR-constituted National Task Force for COVID-19 has been approved by the Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) for restricted use in emergency situations.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sale-and-distribution-of-anti-malarial-drug----hydroxychloroquine----restricted.html
117,28-3-20,PwDs should get smooth access to essential support services: Centre to States,"Noting that people with disabilities (PwDs) are more vulnerable due to their conditions during the coronavirus crisis, which has restricted peoples' movement, the Government has issued guidelines to the States to ensure that the sector has a smooth access to essential support services including caregiver, supplies and medical aid at their doorstep.

The guidelines prepared by the Department of the PwDs under the Union Ministry of Social Justice and empowerment also stress on ensuring easy accessibility of the sector to their caregivers so that they do not have to suffer.

Meanwhile, following intervention of the activists in the sector and DPwDs , the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has exempted the PwDs from attending the offices during the lockdown period.

Shankutala Gamlin, Secretary of the PwDs Department, in a letter to the State Chief Secretaries also suggested the States to designate the State Commissioner for PwDs as the nodal authority for better coordination with other agencies for the welfare of the sector.

While calling for setting up of a 24X7 helpline number at State level exclusively with facilities of sign language interpretation and video calling, Gamlin pointed out that “COVID 19 is impacting the entire population, but PwDs are more vulnerable to the disease due to their physical, sensory and cognitive limitations.

“As such, there is a need to understand their disability specific requirements, daily living activities and take appropriate and timely measures to ensure their protection and safety during situations of risk. Special care should be ensured to children and women with disabilities.”

The exhaustive guideline focus on do’s and don’ts for the authorities while dealing with the PwDs.

The States have been asked to ensure all information about COVID 19, services offered and precautions to be taken should be available in simple and local language in accessible formats; i.e. in Braille and audible tapes for persons with visual impairment, video-graphic material with sub-titles and sign language interpretation for persons with hearing impairment and through accessible web sites.

Sign language interpreters who work in emergency and health settings should be given the same health and safety protection as other health care workers dealing with COVID19 besides sensitizing normal people about the needs of the PwDs, says the guidelines.

Also, during quarantine as well as during treatment, essential support services, personal assistance, and physical and communication accessibility should be ensured e.g. visually challenged persons, persons with intellectual/ mental disability (psycho-social) are dependent on care giver support.

The guidelines also focus on provisions for on-line counselling mechanism to de-stress PwDs as well as their families to cope with the quarantine period.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pwds-should-get-smooth-access-to-essential-support-services--centre-to-states.html

Addressing the people across the State live through social media, Uddhav said in the evening “We have taken some bold steps to ensure availability of essential commodities to the people. As part of the exercise, we have asked the shopkeepers vending the essential commodities to keep their establishments open for 24 hours. Soon after we took these steps, I was asked to learn that the people are travelling by trucks and tankers”

Uddhav, who has been speaking live to the people almost on a daily basis, said: “People should relaise that they face the health risk the moment they stir out of their homes. Hence, it is essential for the people to stay at home. While being at home, please do not feel that you are passing through a crisis. Please realise that the pandemic will not enter your home. Hence you please be where you are. Please do not use unauthorised means to travel”

120,28-3-20,"World has entered recession, says IMF","The world is in the face of a devastating impact due to the coronavirus pandemic and has clearly entered a recession, the International Monetary Fund said on Friday, but projected a recovery next year.

""We have reassessed the prospects for growth for 2020 and 2021. It is now clear that we have entered a recession as bad or worse than in 2009. We do project recovery in 2021,"" IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told reporters at a news conference.

Georgieva was addressing the press after a meeting of governing body of the IMF, the International Monetary and Financial Committee. Representing 189 members, the body met virtually to discuss the unprecedented challenge posed to the world by COVID-19.

The key to recovery in 2021, she said, is only if the international community succeeds in containing the virus everywhere and prevent liquidity problems from becoming a solvency issue.

""The US is in recession, as is the rest of the advanced economies of the world. And in a big chunk of developed and emerging markets in developing economies. How severe? We are working now on our projections for 2020, Georgieva said in response to a question.

The new projections are expected in the next few weeks.

Stressing that while containment is the main reason for the economy to stand still and get into a recession, she said containment is very necessary to come out of this period and step in to recovery. ""Until the virus is not contained, it would be very difficult to go to the lives we love.""

""A key concern about a long-lasting impact of the sudden stop of the world economy is the risk of a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs that not only can undermine the recovery. But can erode the fabric of our societies,"" the IMF chief said.

To avoid this from happening, many countries have taken far-reaching measures to address the health crisis and to cushion its impact on the economy, both on the monetary and on the fiscal side, she said.

The IMF chief said 81 emergency financing requests, including 50 from lower-income countries, have been received. She said current estimate for the overall financial needs of emerging markets is 2.5 trillion dollars.

""We believe this is on the lower end. We do know that their own reserves and domestic resources will not be sufficient,"" she added.

The G-20, a day earlier, reported fiscal measures totalling some 5 trillion dollars or over 6 per cent of the global GDP.

Responding to another question, Georgieva said the IMF is projecting recession for 2020.

""We do expect it to be quite deep and we are very much urging countries to step up containment measures aggressively so we can shorten the duration of this period of time when the economy is in standstill,"" she said.

""And also to apply well-targeted measures, primarily focusing on the health system to absorb that enormous stress that comes from coronavirus. And on people, businesses and the financial system, I am very pleased to say that when we went through countries' responses, that sense of targeted fiscal measures is there and are also very impressive to see the size of these measures,"" she added.

""Countries are doing all they can on the fiscal and on the monetary front. We have heard from our members' very impressive decisions taken over the last days,"" the IMF chief said.

""We also want to caution that as we are responding now, we want to make the recession as possibly short and not too deep. We also want to think about what is going to follow the recovery and make sure that we are putting forward measures that can be supportive in this regard,"" she said.

""Due to the prolonged lockdown, there could be some slight delay in completing the merger process... but transactions like cash deposits, withdrawals and money transfer will begin from April 1,"" the official told PTI.

As per the swap ratio of the merger, 115 shares of Indian Bank will be exchanged with every 1,000 shares of Allahabad Bank.

""We will vacate the head office building, hopefully after three to six months once the merger takes place. This is a rented building and we will move to our annex building across the street on India Exchange Place,"" he said.

The official said though the branches are noT operating at full strength due to the lockdown, all internal guidelines have been disemminated to the staff regarding standardisation of products, process and procedures.

122,28-3-20,Over 2k Indians stranded in SL due to lockdown,"Over 2,000 Indian nationals are among the 16,900 foreign tourists stranded in Sri Lanka due to the lockdown imposed by the government after the coronavirus outbreak, official figures released here said on Friday.

At 2,439, the Indians are the highest among the number of tourists stranded in the island nation followed by the Chinese at 2,167, data from the Sri Lanka Tourism and Development Authority said.

The data was released a day after Sri Lanka said that it will allow chartered flights from any country to land here and fly out their citizens stranded in the country on a holiday or for work purposes due to the coronavirus epidemic.

Sri Lanka shut its international airports for incoming flights since last week and the people were asked to skip foreign travel in view of the coronavirus threat.

A limited number of outbound flights do still operate. Sri Lanka has so far recorded 104 confirmed COVID-19 cases while another over 200 others are under observation.

Sri Lanka’s first known COVID-19 was a female Chinese tourist. She was cured and departed early this month.

The first Sri Lankan national to be confirmed to carry the virus was a tour guide who worked with Italian tourists. He was cured and left hospital this week. The number of COVID-19 cases across the globe has skyrocketed to 531,860 and a total of 24,057 people have died so far. At 85,653, the US now has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world, surpassing China and Italy. Nearly 1300 people have died in the US due to the disease.

123,28-3-20,Int’l tourism to plunge up to 30% due to virus: UN,"International travel will likely fall by 20-30 percent in 2020 due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, putting millions of jobs in the global tourism sector at risk, the World Tourism Organization said Friday.

This revises sharply lower a forecast made on March 6 of a decline of just 1.0-3.0 percent due to the travel restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the disease and economic fallout of the outbreak.

The drop in arrivals will lead to an estimated loss of $300-450 billion in international tourism receipts, almost one third of the $1.5 trillion generated in 2019, the Madrid-based UN body said in a statement.

The UNWTO said it had revised its forecast to take into account “the unparalleled introduction of travel restrictions across the world” but added it “should be interpreted with caution in view of the extreme uncertain nature of the current crisis.” The body had predicted at the beginning of the year that international tourism would grow by 3.0-4.0 percent in 2020.

“Tourism is among the hardest hit of all economic sectors,” the body’s secretary general, Zurab Pololikashvili, said in the statement, adding “it is clear” that millions of jobs within the sector are at risk.

The UNWTO noted that small and medium-sized businesses make up around 80 percent of the tourism sector, which “leads the way” in providing jobs for women, youths and rural communities.

By comparison international tourism arrivals declined by 4.0 percent in 2009 during the global economic crisis and by just 0.4 percent in 2003 after the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which killed 774 people worldwide, it added.

Governments around the world have restricted travel as they scramble to contain the spread of the disease which has claimed over 23,000 lives worldwide since it first emerged in China late last year. More than three billion people around the world are currently living under lockdown measures.

Major cultural events and business conferences have been called off to limit contact between people and airlines have drastically cut back the number of flights they offer.

International tourism arrivals rose by 4.0 percent in 2019 to 1.5 billion, with France the world’s most visited nation, followed by Spain and the United States.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/int---l-tourism-to-plunge-up-to-30--due-to-virus--un.html
124,28-3-20,Af Govt unveils negotiating team for Taliban talks,"After months of deliberation, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Friday announced his 21-member team to negotiate peace with the Taliban, only to have his political opponent reject it as not inclusive enough.

Afghanistan’s political turmoil has impeded each tentative step toward negotiations with the Taliban — negotiations that are supposed to come next under a peace deal that Washington signed with the insurgents last month.

The deal calls for the eventual withdrawal of all 13,000 U.S. soldiers from Afghanistan in exchange for guarantees from the Taliban to fight other militant groups, including the Islamic State group. The deal has been touted as Afghanistan’s best chance yet of ending its relentless wars.

But Ghani and his opponent, Abdullah Abdullah, have been locked in a power struggle that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo could not resolve during his emergency visit to Kabul earlier this week.

Pompeo held talks with both Ghani and Abdullah, who has also declared himself president in a parallel inauguration ceremony earlier this month, but made no headway in reconciling the two. Washington subsequently said it would cut $1 billion in assistance to Afghanistan if the two leaders couldn’t “get their act together.”

Ghani’s 21-member team is led by the Masoom Stanikzai, former head of Afghanistan’s intelligence agency, who was forced to resign last year. He quit after a CIA-trained team under his command was found to have killed four brothers they falsely accused of being Islamic State operatives.

129,28-3-20,Stock markets retreat as nervous investors pocket week’s gains,"Stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic retreated Friday as investors banked profits from the week’s equities rally sparked by massive government and central bank action to bolster an economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones index lost more than 700 points in early business, while in Europe key indices were also deeply in the red — although still set for solid weekly gains.

“European markets have pulled back... With caution being the order of the day after such a good rally,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at trading group Markets.Com. “Stimulus efforts have calmed markets” this week, Wilson said, noting however that investors were looking to take profits ahead of the weekend pause. Earlier, Asian stock markets had managed to record more gains. While the number of people contracting COVID-19 continues to escalate, the support measures which the G20 said amounted to $5 trillion, have given traders hope that the expected global recession will be sharp but short.

Even news that a record 3.3 million Americans claimed unemployment benefits last week — smashing the previous all-time high of 695,000 in 1982 — was unable to derail the more positive view.

Dan Skelly at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management said stocks, after being clobbered in recent weeks, were now showing signs of bottoming out. “While we do believe this will be possibly the sharpest recession in history, it may also be the shortest, so there is room to be optimistic for a second-half rebound,” he told Bloomberg TV. Support this week has come largely from a $2-trillion US stimulus bill that is making its way through Congress and is expected to be passed by the House of Representatives Friday before being signed off by President Donald Trump.

“For investors, this package should be good for US equities and other risk assets as it should leave US corporations in a better position to weather the economic downturn and thrive in the rebound,” said David Kelly, at JP Morgan Asset Management. On Thursday, Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell said the US central bank would continue to “aggressively” pump liquidity into the economy.

133,28-3-20,Sensex drops 131 pts,"Market benchmark BSE Sensex closed lower by 131 points or 0.44 per cent in volatile trade on Friday, cutting short its three-day winning run due to deepening growth concerns and a less-than-expected moratorium on loans announced by the RBI in its monetary policy.

Stock markets had rallied around 4 per cent in opening trade in line with firm global markets and ahead of the RBI governor’s address.

However, stocks lost steam after the policy announcement with the benchmark indices paring sharp gains. The 30-share Sensex ended 131.18 points or 0.44 per cent lower at 29,815.59. It hit a high of 31,126.03 and a low of 29,346.99 in day trade.

The broad-based NSE Nifty managed to end with gains, closing higher by 18.80 points or 0.22 per cent at 8,660.25 as energy, FMCG and select banking stocks advanced.

On a weekly basis, both the indices closed in the red, marking their sixth week of losses due to heavy selling after lockdowns in major economies to contain coronavirus spread.

“In such uncertain times, instead of fresh funds entities want to save their skin, RBI’s relaxation of only 3 months instead of 6 months for a moratorium on interest on loans and working capital has disappointed many,” Jimeet Modi, Founder and CEO, Samco Securities said.

In a bid to support the economy during the pandemic, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das unveiled a slew of measures, including its steepest interest rate cuts in more than 11 years. The repo has been cut by 75 basis points to 4.4 per cent — the lowest in at least 15 years.

Further, the Reserve Bank reduced the cash reserve ratio (CRR) for all banks by 100 basis points to 3 per cent to release Rs 1.37 lakh crore across the banking system. It also allowed banks to put on hold monthly instalment payments on all term loans for three months.

The RBI is playing every card in its pocket to prevent a crisis-like situation by giving banks the ability to lend more, but as such no direct helping hand has been given to ailing industries as of now, Modi observed.

Axis Bank, ITC, NTPC and M&M were among the top gainers. Sector-wise, BSE bankex, metal, power, IT and healthcare indices ended on a positive note while BSE telecom, auto, oil and gas, basic materials and realty indices ended in the red.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sensex-drops-131-pts-2020-03-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/sensex-drops-131-pts.html

135,28-3-20,Coronavirus found in pangolins smuggled into China: Study,"Pangolins that were smuggled into China carry coronaviruses that are closely related to the one behind the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a study which sheds more light on the origins of the deadly virus.

However, the study, published in the journal Nature, said the degree of similarity between the virus in the small anteater mammals, and the one causing the pandemic is not sufficient to suggest that the animals are the intermediate hosts behind the current outbreak.

According to the researchers, including those from The University of Hong Kong, the findings suggest that pangolins are a second mammalian host of coronaviruses.

They said the sale of pangolins in wildlife markets should be strictly prohibited to minimise the risk of future virus transmission to humans.

While evidence suggests that bats may be the reservoir for the pandemic causing virus, SARS-CoV-2, the researchers said the identity of intermediate host animals — that could have facilitated its transfer to humans — remains unknown.

A seafood market linked to early cases of the recent outbreak of respiratory disease was cleared out shortly after the outbreak began, the scientists said, impeding the search for the animal species that is the source of the coronavirus.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/coronavirus-found-in-pangolins-smuggled-into-china--study.html
136,28-3-20,"In Iran, false belief a poison fights virus kills hundreds","Standing over the still body of an intubated 5-year-old boy wearing nothing but a plastic diaper, an Iranian health care worker in a hazmat suit and mask begged the public for just one thing: Stop drinking industrial alcohol over fears about the new coronavirus.

The boy, now blind after his parents gave him toxic methanol in the mistaken belief it protects against the virus, is just one of hundreds of victims of an epidemic inside the pandemic now gripping Iran.

Iranian media report nearly 300 people have been killed and more than 1,000 sickened so far by ingesting methanol across the Islamic Republic, where drinking alcohol is banned and where those who do rely on bootleggers. An Iranian doctor helping the country's Health Ministry told The Associated Press on Friday the problem was even greater, giving a death toll of around 480 with 2,850 people sickened.

The poisonings come as fake remedies spread across social media in Iran, where people remain deeply suspicious of the government after it downplayed the crisis for days before it overwhelmed the country.

""Other countries have only one problem, which is the new coronavirus pandemic. But we are fighting on two fronts here,"" said Dr. Hossein Hassanian, an adviser to Iran's Health Ministry who gave the higher figures to the AP.

138,28-3-20,Days of glory,"Our lives are defined by the experiences and relationships we have through the years. The work of acclaimed artist, architect, sculptor and writer, Satish Gujral, who passed away on Thursday at the ripe old age of 94, was influenced by his multi-faceted passions. By Team Viva

Gujral brothers

Born in Jhelum in pre-Partition Punjab, Gujral was the brother of the late Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and was awarded India’s second-highest civilian honour, the Padma Vibhushan in 1999. The three Gujral brothers belonged to a prodigious family. Satish’s elder brother, IK Gujral, was an important voice in the Congress party and this family went onto to create their own realms in the pages of Indian history. Refugees after India’s Partition, he would often recall how they were given 200 square yards and later, how a 600 square yard plot at Nizamuddin was sold off and they bought a piece of land at Jor Bagh for an auction.

Education and Mexico

Gujral lost his hearing power at the age of eight. But his inner creativity had a resilience that was deep and resonant. He studied at JJ School of Art in Mumbai and was sent to Mexico on a scholarship in 1952. His apprenticeship with David Alfredo Siqueiros and Diego Rivera, two artists who led that country’s muralist movement became the turning point of his artistic odyssey. In an interview in 2000, he had said, “I was a leftist in those days. I wanted to paint on the walls like the Mexican muralists. But later, I realised that art shouldn’t be used as a propaganda. Everything cannot be rebellious. I was always given opportunities and was grateful for them. I decided that art must be a tool to initiate dialogue with people. I started advocating public art in my country. When I did murals on the walls of Panjab University, Chandigarh, Shastri Bhawan and Oberoi Hotel, among many others, I know I was recreating stories of experience and learning.”

His first job was of a graphic designer in Shimla. While working, he painted refugees and their pain. “After a long time, I realised that I didn’t paint Partition but I painted my own sufferings,” he had said in the same interview.

When he came back from Mexico to Delhi, he wanted to sell his works. He went to Ravi Jain’s Dhoomimal at Connaught Place. At that time, there was also Kumar Gallery (set up in 1956) and he gave a few works to Virender Kumar to begin the Kumar Gallery, which stands as one of the best in the nation today.

Among his architectural wonders is the Belgian Embassy in Delhi, which was selected by the International Forum of Architects as one of the 1,000 best built buildings in the 20th century all over the world.

Dialogue between tragedy and solidity

It was Gujral’s paintings that held their own in terms of narratives and depths of contextuality. His subjects were concerned with the dialogue between single tragic figures and buildings set down around them with all the apparent solidity of a stated fact. This dark, parched environment was part of a locked-in world, in which figures and buildings stand among the soundless fall of shadows, so that the viewer’s inspection seemed like a trespass. There was something hauntingly Indianesque but he consciously refused to exploit traditional Indian styles. Perhaps, this quality lay in the dry colour, the texture that was sunburned and gritty, that was dragged across the surface to create a uniform mat texture.

His paintings had subtleties of colour that played across their harsh surface like hints of a mirage in a dry desert. But they had an elusive quality that retreated into profundity too. Eventually, their seeming solidity dissolved into sliding planes of colour.

Gujral’s sculptures

Satish Gujral’s wooden sculptures were a blend of India’s mythology and his brilliance lay in bringing in different mythic metaphors into his sculptural language. Created out of oil on burnt wood, with leather, cowrie shells and ceramic beads on ply board, this work is an abstract representations of deities-interspersed with vermillion and gold colours. He explored the spatial elements of depth and texture through a unique technique and his multi-faceted, contemporary sensibilities.

Scorn for the Progressives

His scorn for the Progressives was well known. He challenged the view that the Progressives brought international modernism to Indian art, a view expressed in his autobiography. “The idea of the Bengal school of a modern Indian art was sound but its practitioners lacked the talent, the genuine inspiration to carry it out. The progressive art group could have given further impetus to the idea of the Bengal school, but killed it. What began in the 60s could have begun in the 40s.”

“We relate modernity to the West; what is not Western is not modern. Judging by that yardstick, our modernity is spurious. But if you judge the difference in attitudes to the past, the determination to infuse contemporary values, then I would say modernism has always existed. In the visual arts, its present source would not be the progressive art group but the Tagores,” was his observation.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/days-of-glory-2020-03-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/days-of-glory.html
139,28-3-20,‘Humanity needs to unite’,"As the global Coronavirus outbreak spelt a series of museum closures and postponed performances and concerts, India’s most-celebrated tabla maestro Ustad Zakir Hussain says that the humanity will need to come together to fight the pandemic.

“It is too early to tell what the effect of this disease will be but it is clear that humanity needs to come together and fight this. There needs to be a serious focus on hygiene like washing hands every 20 minutes, drinking warm water every few minutes, wiping all metal surfaces in the house and of course, keeping distance with other people. If and when we survive this, then we can ask the government and big corporations to help restart the support for arts,” he said when asked how we can sustain the arts in these trying times.

Hussain was part of a concert postponed due to COVID-19, along with Indian classical violinist Kala Ramnath and Carnatic musician Jayanthi Kumaresh, — “both top-shelf premier artists representing both North and South Indian music.”

Last month, Hussain had paid homage to his father and guru Ustad Allarakha on his centenary in the form of several multi-artist performances that spanned a day.

“We had a multi-layered relationship. I was his son, then his student, then his apprentice, then his colleague and finally his friend. I cherish every moment that I spent with him. He was and is the horizon I still reach for,” he said about his father.

He hopes to reinstate the concert, once a virus is contained and eradicated. “These concerts are a way for us all to connect with each other through music. When we are all cooped at home. This can be a welcome change to everyone and keep their minds diverted to something positive when all one hears is about the virus and everyone is in tenterhooks worried about their respective future,” he said.

Kala Ramnath added, “We musicians are also worried but there is no point worrying and by doing these concerts, we are trying to say that what could be possibly better than music to keep us all positive during such a time.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---humanity-needs-to-unite----2020-03-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/---humanity-needs-to-unite---.html
140,28-3-20,Connect the dots,"Stand-up comedian Naveen Richard believes that even while disconnecting with the surroundings or not knowing about what’s happening in the world, one can come up with absolutely fresh content, provided it connects with the audience. That’s exactly what he did for Relatively Relatable. By Chahak Mittal

How did you conceptualise the show, Relatively Relatable? What inspired it?

When you’re writing a show, you don’t have to really conceptualise it. There are two ways to bring it out. First, you spend a few months and write down all the jokes that come to your mind and find a scene for it. It is actually a more fun way to do it. Then, you eventually get tired of doing that, so you challenge yourself. It then starts with the scene and you explore it. I tried the first option. I just kept writing for two years about things that came into my head and then seven to eight months before the show, I started thinking about how I want to connect the dots. At that time, I had a major crisis in terms of my political beliefs and philosophies and what could get me through the crazy times. The world seemed spilt so I felt the need to talk about that part in all of us.

Observational comedy has become the most mainstream comic genre as it easily grabs the attention of people who are able to relate to what’s being said. How did you decide on your content and write your script in a way that everyday observations are visible?

What’s great about observational comedy is that it’s available to everybody. It’s the same observation yet very few people find it. Everyone knows the comic scene and strikes to have the same observation. The best observational jokes seemingly are the most obvious ones yet no one seeks it or digs it specially. To all those who say observational jokes are easy, they are not. It’s not easy to explore. I managed to do it as I was aware of it. I take the audience through seemingly familiar parts of observational jokes and then take them somewhere else. Like Neil Gaiman once said, “If your job is of a storyteller, then take the audience into a forest, guide them and tell them it’s going to be okay. And then you leave them in that forest.” I have wanted to do that with my jokes. I want to have a broader understanding of my observational jokes and then start messing around with them, with my character work and start doing funny anecdotal ones.

Are such shows and online entertainment industry working the best in the time of self-isolation?

I can see most of the comic creators trying to innovate and explore new ways to shoot themselves from home. Although there are some who choose to go long-term and maybe they are working on it and moving along. When the world gets fine later, they will look foward to making it happen. There are some who are working on churning out more frequent content — kind of a short-term deal. They keep on innovating as they are creative people and will go mad if they don’t do anything, really. A lot of stand-up comedians aren’t able to go on stage due to the situation. I am excited about what they will come up with.

Earlier, comedy was only looked at as something that’s supposed to be funny and give people a break from their monotonous schedules. Today, humour has become a tool of dissent and something that could be used to put across a strong perspective in a satirical way. What’s your take on such a change?

It’s good. But I think it has always been that way. When it comes to Kerala, humour is the greatest tool or weapon against political propaganda. Maybe it’s been the case with other states as well, it is just getting highlighted today through social media use. I think for the longest time, humour through cartoons and comics in newspapers has also been the greatest tool to represent a political ideology or opinion. Stand-up has just become another way.

How has the comedy industry evolved in India? There have been talent hunt shows around dance and music but Comicstaan was first of its kind...

It’s about time because stand-up comedy as a reality show is already a known concept internationally. And not just stand-up, reality judge-based contests have always been around. I grew up in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, watching a lot of comedy groups doing comic sketches. They have always been around. It’s just that the format of stand-up is new. Hence, the format of Comicstaan seemed to be new as well.

Mimicry artists have gone through it and showcased their comedy. It’s great because the audience loves drama but they need something that keeps them hooked on in between just like reality show dramas such as Roadies or any other. But here, Comicstaan is a drama with comedy in between. And it caters to people of all ages.

How do you keep yourself updated with the current trends because as a comedian you have to keep your content fresh and contemporary with the time?

I don’t agree you have to. Though, yes, it helps. You could speak on relevant things but there are a million things that will always be there and could be watched. I feel you can disconnect with the surroundings and still can come up with something that works. It’s possible to not know what’s going on in the world and have it influence your work. You don’t have to literally watch news 24x7 to be able to come up with the content. There is still a lot to speak about and make jokes on in comedy. It could literally be about anything you like, given it hits the audience.

141,28-3-20,No easy answers,"Actor Sandhya Mridul’s character in the series Mentalhood stands out for her bold and outspoken attitude, says Sakshi Sharma

Parenting is a daunting task for as there can be several bumps along the way. Right from being anxious about the child touching each of his/her milestone on time to wondering about their future and obsessing over doing each thing perfectly, this job has never been easy. The dilemma, between being a working mom to set a good example or a stay-at-home one who can get down on the floor and play, is endless. There are various other facets of parenting where each has a not-so-easy answer.

Actor Sandhya Mridul’s series, directed by Karishma Kohli, Mentalhood, revolves around different issues of parenting — bullying, health, child molestation and much more. It addresses difficult parenting issues while offering alternative perspectives of motherhood.

The series revolves around Karishma Kapoor (Meira Sharma), who makes her comeback and digital debut with this, as a mother of three with Sanjay Suri (Anmol Sharma) who plays her husband. The character is a former Miss Kanpur who gave up her modeling aspirations to raise her children, two planned and the third, an accident. After her husband’s transfer, she sets up home in Mumbai. The children get admission in a high-end school where Karishma meets several other mothers trying hard to ensure a good upbringing for their kids. With not many avenues open in terms of career, she starts a blog Mentalmom, penning her day-to-day learnings as a mother.

It also stars Sandhya (Anuja Joshi), also known as Ajo, Shruti Seth (Diksha Shah) as the Boho mom, Tillotama Shome (Preity Khosla) as the “Naive” Mom, Shilpa Shukla (Namrata Dalmia) and Dino Morea (Akash).

In the first episode itself one could see that while all the mothers are soft-spoken and patient, Anuja stands apart because of her bold and outspoken attitude. “Yes, Ajo is different from the other mothers and I was aware of it from the very beginning. In fact, this is one of the reasons I wanted to play her. She’s layered and has various shades — black, white and grey. She tries to make her point sometimes but at other times she’s hard to understand. That’s something that I like about her. She is such a crazy, neurotic and erratic character that I thought it would be fun and it was,” says Sandhya.

However, when the script was narrated to her she didn’t jump into it but thought and processed it for a while. As an actor who wants to do versatile and diverse roles, the fact that she hadn’t played such a character before interested her. She says, “I thought it could be an interesting role because it had a range of things — something I always look for in a character. I wanted to play Ajo with all that she’s supposed to be. There is an instance where she yells at Karishma for bringing chole bhature to the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) meet as she thinks they are unhealthy. To play somebody who goes over the top is a challenge in its self... so I was just testing if I can pull this off. Also, Ekta (Kapoor) and Karishma didn’t give me much of a choice. They were very clear that they wanted me for Ajo.”

Each episode of the series deals with a different question and scenario, for instance, the first one is on nutrition, the second on bullying, the third on gender and so on. While one might think that each level demands a different preparation, the actor denies it. For Sandhya, it is important to flow with the moment and what’s happening at that point because there’s so much fun in spontaneity. “Honestly, there was no preparation. I’ll be lying if I say I prepared for it. I am not a method actor. I always flow with the script and what the other actors are giving me. Though subconsciously there is mental preparation of the issue that you are dealing with to internalise the sensitivity involved. But that’s all,” says she.

Anuja is a bully mom. She is referred to as the uncrowned queen of the moms’ WhatsApp group and manages every small task of her children’s lives. One wonders if the actor relates with the role. “Well I relate with Anuja to the extent that I know mothers who are like her, but we have nothing in common. Not her life, lifestyle, mannerisms, most of her is not me,” says she.

Though the actor says that there is nothing in common, but her attitude does seem to match. In real life we have seen Sandhya taking strong stands. During the #MeToo movement in 2018, the actor made headlines as she accused actor Alok Nath of sexual harassment. She even supported and took a stand for other actors who were a part of the movement, too. For Sandhya, the movement is still not over. It will continue till women keep coming out for their rights and justice. “They shouldn’t be asked ‘why didn’t they come out earlier’ or pushed to come out or judged because they are coming out,” says the actor before adding, “I took a stand during the movement because it was important to address the issue. We made a huge impact which really shook the system. It’s a huge start. A message was sent out very clearly. A lot of people will now think twice before doing anything like this. I can say this because I personally know a lot of men who backed off, apologised, are wary and trying to change their ways. The men who weren’t even aware that they were doing something wrong are now aware that they need to deal with women differently.”

However, even after all this there are people who say there is nothing of this sort in India. The actor says it is like disrespecting the women who spoke up. Giving a message to the women, she adds, “Speak when you are ready. And I am always there if anybody wants to consult me. They can reach out to me. Don’t be in a hurry because people are making you feel so. You should speak only when you are ready to. We really need to take action. Not only women but even men. Merely tweeting about the incident won’t help.”

A double role in Hu Ba Hu (2002), a sister in Saathiya (2002), a strong cop in Waisa Bhi Hota Hai (WBHH) (2003), the actor has played a variety of characters but her favourite will always be Agni Sinha from WBHH. “That project, cast, experience and cinema will always be my favourite. I am glad that I did that kind of cinema. The film literally made me jobless because I fell in love with it and couldn’t find another such. And I just couldn’t even try to do commercial cinema (or rather what was called commercial cinema at that time). I kept on trying to choose work which was different. I love films with good scripts, good character sketches and clear characterisation,” says she.

Though the series acts as an essential guide for parenting, its entertainment and thrill quotient has been questioned. The internet is full of reviews which term it a preachy show. However, Sandhya remains unaffected as she doesn’t see the reviews, ever. She says, “I do the best I can with my acting playground and then just leave it. If the audience like it, great. The only reviews I probably care about would be from my family, maybe. If people feel it’s preachy, so be it. It deals with a lot of issues and there are many people who feel a show like this was important. Many people love it. So I’d rather be happy with that. However, I also feel that criticism is good. I am happy with them. Somebody told me that Ajo was over the top and I was like ‘yes she was supposed to be.’ But at the same time, it was a point noted. So that’s the way it is.”

The actor’s creative process is to constantly work on herself, connect with everything, good or bad, and staying vulnerable and fragile. “If I can do that as a human being then as an actor I’ll always be authentic. More than preparing as an actor my process is always fixing myself as a human being and expanding as much as I can. My preparation is mostly emotional, physical, mental and spiritual fitness,” adds she.

142,28-3-20,US has most confirmed coronavirus cases in world,"The US now has more coronavirus cases than any other country after more than 16,000 COVID-19 infections were reported there in a single day, taking the number of patients in America to over 85,600, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

Globally, a total of 24,057 people have died due to the novel coronavirus with Italy standing at the top with 8,215 deaths, followed by Spain (4,365) and China (3,169), the varsity figures stated.

America leads with 85,653 COVID-19 cases, followed by China with 81,782 and Italy with 80,589 infections, the data showed. According to Worldometer, the website that records confirmed cases of infection and deaths globally, the US by Thursday night had 85,088 individuals infected with coronavirus, of which 16,877 were added just in a single day. A week ago, the number of confirmed cases were 8,000. It has dangerously surged 10 times in the span of a week.

With at least 263 deaths, the US also reported most number of fatalities due to the contagion on a single day on Thursday. At least 1,290 Americans have died due to coronavirus so far, the website reported. Over 2,000 coronavirus cases were reportedly in a serious condition. The number of confirmed cases as well as the deaths due to COVID-19 are likely to increase substantially in the coming days.

In China, where the outbreak originated in December, 3,287 people have died due to coronavirus pandemic while Italy has recorded 8,215 such deaths. US President Donald Trump attributed the spike in the confirmed cases to the large-scale testing of the deadly disease.

""I think it's a tribute to our testing,"" he said, adding ""no one knows what the numbers are in China"". Vice President Mike Pence said it was important for hospitals and labs testing the samples to report back to the Centre for Disease Control and Federal Emergency Management Agency so that the Government has full visibility to provide the President with the best counsel.

The Abbott Laboratory submitted to Food and Drug Administration a national request for approval of a point-of-care test, he said, adding that this would be the kind of test where one could go to a doctor and get the test done and have the results in no more than 15 minutes.

In an in interview with the CNN, Anthony Fauci, America's top infectious disease expert said it was difficult to tell where the pandemic will go and how long it will last in the US. This is the relative percentage of asymptomatic infection — and it ""influences everything,"" he said.

It influences transmission, contact tracing, and the measures that the authorities need to take. That's why the most important thing to do now is to conduct widespread testing and collect more data, he asserted.

He called for ratcheting up the current level of contact tracing and testing. ""We've got to do it better than we are now,"" he said. According to Deborah Brix, coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, 55 per cent of all new cases continue out of the New York — New York Metro area. This includes New Jersey as well, she said, expressing concern over the coronavirus spread.

Trump spoke to Xi over telephone, days after the US president angered Beijing by referring to the coronavirus as ""Chinese virus"" and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said China's ruling Communist Party poses a ""substantial threat"" to Americans' health and their way of life.

President Xi took a phone call from President Trump, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

During the conversation, Xi stressed that since the COVID-19 outbreak began, Beijing has acted in an ""open, transparent and responsible manner and provided timely updates on the outbreak to the World Health Organization (WHO) and relevant countries including the United States"".

After their telephonic talk, Trump tweeted, ""Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China. Discussed in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet.

""China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!""

144,28-3-20,"As virus toll mounts in NY, more hospitals sought","President Donald Trump and elected leaders in New York are clashing again over the depth of the state's coronavirus crisis. Meanwhile, the outbreak is taking its toll on the state's civil servants, with the virus claiming the lives of bus and train workers and a civilian employee of the New York Police Department.

There are more than 6,000 hospitalised COVID-19 patients in New York, with almost 1,600 in intensive care. New York has logged a nation-high of 519 deaths, and has more than 44,000 confirmed cases.

Here are the latest coronavirus developments in New York:

MORE HOSPITALS SOUGHT

Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state wants to build four more temporary hospitals in New York City within weeks, before coronavirus cases are projected to peak. The state is seeking authorization from the Trump administration to add 4,000 beds in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. The hospitals would be constructed at a horse track, a city college, an expo centre and a cruise ship terminal.

The requested conversions are part of the state's broader effort to quickly increase New York's hospital capacity from 53,000 beds to up to 140,000 beds. The federal government is already constructing a hospital at a Manhattan convention center and a Navy hospital ship is due to arrive Monday in New York City, a global hotspot of the outbreak. ""Were looking far and wide, very creative, aggressive and finding all the space that we can possibly find,"" Cuomo said.

PUBLIC SERVANTS FELLED BY VIRUS

The coronavirus outbreak is taking its toll on New York City's civil servants. Two people who helped keep New York moving during the crisis, bus operator Oliver Cyrus, 61, and train conductor Peter Petrassi, 49, were killed by the virus Thursday, according to their union.

Transport Workers Union Local 100 President Tony Utano called the two deaths in one day ""a terrible and incredibly sad loss."" He called transit workers ""true heroes"" for continuing to work during the pandemic and he demanded the Metropolitan Transportation Authority provide transportation workers with protective masks.

""Dedication and duty does not mean using transit workers as cannon fodder,"" Utano said. Fifty-year-old letter carrier Rakkhon Kim died Wednesday from COVID-19-related complications, according to the National Association of Letter Carriers. Kim had delivered mail for 23 years. He worked in the Bronx and lived in Northvale, New Jersey, according to the union.

The New York Police Department announced its first coronavirus death on Thursday. Dennis Dickson, a department janitor, died from complications of the disease, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said. Dickson worked for the department since 2006 and spent 17 straight days cleaning up police headquarters after Superstorm Sandy in 2012.

The department, even as it has been tasked with helping police New York's social distancing rules, also continues to see a spike in absences. On Thursday, 3,674 officers called in sick, accounting for about 10% of the force. As of Thursday, 351 NYPD personnel had tested positive for the virus.

149,28-3-20,People get offended too quickly: Honey,"Pop star-composer Yo Yo Honey Singh says staying away from the industry for two to three years never made him nervous about losing it. Asked about the fear of someone taking their place, he said, “I don’t want to outdo anyone’s thought but staying away from the industry for two-three years never made me nervous or fear of losing it. The time, I was away from 2017 till now, I composed 60 songs.”

“And I never felt out of the scene because people were still grooving to my songs and loving my work. I am in the hearts and DNA of my audience, and no one changes that,” he added.

The singer has been vocal about his struggles with bipolar disorder and alcoholism. “I never let negativity reach me or any other aspect of my life, may it be songs, personal life or health. Talking about my health was a way of keeping my larger family and fans informed on my phase of life. I have written songs on my experience; they are more serious and philosophical. I will release the songs to tell my story to people,” he said.

Talking about his journey as a person, the singer said, “Early years of my career, I stretched and exerted myself extensively and I knew it would eventually affect my health. I have changed myself and my routine completely. Akshay (Kumar) sir is a huge inspiration for me. I wake up early, I give myself time to do my tasks and not rush myself into it.”

Recollecting his experience touring with Shah Rukh Khan in Australia, he said, “We went on an Australia tour with Shah Rukh Khan and there were protests against me performing, saying that I promote alcohol. Shah Rukh sir stepped in and said that if I don’t come, then this tour won’t happen at all. After the show, we were partying in my room and that’s when I wrote the song Chaar bottle vodka. We made Shah Rukh listen to the track and he asked what kind of song is this and we said, ‘this is about the four bottles of vodka that we finished last night’.”

The Loca hitmaker feels people now get offended easily. “I think people nowadays get offended too quickly. As much I support the freedom of expression, I still think that you get judged on every single thing. In the past, we had songs like Mehbooba mehbooba, Choli ke peeche kya hai, Chumma chumma and more, but they never got discussed of being morally correct or not. As an artist, it becomes difficult to please the audience at large and be creative at the same time.”

The singer shared his thoughts in an episode of By Invite Only, which airs on zoOm. The singer isn’t against the current remix trend, and said, “I think everyone is original. Even though they are making remix, they are all original.”

In a fun quickie session, Honey Singh said, “If I would be single, would take Alia Bhatt on a date with me.” When quizzed about one Bollywood actor who is overrated, Honey gave a witty response, “Himesh Reshammiya.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/people-get-offended-too-quickly--honey-2020-03-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/people-get-offended-too-quickly--honey.html
150,28-3-20,Barca cut wages of players,"Barcelona have become the first Spanish football club to officially announce a pay cut for players and club staff as the country grapples with the coronavirus pandemic.

Sports in Spain has come to a standstill and Barcelona had to make the move so as to pay their support staff. “Faced with this scenario, the Board of Directors has decided to implement a series of measures to mitigate its effects and reduce the economic effects of this crisis,” said the club in its statement.

“Among the measures adopted, it’s worth noting those related to the workplace are motivated by the need to adapt the contractual obligations of the club staff to the new and temporary circumstances that we are experiencing.”

The club added the measures include “a reduction of the working day, imposed by the circumstances and the protection measures carried out, and, as a consequence, the proportional reduction of the remuneration provided for in the respective contracts.”

The measure should lower the club’s wage bill by around 25 percent at a moment when it is not receiving any income through gate receipts.

Barca also explained it would make all of its facilities available for use by the regional health ministry to help the struggle against the coronavirus.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/barca-cut-wages-of-players.html
151,28-3-20,Italy’s sports minister ‘doubtful’ of early May return for Serie A,"Italy’s sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora on Thursday said he was “very, very doubtful” that Serie A action would return as hoped in early May.

Both Spadafora and Italian football federation chief Gabriele Gravina had last week expressed their hope that the championship could resume on the weekend of May 2.

“The forecasts that made us think we could resume sports competitions in late April or early May I think are a bit too optimistic,” Spadafora told Italian television station Rai 3. “I am very, very doubtful. I can certainly say that if there are conditions to resume competitions in certain circumstances, it will certainly take place behind closed doors.

“To date, it is unthinkable to say that in May it is possible to resume all competitions regularly, especially with spectators.

“Even scientists have no certainty about the evolution of the epidemic. We have to adapt our decisions to changing situations.”

All sport in Italy has been suspended until April 3. “The final decision will be up to the FIGC (the Italian football federation),” the sports minister added.

“They could decide to postpone games until the late summer, but the situation is complicated, football has taken a little longer than others to understand the crisis.”

He added: “We want to be ready to start as soon as it will be possible.

152,28-3-20,Liverpool spirits high despite lockdown: Klopp,"Jurgen Klopp says the mood at Liverpool is upbeat despite the coronavirus lockdown, even admitting he has tried to copy Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s dance moves to keep himself occupied.

The Premier League leaders were on the verge of their first top-flight title for 30 years when English football was suspended earlier this month.

The virus shutdown has since been extended until at least April 30 but Liverpool do not know when, or if, they will get a chance to complete the job.

Klopp said his players’ spirits remained high despite the frustrations of having no football to play and praised the efforts of his backroom staff who are looking after the players’ fitness.

“We spoke a couple of times, we have a really intense, big, big group chat — the whole of Melwood (training ground) are in that,” he said, speaking to the club’s website by videolink from his home.

“The boys are really lively in that, the boys are just interested in what everybody is doing, comments on what everybody is doing — if Ox is on Instagram or whatever.”

Midfielder Oxlade-Chamberlain and his girlfriend, Little Mix singer Perrie Edwards, performed a dance routine, which she posted on social media.

Teammate James Milner played up to his “boring James Milner” tag by posting a video of himself cutting his grass with a ruler and scissors.

“I didn’t cut the grass but I tried the dance of Ox,” said Klopp. “Not as bad as you probably think. It’s very important in these times that we all show we take this situation seriously, but we are human beings.”

Klopp praised the efforts of Liverpool and other clubs in helping support more vulnerable members of the community during the current crisis.

And he urged people to abide by the lockdown.

“The only way to get football back as soon as possible, if that’s what the people want, the more disciplined we are now the earlier we will get, piece by piece by piece, our life back,” Klopp said. “That’s how it is.”

“At one point we will play football again as well, 100 percent,” he added. “I couldn’t wish more for it because of a few really good reasons, how you can imagine. I can’t wait actually, but even I have to be disciplined and I try to be as much as I can.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/liverpool-spirits-high-despite-lockdown--klopp.html

“It probably means the start of next season will be delayed, we will probably have to scrap one of the cup competitions and do without a winter break, but it can be done.

154,28-3-20,‘Dhoni will get chance in T20 WC’,"MS Dhoni’s much-anticipated comeback with the IPL may not happen anytime soon in light of the fast-spreading COVID-19 pandemic but his childhood coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee remains hopeful that the ageing cricketing hero will find a place in India’s T20 World Cup.

The lucrative T20 tournament’s 2020 edition, which had already been postponed to April 15, is on the verge of cancellation with the country in a 21-day national lockdown.

Dhoni has been out of action since India’s semifinal exit in the World Cup in July last year.

“In the current scenario, IPL looks unlikely and we will have to wait for BCCI’s call. His (Dhoni’s) position will become tough obviously. But my sixth sense says he will get a chance in the T20 World Cup, which will be his last,” Banerjee said.

The Chennai Super Kings captain trained in Ranchi in the lead up to IPL 2020 and also led their training camp in Chennai before the league was postponed.

“I spoke to him last after he returned from Chennai and I’m in constant touch with his parents. He’s doing his fitness training and is fully fit.

“Now let’s wait for the BCCI’s decision. There’s no tournament. ICC tournaments are off till June. So we will have to wait and see.”

Head coach Ravi Shastri had earlier said the IPL would decide the fate of Dhoni, who will turn 39 in July.

But with IPL about to get shelved this year, the Indian greats including that of Sunil Gavaskar and Virender Sehwag, had raised a question mark on the return of the 2011 World Cup winning skipper.

“True that he has not played a tournament (since July 2019) but for someone with 538 International matches, I don’t think it would take much time to adjust.”

“It would have been a different scenario for a beginner. But it’s not the case with Dhoni he has got a wealth of experience. I think he will get a last chance,” maintained Banerjee.

“He is fully fit and trained in Chennai for a week or so. Now everything is closed in Ranchi, earlier he would train at the JSCA. But now he’s confined at home and making use of the facilities at home. He has a gym, a badminton court, and a running corridor.”

“I’m sure BCCI (presient, selectors, captain) are aware of the scenario. They will make the announcement when it’s the right time,” Banerjee added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---dhoni-will-get-chance-in-t20-wc----2020-03-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---dhoni-will-get-chance-in-t20-wc---.html
155,28-3-20,Indian shot putter Navin Chikara suspended for four years for flunking dope test,"The integrity unit of the global athletics body has suspended Indian shot putter Navin Chikara for four years for failing an out-of-competition dope test in 2018.

Chikara, 23, has been banned for using a prohibited substance and his suspension period is effective from July 27, 2018, the Athletics Integrity Unit of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) said on Friday.

""On 27 July 2018, the Athlete was subject to out-of-competition Testing pursuant to the Testing Authority of the National Anti-Doping Agency of India in Patiala,"" the AIU said in a statement.

""On 28 October 2018, the World Anti-Doping Agency accredited laboratory in Montreal, Canada, reported an Adverse Analytical Finding for the presence of GHRP-6 in the Sample.""

Chikara had won a silver at the 2018 Federation Cup apart from finishing runner-up at the inter-state championships in the same year.

In November 2018, a provisional suspension was imposed on Chikara, who later waived his right to have the B sample analysed.

In December 2018, ""the athlete informed the AIU that he accepted the AAF and that he had been unaware that GHRP-6 was a Prohibited Substance .""

156,28-3-20,"Ongoing break a 'welcome rest' for India players, feels coach Shastri","Sport coming to a standstill owing to the COVID-19 pandemic is a ""welcome rest"" for India cricketers, feels head coach Ravi Shastri, who has spent barely 10-11 days at home since leaving for the World Cup last May.

As with other sports across the world, cricket has also been affected with all international and domestic fixtures being called off due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.

""(This rest) cannot be a bad thing because towards the end of the New Zealand tour, you could see some cracks coming up when it came to mental fatigue, physical fitness and injuries,"" Shastri said.

He was speaking to former England captains Michael Atherton and Nasser Hussain and Rob Key on a Sky Sports podcast.

According to Shastri, the players may use the time to re-energise themselves, especially after a gruelling New Zealand tour where India played five T20Is, three ODIs and two Tests.

""The amount of cricket we have played over the last ten months, that was beginning to take its toll. Guys like me, and some other guys from the support staff, we left India on May 23 for the World Cup in England. Since then we have been at home for 10 or 11 days.

""There are certain players who played all three formats, so you can imagine the toll it has taken on them, especially being on the field, adjusting from T20s to Test match cricket and all the travel that goes with that because we travelled quite a lot,"" Shastri said.

After the World Cup, the Indian team travelled to the West Indies, then played a long home series against South Africa that was followed by a full tour of New Zealand.

""So it has been tough but a welcome rest for players,"" the coach said.

India is currently in a 21-day lockdown and according to Shastri, his players knew something like this was imminent when the series against South Africa, right after the New Zealand tour, was called off.

""It came as a shock but to be honest, having been on the road during the South Africa series, we guys anticipated it,"" he said.

""We knew something was on the cards as the disease had just started spreading. When the second ODI was called off, we knew something was gonna happen and a lockdown was imminent.""

The disease, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei province, has so far claimed over 27,000 lives across the world.

""I think the players knew it was coming, they sensed it in New Zealand. There were apprehensions towards the end of that tour, when flights were coming through Singapore, out of Singapore.""

""By the time we landed (in India), I thought we got out at just the right time. There were only two cases in New Zealand at that time, that has rocketed now to 300.

""The day we landed, that was the first day they were screening and testing people at the airport. So (we came back) just in the nick of time.""

Shastri said that in such a situation, players could play a role by spreading awareness about this pandemic.

""As players, you have a lot of responsibility. That's why the message is very clear that cricket should be last on everyone's mind now,"" he said.

""I think the most important thing is safety and not ensuring just your safety but ensuring safety of others as well, by creating a kind of awareness that tells people there is something serious around.

""Virat has done it, a lot of other players have done it by posting certain messages on social media. They knew that it's something very serious and there could be a hold up in cricket for some time.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ongoing-break-a--welcome-rest--for-india-players--feels-coach-shastri-2020-03-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ongoing-break-a--welcome-rest--for-india-players--feels-coach-shastri.html
157,28-3-20,Make it big,"Singer Luke Bryan says that in the 18th edition of American Idol, the participants would be able to add a new element each time they perform. By Team Viva

How does it feel to return for the third series of American Idol?

I truly enjoy everything about this show. We really care about the contestants and strive to advise them the best way we know how. We are artists too, so we understand the load of everything they are dealing with — from performing, stage presence to song selection. When I joined the panel, two years ago, it was a completely new territory for me. I loved American Idol in its early years and I still do it. And when I walked on the sets of the 18th edition of the show as a judge, I realised it's big time.

What is the best part of being a judge?

I would say I've been an honest judge throughout all three seasons. The best part is to see kids and get inspired by watching them perform. It is so good when I get to see such talented people go far.

How do you break the news to someone who is super quirky or they have no talent?

Quirky is great. We have to say some things that are hard to hear sometimes but it doesn't have to be presented harshly.

Can you tell us about the dynamics between you, Lionel Richie and Katy Perry?

We have come to know each other very well after three seasons. The shooting days are very long and hectic. I think our comraderie comes across on the show. I'm having a blast with them and respect what they bring to the show. It's great to work with them. We get to have fun with one another and watch these kids, who are just remarkable as they sing. It's actually fun to give them advice and critique them together. I wish we could spend more time helping them.

Each season has some tweaks, what are we going to get from this season of American Idol?

Well, the important thing is that we are seeing a lot of talent in children. However, explaining them as to why and how they haven't put the final pieces of the puzzle together, are the trickiest.

To watch dreams come true in front of your very own eyes is quite inspiring. Music is an inspiration in itself. Some of the songs can be very challenging, obscure but most of the time the contestants pick up the right one for them. With each little performance, they become bigger stars and with each week, they're able to reinvent themselves a little bit more. They will be able to even add a different element each time they perform and pull off new surprises for us. That really sets this season apart.

“Before this crisis started to unravel, we were absolutely determined for our guys to play the IPL,” Langer was quoted as saying by foxsports.Co.Au.

“Because with the T20 World Cup coming up, there’s no better grounding, no better practice, no better tournament for them to get ready for that,” he added.

Australia’s Pat Cummins, David Warner, Aaron Finch, Steve Smith were to headline the IPL.

Langer, who is also a member of the national selection panel, insists he is not stressed about picking players as Australia have a well settled side.

The Aaron Finch-led side defeated South Africa 2-1 in three-match T20 series in February.

“In terms of selection, I’m not too stressed about it ... One or two positions in our World Cup side are up for grabs. It’s a very, very settled team. We played great cricket against South Africa,” he added.

Australia are scheduled to start their T20 World Cup campaign against Pakistan on October 24 in Sydney.

159,28-3-20,Anderson still ambitious to play for England,"England bowler James Anderson is determined that the coronavirus will not end his illustrious career as he focuses on keeping fit by taking part in “virtual” training sessions with his teammates.

Anderson, 37, whose 584 Test wickets are the most taken by any paceman in the history of the game, is nearing the end of his playing days.

But the Lancashire veteran says despite having no cricket to play until the end of May at the earliest, the idea of not bowling professionally again has not crossed his mind.

“I’ve not actually thought about never playing cricket again,” he said during a conference call on Thursday. “I feel like we will play again and I will play again at some stage.

“I’m still hungry to play, I’ve still got ambitions to play for England.

“So I think the fact I’ve been able to do this for a long time and I get to play a sport as a job means when I do get to do that again, I’m really going to cherish it and enjoy every single moment of it.”

With Britain under a coronavirus lockdown, Anderson is keeping fit by working out on-line with teammates including fellow pacemen Stuart Broad and Mark Wood.

“A few of the lads are training together virtually,” he said. “I did a workout with Stuart Broad and Mark Wood yesterday.

“We’ve all got Pelotons — the bikes. You can compete against each other. Stuart came out on top this time, with me a close second and Mark Wood in third.”

Anderson made the most recent of his 151 Test appearances against South Africa in Cape Town in January before a broken rib ended his tour prematurely.

That followed an Ashes campaign last year in which he bowled just four overs because of a calf problem.

Although he has long been a red-ball specialist, Anderson said he would be prepared to play white-ball cricket again, even in the new Hundred competition.

Anderson has an ambassadorial role with the Manchester Originals, one of the franchises, but no contract.

“I want to be playing cricket and if that is the only cricket going on, if it’s the Hundred or the T20 Blast, I’d love to be involved in that,” he said.

“If there wasn’t any red-ball cricket this summer, it would be a long, long time for me to be ticking over in the nets.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/anderson-still-ambitious-to-play-for-england.html

161,28-3-20,Athletes qualified for Tokyo 2020 will keep 2021 spots,"Athletes who had already qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics before they were postponed will keep their places when the showpiece takes place in 2021, sources said on Thursday.

Around 57% of the 11,000 scheduled participants for Tokyo had already made sure of taking part when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) pushed the Games back to 2021 due to the coronavirus on Tuesday.

The IOC and 32 international sports federations held a teleconference on Thursday where it was decided to respect the qualification process.

“Thomas Bach (the IOC President) first explained the reasons for the postponement of the Games, then said that the athletes qualified for Tokyo 2020 would automatically be qualified for 2021,” one of the participants in the conference said.

“One of the main subjects was to know when and how to organise the qualifications.

“In some federations, many sportsmen and sportswomen are not qualified and it takes at least three months for the Olympic Games to organise them.”

The 2020 Tokyo Games were scheduled for July 24-August 9, but after telephone discussions between Bach and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a historic joint decision was taken for the first postponement of an Olympics in peacetime.

However, there is no definite date yet for the rescheduled Games with Bach saying Tuesday the Tokyo Olympics “must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community”.

Many Olympic sports, such as boxing, saw the vast majority of their qualifying tournaments either interrupted or cancelled due to the global health situation.

Others, such as sailing however, already had 90% of their competitors qualified.

“The allocated quotas remain allocated,” confirmed another participant in Thursday’s meeting.

“Thomas Bach has confirmed that a decision (on a new date for the 2021 event) will be made within the next four weeks,” he said.

“Some said they prefer May 2021, others June ...”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/athletes-qualified-for-tokyo-2020-will-keep-2021-spots-athletes-qualified-for-tokyo-2020-will-keep-2021-spots.html
162,28-3-20,ICC planning for World T20 to go ahead,"The all-powerful ICC Board on Friday discussed various contingency plans for its flagship tournaments, including World T20 and World Test Championship in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic that has brought cricket to a standstill.

BCCI president Sourav Ganguly was India’s representative when it was being speculated that a former Board president would attend the meeting, held via video conference.

The sporting world has been under complete lockdown and several bilateral Test series under World Test Championship also run the risk of being cancelled.

“The impact of the pandemic on the sport globally was discussed,” an ICC release stated.

ICC Chief Executive Manu Sawhney said, “We continue to undertake a comprehensive business continuity and contingency planning exercise which will allow us to adapt to the rapidly evolving world in which we find ourselves.”

While no decisions were taken as any shifting of tournament or change of dates involves gigantic logistical exercise which needs meticulous planning at every stage.

“The ICC management will continue our contingency planning around ICC events and will also work with Members to explore all options available to us based on a range of scenarios connected to the pandemic.”

When a Board member was asked what happens if England, which is due to host Pakistan and West Indies at home is unable to do so, he said the matter of points allocation will be referred to the technical committee.

“It can’t happen unless an amicable solution is reached. You might have India playing six series and perched at top and England get to play three due to lockdown and tight FTP schedule. You need a solution to distribution of points and matter should be referred to the technical committee,” a representative of a member said.

A couple of Board members felt that World T20 in Australia is not under threat as October is still some time away.

“If things are under control from June, we can then work on a specific contingency plan. Right now, ICC would be working on various plans and would come up with their proposals in course of time,” the senior official said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/icc-planning-for-world-t20-to-go-ahead.html
163,28-3-20,BWF fire back at ‘disappointing’ virus criticism,"Badminton World Federation said it is “disappointing” that some players, including Indian star Saina Nehwal, questioned its “sincerity and motives” when it continued with the All England Championships despite the rapidly-growing threat of COVID-19 pandemic.

BWF’s decision to conduct the Super 1000 tournament in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak came for sharp criticism from the top shuttlers of the world, including Nehwal, who had accused the sport’s administrators of placing money above players’ safety.

In an open letter, BWF secretary general Thomas Lund said the decision to go ahead with the All England Championships was based on the best advice at that time.

“It has been very disappointing to see some members of the badminton community speculate on the sincerity and motives of the BWF in this time of crisis,” Lund wrote.

“Our number one concern has always been the health and safety of all of our participants.

“However, at the same time, we are deeply concerned about the cancellation of tournaments and the flow-on effect this has on elite players and coaches whereby they could now be in a position of temporary unemployment and loss of income.”

The coronavirus outbreak saw the postponement and cancellation of several high-profile sports events across the world.

While BWF too had postponed a few tournaments, it went ahead with the All England Championship as planned, despite growing cases of the rapidly spreading disease.

Top players had slammed BWF for taking the deadly disease “too lightly” and putting their lives at “risk” by going ahead with the tournament two weeks ago.

India’s chief coach Pullela Gopichand had termed it a “wrong decision”, former world number 8, H S Prannoy called it “stupid”.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bwf-fire-back-at----disappointing----virus-criticism.html
164,28-3-20,"Kohli is 'boss' of Indian cricket, support staff there to take burden off him: Shastri","Head coach Ravi Shastri has called Virat Kohli the ""boss"" of Indian cricket and said the support staff is there to ""take the burden off"" the skipper.

Batting mastero Kohli has been at the heart of India's world-record 12 Test victories in a row on home soil.

""The captain is the boss, I always believe that. The job of the coaching staff, as far as I'm concerned, is to prepare the guys in the best possible way to be able to go out there and play brave, positive, fearless cricket,"" Shastri said.

Shastri was speaking to former England captains Nasser Hussain and Michael Atherton and Rob Key during a Sky Cricket Podcast.

""The captain leads from the front. Yes, we are there to take off the burden but you leave him to do his job in the middle. The captain sets the tone and is encouraged to set the tone. In the middle, he controls the show.""

Shastri, who took over as the head coach in 2017, largely attributed India's march to top of the ICC Test rankings to Kohli.

He also spoke about how Kohli's relentless focus on fitness rubbed on to his teammates.

""When you talk about fitness, the leadership came from the top and that is Virat. He is not a guy to mess around.

""He woke up one morning and said if 'I want to play this game I want to be the fittest player in the world and compete against the best in all conditions' and he let his body go through one hell of a lot.""

In recent years, Kohli is one of the very few regulars of the team to have played almost non-stop, across formats.

""It was not just the training but the sacrifices he made with his diet. I could see that change happening all the time. He got up one day and said 'Ravi, I'm vegetarian!'

""When he sets those standards, it rubs off on others. Test cricket for us is the biggest form. It's the benchmark. We want to set standards,"" Shastri said.

165,28-3-20,"With 13 staffers, their families infected, Noida firm booked for hiding info on foreign auditor","An FIR was registered against a private company whose staffers, including a foreigner who visited the firm recently, are suspected to have infected 13 people with coronavirus in Noida and Greater Noida, officials said on Saturday.

The FIR has been registered under the Uttar Pradesh Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, on the basic of a complaint by Gautam Buddh Nagar Chief Medical Officer Aurag Bhargava, the officials said.

As on Saturday evening, Gautam Buddh Nagar has recorded 26 coronavirus positive cases, including 13 people whose contact of infection could be traced to the Cease Fire company, the Health Department said in a statement.

The managing director of the company had gone to the UK and returned from there on March 1. On March 7, a staffer of the company had returned from the UK. “A foreign national had carried out the audit of the company on March 14, 15 and 16, but the company did not inform about it to the health department. Thirteen people of this company, including their family members, have got infected with coronavirus,” Bhargava said.

Phone calls and live chat available on the company's website yielded no response when contacted by PTI for reaction.

“Of all the cases recorded in Gautam Buddh Nagar so far, we have seen that there is no person whose source of infection is not identified,” the chief medical officer said.

He said it is clear how social distancing and hand sanitation could be preventive against the novel coronavirus and had this company been cautious about these measures then such a situation could have been averted.

“I appeal to the people that if anyone of you has returned from foreign or knows about anyone coming from abroad, please inform the health department and ensure such a person practices home quarantine without fail,” Bhargava added.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/with-13-staffers--their-families-infected--noida-firm-booked-for-hiding-info-on-foreign-auditor-2020-03-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/with-13-staffers--their-families-infected--noida-firm-booked-for-hiding-info-on-foreign-auditor.html

167,28-3-20,"RBI halts EMIs, cuts rates","75 basis point interest rate cut is the steepest in 11 years

The RBI on Friday cut interest rate by 75 basis points and also provided a big relief to the middle class by permitting the banks to allow a three-month moratorium on payment of installments of all term loans outstanding as on March 1, 2020.

During the moratorium period, the borrower will not be not required to make any repayment to the banks. The RBI decision will bring big reliefs to millions of borrowers who are facing tough time from income erosion due to the lockdown.

The 75 basis point interest rate cut by the RBI is the steepest in more than 11 years as it joined the Government effort to rescue a slowing economy that has now got caught in coronavirus whirlwind.

Announcing the measures, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das predicted a big global recession and said India will not be immune. Global slowdown could make things difficult for India too, despite some help from falling crude prices, Das said, adding food prices may soften even further on record crop production. Aggregate demand may weaken and ease core inflation further, he noted.

The RBI cut repo to 4.4 per cent, the lowest in at least 15 years. Also, it reduced the cash reserve ratio maintained by the banks for the first time in over seven years. CRR for all banks was cut by 100 basis points to release Rs 1.37 lakh crore across banking system. The reverse repo rate was cut by 90 bps to 4 per cent, creating an asymmetrical corridor.

The twin measure which follow the Rs 1.7 lakh crore relief package announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday, are expected to provide relief both the weaker section of the society as well as the middle class. The Government may now come up with another set of measures to help the corporate India fight the slowdown triggered by the countrywide lockdown.

On moratorium decision, the Central bank said it will not result in asset classification downgrade and will have no adverse impact on the credit history of the borrowers.

The decision will cover all regional, rural banks, co-operative banks, NBFCs, including Housing Finance Companies, but the banks will have the final say in extending the benefit to customers.

The liquidity measures announced include auction of targetted long-term repo operation of 3-year tenure for total amount of Rs 1 lakh crore at floating rate and accommodation under Marginal Standing Facility to be increased from 2 per cent to 3 per cent of Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) with immediate effect till June 30.

Combined, these three measures will make available a total Rs 3,74,000 crore to the country’s financial system.

After cutting policy rates five times in 2019, the RBI had been on a pause since December in view of high inflation.

While the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the RBI originally was slated to meet in the first week of April, it was advanced by a week to meet the challenge of coronavirus.

In a tweet, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman welcomed the RBI Governor’s decision saying that the macroeconomic fundamentals of the Indian economy are sound, and in fact stronger than what they were in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008-09.

“Appreciate @RBI @DasShaktikanta’s reassuring words on financial stability,” she said.

The three-month moratorium on payments of term loan installments (EMI) and interest on working capital give much-desired relief, she added.

“...Slashed interest rate needs quick transmission,” the Finance Minister said in another tweet.

Meanwhile, welcoming the RBI’s decision to provide three months moratorium on payment of term loans, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said that amid this hour of need, the “move has provided a much needed relief to people and businesses”.

Besides other measures to help the economy facing lockdown, the RBI announced steps to release primary liquidity of Rs 1,37,000 crore in the banking system and reduced cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 100 basis points with effect from March 28 for one year.

It can be noted that a few States like Maharashtra had urged all the departments to pull out money from private sector banks despite previous communication from the RBI not to do so.

169,28-3-20,Help migrants to prevent exodus: Centre to States,"Amid heartrending stories of migrant workers trudging hundreds of kms to return home carrying sackful of goodies on their heads and facing assault from the police, the Centre has asked States to help stranded workers.

The Ministry of Home Affairs also issued advisory to States and UTs to prevent mass exodus of migrant and agri labourers, industrial workers and unorganised sector workers. The Centre’s directive came on a day 300 migrants were found crammed in two trucks .

Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Government has come to the rescue of a 28-year old Mumbai resident by issuing him a special pass to drive close to 2,300 km, cutting across three States, and reach Kolkata to attend his father’s last rites.

Home Minister Amit Shah has spoken to some of the Chief Ministers and asked them to look into the issue of mass exodus of migrant workers from different parts of the country after the announcement of 21-day lockdown. Home Secretary AK Bhalla has also issued an advisory asking States and UTs to take immediate steps to provide adequate support, including food and shelter, to migrant agricultural labourers, industrial workers and other unorganised sector workers during the nationwide coronavirus lockdown.

In an advisory to all States and Union territories, the MHA suggests that in order to mitigate the situation for unorganised sector workers, particularly stranded migrant workers, States/UTs need to explore measures by involving various agencies, including NGOs, to provide food and shelter with basic amenities like clean drinking water and sanitation.

The Ministry has also advised the States and UTs to ensure that hotels, rented accommodations, hostels etc., continue to remain functional and delivery of essential items is streamlined, so that students, working women hostel inmates etc, are allowed to continue in existing facilities observing precautions.

It has also asked States and UTs to make arrangements for uninterrupted supply of essential commodities to hotels, working women hostels so that they continue to live in existing facilities. The States and UTs have also been advised to make these vulnerable groups aware of measures taken by the Government, including provision of free foodgrains and other essential items through PDS, and streamline the distribution system. The coronavirus-enforced lockdown has triggered a mass exodus of migrant workers across the country.

The mass exodus of migrant labourers, workers, domestic help and other unorganised sector workers with their families from different cities continued on the third day. Unable to find transport, hundreds of people, especially daily wage workers and their families, have been seen walking for days with little food and water to reach their villages from the cities. Incidents of police lathicharge on them have been reported from Uttar Pradesh.

Thousands of migrant labourers were seen crossing the Delhi-Ghazipur border on Friday.

In Maharashtra, the authorities have issued a special pass and arranged a vehicle to a person identified as Anindya Roy to attend the last rites of his father. His father Ashish Kumar Roy, 61, died of cardiac arrest early on Thursday. Left with no options due to lockdown, Anindya narrated his ordeal on social media and urged people to help him reach his hometown by road. Roy also called up his family in Kolkata and asked them to send across his father’s death certificate over email as well as WhatsApp. He forwarded the documents to Maharashtra Transport Commissioner Shekhar Channe and narrated his problem. Within minutes, Channe issued a special pass enabling Roy to travel through Maharashtra.

The similar case has happened in Delhi where officials of Bihar Bhawan in Delhi also issued a special travel pass and arranged vehicle to a person to attend his mother’s last rites in Madhubani, in Bihar. Several persons have approached to the Telangana Government through social media seeking special passes or ‘no objection certificate’ to attend final rites of their relatives. A person from Kurnool, is living in Hyderabad, issued the No Objection Certificate (NOC) by the Telangana Government to attend final rites of his mother. In another case, a resident of in Guntur district, was given a special pass and provided vehicle to reach his hometown where his grandfather passed away.

The UP Government has also started arranging for buses to ferry people who are coming in from other States and are stranded on the border districts. The Gautam Buddh Nagar administration on Friday said it arranged over a dozen buses to over 600 stranded people to help them reach home during the lockdown. These migrant workers , including women and children hailing from Bihar and places in interior Uttar Pradesh such as Etawah, Auraiya, Kanpur, Aligarh, Gorakhpur, Azamgarh were picked up from the Yamuna Expressway. In Jharkhand, a group of 27 migrant labourers, who worked in West Bengal’s Hooghly district, walked to reach Dumka. The labourers said that no transport is available to reach their home in Bihar’s Saharsa. In Thane, around 40 migrant labourers working in Mumbai were stopped by police on Friday morning for trying to escape to Uttar Pradesh in a truck.

Worried over a large number of exodus of migrant workers including farm labourers, the Gujarat Government has assured that migrant labourers would be given food and accommodation but won’t be allowed to travel to their villages during the 21-day lockdown.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/help-migrants-to-prevent-exodus--centre-to-states-2020-03-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/help-migrants-to-prevent-exodus--centre-to-states.html
170,28-3-20,15 lakh returnees evaded screening: Cabinet Secy,"In an alarming disclosure, the Government has said an undisclosed number of over 15 lakh passengers who returned from abroad during the last two months may have skipped the monitoring system put in place for coronavirus surveillance.

Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba has pointed to the States that in the last two month, more than 15 lakh international travellers came to India but there appears to be a gap in their actual monitoring.

Gauba has asked States to urgently strengthen the surveillance of international travellers who entered the country before the lockdown.

Interestingly, so far only around 28,000 persons have been tested for the coronavirus infection. The fact that majority of those who tested positive have a travel history, the Cabinet Secretary’s disclosure should alert the States in identifying all those who returned from abroad, quarantine and test them in case of any symptom for the infection.

In his letter to Chief Secretaries of States and Union Territories, Gauba said such a gap in monitoring of international passengers for coronavirus “may seriously jeopardise the efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19,” given that many amongst the persons who have tested positive so far in India have history of international travel.

“As you are aware, we initiated screening of international incoming passengers at the airports with effect from January 18, 2020. I have been informed that up to March 23, 2020, cumulatively, Bureau Of Immigration has shared details of more than 15 lakh incoming international passengers with the States/UTs for monitoring for COVID-19.

“However, there appears to be a gap between the number of international passengers who need to be monitored by the States/UTs and the actual number of passengers being monitored,” Gauba said in his letter.

The Government had started monitoring of all international passengers who have arrived in India in last two months in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

Gauba said, “It is important that all international passengers are put under close surveillance to prevent the spread of the epidemic.” He said the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) has repeatedly emphasised the importance of monitoring, and requested the States and UTs to take immediate steps in this regard.

“I would, therefore, like to request you to ensure that concerted and sustained action is taken urgently to put such passengers under surveillance immediately as per MoHFW guidelines,” he said.

The Cabinet Secretary also urged the Chief Secretaries to actively involve the district authorities in this effort. The screening of international incoming passengers at airports was done from January 18 in a phased manner.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/15-lakh-returnees-evaded-screening--cabinet-secy-2020-03-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/15-lakh-returnees-evaded-screening--cabinet-secy.html

Kejriwal said, “The situation is under control right now, since there is a maximum increase of 3-4 cases per day, and there were also days when no new cases were registered.”

The CM said, “I had formed a team of five doctors under the chairmanship of Dr Sareen, who is the head of ILBS hospital. The team has done brilliant work and submitted its report yesterday, including a comprehensive plan of action on the preparations done in the wake of the surge in COVID-19 cases in Delhi. They differentiated the action plan into three stages, first is what can be done if we get 100 new cases every day, second is what can be done if we get 500 new cases every day, and third is what can be done if we get 1,000 new cases every day.”

“If we get 100 new cases every day, the current healthcare system that we have is enough to treat the surge. For that, a detailed plan has been created to see how many isolation beds, ventilators, ICU beds, testing mechanisms and strength, ambulances, medical staff such as doctors and nurses, under each head of 100, 500, and 1000 new cases every day. They have also mapped a mechanism on which private hospitals to include in case of the surge, where the ambulances, ventilators and other resources will come from, etc.

“We will start implementing all these plans of action once the cases rise from 100 per day. We have a detailed plan of treating up to 1,000 new cases per day. But, I hope that we never reach this stage and I hope and pray that the rise in 4-5 new cases will also decrease in the future,” said Kejriwal.

For the poorest sections of society, the Delhi Government is providing free ration to the people. Those who do not have ration cards, are being fed meals by the Delhi Government in 224 night shelters. “We were feeding nearly 20,000 people per day through these night shelters until now, but we also observed that the number of people was rising. I noticed some videos on the social media of people who could not get meals,” said the CM.

Urging Bihar and Uttar Pradesh migrants not to leave the Capital, Kejriwal said his Government will ensure timely supply of food to daily wagers and homeless.

“Those who do not have ration cards, are being fed meals by the Delhi Government in 224 night shelters. “I noticed some videos on the social media of people who could not get meals,” he said.

“To provide lunch and dinner facilities at 325 Government schools across Delhi. Every school shall be able to feed around 500 beneficiaries each day and each night. The Government has also increased the supply of meals in the existing night shelters from today.

“I have also instructed the MLAs to ensure that no one in their constituency suffers from hunger. They should collaborate with the society and provide food to all,” he said.

Kejrwial said, “Many social and religious organisations have come forward to help, including ISKCON, Radha Soami, gurudwara organisations, and many other organisations are helping the Government and also providing food in their personal capacity. My thanks to all of them on behalf of the people.”

Requesting people to maintain social distance, Kejriwal said the lockdown will bear no results if people do not indulge in social distancing. “I have seen media stories on our night shelters and how beneficiaries are made to maintain a considerable distance from each other,” he added.

The Delhi Government has started transferring pension amount of Rs 5,000 to eight lakh pensioners including senior citizens, widow and disabled in first phase.

“Today, we have transferred Rs 5,000 in the account of pensioners, rest five thousand will be transferred in first week of April in second phase,” Kejriwal said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/delhi-ready-to-tackle-situation-if-number-goes-up--kejriwal-2020-03-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/delhi-ready-to-tackle-situation-if-number-goes-up--kejriwal.html

In a letter to Modi, the Chief Minister pointed out that the Thalassery-Coorg State Highway 30, connecting Kerala with Coorg in Karnataka via Veerajapetta, was a key highway on which cargo lorries ferry essential commodites to Kerala.

If this route was blocked, the lorries would have to traverse a longer route to reach the state, he said.

""This route is a lifeline for the flow of essential commodities to Kerala. If this is blocked, vehicles carrying essential commodities will have to travel a much longer route to reach our state.

Given the situation of the national lockdown, this will add much more hardship to the people, he said in the letter, sent on Friday.

You will naturally agree with me that no action impeding the movement of essential commodities should be initiated at this moment of crisis"", he said.

A copy of the letter was released to the media here on Saturday.

Vijayan requested Modi to intervene urgently in the matter to ensure smooth flow of essential commodities to Kerala when the state is fighting COVID-19 on a war footing.

The city's overall air quality index at 11 am stood at 40, which falls in the ""good"" category.

Environment and weather experts attributed the improvement in the air quality to the 21-day lockdown enforced to contain the spread of the coronavirus and rains and gusty winds due to successive western disturbances.

They said the air quality is expected to oscillate in the good or satisfactory categories due to the reduction in local sources of pollution -- vehicular pollution, construction dust, stack emissions etc -- due to the lockdown.

Delhi recorded a minimum of 15.7 degrees Celsius, four notches less than that recorded on Friday.

The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative figures for the national capital, recorded 5.3 mm rainfall till 8:30 am on Saturday.

He said the central government failed to take appropriate steps even after the World Health Organisation declared coronavirus a pandemic on February 5.

""When it should have been working on a plan to deal with the pandemic, the government was busy making arrangements for US President Donald Trump's visit to India and usurping power in Madhya Pradesh,"" he alleged in a statement.

Azad claimed the prime minister enforced a 21-day lockdown without proper planning and pushed 35 crore people who work in the unorganised sector into destitution.

""The goverment has left these innocent people to die. The prime minister should tender his resignation immediately,"" the Dalit leader said.

The Bhim Army chief also hit out at the Rs 1.7 lakh crore package announced by the Centre to cushion the people from the impact of the coronavirus lockdown and economic disruption caused by the disease.

“The Centre announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore package which will only help those working in the organised sector, those who have documents and bank accounts. The benefit won't reach around 37 crore people who are part of the unorganised sector,” he said.

179,28-3-20,Fully-automated kit to test Covid-19 in 2.5-hr invented by Germany,"Amid coronavirus scare has come a ray of hope with German-based multinational technology company, Robert Bosch, claiming that it has invented a fully-automated test that diagnoses respiratory pathogens, including COVID-19, in less than two-and-a-half hours.

The test, working on Bosch Healthcare Solutions’ Vivalytic analysis device, can be performed directly at points of care — eliminating the need to transport samples. Patients may also be isolated on site, reducing the ability of the virus to spread further, said the company in a statement. The device can be used in all medical institutions, and meets quality standards issued by the WHO.

It can perform ten tests per 24 hours, and can be used by medical workers who have not specifically trained with it before. The company will debut the test at its Robert Bosch Hospital in Stuttgart, before seeking other use cases, said the statement.

“The special feature of the Bosch test is that it offers differential diagnosis, which saves doctors the additional time needed for further tests. It also provides them with a reliable diagnosis quickly so they can then begin suitable treatment faster,” says Marc Meier, president of Bosch Healthcare Solutions.

“We want the Bosch rapid COVID-19 test to play a part in containing the coronavirus pandemic as quickly as possible. It will speed up the identification and isolation of infected patients,” says Dr Volkmar Denner, chairman of the board of management of Robert Bosch.

“Infected patients can be identified and isolated faster,” Bosch Chief Executive Officer Volkmar Denner said in a statement. To develop the test, Bosch teamed up with Northern Irish medical equipment maker Randox Laboratories Ltd, its partner on Vivalytic.

Detection of Covid-19 is the key to stemming its spread. In countries like Germany and South Korea, where testing was robust early on, fatality rates have been comparatively lower than in Italy and the US where slow testing helped fuel the disease’s explosive growth.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/fully-automated-kit-to-test-covid-19-in-2-5-hr-invented-by-germany.html
180,28-3-20,"US confirmed coronavirus cases cross 100,000: Tracker","The United States now has more than 100,000 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, a tracker maintained by Johns Hopkins University showed Friday.

There have been 100,717 cases including 1,544 deaths as of 6:00 pm Eastern time (3:30 am IST).

The biggest cluster by far is in New York, home to almost half the cases, overwhelming the hospital system.

The United States has around 15,000 more confirmed cases than the second country on the list, Italy, and 20,000 more than China, where the disease was first identified but has since peaked.

The US death rate based on confirmed cases is about 1.5 per cent, compared to around 10.5 per cent in Italy.

This death rate figure could fall, as greater testing reveals more people who are positive but asymptomatic.

It may also rise if more cities and states find themselves in a similar position to New York, which has seen more than 500 deaths and is experiencing a drastic shortage of hospital beds, personal protective equipment and ventilators.

""We're still seeing a rising number of cases, a rising number of hospitalizations, rising number of intensive care unit admission, a rising number of patients with the mechanical ventilators,"" Thomas Tsai, a professor of health policy at Harvard told AFP.

""And unfortunately, the death rate is likely going to follow that pattern. It's just that it's going to be days or weeks behind.""

181,28-3-20,"Trump signs USD 2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill, says help is on the way","US President Donald Trump on Friday signed into law the historic USD 2 trillion rescue package to help the Americans and secure the country's economy ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic that has infected nearly 100,000 people across the nation.

""Help is on the way,"" Trump assured his countrymen as he signed the Bill in the Oval Office at the White House. The Senate and the House of Representatives earlier passed the Bill.

""We got hit by the invisible enemy and we got hit hard,"" he said, adding the economy would come roaring back. ""I think we are going to have a tremendous rebound.""

The legislation among other things gives USD 3,400 for most of the American families of four, and billions of dollars' worth of financial assistance to small and medium businesses, and big corporations like Boeing.

""This is a very important day. I've signed the single biggest economic relief package in the American history and, I must say, any other package by the way. It is twice as large as any relief every signed,"" the President said.

The magnitude of the package can be seen in the context that India, one of the top five economies of the world, is estimated at USD 3 trillion.

""I never signed anything with a T on it,"" Trump said.

""I want to thank Democrats and Republicans for coming together and putting America first,"" he said.

The first stimulus check is likely to be sent to the Americans in the first week of April.

More than half of the country's 330 million population is now confined in their homes, Major Disaster Declaration has been announced in over a dozen states and a national emergency has been declared.

A record three million people have applied for unemployment, the entire travel and tourism industry have come to a standstill, companies have stopped their operations and only essential services are running in the US.

The United States is now the hotspot of the coronavirus in the world, where according to Worldometer, over 100,000 confirmed cases of the contagion have been recorded, 1429 people have died and 2,463 people are in critical condition.

New York, which is the financial capital of the world, accounts for nearly half of the total cases and more than 500 people have died in the Big Apple alone.

Trump, the White House said, is signing bipartisan legislation to provide relief to American families and workers during the coronavirus outbreak.

Noting that the CARES Act provides much needed economic relief for American families and businesses who are hurting through no fault of their own, the White House said the legislation will provide assistance to America's heroic healthcare workers who are on the frontlines of the outbreak.

USD 100 billion will go to healthcare providers, including hospitals on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic; and USD 27 billion will go to bolstering life-saving capabilities, including developing vaccines and the development, purchase, and distribution of critical supplies.

USD45 billion will go to the Federal Emergency Management Agency Disaster Relief Fund, more than doubling the amount available to support the President's Emergency and Disaster Declarations to empower state, local, and tribal leaders to effectively respond.

According to the White House, the legislative package brings security to American families by providing them with economic assistance during the time of crisis. It provides tax free payments treated as a refundable tax credit to Americans, giving families the immediate financial support they need.

187,28-3-20,"UK PM Boris, Health Secy Hancock test +ve","British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that he has tested positive for coronavirus after experiencing “mild symptoms”, becoming the first world leader to announce the infection.

Minutes after Johnson’s announcement, his health secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that he too was infected and was in self-isolation.

In a video message posted on Twitter, the 55-year-old Johnson said he will continue to lead the UK government’s response to the deadly virus, which has claimed 578 lives in the country.

“Over the last 24 hours I have developed mild symptoms and tested positive for coronavirus,” Johnson said on Twitter.

“I am now self-isolating, but I will continue to lead the government’s response via video-conference as we fight this virus. Together we will beat this,” he said.

Hancock, who is a key member of Johnson’s coronavirus “War Cabinet”, said in a video message that he will be self-isolating until Thursday.

“Following medical advice, I was advised to test for coronavirus. I’ve tested positive,” Hancock posted on Twitter.

The 41-year-old minister said: “Fortunately for me, the symptoms so far have been very mild so I’ve been able to carry on with the work driving forward the UK response.”

The two announcements sent shockwaves across the top rung of the UK government, with most senior ministers and civil servants in and out of 10 Downing Street as they work to curb the spread of the pandemic.

There are more than 11,600 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, and 578 people have died - a jump of 100 in a single day on Thursday.

UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has previously tested negative for the deadly virus after displaying cough symptoms, will be the next in command in case Johnson has to take some time off if he gets more ill.

The news comes just days after it was confirmed that Prince Charles had been diagnosed with COVID-19 but was displaying similarly mild symptoms. Clarence House said the 71-year-old heir to the British throne was self-isolating in Scotland and remained in “good health” as he continued to work from home.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/uk-pm-boris--health-secy-hancock-test--ve-2020-03-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/uk-pm-boris--health-secy-hancock-test--ve.html
188,28-3-20,Army ready with its ‘Op Namaste’,"With Covid-19 cases increasing by the day and likely to spike in the days to come, the Army has formed responsive and agile Quick Reaction Medical Teams (QRMTs) which are on six hours standby notice to mobilise to help hospitals and civil administration if needed, Army Chief General Manoj Naravane said here on Friday.

He also said contingency plans are ready, adding this responsibility will not affect its operational readiness. The Army has code named its anti-Covid-19 operations as Operation Namaste.

Highlighting some of the measures taken by the Army in the last few weeks, Naravane said all field hospitals were instructed to be ready to set up a 45-bed isolation facility.

And also to create 10 bed Intensive Care Unit (ICU) facility exclusively for COVID-19 at six-hour notice. In addition, 30 per cent Field Hospitals have been kept on standby for constructing COVID-19 hospitals in coronavirus hotspots, he said.

Noting that at present COVID-19 is in “preparatory stage of impact in India” and the country is making concerted efforts to prevent the disease from establishing a firm base, he said “next few weeks will be crucial to prevent negative effects of this deadly mutant virus.”

On the possible contingency options that may arise as the cases continue to rise, Naravane said, at this juncture, it is difficult to say how the situation will develop. “However, after having analysed the impact of COVID-19 over last two-three months in other countries, one can start planning and preparing for difficult times.”

On the Army’s operational preparedness, he said the Army has certain “inherent capability” to rise up to various emergency situations by virtue of organisational structure and training and in keeping with that, the “Indian Army is planning and preparing to fight COVID-19.”

While reviewing the situation on a daily basis, the Army Chief said various advisories and instructions have been issued to the force to create awareness and contain spread of COVID-19. “Command wise COVID-19 helpline numbers have also been given,” he stated.

The Army currently has wellness centres for evacuees at Manesar, Jaisalmer and Jodhpur and Army medical facilities at Jhansi, Binnaguri and Gaya have been kept on standby with an additional collective capacity of 1,600 beds. Naravane said till now 372 evacuees have been treated at Manesar and currently 82 are under quarantine. At Jaisalmer 484 citizens who were evacuated from Iran are under quarantine and another 277 at Jodhpur, he added.

Meanwhile, the Army has asked its personnel on leave to extend their stay and not report to their formations till April 15 in wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak. This order was part of the fresh advisory issued after one soldier in Ladakh was tested positive after he returned from home where his father, who had earlier returned from Iran, was also tested positive. The soldier has recovered.

Moreover, conferences and seminars and temporary duty of all ranks also stand cancelled till April 15. Also, those working in the Army Headquarters here are directed to work in shifts to ensure less contact and reduce footfall in offices.

Chipping in for the national effort to fight the pandemic, 62 Cantonment Boards spread over 19 States and Union Territories, across the country, with a population of approximately 21 lakh (including military and civil) have geared up to the challenge. Instructions have been issued to all the Cantonment Boards to identify beds in hospitals/health centres and guest houses for any eventuality.

Presidents and Chief Executive Officers of the Cantonment Boards are in constant touch with civilian authorities in their respective areas and providing required assistance whenever needed. All the advisories issued by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare are being strictly adhered to by all the Cantonment Boards.

All the Cantonment offices buildings, residential areas, school premises, libraries, parks and markets are being sanitised regularly.

189,28-3-20,Satish Gujral no more,"Architect, painter, muralist, sculptor and graphic artist Satish Gujral was a product of the experiences that he had had. And he kept layering them till the ripe old age of 94. While events like the Partition and his hearing impairment at the age of eight influenced his art, he never let these get the better of him. Later he underwent a cochlear implant and regained his power of hearing after 62 years in 1998.

Indian art and architecture greatly benefited due to Gujral’s fickle-minded nature. Because of his ability to get bored of things easily, he kept changing his profession, but perfected each one of them. At the end of it all, the man turned into one of the most brilliant multi-faceted personalities India has ever seen.

Though he wouldn’t agree to it, art has remained his constant love, even as he experimented with it like no other lover would. Over the years, he constantly changed his medium and materials in order to differentiate his art from that of his previous creation. Known for creating some of the most exquisite paintings, murals and sculptures, Gujral was one of the greatest as well as the most versatile artists of India.

He also ventured into architecture, even as people criticised him for doing so since he was already successful as an artist. Had he not ventured into architecture fearing failure, India wouldn’t have got one of the finest buildings of the 20th century - the Belgium Embassy, situated in New Delhi. He created artworks with modern techniques that were much inspired from Indian culture and tradition and Indian architecture.

Unlike many of his peers, who went to Paris or London in the early 1950s, Gujral went to Mexico City to study with Diego Rivera and Siqueiros. It was here that he was exposed to the idea of public art, which he implemented later in his life and also came in touch with artists Frida Kahlo and Octavio Paz.

The Mexican Government conferred Gujral with “The Order of the Aztec Eagle”, an honour given to foreigners rendering distinguish services to Mexico and humanity.

His art touched people in everyday objects.

His familiar works include the alphabet mural on the outside wall of the Delhi High Court. Among the best are his two sculptures at the ITC Maurya, New Delhi. Gujral created a modernist mould with Indianesque idioms. He also designed the Belgian Embassy in Delhi for which the Belgian Government honoured him with the Order of the Crown in 1983. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan for his contributions. “Gujral’s was a versatile practice spanning painting, sculpture and architecture. RIP,” artist Ranjit Hoskote tweeted, expressing his condolences.

Reactions from other people in the art world came in as well. Adwaita Gadanayak, DG, NGMA, said, “India loses Gujral, an eminent artist, sculptor and architect. His brilliance lay in his ability to use his creativity to the fullest in many forms and ways. The NGMA has his early painting of 1999 in our collection. Highlight happened in 1952, when he got a scholarship to study at the revered Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City, where he was apprenticed under renowned artists Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros - who were remarkable figures of the 20th-century art scene. To have Frida Kahlo and Octavio Paz as his friends became the important point of synergy.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/satish-gujral-no-more-2020-03-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/satish-gujral-no-more.html
190,28-3-20,Security agencies look into role of Kerala youth in Kabul terror attack,"Central security agencies are looking into the role of Kerala youth -- Mohammed Muhsin -- who is believed to be one of the terrorists of ISIS that claimed responsibility of an attack on a gurdwara in Afghanistan killing 25 people, officials said on Saturday.

The youth hails from Kasargod, Kerala, and had left India to the UAE in 2018 from where he is believed to have joined the ranks with the global terror organisation in Afghanistan, they said.

His identity was established after an Islamic state publication posted his picture identifying him with his 'kunya' (Arabic name) Abu Khalid al-Hindi, the officials said.

They said he, along with his family, had returned to Kerala from Malaysia in 2017 and later had left for Saudi Arabia in search of work.

The same year he returned and stayed with his family for sometime before leaving for the UAE in 2018, the officials said.

At least 25 worshippers were killed and eight others injured when a heavily armed suicide bomber stormed his way into a prominent gurdwara on Wednesday in the heart of Afghanistan's capital of Kabul, in one of the deadliest attacks on the minority Sikh community in the strife-torn country.

The Islamic State terror group, which has targeted Sikhs before in Afghanistan, claimed responsibility for the attack.

The central agencies with the help of local police reached out to the family of the accused, who identified him to be Muhsin from the published picture which had ISIS flag in the background, they said.

The parents had claimed to have received a message from the ISIS confirming the death of their son during the attack on gurdwara in Kabul on Wednesday, the officials said.

Muhsin, the 28-year old school dropout, is believed to have landed in Afghanistan as a member of ISIS in the Khorasan Province, they said.

With one of the victims in the gurdwara attack being an Indian, the amended NIA Act gives the agency mandate to take over the investigation but a call is yet to be taken by the Home Ministry, the officials said.

191,28-3-20,COVID-19 patients may still have coronavirus after symptoms disappear: Study,"Researchers claim that half of the patients they treated for mild COVID-19 infection still had the novel coronavirus for up to eight days after symptoms disappeared, a finding that explains why controlling the spread of the disease has been difficult.

The research, published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,

assessed 16 patients with COVID-19, who were treated and released from the Treatment Center of PLA General Hospital in Beijing between January 28 and February 9, 2020.

In the study, researchers, including Indian-origin scientist Lokesh Sharma from Yale University in the US, analysed samples collected of throat swabs taken from all the patients on alternate days.

They said the patients were discharged after their recovery and confirmation of negative viral status by at least two consecutive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.

""The most significant finding from our study is that half of the patients kept shedding the virus even after resolution of their symptoms,"" said co-lead author Sharma.

""More severe infections may have even longer shedding times,"" he said.

According to the research, the primary symptoms in these patients included fever, cough, pain in the pharynx, and difficult or labored breathing (dyspnea).

They said the patients were treated with a range of medications.

The time from infection to onset of symptoms -- incubation period -- was five days among all but one patient, the scientists noted, adding that the average duration of symptoms was eight days.

They said the length of time patients remained contagious after the end of their symptoms ranged from one to eight days.

Two patients also had diabetes and one had tuberculosis, neither of which affected the timing of the course of COVID-19 infection, the study said.

""If you had mild respiratory symptoms from COVID-19 and were staying at home so as not to infect people, extend your quarantine for another two weeks after recovery to ensure that you don't infect other people,"" suggested study co-author Lixin Xie from the Chinese PLA General Hospital in Beijing.

""COVID-19 patients can be infectious even after their symptomatic recovery, so treat the asymptomatic/recently recovered patients as carefully as symptomatic patients,"" the scientists said.

The researchers said all of these patients had milder infections and recovered from the disease, and that the study looked at a small number of patients.

They noted that it is unclear whether similar results would hold true for more vulnerable patients such as the elderly, those with suppressed immune systems, and patients on immunosuppressive therapies.

""Further studies are needed to investigate if the real-time PCR-detected virus is capable of transmission in the later stages of COVID-19 infection,"" Xie added.

195,28-3-20,Shirley Setia: I get nervous and scared while talking to strangers,"New Zealand-based singer-actress Shirley Setia is all set to make her Bollywood debut this year. But before that, she has already just featured in the Netflix film, ""Maska"".

In the movie, Shirley plays a blogger. Talking about her character, the actress said: ""My character's name is Persis. She is a very strong headed girl. She is independent. She is very passionate about stories and finding out people's stories. She is a blogger. So you will always see her with a camera and a voice recorder.""

""She talks to people and writes about them in her blog. She is making a new book about Irani cafes and their culture, about the people related to the Irani cafes. Not just the people who own them but also the regular customers who have a lot of memories with such cafes. That's how she meets Rumi (played by Prit Kamani) and the story unfolds,"" said Shirley sharing further details about the story.

The actress then shared her similarities with her own screen character. When quizzed about the same, Shirley thought for a while and said: ""Some things I relate to like her passion for stories. I've always been very passionate about stories even when I was just a singer. I still sing. When you are writing a song, you want to put a story in it which the audience and your fans can relate to. So, I related to her passion for stories. There are some aspects in her character which I might not absolutely agree with. I guess that's where we differ. But both of us are quite independent and strong headed. We know what we want to do, how we want to focus on things.""

Being an introvert person, it was not easy to play a blogger, especially because she gets nervous and scared while talking to strangers revealed the newcomer. She said: ""It was a little difficult because I am an introvert person. When you are a blogger, you have to go to random people, talk to them, take their pictures, you have to be out of your comfort zone. This was very difficult for me because I get very scared and nervous while talking to strangers.""

However, things became easier after a few workshops. ""Our director did workshops with us and put me in such a situation that I had to go talk to random people as Persis and ask them their stories. It was unexpected but helped me understand the mindset of the character. She is free and doesn't care about what people think of her. She does what she feels is right. I wish I could also be like that,"" expressed Shirley.

Even though brought up in New Zealand, the 24-year-old actress speaks fluent Hindi. Talking about the same, she revealed: ""We speak in Hindi at home. Also, when I was in high school, I used to work as a radio jockey in a Hindi radio station in New Zealand.""

On the work front, Shirley is set to make her Bollywood debut with Sabbir Khan's ""Nikamma"" where she stars alongside Shilpa Shetty and Abhimanyu Dassani.

205,28-3-20,Don’t let rumour infect your mind; Pioneer is sanitized,"The rumours of my death have been greatly exaggerated,” Sir James Paul McCartney, the legendary musical maestro, had once borrowed the line from Mark Twain to scotch the rumour of his death. The sheer influence of a canard — in the present case that newspapers can act as carriers of coronavirus — is as pervasive and deadly as the pandemic Covid-19, leading to panic among newspaper readers and vendors.

Therefore, it is high time The Pioneer informed you about facts, and measures we have taken, when the life of our esteemed readers is concerned. While there is no data or scientific truth — as clarified by WHO too — in the rumour as the entire process from printing to packaging newspapers is completely automated, thus devoid of human touch, The Pioneer has added an additional layer of safety by spraying sanitisation on the paper during the printing and by ensuring that even vendors and delivery persons are properly sanitised.

Also, the printing staff are thermally scanned and sanitised daily, said The Pioneer’s printing manager Indraraj.

The newspaper copies, bundled in sanitised brown envelopes, are loaded into sanitised vehicles. And the delivery boys, the only persons who actually touch your newspapers before delivering the same at your doorsteps, have been informed about the importance of personal hygiene, particularly sanitising their hands. They have been provided with sanitisers and masks to ensure that The Pioneer readers are absolutely safe while touching or reading the newspapers, said the circulation head, Rajeev Gautam.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/don---t-let-rumour-infect-your-mind--pioneer-is-sanitized-2020-03-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/don---t-let-rumour-infect-your-mind--pioneer-is-sanitized.html

208,28-3-20,"Like doing complex, layered roles but don't get offered much: Arshad Warsi","As someone who has mostly done comedic roles, actor Arshad Warsi says web series Asur gave him a rare chance to play a complex and layered character.

Arshad has played serious roles in the past, most notable in the under-appreciated film Sehar , but comedy movies Munna Bhai MBBS , Hulchul and Golmaal have been more successful.

In Asur , which has garnering a lot of critical appreciation, the 51-year-old actor plays the role of a forensic expert.

Arshad said he took up the offer as it gave him a chance to come out of the comic zone.

Two things compelled me to take up Asur'. It had a great script, thrilling and unpredictable, exactly what, I feel, is required in a web series. Secondly, it was not a comic character. It was a serious, complex, layered character, something I like doing but don't get offered much, Arshad told PTI in an interview.

The actor said out of the 70 to 80 films that he has done, about 50 of them have been comedies.

I did only one absolutely serious film, which was Seher'. My work and the film was really appreciated and now the second one is Asur' and again my work and the series has been appreciated.

Then there are the semi-serious characters in films like Ishqiya', Jolly LLB' in which my work was loved. Thanks to these few films, I am considered a versatile actor. I really wish I get offered more serious roles, he added.

As an artiste, Arshad said every film every role comes with its own share of challenges.

Every film and every character is a struggle and a performance pressure is there till the appreciation starts or doesn't start (coming), he said.

Though the actor does not believe in following any technique in portraying a role, he tries his best to capture the nuances and the little details.

Once I have heard a script and understood the character, I keep thinking about it 24/7, till the film or series is over and that is my homework or process to play any role, he said.

Arshad said for his role of Dhananjay Rajput's Asur , available on Voot, he has tried to not over-dramatise his part, keeping it as real as possible.

As actors we tend to over-dramatise a situation. In real life, when a doctor is operating on a patient, he needs to be very calm.These are the nuances that make a character believable, he added.

The crime thriller series pits two opposing worlds against each other - of forensic science and Indian mythology.

Mixing Hindu mythology and science was a brilliant and a difficult idea, which is one of the things that attracted me to the script. The writers of Asur' are well versed with Hindu mythology, way more than I can ever be. So as an actor it is my job to have faith in them, and that's exactly what I did, Arshad said.

The series has got an overwhelming response, 9.1 rating on IMDb, and the actor credits the director for creating a thrilling story.

The director's vision is brilliant. It's unpretentious, to the point, the background score is haunting, the editing is sharp, the visuals are mesmerising and all the actors are immensely talented. It's difficult to go wrong with all this.

The actor revealed that season two of ""Asur"" is pipeline and that the work has already begun on it.

The writers are working on it and it is going to be an uphill task for them after the response of season one, he said.

215,28-3-20,"Europe's virus toll surges, world plunges into recession","Europe was reeling from a staggering surge in coronavirus deaths Saturday, still days or weeks from what experts desperately hope will be the epidemic's peak.

Grim new tolls from Italy and Spain came as the IMF confirmed the world economy has plunged into a historic slump, and the US invoked wartime procurement powers.

More than 600,000 cases of the new coronavirus have been officially recorded around the world since the outbreak of the epidemic, according to an AFP tally.

Variations in testing regimes mean the true number is likely far higher still, and confirmed deaths are mounting.

Spain recorded 832 fatalities in 24 hours, bringing its toll to 5,690, second in the world only to Italy, which confirmed a one-day record of 969 on Friday.

Elsewhere, Iran announced 139 more deaths and India sealed off a dozen Punjab villages that had been visited by a guru now known to be infected and a possible ""super-spreader"".

And, in South Africa, Johannesburg police resorted to rubber bullets to enforce social distancing on a crowd queueing for supplies outside a downtown supermarket during a national lockdown.

The United States now has the world's highest single number of COVID-19 cases but per capita European nations are still the worst hit, with emergency services struggling to cope.

However, two months of almost total isolation appear to have paid off in China's Wuhan, where the virus first emerged, which was partially reopened.

Since January, residents have been forbidden to leave, with roadblocks installed and millions subjected to dramatic restrictions on their daily life.

But on Saturday people were allowed to enter the city, and most of the subway network restarted. Some shopping centres will open their doors next week.

The European Union economy has already been disrupted by border closures and stay-at-home orders, and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte warned that the bloc could lose it legitimacy. ""If Europe does not rise to this unprecedented challenge, the whole European structure loses its raison d'etre to the people,"" he told the Il Sole 24 Ore newspaper.

Italy, backed by France and Spain, wants Europe to come up with a stronger financial response to the crisis, but Germany and the Netherlands are resisting calls to pool national debts.

Meanwhile, on Friday, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said massive spending will be needed to help developing nations, warning: ""It is clear that we have entered a recession."" In the US, which now has more than 104,000 COVID-19 patients, President Donald Trump invoked emergency powers Friday to force a private company to make medical equipment.

""Today's action will help ensure the quick production of ventilators that will save American lives,"" Trump said Friday, as he issued the order to auto giant General Motors.

With 60 percent of the country in lockdown, and infections skyrocketing, Trump also signed the largest stimulus package in US history, worth $2 trillion.

It came as Italy recorded almost 1,000 deaths from the virus on Friday -- the worst one-day toll anywhere since the pandemic began. One coronavirus sufferer, a cardiologist from Rome who has since recovered, recalled his hellish experience at a hospital in the capital. ""The treatment for the oxygen therapy is painful, looking for the radial artery is difficult. Desperate other patients were crying out, 'enough, enough',"" he told AFP.

Infection rates in Italy are on a downward trend, but the head of the national health institute Silvio Brusaferro said it was not out of the woods yet, predicting ""we could peak in the next few days"". Spain has the world's second-highest coronavirus death toll after Italy and the number of cases jumped to 72,248 on Saturday as the country moves to significantly increase testing.

Smaller Belgium and Luxembourg also saw a steep climb in deaths, with 353 recorded in the former on Saturday -- up from 289 the day before -- and 15 in the grand duchy, up from nine. Europe has suffered the brunt of the coronavirus crisis in recent weeks, with millions across the continent on lockdown and the streets of Paris, Rome and Madrid eerily empty.

In Britain, the men leading the country's fight against the coronavirus -- Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Health Secretary Matt Hancock -- have both tested positive for COVID-19.

Meanwhile, other countries across the world were bracing for the virus's full impact, with AFP tallies showing more than 26,000 deaths globally.

The World Health Organization's regional director for Africa warned the continent faced a ""dramatic evolution"" of the pandemic, as South Africa also began life under lockdown and reported its first virus death.

In the United States, known infections jumped past 104,000, the world's highest figure, with 1,711 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.

In New York City, the US epicentre of the crisis, health workers battled a surging toll -- including an increasing number of younger patients -- while struggling with a severe shortage of protective equipment.

But as Europe and the United States struggle to contain the pandemic, aid groups have warned the death toll could be in the millions in low-income countries and war zones such as Syria and Yemen, where hygiene conditions are already dire and healthcare systems are in tatters.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/europe-s-virus-toll-surges--world-plunges-into-recession-2020-03-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/europe-s-virus-toll-surges--world-plunges-into-recession.html
