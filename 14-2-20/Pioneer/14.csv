0,14-2-20,Turbulent times for Beijing,"Only history can reveal the source of coronavirus. But the crucial issue facing China today is how the people perceive the communist regime’s response to the disaster

The world is going through tumultuous times. China, too, has not been spared. A dreaded virus has struck the Middle Kingdom and there’s no end in sight for the epidemic though it seems to be spreading at a slower pace outside Wuhan, its epicenter. The epidemic has strange collaterals. In usual times, internet and social networks are kept under close watch by the communist State and any “reactionary” or “anti-Government” post is deleted immediately. Ever since the outbreak of the virus, monitoring has been extended to topics that are usually out of the purview of the censor.

Recently, netizens received a notice from Douban, a popular Chinese social network, which said, “The news you posted has been removed as it contains radical, political or ideological content.” It referred to the lyrics of the Chinese national anthem, which starts: “Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves! With our flesh and blood, let us build a new Great Wall! From each one, the urgent call to action comes forth. Arise!”

Indeed, it is a revolutionary song … one that is dangerous for the ruling party in the present context as it evokes fears of a popular revolt against the way the Government has been handling the spread of the coronavirus. Take the case of Dr Li Wenliang, one of the first doctors who alerted the public about the outbreak. When Dr Li sounded the alarm in December, he was severely reprimanded by the local authorities. And when he passed away, the Wuhan Central Hospital first denied his death, triggering deep anger among the public.

Bill Bishop, the author of the well-informed Sinocism newsletter, noted: “Social media is blowing up the news that Wuhan whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang has died …but in a morbid twist, it appears that the relevant authorities, probably after seeing the online uproar, may not be allowing him to die officially yet.” The regime’s hesitation to announce Dr Li’s death showed the dilemma the communist party is faced with.

During the first month after the outbreak of the virus, China lost two battles. First, it was unable to foresee the seriousness of the epidemic (on the contrary, for a month, it tried to hide the truth from the public). Second, it lost control over the information warfare, which was then led by the citizens. China has now decided to retake the initiative on the information battlefield even as it uses the toughest possible preventive measures on the ground to manage the fallout of the coronavirus. This, at the risk of facing an economic slowdown.

On February 10, Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the communist party, reappeared (with a mask) on the stage after several days of absence and spoke of “resolutely winning the people’s war against pneumonia epidemic.” According to Xinhua, Xi asserted that the situation remained very serious but expressed confidence that “China will certainly obtain a full victory in the fight against the epidemic.”

At Ditan Hospital in Beijing, Xi talked to medical workers of three hospitals in Wuhan via video conference and praised the work done by them. He said, “Wuhan is a heroic city and people of Hubei and Wuhan are heroic people who have never been crushed by any difficulty and danger in history.”

Xi’s return seems to be a well-orchestrated move to regain the initiative. The Chinese President was pompously termed as the “commander of the people’s war against the epidemic.” Before disappearing, he chaired a meeting with the Politburo Standing Committee. Here, he stressed that the party should “do a good job in propaganda education and public opinion guidance.”

HK01, a Hong Kong-based online news portal, said that such guidance must include “promoting in-depth publicity about the major decisions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, substantially reporting the effectiveness of the joint (epidemic) prevention and control measures in different regions and different departments, vividly telling touching stories about China’s fight against the epidemic and demonstrating the Chinese people’s spirit and the great power of unity and togetherness in fighting the epidemic.”

As a result, Zhang Xiaoguo, Director of the Information Bureau of the CCP Central Propaganda Department, announced that his department would send 300 reporters to Hubei province. The WeChat account of “Reporters Station” said that the scribes, besides providing reports on the epidemic prevention and control, “will present positive stories on humanity to the public to strengthen the guidance of public opinion.”

At the same time, authoritarian methods have been put in place. CNN mentioned, “They (Chinese authorities) are turning to a sophisticated authoritarian playbook honed over decades of crackdowns on dissidents and undesirables to enforce quarantines and lockdowns across the country”. The US channel spoke of a shift in the narrative “from a story of an entire country pulling together in a time of crisis to a darker tale of bad actors undermining efforts to keep people safe and spreading the virus through their own irresponsibility.”

The “Li Wenliang effect” had to be rectified by massive propaganda. The Globe, the Canadian media group, observed: “Stung by public criticism as the Wuhan virus outbreak continues to claim lives, Chinese authorities have reinvigorated the state hero-making machine, with official media promoting stories of sacrifice, dedication and love in arduous times.”

Meanwhile, Xu Zhangrun, a law professor at the Tsinghua University in Beijing who has been under suspension, blamed the communist party leaders for putting politics ahead of the people. He wrote a strongly-worded piece that was published on overseas Chinese language websites. He said, “The political system has collapsed under the tyranny and a governance system [made up] of bureaucrats, which has taken [the party] more than 30 years to build, has floundered.”

Only history can reveal the source of the virus — whether it is animal-borne or originated from a laboratory working on a covert biological weapons programme. The crucial issue today is how people perceive the regime’s response to the disaster. This is the real battle in China at present. Since 1978, the current dynasty in China has managed to bring some wealth and well-being to the masses but in the process, the Chinese people have lost their freedom to think freely. In every corner of the Kingdom, they are recognised by cameras, which record the most intimate details of their life. They have no choice but to follow the words of the party. With the novel coronavirus still spreading wildly, the system has started showing its limits. More propaganda cannot undo the much-needed political reforms in China.

1,14-2-20,Another Pak ploy,"The Imran Khan Government has jailed global terrorist Hafiz Saeed yet again to wriggle out of the FATF grey list

This is as anodyne as it can get, Pakistan imprisoning globally proscribed terrorist and mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai attacks Hafiz Saeed. For the nth time. That too on terror-financing charges. Clearly, Pakistan is indulging in another round of tokenism to escape severe action by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the anti-money-laundering watchdog, something which would cost it international aid. With consistent lobbying, it managed to win over the monitoring panel recently when its members expressed satisfaction over its corrective compliances and counter-terrorism efforts. The crackdown on Saeed is another demonstrable tradeoff tool, with fringe benefits. This time he has been charged with routing money through his charity organisations, Jamaat-ud-Dawa’ah (JuD) and Falah-e-Insaniat, both fronts that funded his militant group Lashkar-e-Tayyeba (LeT). This is not the first time that Saeed, the arrowhead of Pakistan’s proxy war with India, has become a scapegoat to pacify world opinion at our behest. As and when there has been a concerted push against global terrorism, Pakistan has kept Saeed in and out of detention on various charges and even put him under house arrest, eight times since 2001, according to the US House foreign affairs committee. While these made for temporary optics, he has been roaming around that country at will. Not only that, Pakistan has abetted the mutation of several terrorist networks, eliminating them the moment their names have been put under the scanner and recasting them as new outfits. The charity route through socio-religious bodies is also tried and tested, with no means of tracking specific use of each grant that is funnelled through several conduits except those listed deliberately to deflect attention from the clandestine operatives. Remember, Saeed was also arrested last July and no less than US President Donald Trump — amping up Pakistan’s instrumentality in negotiating with the Taliban — had publicly scaled up a routine affair, saying it was possible only after a 10-year search. Neither has Saeed appeared broken or in retreat. In fact, before he was confined to his premises in 2017, he held a press conference on continuing jihad in Kashmir, exclaiming, “This order has travelled from New Delhi to Washington and then finally to Islamabad.” This is no different from Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has made a habit of attributing every Western admonition of its excesses to pressure from India and its status as a significant market. Given these precedents, the latest move is also nothing but a hogwash.

Except that the endorsement of Pakistan should worry us a bit more this time, particularly now that US Senators are keeping a close watch on the lockdown in Kashmir and have even written to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to address it during the Trump visit to India. With Pakistan under review at FATF, the Kashmir issue is unwittingly being drawn into the discourse as a counterweight. Alice Wells, the top US diplomat for South Asia, who had expressed concern over continued detentions and internet shutdown in Kashmir, has now lauded Pakistan “in meeting its international commitments to combat terrorist financing.” Clearly, the US needs Pakistan for the Afghan pullout and bending the Taliban. It may also be yielding ground at FATF as freezing aid to Pakistan might just aggravate the economic instability in the region and have a cascading impact on politics. But at the last round of FATF, India’s was the lone voice of protest against the lenient view on Pakistan. Even the European Union (EU) and Japan were convinced by our neighbour. If indeed it gets out of the grey list, it can avail international funding and the conduits to Kashmir could be red hot again, not that they had stopped completely. Besides, the Pakistani economy is not exactly stuttering, Moody’s upgrading its status from negative to stable, its Arab benefactors investing and even Russia keen to put money in north-south gas pipelines. Global penalties won’t impact Pakistan’s proxy war with India; the Government-military configuration will always keep that on the boil, prioritising it as a strategic interest. Even while staying on the FATF watch, there has been no cessation of terrorist infiltration into Kashmir. A listing won’t change that ground reality. At the same time, India has to ensure that there is no change in the international opinion of “Kashmir is a bilateral issue” argument, the pin-pricking offers of mediation by Trump notwithstanding. The Government needs to demonstrate some optics, too, in assuaging criticism both in the US and EU, both of which are being pushed uncomfortably on human rights in Kashmir. Our hardening stance would mean that the world will relax its posturing towards our neighbour.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/another-pak-ploy-2020-02-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/another-pak-ploy.html
2,14-2-20,Will Cong learn now?,"The infighting has spilled out in the public space, plunging the party to new lows

The Congress wouldn’t have been the way it is without its egoistic sabre-rattling and dirty infighting. But the knives-out civil war and the unabashed blood-letting in the party, post its unprecedented debacle in the Delhi Assembly elections, have got to be a new low, even by its own standards. Senior leader Jairam Ramesh summed it up the best when he candidly admitted that Congress leaders had forgotten they were out of power for six years but were still behaving as arrogantly as Ministers. Another articulate leader and now tainted ex-Finance Minister P Chidambaram publicly passed off the challenge to counter the BJP to State parties. He was promptly pulled up for relinquishing the party’s own responsibility in defeat by the daughter of the dyed-in-the-wool Congressman Pranab Mukherjee, Sharmistha Mukherjee. The worst was the public denunciation of Sheila Dikshit, who transformed Delhi during a 15-year reign as Chief Minister and gave a creditable legacy to the party, and attributing the present factionalism to her. Such name-calling is not just churlish, it is morally wrong. Not even the smallest outfit would make its internal battles public for the sake of propriety. But then all of the Congress’ Central leaders seem to have had a mental derangement in the face of their self-created adversities. And suffering waves of frustration since 2014, have lost the script. They are also delusional, thinking their words still matter at a time that they have become a fringe third or fourth player in certain States. Make no mistake, the Congress revival in States has been possible because of the strength of the local leadership, like in Punjab, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, and some default settings. But durbar leaders are too blinded by powerlessness to recognise their assets. Even the leadership of the Gandhis can’t save the party because a new India is averse to the politics of entitlement. The Congress may espouse the power of democracy but is yet to apply it to itself.

The Delhi rout was but expected with even the common man on the street wondering if it should bow out of the race respectfully than play vote-cutter. The only assets the party has are its pan-India footprint and historical recall. It can still reinvent itself, begin with organisational elections and choose the strongest as its president. It needs to overturn the dynastic hold with a battery of young leaders who can be tasked to lead each State as equals. It needs to follow result-oriented formula. Or else it will not find anybody to write its epitaph.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/will-cong-learn-now--2020-02-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/will-cong-learn-now-.html
3,14-2-20,A tightrope walk,"The rising tension between the US and Iran is a litmus test of India’s new policy of multi-alignment within the region

The end of 2020 will be intensely awaited by the world as it seeks an answer to the burning question, will Donald Trump, who just triumphed in the impeachment proceedings, remain the President of the United States after the November elections? Significantly, Iran is also going to witness its parliamentary elections on February 21.

According to strategic thinkers, with the high-profile killing of Iranian Major-General Qasem Soleimani, the Trump presidency intended its Iran policy to be entirely different from that of his predecessors. The attack has ignited a debate whether or not it was worth the risk to kill Soleimani, who incidentally, was the face of armed resistance against the Islamic State (IS) in Iraq and Syria along with the US, Russia, Turkey and its European allies.

Previous US administrations also had the opportunity to take out Soleimani but chose not to, mostly because of concerns that it would lead to a series of dangerous escalations on both sides. However, it is clear from the economic sanctions imposed against Iran that Trump has adopted a different approach and has used his famed “maximum pressure” strategy.

Although, anti-Americanism in Iran has always remained a challenge for US foreign policy, Trump’s decision to take out Iran’s most popular military leader has pitched to a new high the anti-American wave on Irans streets. The much-loved General’s assassination will most likely be used by the Iranian regime to fan anti-American sentiments that are running high in the country. And this will have long-term consequences, which the US may or may not be prepared for.

Elections have long been used by the Iranian leadership under the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei’s watch as tools to create an illusion of public support and democratic legitimacy. And this time around, the regime is more desperate than ever to show its detractors at home and abroad that it represents the will of the Iranian people because over the last four decades, the gap between the people and the regime has gradually widened.

With every passing day, more and more Iranians are coming to the conclusion that the regime does not represent them and cannot be reformed and Iranians want and deserve a leadership that respects their wishes and protects their interests. Until Iran’s leaders understand this fact and hold free and fair elections, the gap between the people and their rulers will continue to widen, the protests will continue and the real voter turnout will remain low. So, the regime will use this attack by Trump as a means to cover its ruthlessness and shortcomings and fan anti-US sentiments to make itself relevant as elections loom large.

Interestingly, on the other side, in the US, where conspiracy theories abound accusing past Presidents of purposely creating foreign policy crises during an election year with an aim to divert public opinion from pressing and unsavoury domestic issues, the killing of General Soleimani is nothing new.

However, this time Trump may have taken things too far in search of short-term domestic electoral gains. Security experts caution that this incident will have a long-term impact and may endanger US’ security interests in West Asia. As per a latest development, a Democratic-led US House of Representatives committee had reached an agreement with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to testify at a public hearing on Iran and Iraq policy, after threatening a subpoena over previous refusals to appear. This will be in public domain soon.

The ongoing tension between the US and Iran has shaken the world as anything that happens in the Gulf region will have a severe impact on the oil-based economy of the world and more specifically Asian countries. However, security experts have signalled, based on Trump’s recent statement “calling on NATO partners to play a bigger role in the Middle East region” that he is willing to de-escalate tensions. On its part Iran, too, is not keen to ratchet up the issue as it has shown its willingness to submit to the International Atomic Energy Agency inspections and is not walking out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.

Notwithstanding these signals from the two countries, New Delhi is understandably worried about how Gulf tensions will impact India. This is because India has strategic interests in the region in the form of the Chahabar Port and the nearly 10 million Indians working in the Gulf, who send home over $40 billion as remittance.

In January, while speaking at the fifth edition of the Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi, Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif set temperatures rising as he called the US “ignorant and arrogant” and slammed the country for the assassination of the war hero. He also asked India for an aggressive backdoor diplomacy to safeguard its national interests in the region.

While promising that his country was not looking for a war with the mighty US, the Iranian Ambassador pushed India for a greater role in the efforts to de-escalate rising tensions in the Persian Gulf region. Allaying fears about the effects of the crisis on trade, Chegeni also assured India that Chabahar Port was fine and operative as it was a symbol of the friendship between India, Iran, Afghanistan, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Europe and the whole Persian Gulf.

Significantly, keeping in mind the strategic importance of developing the regional maritime traffic to Afghanistan and Central Asia, the US gave a written assurance to India that it would help facilitate the funding for the purchase of equipment worth $85 million for the Chabahar Port.

Also, tension in the region may cause a threat to the traffic that goes through the tiny Strait of Hormuz, which though just 21 miles across at its widest point, has major strategic and geopolitical relevance because it is situated between Iran and Oman. It is a financially crucial checkpoint because it is the world’s busiest shipping lane and there are limited alternatives to bypass it.

According to a report of the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), 21 million barrels of crude and refined oil pass through the strait, which is about one-third of world’s sea- traded oil. Thus, Iran can take revenge on the US and give its allies sleepless nights by shutting the strait or obstructing the oil tankers passing through it, which will ultimately disrupt supply and push up shipping costs and consequently energy prices.

India has an exceptional advantage here, being a nation with a multi-alignment approach in the Gulf region. As it shares close relations with Iran and the US alike, New Delhi can act as a mediator between the two nations.

Given its security and economic interests in the region, New Delhi has cultivated a strong friendship with most countries in West Asia like Israel, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman. This affords it an opportunity to initiate a dialogue in times of strife, with greater chances of success.

However, this recent episode of rising tensions between the US and Iran is a litmus test of India’s new policy of multi-alignment within the region.

The unfolding events in West Asia are being keenly watched by Russia and China because both have strong interest in the region. While Moscow sees itself as an emerging dominant power with West Asia being a major part of its plan, China is equally concerned as 50 per cent of its oil imports come from the region. However, its biggest worry is its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as Iraq has major geo-strategic importance because of its location.

There is speculation that Moscow is silently backing Iran as it has intelligence-sharing arrangements with it. This, more than anything else, should give the US cause for worry.

4,14-2-20,Address key issues,"For Ayushman Bharat to be a success, hospitals must start delivering services at Govt-approved rates, but a lot needs to be done

The public healthcare systems in the country have shouldered the burden of providing affordable and accessible services to scores of Indians for long. However, the sheer expanse of the area and the number of people make it difficult for the Government to reach all those who need help. This is where private healthcare systems have emerged as a reliable partner over the last three decades. And now, with the advent of Ayushman Bharat, healthcare in the country has got a much-needed shot in the arm. Armed with a state-funded insurance scheme, the underprivileged were brought at par with their privileged compatriots. However, private participation in this ambitious healthcare scheme is stymied by several issues and the allocation of Rs 69,000 crore for the healthcare sector in this year’s Union Budget is only half of the Rs 1.12 lakh crore demanded by the Ministry. Having said that, the Government’s proposal to expand the reach of the Ayushman Bharat scheme in more Tier-2 and Tier- 3 cities with no empanelled hospitals brings some good news. The allocation for Ayushman Bharat for the Financial Year (FY) 2020-21 is expected to be Rs 6,429 crore and as per the NITI Aayog’s recommendation, the Government has aggressively promoted the idea of public-private partnership (PPP) for deeper penetration of the scheme.

Anyone, who has ventured or tried to venture into that coveted and yet uncharted territory of Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, will know what it entails. A PPP model helps address many of the challenges faced by private healthcare providers, who want to set up new facilities — land acquisition, finance and permits are some of the challenges. With Government support, many of these issues can be eased out. However, making the operation part a win-win lies in managing finances and the optimum use of resources — the cost per bed of setting up a private hospital in a metropolitan city can be as much as a mind-boggling Rs 1.30 crore.

It takes more than 50 licences and approvals to open a hospital in India and all of these are a time-consuming process. For example, an approval for a building plan and an approval from the pollution control board takes several weeks. The single-window approval system proposed by successive Governments is still pending. There is also no clarity on how the land — one of the biggest assets of any business and a major cause of their concern in recent times — will be sourced and who will be primarily responsible for that.

Together with finding good doctors and nurses, providing necessary equipment and technicians to handle them, as well as training and retaining all such people, hospital operation and management is a far more Herculean task than it appears to be. It’s not only limited to the infrastructure of the hospital but also all other supporting amenities like good education institutes for the children of people coming to work in these institutions, in the same town.

The financial and reputational risks are too real to ignore. The problem of scaling up, the lack of adequate and trained workforce, the insufficient road and transport options — all of them together make Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities a lucrative but tough call. It is commendable that the Government has noted this and proposed viability gap funding, a very popular concept in the infrastructure sector wherein the Government provides support to infrastructure projects that are justified economically but fall short of achieving financial viability.

While the plan is to utilise the proceeds from taxes on medical devices to this end, the question is, as the widely-used medical devices and equipment are covered by National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority regulations, thereby limiting the source of tax and fund, how will the fund create a corpus to help the private partners? Besides, whether the support will be one-time or funds will be released from time to time is not yet clear. A one-time support may be good to boost the physical infrastructure of setting up the hospital but sustaining quality healthcare delivery may need more than that.

Therefore, it brings us to an even bigger concern — operational viability, that helps sustain a hospital in the longer run. While Viability Gap Funding and other aids from the Government can help build the infrastructure, its purview is limited till the time the hospital becomes operational and starts delivering its services to the people at the Government-approved rates.

However, private partners have found the rates proposed for surgeries and other medical procedures unviable and no common ground has been achieved so far. If we want Ayushman Bharat to achieve its full potential, it is time to take this bull by its horn.

5,14-2-20,Revitalise farmers’ cooperatives to grow incomes,"Associations can grow as viable, member-controlled, self-sustaining businesses if they constantly work on reshaping the interaction of their members with themselves

Small farmers are the key to ending poverty and hunger and promoting sustainable development. But they are among the most underserved population and are highly susceptible to food and nutrition insecurity. They often lack basic tools and new technologies and don’t have networks to access them, the financial services to afford them, or the markets to profit from investments in them. They are plagued by low productivity and lack access to quality farm inputs such as good seeds and fertilisers, training and capital and technology and knowledge that can make their enterprises commercially viable.

Fragmentation of land holdings has left growers with shrinking farms that are too small to be remunerative. They have poor access to credit and irrigation, which makes it difficult for them to make their scanty land yield a decent income. A tenth of our farmers are landless. They are forced to contend with a cycle of low investment, poor productivity, low value- addition, weak market orientation and depressed margins.

The last few decades have witnessed shrinking of employment in rural India. Rural-to-urban migration is an inevitable socio-economic reality, especially for those unable to generate a meaningful livelihood from rural resources. Rural areas typically face several developmental impediments: Small land holdings, low savings and capital formation, limited market access, low levels of human development and a young population alienated from farming and other rural occupations. They need solutions tailored to their needs and problems.

One of the ways to mitigate rural distress and promote a farm revolution is to design a livelihood and development strategy that entails collectivising and strengthening primary producers among small farmers through Food Producer Organisations (FPOs) and integrating them into an inclusive value chain to provide end-to-end support. This mutual aid organisation, whose members pool their expertise and part of their savings, helps the members achieve more together than they can alone and becomes self-propagating in the course of time. It confers greater bargaining power, better market and price discovery, access to credit and insurance and sharing of assets and costs. The FPOs are owned and governed by shareholder farmers and administered by professional managers. They adopt all the good principles of cooperatives and the efficient business practices of companies and seek to address the inadequacies of the cooperative structure. The best way for these organisations to leverage their collective strength is through a full value chain from the farm to the fork. The underlying principle that the value chain follows is similar to that of the full stack approach. This approach makes the sponsor, catalyst or promoter responsible for every part of the experience. In the context of agriculture, the full stack approach includes helping farmers identify what to grow and how to grow it, what technology to use and when and where to sell at what price. The farm-to-market initiative encourages smallholder farmers to use technology to collectively transport and sell their produce. Collectivising significantly reduces transportation costs, saves farmers from having to travel to the market and consolidates their selling power. Moreover, the whole value chain needs to have a business approach in order to make it viable.

Agricultural business companies, private sector financial institutions, primary producer organisations and other stakeholders need to collaborate to structure such functional full value chains to make greater benefits accrue to individual members. It is a sustainable, market-based approach to systematically and incrementally address the barriers that prevent individuals from accessing necessary services. Small producers need to reach the scale necessary for sourcing inputs and services. Apart from the collective strength that group synergy generates, the support structures help in building the capacities of producers to deal with input suppliers, buyers, bankers, technical service providers, development promoting agencies and the Government (for their entitlements), among others. The sponsor of the value chain provides a gateway for primary producers to access resources, information and markets. One of its important roles is linking them to reliable and affordable sources of financing to meet their working capital, infrastructure, development and other needs. The collective works to reorient the development and funding ecosystem to make it more responsive and relevant to the needs of small producers. It also works towards strengthening an enabling environment by influencing and orienting policies in this direction.

The extension services include lengthening farmer capacity through agricultural best practices for enhanced productivity, agronomic advice, fostering connections to local farm financial services, training on methods of application of bio-fertilisers and pesticides, modern harvesting techniques, appropriate integrated pest management, integrated nutrient management and access to optimal environmental practices and regionally-appropriate crops for planting. The key benefit is the marketing support that links producers to mainstream markets through aggregation of subsistence-level produce into economic lots that can significantly raise the share that peasants get of the money people pay for their food. The success of a collective hinges on many actors: The technical support it receives, its institutional base, composition, land access and cropping patterns of members and adaptation of the model to the local context. The elite farmers are significantly more likely to participate than the less privileged. Moreover, the better-off often become administrative members and use services substantially more to them than to rank-and-file members. The collectives, therefore, positively affect household welfare for elite members but impact is lower for rank-and-file members. It is, thus, necessary to strengthen democratic processes in these institutions.

Evelyn Huang, a celebrated design thinking trainer in American financial sector, who believed in “reimagining the way 60 million people interact with their money”, implicitly suggested that the design of cooperative enterprises should be about constantly reimagining how thousands of potential members interact with their cooperative so that the process imparts strength and vitality to the latter. It found that the failure of cooperatives is often rooted in the inability of their promoters to understand this interaction.

While FPOs remain the most trusted allies for farmers, they need to be revitalised by infusing modern design features without diluting their traditional ethos and philosophy. In the light of our learning, we need to revisit the model and harness the basics; tweak designs of traditional structures instead of reinventing the wheel. Experience tells us that continuous training, capacity-building and member-awareness programmes can reinforce the design features and help solidify the relationship between members, field staff, professional managers, financial institutions and directors and build a strong bond that can equip the collectives with the will to fight adversities and exploit opportunities.

FPCs can grow as viable, member-controlled, self-sustaining farmer businesses if they constantly work on reshaping the interaction of their members with themselves. A self-regulatory body designed to protect the interest of FPOs and farmer members can serve a useful purpose. We don’t have to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

6,14-2-20,To drive or not to drive?,"Sometimes even someone like me has to face some deeply existential questions, especially when confronted with something like the new Audi A8L

Should I be honest for a moment, as much as I love driving cars, it is more often than not an extremely stressful activity. And if you drive in India, you know what I am talking about. Indian motorists have taken Gandhiji’s civil disobedience movement to heart and continue to do so even after eight decades of it and seem to have a fleeting semblance of the law. It is better in some cities like the heart of Delhi but every time I cross the border towards Noida, it appears that our roads belie the concept that we are a rule-based nation. Well, believe me when I tell you that Noida is one of the more civilised places to drive in Uttar Pradesh. You might think that I am being unduly negative but as per the statistics, 400 people die on our roads every day. While we do not know how truthful the Chinese government is being about the current contagion, but I don’t see our ministers and bureaucrats moving towards getting law and order into place and on our disorderly roads. Again, some places are better than others.

Enough negativity, the point I’m trying to make is that driving in India, even for someone like me who has to do it as part of my job, can be an extremely strenuous experience. But you cannot really evaluate a car if you don’t drive it. Or can you? Because let me introduce you to the new Audi A8L.

Here are the things you need to know about the fourth-generation of the A8 that the German carmaker has launched in India. It is very long, big, opulent and quite powerful. As far as Presidential cars go, it is extremely well-appointed although unlike the competing Mercedes-Benz S-Class and BMW 7-Series and as a direct result of the diesel emissions fiasco, Audi India has not put a diesel motor in this latest iteration of the car. In fact, when I drove the Audi Q8 in Dubai recently, I spoke with Balbir Dhillon, Audi India’s new boss, and he said that it will be late 2020 at the earliest before Audi brings in a BS6-capable diesel. You can argue that petrol cars are slightly thirstier but when you are spending `1.56 crore ex-showroom on a car, the fuel bill will be a petty change. In a positive though, it is a very nice motor with 340-horsepower that can get the A8 rocketting to 100 kilometres per hour in just 5.6 seconds, which, when you see the size of the car, is quite an achievement.

But here is another thing. Driving such large and expensive cars can be quite terrifying in traffic, especially if you have the proximity sensors on. At every traffic light, the car’s alarms light up as motorcyclists try to inch forward even when there is barely an iota of space. And you feel petrified realising that the paint job on a single panel of this car is going to cost more than a five-year-old commuter motorcycle. Honestly, I end up driving an Audi A8 far more carefully than I would an Audi A3 for example. I drove this car so carefully in fact, that I believe I might even have a future career as a chauffeur if I wanted one.

But then, there was a reason I had requested that Audi send over the A8 with a driver, because when I got into the seat that my friend Siddharth Patankar calls the ‘Sethji’ seat, the one diagonally behind the driver, I realised that the joy of owning an Audi A8L is not in driving it. Yes, it is a fabulous car to drive but a car like this is meant for the Presidents of countries and large corporations and they are not the driving sort. And even if they could, they would not be allowed to drive by their security detail. So, as one does, one sits in the ‘Sethji’ or the Presidential seat, whatever you wish to call it and gets a massage. All cars in this class have massagers, none has a foot massager on the end of the footrest until now. Nice. The Band and Olufsen audio system is brilliant. The interior lighting is extremely soothing. And I particularly enjoyed the pop-up remote controller between the rear seats which can operate all the functions that you need.

Frankly, when you compare the differences between the three cars, you are actually looking at the small things and the Audi A8L does the small things quite nicely. It is a very nice car to look at as well. It is also a very nice car to drive but in India’s traffic and with that foot massager, I’d take the ‘Sethji’ seat anyday.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/to-drive-or-not-to-drive--2020-02-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/to-drive-or-not-to-drive-.html
7,14-2-20,Congress seeks varsity status for R’kela College,"The Congress on Thursday staged a demonstration in front of the ADM office here, demanding upgradation of Government Autonomous College, Rourkela (GACR) to a university and establishment of a Tribal University in Sundargarh district.

Former MLA George Tirkey led the demonstration. Later, a team led by Tirkey submitted a memorandum, addressed to the Chief Minister, to the ADM. The State Government has recommended a list of seven colleges for upgradation to to university. But unfortunately, the name of GACR doesn’t figure in the list. The college deserves to be a university as it has adequate land, infrastructure, PG in 17 streams, MPhil in 3 streams and students intake capacity of 5,000.

Sundargarh is a mineral-rich and tribal-dominated district. While both the State and Union Governments are getting huge amounts of revenue form the district, it is very disappointing that they always neglected the district in education and other sector.

“If a Tribal University is established, education, economic, social and cultural standards of tribals will be enhanced,” claimed the party.

Tirky threatened that the party would intensify the agitation if the two demands are not met soon.

Among others, former DCC president Biren Senapati, senior leaders Debabrata Bihari, Prabhati Mishra and Kailash Sahoo, youth leaders Prasant Sethy and Rohit Joseph Tirkey, Mahila leader Nirupama Baliarsingh and Seva Dal leader Vinod Rout and students from different colleges were present.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/congress-seeks-varsity-status-for-r---kela-college.html

10,14-2-20,‘Accord tiger reserve tag to Sunabeda-Khariar forests’,"When tiger population in Odisha is not increasing impressively, the delay of almost 22 years in according status of a tiger reserve to the Sunabeda-Khariar sanctuary both confounding as well as perplexing, said the Wild Orissa in a memorandum to CM Naveen Patnaik.

Notably, the forum has been continuing a sustained campaign since 1990 for inclusion of the high potential forests of Sunabeda and Khariar under the Project Tiger Scheme.

The field findings from survey conducted by the Wild Orissa since 1997 brought up excellent prospects for a potential tiger reserve encompassing forests of Sunabeda Wildlife Division and Khariar Forest Division in Nuapada district. Reports of migration of wildlife between Sunabeda plateau and Udanti forests in Chhattisgarh were obtained. The then Chief Wildlife Warden had during 2002, basing on the findings and sustained demand, requested the Project Tiger Directorate to notify the Sunabeda Tiger Reserve.

During 2003 at the National Symposium on Conservation of Wild Tigers, held at Bhubaneswar, inaugurated by the then Governor of Odisha, a very strong recommendation for the Sunabeda-Khariar Tiger Reserve was made.

Further a detailed proposal was sent by the State Government during 2004, where field findings by Wild Orissa, especially those of justifications for including Sinapalli-Patdhara forests of Khariar Forest Division and factoring the forest corridor for migration of Wild Buffalo Bubalus arnee from Udanti to Sunabeda were incorporated. The proposed TR was for 956.17 km2 (longitude - 82°20'0"" to 82°34'48"" east and latitude 20°06'0"" to 20°44'0"" north), in Nuapada district bordering the State of Chhattisgarh to the west of Odisha, and included the Sunabeda Sanctuary (591.75 km2) and the Patdhara forest block to its south (364.42 km2).

Fortunately, in the 3rd meeting of the National Tiger Conservation Authority [a new body from the erstwhile Project Tiger Directorate], held in May 2008, in-principle approval was given for the Sunabeda- Khariar Tiger Reserve, Shahyadri Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra, Pilibhit Tiger Reserve in Uttar Pradesh and Ratapani Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh, basing on the proposals sent by the concerned State Governments earlier and the concerned State Governments were asked to submit final proposal delineating the 'core' and 'buffer'.

""Unfortunately, it was only during 2016, after a lapse of full eight years, that the State Government of Odisha finally proposed an area of 1083.098 sqkm for the Sunabeda-Khariar Tiger Reserve consisting of 600 sqkm of Sunabeda Wildlife Sanctuary and 483.098 sqkm of forests under the Khariar Forest Division,” the memorandum said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---accord-tiger-reserve-tag-to-sunabeda-khariar-forests---.html
11,14-2-20,Fake ITDA official held for duping 2 tribal vendors,"The Commissionerate police have arrested a person for allegedly duping two tribal vendors of over Rs 1 lakh during the recent Adivasi Mela-2020 in the city in the guise of an official of the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA).

The accused Lakshman Panda, a resident of Dharakote in Ganjam district, was working as a security guard and staying in Old Town here.

The two cheated tribal vendors of Koraput district, Shashi Paligudia and Damei Nayak, were allotted a stall at the tribal fair.

43,14-2-20,Forums concerned over abnormal mines bidding,"While the most abnormal, conspiracy-driven iron ore auctions with premiums as high as 135 per cent for the mines in Odisha have widened ample scope for a massive mining scam, the Citizens’ Action Forum (CAF) and the Janmat (Joints Action Network of Mines Affected Territory in an urgent meeting declared to work as the watchdog. They urged the Government to immediately clarify about the aggressive bidding and possibility of mining scam.

""The aggressive biddings with an aim to loot the State's precious iron ore are the reasult of a nexus between a few industrial houses, close to the power corrider, political leaders, bureaucrats and mines contractors,"" said secretary CAF CR Sahu.

The first block that was auctioned for Nuagaon mines of 792.93 MnT reserves was won by JSW Steel Ltd with 95.2 per cent bidding for the block. The second block was auctioned for Narayanaposhi mines with 190.6 MnT reserves and was also won by JSW Steel with its bid at 98.55 per cent. The JSW Steel bagged the 14th iron ore block in auction by committing to pay 110 per cent of the sale to the State Government for Jajang in Keonjhar district. The Thakurani(reserves 180 MnT), fetched a premium at 107.55 per cent and was won by ArcelorMittal. The Balda iron ore (reserves 210.17 MnT) was retained by Serajuddin and Co. at a premium of 118.05 per cent. Shyam Ore even bagged the Jilling-Langalota iron ore block in Keonjhar district by committing to pay 135 per cent of sale to the Odisha Government. The Tata Steel, Steel Authority of India Limited and JSPL have not been bidding aggressively, sources said.

This premium is a percentage of the price of the iron ore that is set by the Indian Bureau of Mines each month for di?erent States and grades. The premium will be taken by the State. So Serajuddin and Co. which owned at a premium of 118.05 per cent will pay 118.05 percent of the monthly value of the IBM set price of iron ore to the State Government. This will be on per tonne of iron ore sold by the company.

Apart from the premium , the new owners will pay to the State Government a royalty of 15 percent of base price, DMF fund contribution 30 percent of royalty and National Mineral Exploration Trust of 2 per cent of royalty that will be charged separately on the base price. Premium and royalty will be charged on sales of iron ore, sources added.

The high premiums will lead to illegal minning, unethical market manipulation, rate fixing and other massive mines corruption. Since many of the large companies are emerging as the winners, they will become the new price makers in the market and the ultimate burden will pass to the consumers, the CAF and JANMAT alleged.

The forums expressing grave concern over the manipulated system of iron ore minning business in the State, urged the Government to act immediately to ensure the interest of the State and the people was protected.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/forums-concerned-over-abnormal-mines-bidding.html

45,14-2-20,‘Implement Mandal recommendations’,"Former Union Minister Srikant Kumar Jena in a letter to Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Thursday requested him to immediately implement the Mandal Commission recommendations.

Jena stated, “The State Government after a delay of 25 long years decided to form an OBC Commission. This displays your ‘sincerity’ towards the development and rights of 54 per cent people of the State!”

Jena urged the Chief Minister to immediately implement 27-per cent reservation for OBCs in the education and job sector. Besides, he asked the Chief Minister to ensure 38.5-per cent reservations for Dalit and Adivasi students in the higher education (medical, engineering) sector.

Due to non-grant of reservation for these classes, while 10,000 OBC students have been deprived of becoming doctors, another 20,000 have been deprived of becoming engineers, he claimed.

Recently, the Supreme Court in a judgement said, “Reservation is not a fundamental right.”If the States want, they can give reservation or they won’t.

46,14-2-20,Fresh auctions: Merchant mining firms left behind,"While the mines auction in Odisha is going on, the Government is targetting a huge revenue of Rs 75,000 crore out of this. Big mining houses like Rungta, EMIL and Alluwalia have failed to retain any of their mines in the recent auctions while most of merchant mining companies will be out of mining business after the fresh mining auctions.

In the recent biddings this week, Nadidihi Iron mines with an estimated reserve of 20.48 million tons has been bagged by Sociedad De Formento Industrial Pvt Ltd, a Goa based company at a premium as high as 141.25 percent. Pattnaik Minerals Pvt Ltd bagged Mahulsukha iron and manganese mines in Koida circle at a premium of 92.70 percent and KN Ram &Co retained Roida II iron mines at a premimium of 90.90 percent. Also Yazdani steel has bagged the Rungta’s Kolmong mines, Vishal LPG bagged Nadidihi freegrade mines and Ghanashyam Mishra has been able to retain its Gorumahisani iron ores in recent bidding auctions. Sirajuddin & Co has bagged the Balda iron ore mine at a premium of 118.05 per cent, Arcellor-Mittal has bagged the Thakurani mines at a premium of 107.5 per cent, Syam Ores was top bidder of 135 percent premium for Jilling iron mines.

The ore prices of iron and manganese are expected to soar high immediately after the auction due to the high bidding prices and merchant miners will find it hard to compete with the market which is to remain in hands of mega steel producers. The gap between the import price and domestic price of ore will close up encouraging imports of ore by iron and steel users without mines, experts opined.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/fresh-auctions--merchant-mining-firms-left-behind.html
47,14-2-20,City Ambulance Corridor still a far cry,"Four years after the Commissionerate police proposed to design a green corridor in Bhubaneswar for hassle-free movement of ambulances, the project is yet to see light of the day.

Many lives have been claimed due to obstruction in movement of emergency vehicles and ambulances and many Police Commissioners have been reshuffled during the period. However, no initiative has been taken up by the Government and the project still appears a distant dream in the city.

In 2015, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik had formed a committee and a sub-committee to formulate plan for setting up a green corridor for movement of ambulances on the roads in traffic congested city. While a panel was set up comprising officials of Commissionerate Police, NHAI, Public Works and BMC as members, the sub-panel had the members from private hospitals, police, IT and 108 Ambulance services.

Reports said that after several meetings, it was decided to instal GPS in private ambulances for which the vehicles could move freely without hindrance with help of police control room.

However, the issue came to the fore pertaining to steps taken by the Government on basis of the committee reports for a dedicated corridor following an incident on Tuesday when a 5-year-old boy carried in ambulance died due to alleged traffic jam.

According to reports, the patient was being shifted from the Capital Hospital to a private hospital after his condition deteriorated. The ambulance got stuck in traffic and took over an hour to travel a 13-km stretch on Jaydev Vihar-Nandankanan road that proved fatal for the ailing child.

Sources said that the life of the patient could have been saved if there had been a dedicated passage for ambulances.

Notably, there are 120 private ambulances and more than eight 108 Ambulances plying on the city road. While the 108 ambulances are already equipped with GPS system, the committees had stressed on installing the satellite-based radionavigation system in the private ambulances.

Currently, the special corridor on roads exists in cities like Chennai, Bengaluru and Gurgaon for hassle-free movement of the ambulances as well as other vehicles providing emergency services to reach the hospitals for timely medical attention.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/city-ambulance-corridor-still-a-far-cry.html

“It is also observed that such electrical installations are being done on the carriageway or on the shoulders of the road, which restricts the future expansion proposals of the roads,” the letter stated.

53,14-2-20,23 criminals held after deported gangster Buddha spills beans,"In less than six months after the gangster Sukhpreet Singh Dhaliwal alias Buddha was arrested by the Interpol in Armenia and deported to India, the Punjab Police on Thursday claimed to have arrested 23 criminals and recovered 36 weapons from Ferozepur and adjoining states of Haryana and Rajasthan on the basis of information revealed by him.

Budha, who was operating as a self-styled head of the Davinder Bambiha gang, was deported from Armenia and arrested by the state police at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi, when he landed in November 2019. He was wanted in over 20 cases of murder, robbery and demanding ransom in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.

The revelations made by him during interrogation led the police to solve numerous untraced heinous crimes in Punjab besides nabbing many criminals as a follow-up, said the state Director General of Police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta on Thursday.

The state police chief said that further investigation into the cases related to the recently arrested ‘A’ category gangster Budha, the Punjab Police has arrested 23 accused and recovered of 36 weapons from them during raids in Ferozepur range and adjoining states of Haryana and Rajasthan.

Gupta said that a major crackdown on the illegal supply of weapons by unscrupulous weapon dealers had led to recovery of 30 weapons from various criminals arrested. These included 14 DBBL 12 bore, four SBBL 12 bore, five 32 bore pistols, one 45 bore pistol, three 30 bore pistols, one 25 bore pistol and two carbines.

Following the recovery of these illegal weapons, four shops of gun dealers were sealed, several gun house dealers have been booked and thorough investigations are underway. “Further operations are in progress to identify and crack other links of these accused,” he said.

LINK TO TARGETED KILLINGS

Following a disclosure by Budha, the Punjab Police in a joint operation with the Anti Terrorist Squad of Uttar Pradesh arrested Ashish of Meerut on January 30. Ashish was the main supplier of illegal automatic weapons used by the criminals to commit murders, extortions, kidnappings for ransom and other crimes.

Gupta said that Ashish was introduced to Budha by Dharminder Gugni, who is one of the main accused in the cases of target killings of Brigadier Jagdish Gagneja, an RSS office-bearer, and other Hindu religious leaders in Punjab.

Ashish was also wanted in the targeted killings cases and being investigated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).

He was arrested for the first time for his alleged involvement in smuggling of 120 crates of illicit liquor and then nabbed by the Punjab Police in an NDPS case, in which he got a 10-year imprisonment in 2012. He was sent to Nabha jail, Patiala, where he developed special friendship with Dharminder Gugni, Sukha Kahlwan among others who were also lodged in same jail at that time.

After his release from jail, he jumped bail in 2014, but remained in touch with Gugni and started supplying illegal weapons to him and most wanted criminals like Jaggu Bhagwanpuria, Davinder Bambhia, Sukha Kahlwan, and others. These criminals had been using the weapons in gang wars, murders, extortions, kidnappings etc in Punjab since 2014.

Investigations further revealed that Ashish had supplied a large number of illegal weapons to various Punjab based criminals, who used them in the Tarn Taran inter-gang wars in 2015, and recently in the murder of Abdul Rashid alias Gudhu in Malerkotla in November 2019.

The weapons supplied to Sukhpreet Budha and his associates were used in attack on Punjabi singer Parmish Verma in Mohali and several other murders, dacoities and extortions committed in Punjab.

Later, his two accomplices, Gurpreet Singh alias Laddi and Neeraj Kumar alias Dhiraj Batta, wanted in 20 and 13 criminal cases, respectively, were arrested. One 0.30 bore and two 32 bore, 36 live cartridges have been recovered from them.

A separate case was registered under the UAPA in Mohali against Ashish and his accomplices.

A special investigation team (SIT), under the supervision of AIG Harkamalpreet Khakh, is conducting the investigation and efforts are being made to recover all illegal weapons by getting the production warrants of criminals in Jails, on whose instructions Ashish had supplied the weapons.

The SIT is also taking the help of UP ATS to track and arrest the persons who manufactured and supplied weapons to .

DEEP NEXUS B/W GUNHOUSE DEALERS AND CRIMINALS

Further interrogation of Sukhpreet Budha also revealed that one Kapil Dev, proprietor of Kapil Arms Company in Jalalabad, was also supplying illegal arms and ammunition to criminals in Punjab for committing murders, dacoities, kidnappings etc in the State.

Disclosures made by Kapil pointed towards a deep nexus between gun house dealers who are procuring illegal arms and ammunition and supplying the same to different criminals in Punjab with impunity.

As many as 14 illegal weapons have been recovered on the revelations made by Kapil from different persons and, accordingly, separate FIRs have been lodged in Fazilka and Ferozepur districts.

Different gun house dealers in Abhor, Jalalabad, Mamdot and Fazilka have been booked and investigations are being carried out under the supervision of Special Investigation Team headed by Organized Crime Control Unit (OCCU) AIG Gurmeet Singh Chauhan.

Notably, Amar Setia, proprietor of Setia Gun House, was earlier involved in the preparation of fake arms licenses case investigated by the CBI and had been sentenced to three years imprisonment and his license had been cancelled.

Apart from his previous role in fake arms licenses, he has been involved in illegal sale and purchase of arms and ammunition without having license to do so.

Similarly, Harish Kumar Rishu, proprietors of Durga Gun House, Abohar, Rahul Gun House, Fazilka and Sandeep Bishnoi of Ellanabad, Haryana and Surinder alias Sumi Godhara of Lalaina, Nohar, of Hanumangarh district in Rajasthan, have been arrested for illegal sale and purchase of arms and ammunition.

STATE-WIDE AUDIT WORKING OF ARMS DEALERS, LICENSING BRANCHES

Punjab police has launched a state-wide audit of the working of arm dealers and licensing branches to check stock, sale and purchase of the arms.

The decision came after large-scale discrepancies and loopholes were noticed in the stock, sale and purchase of arms and ammunition by arms dealers and licence holders. A state-wide audit of working of arms dealers and licensing branches is also being carried out by the state police, said the DGP.

WHO IS BUDDHA?

A native of Kussa village of Moga district, Budha gained notoriety as one of the biggest names in crime in Punjab, along with gangster Vicky Gounder.

In 2018, he had fled the country after the State Government launched a crackdown against gangsters. As part of the campaign, Punjab Police had arrested and killed gangsters in encounters, including Gounder, and Prem Lahoriya.

His first major crime involved the killing of a man in his village on March 20, 2011. A court arrested and convicted him of murder on August 5, 2015.

In 2016, he jumped parole after which he was declared a proclaimed offender. On January 17, 2017, he killed a businessman in Dabwali followed by murder of another Jaito trader Ravinder Pappu Kochhar in July the same year.

In June 2017, Buddha and another gangster killed a poultry farm owner Hardev Singh Gogi Jatana at Rampura Phul in Bathinda. They had claimed that this was a revenge killing as Hardev had given a tip-off to the police about Bambiha’s whereabouts. Budda had claimed responsibility on Facebook for killing Maninder Pal Bittu, an activist of Dera Sacha Sauda, who was murdered inside Nabha Jail.

He was the mastermind behind the attack on Punjabi singer and actor Parmish Verma in April 2018. He was also allegedly behind threats to other famous Punjabi singers and actors, including Gippy Grewal, and businessmen over WhatsApp. A well-known Punjabi singer Karan Aujla was attacked in Canada on his directions.

Budda was also said to be in touch with pro-Khalistan elements. Notably, a few pro-Khalistan activists in Europe had posted about his arrest by the Interpol in Armenia on August 8 last year on Facebook, calling him ‘a strong voice for Khalistan in Punjab’.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/23-criminals-held-after-deported-gangster-buddha-spills-beans.html

57,14-2-20,Inter-district sex racket busted,"An inter district sex racket was busted by Palamu police where in police remanded in judicial custody eight people late in the evening of February 12.

Five out of eight people were sent to Central jail Daltonganj are women. Residents of the town have congratulated police for this discovery of under belly sex trade here.

Sources said SDPO Sadar Sandip Kumar Gupta and his team of police officials namely Anand K Mishra (inspector cum officer in charge Town police station) Priyanka Anand (OC Mahila police station) R Yadav ( ToP 1) Sudheer Kumar ( ToP 2) and a few probationer SIs of police were on the trail of this sex racket here in the town over the last 6 weeks or so.

Sources said what the police have so far unearthed is just a tip of the iceberg as sources said there are more faces and more hands behind this sex racket.

Gupta said, “About half a dozen districts like Ranchi, Latehar, Garhwa, Palamu etc are involved in this flesh market. There is a big network. We have been able to expose it. Eight have gone to jail. We are still working on this. There can be many more behind this racket.”

Gupta said, “Our team worked too silently. It did not make any noise. The racket was running even from private residential houses. It was a difficult job for police to expose it as any noise over it would have painted that locality in too bad and poor light. We were too cautious and careful.”

Sources said the culture of sex marketing which one finds in beauty parlour or massage parlour of big cities is not here. Sources said sex is bought and sold still in its old traditional style. Poverty, not luxury is the major cause said SDPO.

Gupta said, “Police have so far found no trace of any school or college going girl doing this obscene work. We have also not found so far any evidence to suggest that girls living in private lodge/government hostel etc are any involved in it.”

He agreed that rural and urban girls and women are definitely involved in it. As regards rural women’s involvement in this immoral trafficking Gupta said, “The age group of rural fair sex indulged in this trade is between 22 to 45. Most of them are married. Their husbands are away from homes for earning livelihood and come homes after 6 months or 9 months or even after a year. Their absence spurs these married women to get in sex sale for cash.”

Gupta said some profiles readied by our team found widows too in this sale purchase of sex who do so to meet their daily needs of living as there is none to support them any financially.

He said the sex purchase - sale has many components like rent of room/ house where sex is provided, commission to pimp, charging from the customer, wages to girls/ women who sleep with males etc.

He said a woman/girl who so sells her body gets not beyond 500 rupees, while the major share of money gets down to others like racketeer, pimps etc.

Police have seized used condoms, unopened packets of condoms, butts of burnt cigarettes, empty bottles of wine, disposable glasses too from the scene where this sex crime was done.

A lawyer not willing to be identified said such a case where an adult woman so sleeps with an unknown man all for money to live on is a matter of consensual sex and hence police will have to work too harder to prove the case that this immoral trafficking was harming the conscience of the society.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/inter-district-sex-racket-busted.html

After all, Marandi's JVM, a regional party, has largely been punching below its perceived weight in successive elections. The JVM could win just three of the state's 81 assembly seats. Sources said that Marandi will be either given the post of leader of opposition or state president.

If Marandi's political fortunes are at the bottom, the BJP too is facing its worse of times in Jharkhand. Because of the defeats of saffron stalwarts such as former CM Raghubar Das, former Speaker Dinesh Oraon and party chief Laxman Gilua in the recently concluded Assembly polls, the party is faced with a leadership vacuum.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp--jvm-set-to-make-marandi---s----ghar-wapsi----grand-affair.html
61,14-2-20,"Mixed reactions on HRD directive of ‘No homework for Std I, II’","In accordance to a directive issued by the Ministry of Human Resource Development which stated that schools of any medium cannot give homework to students of standard of I and II, while on one hand some schools in the State capital don’t give much homework some others burden the children with too much of it.

“My son goes to St Mary’s School and is in class II. There is no doubt that the school is very nice but the syllabus is very tough for such a small child and there is too much pressure. Before the exams, tests are conducted on a regular basis and homework is also given daily. There are as many as 10 subjects taught in class I including social studies, general knowledge and computers,” said a mother on the condition of anonymity.

Delhi Public School Principal Dr Ram Singh totally supports the directive issued by the Ministry. “Children of this age should be taught using tools and playing games instead of burdening them with homework. Emphasis should also be given on teaching through playful experiments, which will also help forming a strong base for the child. As far as the weight of the school bag is concerned, there is a scheme of removing books and introducing tablets. The school has to maintain uniformity and this will only be only be possible if all the parents agree to it,”

“There are many schools in Ranchi, which don’t give any homework while some others do not follow the same. Before the beginning of the next academic session, an awareness drive will be conducted for the parents. Giving homework to small children is a very serious matter and the All School Parents Association will ensure that all the schools follows this directive and also implements this at the earliest,” said Ajay Roy, National General Secretary, Federation of Parent’s Association.

Former Chairperson Jharkhand State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (JSCPCR), Aarti Kujur said that the directive issued states that students of class I and II should be taught using easy learning techniques and not burden them with books. “Efforts need to be made to develop the child’s interest in a subject.

This is very good step taken by the Ministry and this will help in decreasing the undue pressure on the child. This needs to get implemented in the State at the earliest.”

“My son goes to St Xavier’s School and is presently is class III. Even in standard III, he still does not get much homework. In class I and II, he would seldom get any homework. The school gives holiday homework which includes writing a certain number pages which is in a way is acceptable as it helps in the child busy during the month long break,” said Brinda.

Bridgeford School Principal Seema Chitlangia is of the opinion that the homework given should be such that the child is able to complete in 30 minutes.

“Children need not be burdened with it. With so much influence of digital media and phones, this will also ensure that parents spend some quality time with the child which is very crucial at this age,” she said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mixed-reactions-on-hrd-directive-of----no--homework-for-std-i--ii---.html

63,14-2-20,Alam urges farmers to become self reliant in Lac cultivation,"State rural development and parliamentary affairs minister Alamgir Alam on Thursday stressed on production of lac to create employment saying that State Government is ready to cooperate with Centre for setting up a lac board. Alam said that marketing and branding of the lac produce would be undertaken by the State Government in larger scale so that farmers get rich dividends.

Alam said, “From lac not only bangles and gum can be produced, but it has also medicinal value as lac can be used in medicines. Farmers can become self reliant if they go for lac production in large scale.” Alalm, along with Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth, Khijri MLA Rajesh Kachaap and others, was present at the two day farmers’ fair cum technical exhibition at Indian Institute of Natural Resins and Gums (IINRG) (formerly Indian Lac Research Institute (ILRI), Namkum.

He said, “Farmers can become self reliant if they have proper knowledge of crop, time of cultivation sowing of seeds, requirement of water for different crops, use of bio fertilizers and others. As Jharkhand’s weather suits lac cultivation farmers can even go for lac cultivation.”

Presently lac cultivation is carried out in Ranchi, Simdega and Khunti areas, but it can be grown in other parts of state too. Echoing the views of Alam, Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth said that use of lac is multifold in diet, medicine, colour and others. He said, “Presently 25 lakh tonnes of lac is produced in country, out of which Jharkhand accounts for 12 lakh tones of lac, rest it is produced in Chhattisgarh.”

IINRG director KK Sharma said that IINRG formerly Indian Lac Research Institute has been working on lac production for around 100 years. Sharma said that through lac production and its export country earns nearly around Rs 300 to 400 crore of foreign reserve. The IINRG carries out all aspects of lac research and development and other natural gums & resins.

Realising the strategic importance of lac, the then Imperial Govt. of India constituted the Lindsay- Harlow Committee in 1920, to look into all aspects of the country's lac trade and its development. On the suggestions of this Committee, lac merchants organized themselves into the Indian Lac Association for Research, under the aegis of which, the foundation stone of Indian Lac Research Institute (ILRI) was laid at Ranchi on September 20,1924.

Vij conducted inspection there for about an hour and found several irregularities as well as negligence of policemen on duty.

Talking to The Pioneer, the Home Minister said, “I have inspected civil line police station, Rohtak and suspended six policemen including SHO for their negligence on duty.”

Police source said the Home Minister found many complaints unattended. The SHO apparently received the complaints but had not maintained it in the register book. Large numbers of complaints received at Police Station were unattended.

In the course of inspection, it was also found that two loaded carbines and a pistol were found in one of the rooms of the police Station. As per rules, these weapons should be kept in the store room rather than in an unattended room. ""Under such condition, anyone could misuse these weapons,"" a source said.

Sources said that the Home Minister came to Rohtak to attend a meeting with the officers of different departments. After the meeting was over, his convoy suddenly reached a Women's Police Station.

However, he did not go inside the Women's Police Station. After getting down from the car there, he reached the Civil Line Police Station adjacent to the Women's Police Station after a woman policeman had complained to him about irregularities in Civil Line Police Station.

On reaching the police station, he went directly to SHO and then to Munshi. The Home Minister first searched the files and then inspected other rooms including barrack number 11 and 12. Complaints were found in unclaimed condition from inside the table placed in barrack number 11.

SHO Naresh Chand could not give any satisfactory answer on why the complaint was kept there instead of being put in the register or registering an FIR on the received complaints.

Minister went to every room and checked all the offices, rooms and table drawer. He even went to the toilet and did an inspection.

The SHO could not answer why the carbine and pistol were kept in a room instead of keeping it in the store room. Vij reprimanded the SHO and said, “You are running this office as your private police station. You make decisions according to your choice.”

Finally after about an hour, the Home Minister ordered suspension of six policemen, including SHO Naresh Kumar, Munshi Virendra and Head Constable Rakesh.

These include the three policemen who kept the carbine and pistol unattended. He also instructed the SP to send a report to him immediately. The Home Minister also seized some documents from the police station concerned, sources added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/vij-suspends-sho--five-others-after-surprise-raid.html

72,14-2-20,"SC refuses PIL seeking CBI investigation, asks petitioner to move HC","Hours after the Supreme Court declined to entertain a plea seeking a court-monitored CBI probe into the alleged molestation of students during a cultural festival last week at the all-women Gargi College, the petitioner moved the Delhi High Court on Thursday. Earlier in the day, a Bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde asked the petitioner lawyer, advocate ML Sharma, who mentioned the matter seeking an urgent hearing, to move the Delhi High Court with his plea.

“Why don’t you go to the Delhi HC. If they dismiss the petition then you come here,” the bench, also comprising justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant, said. The apex court said it would like to have advantage of Delhi HC’s view on the matter. In the SC, the petitioner expressed apprehension that electronic evidence related to the case might be destroyed.

On this, the top court said, “The Delhi High Court can also pass order like the Telangana High Court in the police encounter case to preserve electronic evidence.”

Sharma, in his plea, has sought preservation of all video recordings and CCTV camera footage of the college campus.It has also sought arrest of the people behind the “planned criminal conspiracy”.

Sharma, in his plea, has alleged that it was a planned political and criminal conspiracy hatched in the backdrop of the Delhi elections and no action was taken after the incident.

“It is a clear criminal conspiracy hatched by the political party to deploy accused persons to provoke the Delhi public for voting in their favour. Despite presence of Delhi Police, on February 6, neither principal nor other state authorities tried to stop and arrest the accused persons,” the PIL claimed.

The petition further claimed that “deliberate chants of Jai Shri Ram discloses that it is a political, planned conspiracy” and blamed the chief minister of Delhi for not taking any action against the accused. Besides the security arranged by the college, the area had Delhi Police and paramilitary personnel who were stationed there for the Assembly polls.

According to the police, a case was registered under IPC sections 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention).",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sc-refuses-pil-seeking-cbi-investigation--asks-petitioner-to-move-hc.html

It has been a smooth sailing for the TSR in Uttarakhand so far thanks to the numerical strength the BJP enjoys in the assembly and strict internal discipline of the party. However the recent electoral reverses in different states have alerted the saffron think tank. It appears that the bigwigs of BJP have asked TSR to be more flexible in dealing with the elected representatives and foot soldiers of the party. The Manthan with the MLAs also seems to be the part of the exercise to tread cautiously and keep the elected representatives of the party satisfied. The mythological ‘Manthan’ of sea yielded both ambrosia and the poison, one hopes both of these extracts also emanated out of churning held at the residence of CM but it would be interesting to see if TSR has the fortitude to drink the poison.

Catch 22 situation

When it filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court (SC) against the Uttarakhand High Court decision in the reservation in promotion case, little did the Uttarakhand government know that the action would put it into a tight spot. The order of SC that reservation is not a fundamental right and that the states are not bound to provide reservation in promotions enthused the general category and OBC employees of the state and it was generally believed the triumphant state government would lift the moratorium on the promotions. Things took a different turn when the opposition parties latched on to the opportunity and attacked the Modi government for trying to finish the reservation. The opposition members launched a diatribe on the government in the Lok Sabha which forced the government to issue a statement on the subject. The spectre of inviting ire of the reserved categories has alerted the top leadership of the saffron party and the Union government could do something like it did to overturn the SC order on dilution of SC ST (prevention of atrocities) act. If this happens, the BJP government would surely antagonise the forward castes in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand where they comprise the majority.

Blue eyed boy

In the recent reshuffle of administration, a young IAS officer who is in the good books of CM was handed over the coveted assignment of the heading the administration of Dehradun district. The development evinced interest since the Babu was already overloaded with the assignments considered plum in administrative parlance. Apart from being District Magistrate of Dehradun, the officer is also heading the Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority (MDDA), is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Dehradun Smart City limited and is also discharging duties as additional secretary to the CM. The special affinity the officer enjoys with the CM is being linked with the cartful of coveted assignments to him. Though the officer is considered efficient, the heaping of the many responsibilities on his young shoulders cannot be considered a practical approach especially when all these tasks are fulltime and important assignments.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/candid-notes-candid-notes-2020-02-14.html

Jagga said that Indian embassy in France may be requested to step in and attempt to stall the auction of heritage items. The matter should be probed how the heritage furniture reached beyond the territory of India even after instructions from the Union Ministry of Home Affairs for the preservation of city’s heritage items.

He has also written to UT Adviser Manoj Parida, who is chairman of Heritage Protection Cell on the issue.

A meeting of the Heritage Protection Cell should be convened at the earliest to discuss the upcoming auction and to chalk out a plan to stop it, Jagga added.

Notably, members of Chandigarh Heritage Items Protection Cell have several times expressed apprehensions over the theft of city’s heritage items from various places here and easy flow of these items especially furniture to foreign markets.

84,14-2-20,"Locals demand action against MCD, Ramky Co","The residents of Sheeshambada warned the district administration that they will begin a hunger strike outside the Chief Minister’s residence if no legal action is taken against the Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) and Ramky Company which operates the solid waste management plant at Sheeshambada.

According to one of the locals Satpal Dhaniya, “We suspended our indefinite period protest outside the Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB) on Thursday on receiving assurance from the district administration. We submitted a memorandum and asked the district official to file a case and take legal action against MCD and Ramky Company regarding the improper functioning of the solid waste management and recycling plant or we will commence our hunger strike outside CM’s residence. He has assured us of action in this matter.”

The locals have alleged that there is a huge heap of garbage accumulated inside the waste management plant which is emanating foul smell and pollution in nearby areas.

Besides pollution, the unprocessed garbage is also spreading many disease-causing germs in the area due to which children are regularly falling sick.

Last month, the Leachate Treatment Plant (LTP) was set up to treat the leachate generated from the plant but according to one of the protesting locals, Prem Singh Negi, setting up LTP was of no use because the leachate has already spread in the whole area converting it into a marshy land and it is also getting mixed with groundwater. So it is nearly impossible to treat such kind of waste on such a large scale.

According to another resident Deepa Devi, “In the beginning, we were told that there would be one layer of waste and one layer of soil which will help in the easy decomposition of garbage and hence there would be no smell but later we noticed that every type of garbage is dumped together.

Now this negligence by the management has become a curse for us. Our children have also been affected by this plant. They cannot play outside, cannot go to school without a mask and cannot study in the school without the mask too. I do not know why we are being harassed like this by every department.”

It is pertinent to mention here that the allegations regarding foul smell and disease causing germs have been rejected by the project manager of Sheeshambada waste management plant MA Saify, as according to him there is nothing like foul smell in the area and the locals have made their mind to get rid of the plant despite having no issue in the area caused by the waste management plant.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/locals-demand-action-against-mcd--ramky-co.html

The division bench of chief justice Ramesh Ranganathan and justice RC Khulbe has given the government and the bodies two weeks to submit their reply in the court.

According to the case details, Dehradun resident Akash Yadav had filed a public interest litigation stating that the municipal corporation is not removing the encroachments made on government land, roads and nalas in the city.

Encroachments have been made once again at the very sites from where encroachments were removed in the past. The petitioner stated that on several occasions he had submitted reports to the state government, municipal corporation and the MDDA regarding encroachment not being removed from various areas in the city.

However, neither were the reports heard nor were the encroachments removed, the petitioner has stated.

It is pertinent to mention here that the State Government and departments concerned have undertaken anti-encroachment drives in Dehradun on the directions of the high court. However, apart from some sites, the encroachments and illegal construction in many areas have either returned or remained unaffected.

Besides, the market of industrial hemp will grow considerably in the coming years, so the foundation’s Mission Hemp will also help the states financially in addition to the farmers.

The U-Turn Foundation is also going to work on other projects like Value-Added Products for Agricultural Sustainability (VAPAS) wherein the farmers will be introduced to organic farming with high yields and specialised products of higher value and agrotech through which the gap between Uttarakhand farmers and agripreneurs can be reduced.According to joint secretary of the foundation Vineet Mishra, “Establishing Uttarakhand as a major player in the organic products industry will help and support farmers as well as entrepreneurs of the state.”

“If India is prosperous, Nepal also becomes prosperous, because half of the population of Nepal lives in India. The Indo-Nepal dialogue along with cultural and spiritual heritage of both countries will also take trade between the two countries to a new height,” Yogi said while addressing the second Indo-Nepal bilateral dialogue at his 5, Kalidas Marg residence in Lucknow on Thursday.

The dialogue was held under the aegis of India Foundation, Niti Anusandhaan Pratishthan (Nepal) and Nepal-Indo Chamber of Commerce and Industry (NICCI), Kathmandu.

Addressing the gathering, the chief minister said that it was a great initiative.

“While India and Nepal are two bodies since ancient times, our cultural heritage connects each other. The well being of both countries is linked to each other,” he added.

Yogi said that the credibility of Nepalese people was strong in Indian army and Indian homes. “Nepalese people are in Indian army and their rank varies from a soldier to very senior positions. This is the belief of India and our common heritage is based on these beliefs. Small countries of Europe are moving ahead at a fast pace, then why can Nepal not move forward in this competition,” he said.

The chief minister said that Nepal could become a big power centre and a major hub of tourism. “But it is important to identify hindrance in this and resolve it. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has connected Pashupatinathji with Kashi Vishwanath and Ayodhya has also been connected to Janakpuri,” he said.

Yogi said that if Varanasi was developing into a Smart City, then why should Kathmandu lag behind.

The chief minister said that Nepal had to identify its enemies and friends.

“The Kashi Vishwanath temple has been linked to the employment of locals. Perfumes and incense are being made from flowers and other items offered in the temple and this task is being done by a group of 50 women from villages, which had earlier been suffering due to Naxalism. Similarly, youth are earning lakhs of rupees per month by acting as guides. Nepal has many such temples and cultural heritage. It can be linked to employment,” the chief minister said.

Earlier, BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav said that India and Nepal were very old neighbours and India wanted both countries to move ahead together.

He said that India’s development model was based on two principles — ‘neighbour first’ and ‘we move forward together’.

“India is making rapid progress. We want that our neighbours also get benefited by this progress,” he said.

Addressing the event, Nepal Congress general secretary Dr Shashank Koirala said that Nepal was highly impressed by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for his focus on spiritual tourism.

Last month, lawyers had struck work across the state, protesting against recent attacks on members of their fraternity.

Meanwhile, AICC media wing chairman Randeep Singh Surjewala also attacked the Yogi Adityanath government over poor law and order in Lucknow.

“The chief secretary, DGP and even additional chief secretary (home) are working on ad hoc basis and two officers of the PMO are running the UP government,” Surjewala said, adding that with no permanent officers on important posts, criminals were having a field day and striking at will.

Surjewala charged that corruption was at its nadir as districts and police stations were being sold.

“Yogi has no vision and is only interested in media and publicity. The state has turned into an ‘apradh pradesh’ (crime state) and Yogi government has turned ‘divaliya’ (bankrupt),” he said.

Alleging that the Modi government was conspiring to end reservation, Surjewala charged that the BJP and Sangh Parivar have been anti-Dalit, anti-tribal and anti-Backward Classes for decades, both in thought and in action.

Addressing media persons in Lucknow on Thursday, the Congress leader said that Congress would go to any length to make reservation a fundamental right and end the conspiracy of the BJP.

“A sinister conspiracy has been hatched by the BJP, Modi government and Uttarakhand BJP regime to attack the Constitution and abrogate the right of reservation in government jobs for SC/ST/OBCs. This was evident in the plea taken by Uttarakhand government before Supreme Court in two cases. The BJP government of Uttarakhand argued that there was no fundamental right of reservation in government jobs for SC/STs and it was not a constitutional duty of governments to grant reservations,” he said.

Surjewala said the Uttarakhand government’s plea was unfortunately accepted by the Supreme Court and it said that it was for the state government to decide whether reservations were required in the matter of appointment and promotions to public posts.

“Instead of the prime minister apologising to the country for the conspiracy and correcting the historical wrong being done to SCs/STs/OBCs, the BJP is trying to shift the responsibility by levelling false allegations “ he said.

“Dalits-Adivasis-Backwards victims of exploitation are being denied justice on account of the BJP’s tilled mindset. Under Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the Congress is determined to fight a decisive battle to protect rights of the downtrodden from the onslaught unleashed by Modi-Yogi governments,” he said.

Surjewala said that Congress would also launch a ‘Samvidhan Chaupal’ in all 822 blocks of the state from February 15 to make people aware of the conspiracy.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/priyanka-lambasts-up--govt-over-law--order.html

118,14-2-20,India to highlight mosque construction funding by LeT,"India is set to highlight the funding of a mosque construction in Haryana by Lashkar-e-Tayyeba (LeT) and receipt of foreign funds by controversial outfit PFI as major sources of Islamic radicalisation at a plenary of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to be held between February 16 to 21 in Paris.

A team of officials led by Financial Intelligence Unit-India chief is heading to Paris to attend the FATF meet and lobby at the multilateral body against terror financing.

The FIU-India team will comprise officials from the National Investigation Agency (NIA), Enforcement Directorate, Intelligence Bureau and Ministries of Home and Finance, sources said, adding they have have been tasked to lobby against terror funding and related issues like radicalisation.

Track trail back of funding for construction of Khulafala-e-Rashideen mosque at village Uttawar in Palwal by the NIA in October 2018 revealed that it was allegedly built with the help of funding by LeT.

The Imam of the Masjid, Mohammed Salman, arrested by the NIA, allegedly received Rs 70 lakh from a Dubai-based Pakistani citizen Kamran. Salman is alleged to have received the money through Hawala from Dubai. The NIA is probing the terror funding case and suspects that Kamran was working for LeT and used to provide funds for terrorist activities in India.

Likewise, the Popular Front of India and NGO Rehab India Foundation linked to the outfit are being probed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act by the ED in connection with a case registered in 2018. The agency has claimed receipt of funds to the tune of Rs 120 crore by the PFI and entities related to it are being probed from money laundering angle. The agency also suspects that the PFI used the funds for violent protests against CAA in various states. However, PFI has denied the allegations.

Agencies also suspect that a portion of the PFI funding came from UAE and could have been used for Islamic radicalization.

Meanwhile, sources said the efficacy of Pakistan's decision to send LeT founder and 26/11 terror attack mastermind Hafiz Sayeed to jail remains to be seen as it came just days ahead of FATF review on Islamabad's action against terror networks operating from the country.

A Pakistani court on Wednesday sentenced Sayeed to 11 years' prison in two cases relating to terror financing.

Last year, the FATF asked Pakistan to fully implement its anti-terror action plan by February 2020 or face severe action. Pakistan was already kept under the ""grey list"" of countries by the FATF for failing to contain terror financing.

""The decision (to put Sayeed behind bars) has been made on the eve of FATF Plenary meeting, which has to be noted. Hence, the efficacy of this decision remains to be seen,"" an official said, reacting to the Pak decision on the terror mastermind's sentencing.

India has been pressing Pakistan to take action against terror masterminds involved in cross-border terror attacks including the Mumbai and Pathankot attacks.

The sentencing of Sayeed is also being seen as a Pakistani ploy to keep the US President Donald Trump in good humour as he is visiting India later this week.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/india-to-highlight-mosque-construction-funding-by-let.html
119,14-2-20,Efficacy of Pakistan's decision to send Hafiz to jail remains to be seen: Govt,"India on Thursday said the “efficacy” of Pakistan’s decision on Wednesday to send Lashkar-e-Tayyeba (LeT) founder Hafiz Saeed to jail remains to be seen as it came just days ahead of a global watchdog’s review on Islamabad's action against terror networks operating from the country.

The reaction from officials sources here came a day after a Pakistani court on Wednesday sentenced Saeed, the mastermind of 2008 Mumbai terror attack, to 11 years' prison in two cases relating to terror financing.

The sentencing of Saeed came just four days ahead of a meeting of global anti-terror watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in Paris to review Pakistan's compliance of an action plan prescribed by it to contain terror groups in the country.

Last year, the FATF asked Pakistan to fully implement its anti-terror action plan by February 2020 or face severe action. Pakistan was already kept under the ""grey list"" of countries by the FATF for failing to contain terror financing.

Indian Government sources said it is part of a long-pending international obligation of Pakistan to put an end to support for terrorism and that efficacy of Saeed's sentencing remained to be seen.

""The decision has been made on the eve of FATF Plenary meeting, which has to be noted. Hence, the efficacy of this decision remains to be seen,"" an official source said elaborating on the Government's assessment of the action.

The sources said it is also to be seen whether Pakistan will take action against all other terrorist entities and individuals operating from territories under its control.

India has been pressing Pakistan to take action against all those involved in cross-border terror attacks including the Mumbai and Pathankot attacks.

It has to be seen whether Pakistan brings perpetrators of cross border terrorist attacks, including in Mumbai and Pathankot to justice expeditiously, the sources said.

Hafiz Saeed has been declared a global terrorist both by the United Nations and the US, which put a $10 million bounty on his head. He also heads the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a front organisation for the terror group'

The US has hailed the sentence against him. The conviction ""is an important step forward -- both toward holding LeT accountable for its crimes, and for Pakistan in meeting its international commitments to combat terrorist financing,"" tweeted Alice Wells, the top US diplomat for South Asia.

Hafiz Saeed has spent years in and out of varying forms of detention in Pakistan, sometimes under house arrest, on various charges. For the most part he has been free to move at will around the country, enraging India which has repeatedly called for his prosecution.

His most recent arrest came in July last year. At the time, US President Donald Trump tweeted that he had been detained ""after a 10-year search"". The US House Foreign Affairs Committee also noted then that Hafiz Saeed had been arrested and released eight times since 2001.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/efficacy-of-pakistan-s-decision-to-send--hafiz-to-jail-remains-to-be-seen--govt.html

124,14-2-20,Min clears air on ‘scrapping’ property registration for Rs 1,"Health Minister Banna Gupta on Thursday cleared the air on the speculations about the Government’s plan to do away with registration of property worth Rs 50 lakh or less for a token amount of only Rs 1 for women buyers – a decision taken by the former Raghubar Das-led NDA Government here in 2017 to empower women. He said that the current Government may use the revenue generated through registration for more meaningful purposes.

“We may do away with the stamp-duty-free property registration for women, and use the revenue generated for welfare of more needy groups of the society. We may give that rebate in electricity, water, education and other utility services,” Gupta said while attending a programme at the Ranchi Press Club. The Government, he added, was weighing its options for curtailing unnecessary expenses and filling the Government’s “empty” coffers without compromising with the important welfare schemes.

In June 2017, the state government decided to waive off the 7 per cent charges – 4 per cent stamp duty and 3 per cent court fee – on properties registered on the name of women. The decision was floated as an initiative to empower women in households and encourage families to register properties on the names of their women members. The initiative, though appreciated by commoners, had led to loss to the exchequer.

Finance Minister Rameshwar Oraon had earlier said that the State’s coffers were empty and the Government may discontinue “useless” schemes in order to boost the exchequer. His statement came days after Chief Minister Hemant Soren accused the former Government of wasting the State exchequer’s money extravagantly.

Gupta on Thursday also said that the Government is committed in providing a safe work environment for the fourth pillar of democracy – the media. He said that he will speak to the Chief Minister about providing insurance facility to scribes and ensuring safety for them while they visit unrest-hit places during the course of their work.

The Congress Minister has been among the most vocal members of the recently-expanded Cabinet.

Earlier this week, he asked doctors, hospital authorities and medicine shop owners to not be afraid of officials and directly inform the Minister over WhatsApp if any official demands bribe. On Thursday, he also visited Ranchi Institute of Neuro-Psychiatry and Allied Sciences (RINPAS) to review the state of affairs in the premier mental health facility.

Gupta pointed out that some patients at RINPAS were staying in the institute despite not needing mental health treatment, while many inmates at the tertiary care centre were forced to stay at the facility as their families refused to accept them. “We will inspect RINPAS and see what we can do to improve the infrastructure. I want to serve the people of Jharkhand, and I do not mind even cleaning the filth of patients as the chief of the health ministry,” he said.

The first-time Minister has been frequenting the various Government-run health facilities in the State since taking charge. The State Cabinet recently announced that it would bear the treatment cost of up to Rs.5 lakh for poor and middleclass patients suffering from severe ailments. The decision, he said, was aimed at supporting the families that cannot afford the exorbitant cost of medical treatments.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/min-clears-air-on----scrapping----property-registration-for-rs-1.html

126,14-2-20,Dist Admin set to distribute KCC among 33K farmers,"District administration Bokaro has set a target to distribute KCC among 33,000 farmers under the Kisan Credit Card scheme by 23 February. About 40,000 farmers have been registered as Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) across the district but only 6,913 KCC has been executed by till date, said a district administration official.

On the decree of Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India, Bokaro Deputy Commissioner Mukesh Kumar directed LDM Dineshwar Rana, DDM NABARD Filmon Billung and District Agriculture Officer Rajiv Kumar Mishra to take all necessary steps to achieve the target by 23 February.

Expressing displeasure over the tardy progress in distribution of KCC Bokaro DC executed an order to the officials asking them to clarify the KCC position earliest, informed DPRO Rahul Kumar. “It has been decided to provide KCC loans to 100 per cent farmers registered under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Yojana through banks,” he added.

Administration targeted to distribute KCC among 33,331 farmers within 15 days. DC asked LDM to issue instructions to all the banks in the district and make sure to give KCC to all the beneficiaries by setting up camps at the panchayat level, said DPRO.

A total of 40,224 farmers are registered under PM-KISAN in the district. Out of these, KCC has been distributed only among 06,913 farmers while the remaining 33,311 beneficiary farmers will get their KCCC under this campaign anyhow by 23 February, said DPRO adding “there is also a provision to provide KCC for animal husbandry and fisheries.”

Now it has become much easier to get KCC loan, as there is a simple application of one page. KCC loan can be availed from any bank’s branch only by giving details of land ownership and crop in the application form, said Rana LDM.

He appealed to the beneficiaries to go to the bank and get KCC loan. “All branches (banks) have started receiving KCC applications by setting up camps in their respective areas and working dedicatedly to achieve this goal,” he added.

The KCC scheme aims at providing adequate and timely credit for the comprehensive credit requirements of farmers under a single window, with a flexible and simplified procedure, adopting the whole farm approach, including the short-term credit needs and a reasonable component for consumption needs, through KCC, said the official.

“This also provides insurance coverage and financial support to the farmers in the event of failure of crops as a result of natural calamities, pests and diseases,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/dist-admin-set-to-distribute-kcc-among-33k-farmers.html
127,14-2-20,RaGa takes a dig at BJP over LPG cylinder price hike,"Wondering if the increase in prices of cooking gas was ""revenge"" for the saffron party's crushing defeat in the Delhi polls, the Congress on Thursday demanded that the Government should rollback the LPG cylinder price hike.

For its part, the Mahila Congress held a protest against the steep LPG price hike and submitted a memorandum to the Government demanding a rollback of the increased prices.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also took a dig at the BJP over the price hike by tweeting an UPA-era picture of the saffron party's leaders protesting an increase in prices of cooking gas at the time.

""I agree with these members of the BJP as they protest the astronomical Rs 150 price hike in LPG cylinders,"" Rahul tweeted along with the picture of the protesting BJP leaders, including Smriti Irani.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi takes great pride in the fact that crores of people gave up their LPG cylinder subsidy for the poor and now affording non-subsidised cylinders has become extremely difficult for the citizens, Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev said in a statement.

""It is more shocking that within 24 hours of the Delhi election results (December 11), the BJP government increased prices of gas (LPG). Is this revenge for their crushing defeat?"" she asked.

129,14-2-20,Bengal BJP divided on strategy for 2021 polls,"After the BJP’s defeat in the Delhi Assembly elections, poll managers of its West Bengal unit are divided whether to push its aggressive strategy on the CAA-NRC or mellow it down and lace it with alternative policies of governance.

The BJP that recently suffered a defeat at the hands of the AAP, which won the polls for the third consecutive time on the plank of good governance, is in two minds about its strategy for 2021 Assembly polls in West Bengal.

In West Bengal, the BJP had won 18 out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019 parliamentary polls, while it had swept all the seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi.

“But within a few months, we see that the results are completely opposite in Lok Sabha polls and Assembly polls in Delhi. So we cannot take it for granted that just because we won 18 seats in Bengal, we will also win the Assembly polls.”

“So we need to change our strategy for state elections. It is not necessary that what works for national elections will also work for state polls. Our campaign should not only highlight implementation of CAA and need for NRC. It should also lay similar stress on alternative and better policies of governance,” a senior BJP leader said on condition of anonymity.

Since last year, the demand for NRC to weed out infiltrators and the new citizenship law have emerged as the latest flashpoint in the state, with the TMC opposing them tooth and nail, and the BJP pressing for their implementation.

Another section of the state BJP, considered close to its president Dilip Ghosh, is of the opinion that there is no need for a change in the party’s strategy in West Bengal, as aggressive politics has yielded positive results for the party.

“If you want to counter a party like the TMC, you have to keep up the tempo and your aggressive strategy. It has helped us. Our campaign on the issues of the new Citizenship bill and the proposed NRC had yielded good results in Lok Sabha polls.

“If we change our strategy, it will be considered that we are retreating. This would send a wrong message to our party cadres. Obviously we will have an alternative set of governance policies but that doesn’t mean diluting our campaign over CAA-NRC,” the BJP leader said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bengal-bjp-divided-on-strategy-for-2021-polls.html
130,14-2-20,Kolkata: Aishi Ghosh leads students rally,"Hours after being denied permission to hold a meeting inside the Calcutta University(CU) allegedly at the behest of the Trinamool Congress Government, JNU students’ union president Aishi Ghosh on Thursday led a massive students rally in north Kolkata protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Citizenship Register.

Mainly partaken by the Left students the procession had no flags save the Tri-colour and was joined by a large number of civil society members. Even as Ghosh and other student leaders like Mayukh Biswas led the rally senior Left Front leaders like Surya Kanto Mishra and Biman Bose walked quietly in the rear.

Ghosh later said that the Mamata Banerjee Government should first decide whose cause it was buttressing by refusing to grant her permission to address meetings.

“We had assembled here to address a meeting of students against the divisive policies of RSS and BJP who have slapped the discriminatory CAA and are planning to invoke NRC and NPR. We hear that they (TMC) too has been strongly protesting against CAA and NRC. If that be so then they had no business denying the permission to hold a meeting inside the university. They (Trinamool) should first decide as to whom they are supporting and for whom they are standing in Bengal.”

Another rally of Ghosh had been denied permission at Durgapur on Wednesday. Sources also said that the police have refused to grant permission for a third rally scheduled to be addressed by Ghosh at Jadavpur.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/kolkata--aishi-ghosh-leads-students-rally.html
131,14-2-20,"Shaheen Bagh protesters should agitate against NPR, NRC, says Ramesh","Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh has said people in Shaheen Bagh, epicentre of anti-CAA protests, should agitate against the National Population Register and National Register of Citizens if they are worried that their citizenship is going to be taken away from them.

He claimed that the ongoing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at Shaheen Bagh in New Delhi served the BJP’s “communal interest and also helped communal Muslim interests.”

“I don’t understand what Shaheen Bagh people are protesting about. Are they worried that their citizenship is going to be taken away from them.

That is a legitimate fear. Then they should agitate against NPR and NRC. Why are they only agitating against CAA,” he asked.

“Fine, I understand the emotion and sentiments. Initially (protest) in four days, five days...But after a while, I think it served the BJP’s interest to keep Shaheen Bagh going, it served the communal Muslim interests to keep Shaheen Bagh going,” he said in an interview to PTI.

These protests helped the BJP, but it also helped the communal outfits, Ramesh said.

“And frankly beyond a point of time, I did not go to Shaheen Bagh,” Ramesh said.

Congress leaders Shashi Tharoor and Mani Shankar Aiyar had visited Shaheeh Bagh in January to express solidarity with those protesting against the amended citizenship act. Ramesh, however, hit out at the BJP-led Central government for bringing amendments to the Citizenship Act, claiming it was brought to divide the people on the basis of religion. The Congress party’s stand on the amended Act was very clear, he said.

“The BJP wants to exclude certain communities from the CAA... BJP’s policy is one of excluding Muslims.We want to include everybody. Tamils from Sri Lanka, Christians from Bhutan, Ahamedias from Pakistan... Citizenship should not be based on religion,” Ramesh added.

Citizenship should not be based on religion. That is our fundamental position because that was rejected by our Constitution makers and it violates Article 14 of our Constitution,” Ramesh added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/shaheen-bagh-protesters-should-agitate-against-npr--nrc--says-ramesh.html
132,14-2-20,Jairam: Cong poll debacle in Delhi an ‘unmitigated disaster like coronavirus’,"Calling the Congress’ poll debacle in Delhi an ‘unmitigated disaster like coronavirus’, senior party leader Jairam Ramesh has said it must ‘ruthlessly’ reinvent itself or face the prospect of becoming irrelevant.

The note of caution for the Congress by Ramesh, a former Union Minister known for his outspoken views, came close on the heels of a call by fellow party leader M Veerappa Moily for a ‘surgical’ action to revive the party.

“Congress leaders have to reinvent themselves. Congress party has to reinvent itself if it has to be relevant,” Ramesh, 65, told PTI in an interview here on Wednesday. “Otherwise, we are staring at irrelevance. Our arrogance has to go, even after six years out of power sometimes, some of us behave as if we are still Ministers.” In Ramesh’s view, local level leaders have to be encouraged and nurtured and be given freedom and autonomy.

“The substance and style of our leadership has to change,” said the Rajya Sabha MP who is here to participate in the ongoing Krithi International Book Fair organised by a society controlled by the Kerala Government. On the Delhi Assembly poll outcome, Ramesh alleged that the BJP utilised the anti-CAA protests at its epicentre in Delhi in Shaheen Bagh to “polarise” votes. “In the short run BJP has not won but the result is a disaster for the Congress party also. “It is an unmitigated disaster like coronavirus for the Congress,” he said.

133,14-2-20,"Free bus rides, breakfast in PMK’s shadow Budget","It is a Budget proposal full of irresistible offers which the man and woman in the street will find difficult to say no. Free bus rides to all women in the State, a free and sumptuous daily breakfast with a cup of milk to all students in the Government run schools and climate-smart agriculture to mitigate the effects of climate change on agriculture.

These are some of the mouth-watering proposals which are incorporated in the shadow Budget prepared and presented to the people of Tamil Nadu by PMK, a regional outfit dominated by the Vanniyar community in the State. Since the inception of PMK as a political party, its founder Dr S Ramadoss has made it a point to come out with shadow Budget proposals every year ahead of the presentation of the State Budget.

Dr Ramadoss is a votary of transparent and corruption-free governance. He was the first politician in the State to call for auctioning the quarrying and mining of sand and beach sand along the East Coast of the State which are known for its rare earth minerals like monazite, ilmenite, garnet and other elements. Sand mining and quarrying in Tamil Nadu are sectors enmeshed in corruption and favouritism.

The axis between the mining industry, politicians and bureaucrats is plundering the beach and river sand in the State causing the exchequer losses worth Rs 15 lakh crore every year, according to Daya Devadoss, a mining baron turned evangelist in

Tirunelveli.

The PMK founder has also proposed to create smaller districts for speedier and transparent governance. “The maximum population in each district should not exceed 12 lakh so that the bureaucrats would find them easy to administer,” said the medical doctor-turned-politician.

He said it was possible to create 50 lakh jobs in agricultural and horticultural industries in the next five years. The PMK’s main focus would be to see to it that the water table in the State, especially in areas known for cultivation, goes up.

Whether these proposals would find place in the budget to be presented by Panneerselvam is anybody’s guess. But Ramadoss is confident that these are all projects which could be implemented if the Finance Minister has determination and sincerity.

There is nothing secret about our budget proposals. These are all implementable ideas and missions. If the Government uses some of the proposals, we will be happy because millions of people would be implemented. We are the one and only political party in the State which has been demanding the declaration of Cauvery Delta region as Protected Agricultural Zone.

The AIADMK Government has listened to our demand and we are happy over it,” said the doctor.

“If all opposition parties in the State and elsewhere in the country follow the footprints of Ramadoss and prepare shadow budgets instead of simply lambasting the Budgets, the country stands to gain a lot,” said Dr C Murugadas, professor of economics, Madras University.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/free-bus-rides--breakfast-in-pmk---s-shadow-budget.html

Speaking to reporters in Belagavi, he said, “But, one thing is certain, those (BJP) who were confident of victory in the name of religion, despite campaigning from Prime Minister, Home Minister, several Ministers, CMs, MPs and MLAs, the principles that they believed in did not get the success.

137,14-2-20,Jaishankar's assertion on Nehru sparks twitter war,"A war of words on Twitter erupted on Thursday over External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's assertion, citing a book, that Jawaharlal Nehru did not want Sardar Patel in his first Cabinet in 1947. Among those who responded to the post was eminent historian Ramachandra Guha, who called it a “myth”. Congress leaders Jairam Ramesh and Shashi Tharoor also questioned the Minister’s claim.

Was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Jawaharlal Nehru's initial cabinet list in 1947 was the hotly debated question with Jaishankar citing a new book to claim that Nehru did not want Patel in his cabinet and Guha and Congress leaders denying the argument while hitting out at the Minister.

The Twitter duel, with both sides deploying sarcasm and historical references, began on Wednesday night when Jaishankar put out a post on releasing an ""absorbing biography"" of VP Menon - a senior civil servant who worked closely with Patel - by Narayani Basu. He noted that the book had done ""much awaited justice to a truly historical figure.""

""Learnt from the book that Nehru did not want Patel in the Cabinet in 1947 and omitted him from the initial Cabinet list. Clearly, a subject for much debate. Noted that the author stood her ground on this revelation,"" he said.

This tweet elicited a sharp response from Guha, who said ""this a myth that has been comprehensively demolished by Professor Srinath Raghavan."" The historian also said besides promoting fake news about and false rivalries between the builders of modern India is not the job of the Foreign Minister. ""He should leave this to the BJP's IT Cell,"" Guha retorted.

Jaishankar hit back saying some Foreign Ministers do read books and it may be a good habit for some professors too. ""In that case, strongly recommend the one I released yesterday,"" the minister said.

It did not stop there. Guha then posted a letter from Nehru to Patel dated August 1, 1947. In the letter, Nehru invites Patel to join the first Cabinet of free

India, calling him the ""strongest pillar"" of that Cabinet. ""Can someone show this to Jaishankar, please,"" Guha asked on Twitter. Tagging Jaishankar's 'foreign ministers do read books' tweet, the historian added, ""Sir, since you have a Ph D from JNU you must surely have read more books than me. Among them must have been the published correspondence of Nehru and Patel which documents how Nehru wanted Patel as the 'strongest pillar' of his first Cabinet. Do consult those books again.""

Congress leader Ramesh said in light of the ""fake news"" doing the rounds that Nehru did not want Patel in his cabinet, he would share a series of letters and documents. Ramesh posted Nehru's letter to Mountbatten of July 19, 1947 with

Patel on top of the cabinet list. He also shared Nehru's letter to Patel dated August 4, 1947 with the cabinet list including the latter's name.

139,14-2-20,"Didi not invited, TMC boycotts Metro inauguration","A fuming Trinamool Congress leadership on Thursday boycotted the inaugural ceremony of Kolkata East-West Metro corridor in Salt Lake section after the Bengal ruling outfit complained that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had not been invited in the programme.

The project was inaugurated by Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and attended among others by his ministerial colleague Babul Supriyo and some senior leaders of the BJP.

Senior TMC leader and local MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar and State Minister and local TMC MLA Sujit Bose was however invited to the programme. Both of them decided not to attend the show in protest against what the party leadership called a “filthy exhibition of indecorous the behavior” by the saffron leadership and the Central Government which controls the Metro Railways.

Both BJP sources and Metro authorities however said the Chief Minister had been invited for the programme. “Twice out representatives had visited the State secretariat Nabanna,” Metro sources said only to be promptly contradicted by the TMC leadership which wondered “how if the Chief Minister was invited twice her name did not figure in the invitation card issued by the authorities.”

Trinamool leader and Minister Tapas Roy speaking on behalf of the State Government said “such indecorous treatment is the last thing you can expect during Government-to-Government transactions,” adding other invitees (TMC leaders) from the State Government were right in their decision to skip the programme.

“Can you imagine how the lady who conceived and green-signaled the East-West Metro project during her stint as the Railway Minister of India would be ignored and left out in such a manner… By doing so you are not humiliating the Chief Minister but you are belittling your own (central) Government. It shows the political culture your party (BJP) represents,” the fuming Minister said.

“The East-West Metro corridor project was brainchild of Mamata Banerjee during her tenure as Railway Minister from 2009-2011. It was she who had sanctioned the money in Railway budget. Now, when the project is being inaugurated she has not been invited. This is an insult to the people of Bengal,” Dastidar said.

Reacting to the TMC leader’s decision to boycott the programme BJP State president Dilip Ghosh said that he had information that the Chief Minister seldom attended the programmes hosted by the Centre. This was the reason why she might not have been invited, he said.

Besides, Mamata Baneree should herself consider the precedent she created in the past by showing indecorous behavior to the then State Government, he maintained adding “when she was the Railway Minister she never invited the then Chief Minister Buddadeb Bhattacharjee and now she is raising the same issue of which she herself is guilty.”

Kolkata is the first city in India to have started Metro Railway services way back in 1984. TK Nath the motorman who drove the first tube railway in Kolkata said “I am feeling nostalgic and keen to see a fellow motorman getting the same experience today.”

The new East-West metro which will be opened to public from Friday is the first such project in the country to pass under water. It will run underneath the River Hooghly for a kilometer before reaching Howrah and joining the satellite city with Salt Lake after it is completed.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/didi-not-invited--tmc-boycotts-metro-inauguration.html

The parents of 11 students, studying in fourth and fifth standards, had complained about the 52-year-old headmaster for sexually harassing the girl students, the police said. The school head refused to meet the parents and got himself admitted to the hospital a few days ago, and the parents staged a protest demanding police action against the accused.

As the parents refused to give up, the police took seven of them in the van, even as the headmaster talked to mother of one of the students and expressed regret for his misbehaviour.

Even members of the All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA) and Students Federation of India (SFI) had taken up the issue.

141,14-2-20,Missing data row: FIR against former NRC official,"Hours after Assam’s updated citizenship data disappeared from the website ‘nrcassam.nic.in’, an FIR was filed against a former NRC official for allegedly failing to submit the password to the sensitive document before quitting her job.

Talking to PTI on Thursday, NRC state coordinator Hitesh Dev Sarma said the complaint against former NRC project officer was filed under Official Secrets Act in Paltan Bazar police station here, as she “did not provide the password to the document, despite written reminders”.

“She failed to surrender the password even after tendering her resignation on November 11 last year. She was a contractual employee and no longer authorised to hold the password, after quitting her job. An FIR has been filed against the former NRC project officer on Wednesday for violating the Official Secrets Act,” he said.

Sarma also stated that the NRC office had written to her on several occasions for submitting the password, but did not get any response. “We knew (she had resigned) and, therefore, sent several letters to her for handing over the password. But as she did not respond all these months, we filed a complaint against her yesterday for violating the Official Secrets Act.

“We must know if she has tampered with the sensitive information, after resigning,” he added.

The NRC State coordinator, however, refuted allegations of “malafide intent” involved in the matter.

“This (cloud service provided by IT major Wipro) was not renewed by the earlier coordinator. So, the data went offline from December 15 last year. I assumed charge only on December 24,” Sarma, who had gone on leave for weeks after being appointed the NRC state coordinator, clarified.

He also said that the state coordination committee had discussed the issue in its meeting on January 30 and wrote to Wipro during the first week of February.

“Once Wipro makes the data live, it will be available to the public. We hope that people will be able to access it in the next 2-3 days,” Sarma claimed. Reacting to the development, Wipro had said: “The IT Services Contract was not renewed by the authorities upon its expiry in October, 2019.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/missing-data-row--fir-against-former-nrc-official.html

143,14-2-20,"Banks, Please take your money, says Vijay Mallya","Liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya once again asked the Indian banks to take back 100 per cent of the principal amount owed to them at the end of his three-day British High Court appeal on Thursday against an extradition order to India.

The 64-year-old former Kingfisher Airlines boss, wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering amounting to an alleged Rs 9,000 crores in unpaid bank loans, said the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) are fighting over the same assets and not treating him reasonably in the process.

“I request the banks with folded hands, take 100 per cent of your principal back, immediately,” he said outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London.

“The Enforcement Directorate attached the assets on the complaint by the banks that I was not paying them. I have not committed any offences under the PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) that the Enforcement Directorate should suo moto attach my assets,"" he said.

""I am saying, please banks take your money. The ED is saying no, we have a claim over these assets. So, the ED on the one side and the banks on the other are fighting over the same assets,” he added.

Asked about heading back to India, he noted: “I should be where my family is, where my interests are.

""If the CBI and the ED are going to be reasonable, it's a different story. What all they are doing to me for the last four years is totally unreasonable.”

Lord Justice Stephen Irwin and Justice Elisabeth Laing, the two-member bench presiding over the appeal, concluded hearing the arguments in the case and said they will be handing down their verdict at a later date after considering the oral as well as written submissions in the “very dense” case over the next few weeks.

On a day of heated arguments between Mallya's barrister, Clare Montgomery, and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) counsel Mark Summers, arguing on behalf of the Indian government, both sides clashed over the prima facie case of fraud and deception against Mallya.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/banks--please-take-your-money--says-vijay-mallya.html

Yechury said the Left party workers will launch agitation wherever Trump goes during the tour on February 24 and 25.

""May be in Delhi or in Gujarat, the party activists will certainly protest,"" he said.

The CPI(M) leader said the protests would be held on two counts. ""First, America is putting pressure and (Narendra) Modi is succumbing to completely open up our economy which is the gain they want to achieve in order to give support to Modi on issues like CAA, Article 370 and others,"" Yechury told reporters on the sidelines of an anti-CAA rally here.

""That is the quid pro quo going on, which is not in India's interest. This apart, we will be spending billions of dollars for buying US military equipment, to bail out US economy while destroying our own,"" he said. Replying to a question on the increse in LPG cylinder price, the CPM leader said his party has been protesting against it in many places.

146,14-2-20,6 women among 12 kill youth over seat brawl,"In a disturbing incident, a 26-year-old man was thrashed to death allegedly by 12 fellow passengers, including six women, following arguments over a seat, between the Pune and Daund railway stations on board Mumbai-Latur-Bidar Express on Thursday.

The incident took place after the deceased man — identified as Sagar Janardan Markhad — boarded a crowded second class compartment of the train along with his wife Jyoti, mother and 2-year-old daughter at around 12.45 am. He requested a sitting woman to give space for his daughter.

However, the woman concerned not only refused but she also heaped abuses on Markhad. When Markhad requested the woman not to use foul language, the woman in question would not listen.

As the arguments continued between the two sides, a group of women supporting the woman who was having a verbal duel with the male passenger, joined her and manhandled Markhad. Thereafter, the male family members of the women who were roughing up the male passenger joined the women and beat Markhad black and blue.

Before long, Markad collapsed. Efforts by his wife and mother to revive Markhad failed. Markhad died on the spot. Markhad’s wife pulled the train’s chain thrice. Though the train stopped on all three occasion, it restarted as other passengers did not help Markhad in medical aid. Meanwhile, a passenger called the railway police and informed them about the incident.

At 2 am, the train arrived at Daund station where the police took into custody the 12 passengers who had thrashed Markhad to death. Simultaneously, the police rushed Markhad to a nearby hospital where he declared dead upon admission.

150,14-2-20,"BJP not against freebies, just wanted to make Delhi capable: Gautam","Cricketer-turned-politician Gautam Gambhir on Thursday rued the BJP’s drubbing in Delhi Assembly polls, claiming that the party was unable to convince people that it was not against freebies, but wanted to make the city ‘saksham’ (capable).

Addressing a press conference here, Gambhir deftly made light of references to the BJP performing relatively better in Assembly segments falling under his East Delhi Lok Sabha constituency, stressing on ‘collective responsibility’ for the party’s successes and failures. Gambhir also dismissed as ‘hypothetical’ queries about the perception that the BJP would have fared better against Arvind Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party, had it declared someone like Gambhir as its chief ministerial candidate.

“I congratulate Kejriwal and his party for the stupendous victory. They succeeded in convincing the people about their vision and their agenda which we could not. We were never against freebies. Please look at our party manifesto, where it was clearly stated that amenities that people were enjoying free would not become chargeable in the event of the BJP coming to power,” he said.

Somehow, the saffron party could not find enough resonance with Delhi people, the former cricketer said.

“In fact, we, too, had promised free scooters and bicycles and these would have been disbursed among all residents of Delhi and not just those who had voted for the BJP. We could not explain to them adequately that we wanted to make Delhi saksham and not laachaar (helpless),” he added. The left-handed opener, whose career was marred following a spate of injuries, was in the city for the launch of a ‘cricket scholarship’ programme, which - he claimed - would nurture talent at the first-class level and eventually help the state in having a representation in the IPL.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-not-against-freebies--just-wanted-to-make-delhi-capable--gautam.html

Over the next couple of days there would be several panel discussions, workshops, talks and student debates that are bound to spark off new thoughts and ideas and keep the attending guests engaged.

Some of the issues that would be covered in the panel discussions include ‘Discrimination Law and Minorities’, ‘Gender, Legal Profession and the Courts’, ‘Reforms in the Administration of Justice’, ‘Free Speech, Censorship and Media’, and ‘Accountability vs Independence of the Judiciary’, and the panels would address each of these areas and come up with specific action points and policy recommendations which would be documented. In addition to these there would be panel discussions on laws related to women and children, efficacy of environmental laws and laws on the right to privacy.

Key speakers and panellists who would be presenting their viewpoints at Difficult Dialogues 2020 include Dr Pinky Anand, Senior Advocate, Supreme Court of India and politician, Prof. C.

152,14-2-20,"India plays crucial role in shaping global paradigm on security, trade: President","President Ram Nath Kovind said on Thursday that as a leading power, India played a crucial role in shaping the global paradigm with respect to international security, trade and commerce.

Speaking at a ceremony after presenting ‘Colour’ to the INS Shivaji at Lonavla near Pune, the President said: “India’s rise in the international order has been fuelled by many factors including the capabilities and valour of our armed forces”.

“Today, the geopolitical situation in the world and in the Indo-Pacific in particular demands greater vigilance. I am aware that the Navy has adopted mission-based deployments in the Indian Ocean region,” Kovind said.

Heaping praise on INS Shivaji for imparting technical training of highest standard to marine engineers from the Indian Navy, Coast Guard and friendly foreign countries, Kovind said: “High quality training of marine engineers is crucial for sustained deployments and presence in our areas of interest. The future will also see great diversity in the propulsion systems ranging from conventional to nuclear and electric and hybrid propulsion”.

“Concepts of maintenance will also undergo a paradigm shift with increased requirements on operational availability of platforms. INS Shivaji will need to impart the requisite skills to all trainees to prepare them to meet future challenges,” the President said.

“As INS Shivaji completes 75 years of excellence, let us introspect and reflect on the journey so far and also glance at the future. Technology is leapfrogging to produce autonomous vessels. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are being deployed for decision-making and war-fighting,” Kovind said.

“The training of marine engineers will also need to be tailored to train them to work with evolving technologies, while maintaining competence in the core engineering profession. I am confident that INS Shivaji would impart the skill set required in the future to all trainees passing out through its portals,” the President said.

“I am glad to note that more than two lakh officers and sailors of the marine engineering branch of the Navy, Coast Guard and friendly foreign countries have been trained in this fine institution till date,” he said.

“INS Shivaji has distinguished itself with stellar service to the nation over the years. It has a proud record of professional excellence, and has discharged its responsibilities with distinction,” the President said, he lauded the INS Shivaji’s contribution to the Indian Navy.

“A nation’s maritime interests are usually also linked to its economy and the well-being of its people. I am told about 90 per cent of our trade, by volume, is handled by sea routes. This enhances the role of the Indian Navy not just in national security but also in economic security, and thus in the wider process of nation building,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/india-plays-crucial-role-in-shaping-global-paradigm-on-security--trade--president.html
153,14-2-20,"Fell in love, almost got married: RatanTata revelation on V-Day","Renowned industrialist Ratan Tata provided a rare insight into his personal life on the eve of Valentine’s Day, by disclosing that while he was in Los Angles in the early sixties, “I fell in love” and “almost got married”.

Baring his heart out on a public platform, the Chairman Emeritus of Tata Sons revealed in a post posted on a Facebook page ‘Humans Of Bombay’ as to how he fell in love, “almost got married”, how the 1962 Indo-China came in the way of tying a nuptial knot and “the relationship fell apart”.

Tata was in mid-twenties when he fell in love while he was working for

architecture firm in Los Angles in the early sixties. “After college, I landed a job at an architecture firm in LA, where I worked for two years. It was a great time -- the weather was beautiful, I had my

own car and I loved my job. It was in LA that I fell in love and almost got married,” Tata wrote on a Facebook’s “Humans of Bombay” page.

“But at the same time I had made the decision to move back at least temporarily since I had been away from my grandmother who wasn’t keeping too well for almost 7 years,” Tata recalled.

“So I came back to visit her and thought that the person I wanted to marry would come to India with me, but because of the 1962 Indo-China war her parents weren’t okay with her making the move anymore, and the relationship fell apart,” the industrialist revealed in a post put out on Thursday.

Eight-two-year-old Tata, who has remained a bachelor all his life after having devoted al, his time to build a huge business empire, does not seem to have a regret that he did not marry – an impression one gets from the manner-of-the-fact manner in which he has narrated as how the relationship with the girl whom he fell in love with did not culminate in marriage.

Giving a peek into his childhood, Tata wrote on “Humans of Bombay” FB page: “I had a happy childhood, but as my brother and I got older, we faced a fair bit of ragging and personal discomfort because of our parent’s divorce, which in those days wasn’t as common as it is today. But my grandmother brought us up in every way”

“Soon after when my mother remarried, the boys at school started saying all kinds of things about us -- constantly and aggressively. But our grandmother taught us to retain dignity at all costs, a value that’s stayed with me until today. It involved walking away from these situations, which otherwise we would have fought back against,” Tata wrote. I still remember, after WW2, she took my brother and I for summer holidays to London. It was there that the values were really hammered in.

She’d tell us, ‘don’t say this’ or ‘keep quiet about that’ and that’s where, ‘dignity above everything else’ really embedded in our minds,” Tata stated, while going down the memory lane.

“And she’s always been there for us. It’s difficult now to say who’s right or wrong. I wanted to learn to play the violin, my father insisted on the piano. I wanted to go to college in the US, he insisted on the UK,” Tata wrote.

Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Sanjay Kumar told PTI on Thursday that “the state home department has no objection to the case being entrusted to the NIA”.

Home Minister Anil Deshmukh sought to put the ball in the court of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who belongs to the Shiv Sena, the lead constituent in the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi which also consists of the NCP and the Congress.

Talking to reporters here, Deshmukh, an NCP leader, said “The State agencies were investigating the Koregaon Bhima (Elgar Parishad) case. But, the Centre handed over the investigation to the NIA.

“As Home Minister, my stand was that the Centre should have taken the state government into confidence before taking the decision. We were putting up our stand in the court in this direction. The Chief Minister has the right to overrule my stand.”

The Centre last month transferred the probe in the case from the Pune Police to the NIA, a move then criticised by the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress Government.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/elgar--maha-reverses-stand--says-no-objection-to-nia-probe.html

Barring a stray incident of stone pelting at a bus in Dakshina Kannada district, the bandh was peaceful,police said.

Buses and auto rickshaws plied as usual defying the bandh call given by the ‘Karnataka Sangathanegala Okkoota’, a consortium of organisations in Karnataka.

The organisers of the bandh are demanding implementation of the Sarojini Mahishi report, which recommended that preference be given to Kannadigas in Government and the private sector.

In Bengaluru, city buses plied as usual though most of them ran empty as there were very few commuters.

Auto rickshaws and cabs ran regular services,though one of the auto rickshaw drivers’ associations had supported the bandh.

RK Nagar and surrounding areas, the main trade area of the city, saw normal activity.

A few Kannada organisations took out a rally in the city and their leaders later submitted a memorandum to Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa at his residence, demanding strict implementation of Sarojini Mahishi report. Some of them forced traders to shut shops

In Anekal near Attibele in the city on the Karnataka- Tamil Nadu border, activists reportedly tried in vain to forcibly shut shops and business establishments.

At Pirangipet in Bantwal in Dakshina Kannada district, stones were pelted at a private bus in the morning.

Police said 200 people were detained as a preventive measure to avoid any law and order situation.

Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa had appealed to the outfits to keep their agitation peaceful.

He had also said his government always stood for Kannada and Kannadigas and had initiated measures to implement the Sarojini Mahishi report.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/k---taka--bandh-by--pro-kannada-outfits-has-little-effect.html

The names of all the 40 personnel along with their pictures will be part of the memorial along with the moto of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) -- 'Seva and Nishtha' (Service and Loyalty).

""It definitely was an unfortunate incident and we have learnt our lessons now. We were always extra alert during our movement but now an extra layer of alertness has been added to it,"" Hasan told PTI here.

The supreme sacrifices of the 40 jawans has furthered increased ""our resolve to eliminate enemies of the country"".

""We fight with extra vigour during an encounter with terrorists and that is why we were able to eliminate the entire Jaish-e-Mohammed commanders immediately after the attack on our jawans,"" he said.

While he refused to spell out the precaution that is taken during troop movements in the aftermath of the February 14 attack, officials in the security establishment said the movement of troops is now done in coordination with other security forces and the army.

The Ministry of Home Affairs had also allowed the CRPF to carry its troops by air to avoid the possibility of any such attack.

Both the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and the Commerce Ministry are discussing a proposal in this regard, they said.

Putting an item under restricted category of imports means that the importer of that commodity would have to seek a licence from the Commerce Ministry’s directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT) for the imports.

Imports of TV stood at about USD one billion during 2018-19. China (USD 535 million in 2018-19) is the largest exporter of TV sets in India. It is followed by countries like Vietnam (UD 327 million), Malaysia (USD 109 million), Hong Kong (USD 10.52 million, Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, and Germany.

The government is also likely to impose restrictions on imports of furniture with a view to boost domestic manufacturing and reduce inbound shipments of non-essential items.

159,14-2-20,RBI new asset recognition norms credit negative for banks: Moody’s,"The Reserve Bank of India’s recent asset recognition norms that allows banks not to treat real estate loans as restructured for one year is credit negative for Indian banks, a report by Moody’s said.

Last week, the RBI harmonised guidelines for deferment of date of commencement of commercial operations (DCCO) for projects in non-infrastructure and commercial real estate (CRE) sectors.

It said the revisions of the date of DCCO and consequential shift in repayment schedule for equal or shorter duration will not be treated as restructuring provided the revised DCCO falls within the period of one year from the original DCCO stipulated at the time of financial closure for CRE projects.

In case of CRE projects delayed for reasons beyond the control of promoter, banks may restructure them by way of revision of DCCO up to another one year and retain the ‘standard’ asset classification if the account continues to be serviced, the RBI said.

“The measure is credit negative for Indian banks because it will defer the recognition of such loans from the real estate sector, and by extension appropriate loss provisioning against them,” Moody’s said.

It said property developers will have an additional year to address their funding issues before the banks have to classify a loan as restructured.

“While this will alleviate near-term asset quality risk to the banks from the real estate sector, it will not address the credit issues facing real estate developers,” it said.

Developers are facing funding challenges because nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), the key lenders to the sector, are facing funding challenges of their own.

Tight funding conditions are straining developers’ ability to complete projects, and by extension their solvency, the report said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/rbi-new-asset-recognition-norms-credit-negative-for-banks--moody---s.html
160,14-2-20,‘Homecoming’ for Rajiv Bansal as Air India CMD,"After successfully heading Air India for three months in 2017, senior bureaucrat Rajiv Bansal was on Thursday appointed for the second time as the chairman and managing director of the debt-ridden national carrier, according to a Personnel Ministry order.

Bansal, a 1988-batch IAS officer of Nagaland cadre, is at present additional secretary in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.

The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet has approved his appointment as the CMD of Air India in the rank and pay of additional secretary, the order stated, without mentioning further details.

He replaces Ashwani Lohani, who completed his one-year extended tenure on Thursday.

Bansal was in August 2017 named as Air India’s interim CMD for three months. He had then replaced Lohani, who was appointed chairman of the Railway Board after completion of his two-year stint.

During Bansal’s three-month tenure, Air India launched services to Copenhagen, among others. He also initiated various steps to reduce costs and improve on-time performance of

flights.

Lohani, a 1980 batch officer of the Indian Railway Service of Mechanical Engineers, was in February last year appointed Air India’s CMD for the second time for a one-year tenure. He had retired as the Railway Board chairman in December 2018.

The appointment assumes significance as it comes days after the government decided to sell its stake in Air India, which has a debt pile of over Rs 60,000 crore.

162,14-2-20,WPI inflation rises to 3.1 pc in January,"Wholesale prices-based inflation rose to 3.1 per cent in January, as against 2.59 per cent in the previous month due to increase in prices of food articles like onion and potato.

The annual inflation, based on monthly wholesale price index (WPI), was at 2.76 per cent during the same month a year ago (January 2019).

The rate of price rise for food articles stood at 11.51 per cent during January as against 2.41 per cent a month earlier, while for non-food articles it rose nearly three-fold to 7.8 per cent from 2.32 per cent in December, the data released by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry on Friday showed.

Among food articles, vegetable prices surged by 52.72 per cent mainly on account of onion, which witnessed 293 per cent jump in prices, followed by potato at 37.34 per cent.

Earlier this week, retail inflation based on consumer price index (CPI), rose to a near six-year high of 7.59 per cent in January, surpassing the Reserve Bank of India's comfort range primarily on account of rising vegetable and food prices.

This is the highest rate of inflation since May 2014, when it was 8.33 per cent.

Vodafone Idea on Thursday reported widening of losses to Rs 6,438.8 crore in the third quarter of 2019-20 against Rs 5,004.6 crore a year ago, as the telco continued to sound out warnings on ""material uncertainty"" casting ""significant doubt"" on its ability to continue as going concern.

The company's ability to continue as a going concern is essentially dependent on a positive outcome of its modification application in the Supreme Court on the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) matter and any relief from the Telecom Department on payments, it said.

164,14-2-20,China witnesses deadliest day,"China on Thursday reported 254 fatalities from the coronavirus outbreak — the highest in a single day and double than the previous record high — taking the death toll to 1,367, as authorities adopted a new diagnosis method amid concerns that the crisis is nowhere near slowing down contrary to official projections.

China’s central Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus outbreak, reported 242 deaths and nearly 15,000 fresh cases on Wednesday, said Mi Feng, a spokesperson with the National Health Commission.

Twelve fatalities came from other provinces including two in Henan, and one in Tianjin, Hebei, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Shandong, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps respectively.

The total deaths from the more than two-month-old virus outbreak as reported on Thursday stood at 1,367, with the total number of confirmed cases mounting to 59,804, health officials were quoted as saying by the state-run Xinhua news agency.

The Philippines reported the first death outside China from the virus. So far 445 cases have been reported from about 26 countries, including three from India.

Amid growing public anger over the handling of the crisis, the ruling Communist Party of China replaced two high-ranking officials in Hubei province, where coronavirus first emerged in late December in provincial capital Wuhan.

Xinhua reported that former Shanghai Mayor Ying Yong, 61, a close ally of President Xi Jinping, has been appointed as the new Hubei party secretary, replacing Jiang Chaoliang.

The leader of Wuhan city, Ma Guoqiang, 56, has been replaced by Wang Zhonglin, 57, the party secretary of Shandong’s provincial capital Jinan. Jiang, 61, is the highest-ranking political casualty so far in the virus outbreak.

Today’s purge of the officials followed dismissal of the two top health officials in Hubei province earlier this week. The Hubei Provincial Health Commission said Wuhan has reported 14,840 new cases on Wednesday, including 13,332 “clinically diagnosed cases”, which are being treated as confirmed cases from Thursday onwards as a new method of calculation.

The commission said the adjustment in the calculation has been made to give those who have been clinically diagnosed with the timely standard treatment of confirmed cases.

With this, the total confirmed cases in Hubei province rose to 48,206, it said.

While China attributed the big increase in the numbers to the change in the new methodology of calculation, significantly the rise coincides with the visit of a 15-member team of the specialists of the World Health Organisation (WHO) which is currently visiting China.

It is not yet clear whether WHO team is also scrutinising the numbers relating to the virus. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined to confirm whether the method of calculation of the cases is approved by the WHO team.

But at the same time, he told a media briefing online that “the advance team is here to discuss specific arrangements for the China-WHO joint mission with the Chinese side”. “The purpose of the joint mission is that experts of both sides can have in-depth communication on the situation and efforts of prevention and control, and come up with advice for China and other affected countries. I’ll leave the specifics to the competent authorities”, he said.

The big hike in cases comes amid the official accounts that the cases of the coronavirus are coming down and gradually normalcy is being restored.

Under pressure to accommodate growing number of cases, Wuhan health officials started converting dormitories, gyms of universities in the city into hospitals which raised concerns among foreign students who are stuck in the city.

In the wake of development, foreign students including that of India and Pakistan have started making desperate pleas to their governments to immediately evacuate them.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/china-witnesses-deadliest-day.html
165,14-2-20,Benchmark indices falter on dismal macro data,"Equity benchmarks retreated on Thursday as disappointing macroeconomic data and a sharp rise in the number of new coronavirus cases in China dampened investor sentiment.

The BSE Sensex skidded 106.11 points or 0.26 per cent to settle at 41,459.79. Likewise, the NSE benchmark Nifty dropped 26.55 points or 0.22 per cent to close at 12,174.65.

Global markets wobbled after new cases from China’s coronavirus outbreak soared under a new diagnostic method, with over 200 more deaths and thousands of new patients.

On the macro front, official data released after market hours on Wednesday showed that India’s industrial output contracted by 0.3 per cent in December while retail inflation jumped to a 68-month high of 7.59 per cent in January on high food prices.

Interest-rate sensitive bank, finance and auto stocks tumbled as the high inflation dimmed the prospects of a rate cut by the RBI.

IndusInd Bank was the top loser in the Sensex pack, falling 3.68 per cent, followed by NTPC, Tata Steel, ICICI Bank, Kotak Bank and HDFC.

On the other hand, Titan, SBI, Infosys, Sun Pharma and Tech Mahindra rose up to 2.37 per cent.

Of the 30 Sensex constituents, 16 closed in the red while 14 finished with gains.

“Spike in new coronavirus cases reported across the globe and rise in inflation level for January held markets flat as investors awaited for more cues. “Consumer price inflation indicated a prolonged pause in the interest rate from RBI as rise in core inflation from 3.5 per cent to 4.2 per cent came as a surprise which is expected to impact rate-sensitive stocks,” said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services.

Sectorally, BSE bank, finance and utilities indices were among the major laggards, while healthcare, IT and teck climbed up to 1.06 per cent.

In the broader market, both BSE smallcap and midcap indices outperformed the benchmark.

Asian stocks closed mostly lower amid mounting concerns over the coronavirus epidemic. Bourses in Europe too were trading in the red in opening trade.

Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said global oil demand would suffer its first quarterly drop in a decade as the novel coronavirus has hit the Chinese economy hard and its impact ripples throughout the world.

Reacting to the IEA report, global crude oil benchmark Brent Futures slipped about 2 per cent to trade at USD 55.25 per barrel.

Rupee settles flat

On the Indian currency front, the rupee on Thursday settled flat at 71.33 (provisional) against the US dollar after weak macro-economic data disappointed market participants.

Forex traders said disappointing macro economic numbers and weak domestic equities weighed on the local unit, while easing crude oil prices and weakening of the American currency in the overseas market restricted the fall to some extent.

At the interbank foreign exchange market, the rupee opened at 71.35, then lost further ground to touch a low of 71.49. The domestic unit finally settled at 71.33 against the US dollar, unchanged from its previous close.

“Rupee continued to consolidate in a narrow range but came under pressure after data released on the domestic front was weaker-than-expectation,” said Gaurang Somaiyaa, forex & bullion analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/benchmark-indices-falter-on-dismal-macro-data.html

Son-in-law of Infosys’ co-founder Narayana Murthy, Sunak was a career investment banker before dedicating his life to public service by entering politics by becoming a MP first time in 2015.

Sunak, 39, replaces Pakistani-origin Sajid Javid who resigned as the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a shock move in one of the biggest shakeups since Johnson won a thumping majority in the December 2019 general election.

He has been an elected representative of the UK Parliament for three times, beginning May 7, 2015.

Javid’s resignation meanwhile came two weeks after Brexit and a month before he had been due to deliver his first annual budget on behalf of Johnson’s Conservative administration. Johnson appointed senior Treasury official Rishi Sunak to succeed Javid as chancellor of the exchequer.

“Volatility has been injected into the markets on the back of the news that Sajid Javid, the chancellor, has resigned,” CMC Markets UK analyst David Madden told AFP.

“The news caught traders by surprise. Sterling has the biggest reaction to the news -- it initially sold-off, but it since recovered all the lost ground and is now back above the pre-announcement level.”

British news agency the Press Association quoted a source close to Javid as saying he resigned after refusing to carry out Johnson’s demand that the chancellor sack his entire team of aides.

172,14-2-20,WHO: No major change in ‘trajectory' of virus outbreak,"The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday said a sharp rise in reported COVID-19 cases in China, due to a change in counting methods, did not represent a big shift in the epidemic. China’s official death toll from the new coronavirus and the number of cases reported soared dramatically on Thursday after authorities altered the way they tally infections.

“This does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak,” Michael Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies programme, said at a press conference. “We’re not dealing, from what we understand, with a spike in cases of 14,000 on one day,” he said.

“This increase that you’ve all seen in the last 24 hours is largely, in part, down to a change in how the cases are being reported.” Ryan also said he expected members of a WHO-led international mission to China to arrive over the weekend.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/who--no-major-change-in----trajectory--of-virus-outbreak.html
173,14-2-20,"Sharma, Bidhuri power Delhi to 623","Kshitiz Sharma, whose place in the playing eleven was questioned, silenced his critics with a gritty 103 that helped Delhi post a mammoth 623 in the first innings of their Ranji Trophy match against Rajasthan at Feroz Shah Kotla on Thursday.

Sharma, who played for Arunachal last season, stitched a 196-run stand with Kunwar Bidhuri who too reached the three figures scoring 115 off just 135 balls.

Delhi had resumed day two at 389 for six and ended up adding 234 runs. The hosts maintained a decent run rate of 4.23 in the innings lasting 147 overs.

In response, Rajasthan were under the pump at 115 for four, trailing Delhi by 508 runs at close of play. They clearly have a mountain to climb in their last league game.

Ashok Menaria (38) and Rajesh Bishnoi (23) were at the crease at the draw of stumps.

Leggie Rahul Chahar (5/161) picked a five-wicket haul for Rajasthan.

Virtually out of the quarterfinal race, Delhi need other results to go their way and a big win over Rajasthan to remain in the hunt for a knockout berth.

In Patiala, Punjab, resuming the day at 93 for three, just about managed to take a 13-run first innings lead against Bengal after being bowled out for 151. Bengal were bundled out for 138 on day one.

Left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed wreaked havoc on day two, running through Punjab batting to bring his team back into the game.

At stumps, Bengal were 199 for nine, leading Punjab by 186 runs.

TN seizes advantage

Rajkot: Tamil Nadu wicket-keeper batsman Narayan Jagadeesan came up with a gritty 183 to help his team post a competitive total of 424 on the second day of Elite Group B game against Saurashtra.

Then Tamil Nadu hit back to reduce Saurashtra to 107 for 3, as the hosts are still adrift by 317 runs.

After Saurashtra led by their skipper Jaydev Unadkat took honours on the opening day by restricting Tamil Nadu to 250 for 7, it was Jagadeesan, who pulled the side out of trouble, by notching up his fourth first-class 100.

He hammered 22 fours and five other hits over the fence in his 256-ball knock.

For Saurashtra, Unadkat (6-73) grabbed another five- wicket haul and emerged as the most successful bowler.

Meanwhile at the Wankhede, in an inconsequential game, Mumbai posted a massive 427 on the board in their first essay against Madhya Pradesh.

Sarfaraz, who has had a dream run this season, however fell 23 runs short of a double hundred.

He already has a triple, double and now a hundred to his name this season.

Then Mumbai bowlers reduced Madhya Pradesh to 200/7, still adrift by 227 runs.

In Bengaluru, Baroda are marginally ahead by 60 runs, but hosts Karnataka can sniff victory having taken five Baroda wickets in their second essay and still two days left.

Goa storm into q/f

Kolkata: Goa cantered into the quarterfinals with an innings and 211-run win over Mizoram in their Plate Group clash at the CC&FC ground. All-rounder Amit Verma once again led by example as he followed up his century with a 5/39 in the second innings of Mizoram who folded for 170 after following-on to suffer the defeat inside two days.

Nineteen wickets tumbled on the extended second day with Mizoram skipper KB Pawan waging a lone battle remaining unbeaten on 111, even as seven of their batsmen failed to reach double digits in their second innings.

Lakshay Garg and Amulya Pandrekar claimed three wickets each, while Verma was at his tidy best with figures of 2/2 from 4.2 overs as Mizoram’s first innings succumbed to 109 inside 41 overs.

Goa topped the table with an unassailable 50 points to secure the lone knockout berth from the Plate Group.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sharma--bidhuri-power-delhi-to-623.html
174,14-2-20,Jemimah excited for T20 WC opener against Aus,"India top-order batswoman Jemimah Rodrigues is raring to go at the T20 World Cup and feels that the opening match against Australia will be one of the most important games of her career.

“I think it will be one of the most important games in my career. Playing a World Cup... The first match in Australia and for me first time playing (a World Cup) in Australia. Nothing is more exciting than India in Australia, so it will be a match we all will be keen to play and just excited,” Rodrigues said in a release from the ICC.

Matches between India and Australia have been keenly contested and in the last edition of the World Cup, India had got the better of Australia in the group stage.

The two teams have some of the best batters in their line-ups. India’s Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet Kaur have proven records against Australia, while Ellyse Perry, Meg Lanning and Alyssa Healy of the hosts have enjoyed excellent form in the past year especially.

Australia fast bowler Megan Schutt was all praise for India opener Mandhana. “Smriti Mandhana is on another level. She’s put me over the fence countless times both on international and WBBL level unfortunately. She’s got the x-factor, she’s a left-hander, can hit to all the areas of the field,” Schutt said.

Schutt was also wary of India skipper Harmanpreet, who struck a blazing 171 not out in the ICC Women’s World Cup 2017 semi-final against Australia.

“(They) have someone like Harmanpreet Kaur come out, who can just swing it like no other really, and kind of put you out of the stadium. And she’s obviously, kind of climbed to fame in the World Cup with a huge innings there and I think since then she’s also proved that she can do that in other matches.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/jemimah-excited-for-t20-wc-opener-against-aus.html
175,14-2-20,Eng giddy,"Fast bowler Lungi Ngidi took three wickets in his last two overs as South Africa snatched a thrilling one-run win in the first Twenty20I against England at Buffalo Park on Wednesday.

Jason Roy and captain Eoin Morgan hit half-centuries for England and they looked well on the way to chasing down South Africa’s total of 177 for eight.

But the match changed dramatically in the last three overs as England lost six wickets for 24 runs to finish on 176 for nine.

“You run in as hard as you can and hit your length. All of a sudden their team was on the back foot,” said Ngidi who was man of the match for his 3-30.

“It was a very fast-paced game, but it’s about how you bounce back. I didn’t panic under pressure, they seemed to be cruising but my job was to get wickets.”

England needed just seven to win off the last over but Ngidi dismissed Tom Curran and Moeen Ali while conceding only five runs.

Adil Rashid was run out off the last ball, trying for an improbable second run which would have tied the scores.

Both innings followed a similar pattern. Both teams scored 68 runs in the first six-over power play and both had scored 113 runs after 12 overs before slowing down in the closing overs.

Opening batsman Roy was brutal in reaching his fifty off 22 balls on the way to scoring 70 off 38 deliveries with seven fours and three sixes.

Morgan seemed set to take his team to victory, hitting Beuran Hendricks for two fours and a six in the penultimate over before holing out off the last ball of the over after making 52.

Earlier, De Kock (31) and Temba Bavuma (43) got South Africa off to a fast start, putting on 48 for the first wicket off 26 balls.

Rassie van der Dussen (31) joined Bavuma and the pair added 63 for the second wicket off 41 deliveries before Van der Dussen fell to Ben Stokes and the innings lost momentum.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/eng-giddy.html
176,14-2-20,Indian women’s team can emulate ‘83 batch at T20 WCup: Raman,"India women’s coach WV Raman feels his team is capable of emulating Kapil Dev’s World Cup winning team at the T20 World Cup, beginning in Australia on February 21.

India will begin their campaign at the T20 World Cup against Australia on February 21. Raman said Harmanpreet Kaur and Co will be one of the favourites to win the title. The Indian women’s team has never won an ICC trophy.

“Definitely one of the favourites. They made people sit up and take notice in the 2017 World Cup (runners-up) and the 2018 T20 World Cup (semifinalists). Since then there has been a lot of improvement, in terms of fitness, agility on the field and their approach to batting,” Raman was quoted as saying in ESPNcricinfo.

“They have been shaping well over the last six months. It is more or less a better and settled team than perhaps what it was when I took over. These girls have a very good chance in this World Cup.”

Raman said if India can go on to win the title, it will give a big fillip to women’s cricket in the country.

“If they end up doing that, they will probably do what Kapil Dev’s World Cup-winning team did for Indian cricket in 1983. And they will become superstars if they go on to win.”

Talking about India’s batting, Raman said: “They are definitely good. They are fearless strikers of the ball with good technical skills to boot. They are adept at playing both pacers and spinners all round the wicket and they are confident. That’s what I meant when I said each can be a match-winner on her own.”

One player to look out for during the World Cup will be 16-year-old opener Shafali Verma, who had burst into the scene last year after becoming the youngest Indian to score a half-century in international cricket, a record earlier held by Sachin Tendulkar.

Raman said Shafali is a special talent but asked the media to refrain from focussing too much on her.

“... I would request the media not to go gaga over her, because she is barely 16, and too much attention is not good for her at this stage. I have given her the freedom to play the way she has been playing. She has shown she has the talent. She is fearless. She is unique,” he said.

“She is extremely positive. She has the ability to score runs quickly. She can hit the ball hard and she looks to get runs. She is at a stage and an age where it doesn’t make sense to put anything into her. She needs to be allowed to be figure it out for herself. That will come with experience.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/indian-women---s-team-can-emulate----83-batch-at-t20-wcup--raman.html
177,14-2-20,No fight for spot with Prithvi: Gill,"Promising India batsman Shubman Gill insists he is not competing with fellow young gun Prithvi Shaw for the opener’s slot in the first Test against New Zealand but if he does get the opportunity, he will not “let it go waste”.

With a double hundred and a century against New Zealand A here, Gill has made everyone take notice despite Shaw being firmly back in the mix for the upcoming two-match series starting in Wellington from February 21.

“Obviously, our careers started at the same time but there is no fight as such,” Gill said on Thursday when asked about his take on his competition with the former India U-19 captain.

Both Gill and Shaw are 20 and considered the stars of the future after a splendid runs in age-group cricket.

“Both of us have done well in our positions. It’s up to the team management, who they will play. It’s not as if there is a fight. Whoever gets the chance will try to make the most of the opportunity and not let it go waste,” the 20-year-old said ahead of the warm-up game against New Zealand XI.

Having played in New Zealand for the last six weeks as part of the A team, Gill feels that if New Zealand’s short-ball factor can be nullified, it would go a long way in helping the team.

“I think their bowling attack has been taking a lot of wickets with the short ball, especially Neil Wagner. If you see the last series they played against Australia, when nothing was happening in the wicket, they were really relying on the short ball.

“As batsmen, if we could take that out of the picture and not give wickets to the short ball, it will be really helpful for us,” he observed.

Gill also spoke about wind being a key factor in Wellington during the opening Test.

“Wind (Breeze) factor is very important, especially when you are batting. The bowlers do a lot of planning depending on the breeze. It was not that easy to consistently pull and hook the ball (in windy conditions during the A series).”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/no-fight-for-spot-with-prithvi--gill.html
178,14-2-20,India check combination against New Zealand XI,"Clarity on opening combination, a call on whether Ravichandran Ashwin’s variations can trump Ravindra Jadeja’s all-round skill-sets will be the focus for India in their three-day warm-up game against New Zealand XI starting at Seddon Park today.

After the harsh reality check of 0-3 drubbing in ODI series, a red-ball warm-up game will be the most welcome distraction for Virat Kohli and his men as a precursor to the two-match Test series starting next week.

India could not have asked for a better practice game as the opposition team is full of New Zealand senior and A team players, including leg-spinner Ish Sodhi, all-rounder Jimmy Neesham and wicketkeeper Tim Seifert, in its ranks.

The inclusion of first team white ball pacers Scott Kuggeliejn and Blair Tickner will be the kind of test which both Prithvi Shaw and Shubman Gill will relish as they make a case for their inclusion in the playing XI for the first Test.

Shubman will be itching to show his skipper that he is ready for the big debut which is eagerly anticipated among his growing legion of fans, despite his international career being two-match old.

A flat track like the one at Seddon Park will also be a test for the two frontline spinners with Ashwin and Jadeja getting a chance to test the likes of Daryl Mitchell, Tom Bruce and Seifert in action.

A good show on a flat deck can improve Ashwin’s chances of toppling Jadeja even though the proposition looks dim at the moment.

For the New Zealand XI, there is Dane Cleaver, who has had scores of 196 and 53 in the two A Tests against India. He would like to impress the selectors and get into the first team for the Test series.

179,14-2-20,Bumrah needs to be aggressive and take extra risks: Zaheer,"Former India pace spearhead Zaheer Khan feels Jasprit Bumrah needs to be more aggressive and take extra risks to make his presence felt in the upcoming Test series against New Zealand after going wicket-less in the ODI series.

Zaheer said the opposition batsmen have now become more careful while playing Bumrah and the pace spearhead needs to put extra effort to return to form.

“When you build a reputation like how Jasprit Bumrah has built now over the years, you will have to fight this,” Zaheer was quoted as saying by cricbuzz.com.

“...The teams are saying ‘ok even if we get 35 runs, we are happy with that as long as we are not giving him wickets because then we can attack the other bowlers’.

“That is something Bumrah has to understand, that he has to be extra aggressive in terms of looking to get those wickets. Bumrah needs to take extra risks,” he added.

Zaheer said batsmen have become careful while facing Bumrah.

“He knows the batsmen are going to be defensive so he has to find that way of going for wickets rather than hoping that the batsman will make a mistake. The batsmen are taking a very conservative approach, they are making sure that Bumrah’s wicket taking column is not getting filled,” he said.

“It’s a good sign that other batsmen are giving him that respect, so it’s now Bumrah’s call to make them play. You have to tell yourself ‘my job is not to contain, my job is to take wickets and in the process if I go for runs so be it. I am the lead bowler so I have to dictate terms’,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bumrah-needs-to-be-aggressive-and-take-extra-risks--zaheer.html

181,14-2-20,An ode to India,"On Valentine’s Day, actor Swara Bhasker appeals to people who don’t subscribe to the hate culture but protest silently against the prevailing injustice because of their love for the nation. At India, My Valentine, a number of artistes will be performing. By Chahak Mittal

Bhagat Singh’s iconic words, “Meri dulhan toh azaadi hai,” hold true even now, decades after his death. His words reflected how his love towards the nation surpassed any other emotion. It pre-empted the idea of romantic love and grew solely for India, which “is meant to be one”.

On Valentine’s Day, actor Swara Bhasker, along with some activists and industry friends have been inspired by the same spirit and celebrate, India, My Valentine, where they look at the nation as one’s love and duty. It celebrates the India of Rabindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Maulana Azad, Vallabhai Patel and Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Ashfaqullah Khan and Ram Prasad Bismil, Savitribai Phule and Fatima Sheikh, and BR Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh, bringing the movements back to people’s minds. They honour the India of tolerance, of acceptance, which strove to be a better place for even her most oppressed children and the India that was a dream for many of its freedom fighters.

There have been several voices raised over the last few months in the country against the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) and its implied linkage to the NRC (National Register for Citizens). To shut them down and also the massive protests around the country, many lathi-charges have taken place, tear gas has been released, administrations and students of major universities and institutions have been hounded. While today’s youth might be increasingly becoming active in being a part of such debates and protests directly, many choose to stay behind the curtains and present ideas. Swara’s target through this initiative is exactly those people, who “might also not agree with the hate climate but wouldn’t get involved in the harsh messaging too.”

She says, “India’s people are increasingly becoming fractious. They have started behaving more like an echo chamber. Not many people are actually listening to different opinions. And then there’s a set of people who wouldn’t show up at protests but rather would happily go to a cultural event based on the same issue. Which is fine. It doesn’t mean they are not active or apolitical or do not care about the Constitution or its rights or the country falling apart. We thought how could we reach out to this lot of the population that doesn’t subscribe itself to the ideology of hate but also doesn’t want to get into aggressive politics or protests. Hence, we came up with this.”

Social media and a number of written words or posts are evident that there are people who choose to raise voices in a different way than being physically present at a political gathering. “They may feel uncomfortable in attending or listening to political speeches but they would attend some stand-up or music night or be a part of the spoken world through cultural events. This is fine because after all, they’re fighting for India, isn’t it? Whatever our political or religious differences be, we can always find that common link. India se pyaar hai, bohot hai na. Basically, this is to celebrate unity and the fact that at the end of the day, India is our first valentine. Apart from your family, the first thing you learn is to love your country. That is why we pitched it like ‘India, My Valentine’.”

Artistes have been contributing to standing up with the protesters in their respective ways. Be it through films, music, poetry and shayari, art or even being physically present at the protest sites. Prateek Kuhad, Shubha Mudgal and TM Krishna recently performed at the Shaheen Bagh to encourage the women and children to keep their fighting spirits up. Certainly, art does bring something out of the blue, which isn’t aggressive but conveys a point by hitting the right chord. Swara says then why not make the most out of it? “Art has the power to unite because it appeals to our hearts and resonates with our emotions. Even most complex political issues or nuances can be conveyed through an emotional story or a piece of art. The good art teaches us to be empathetic. This will be a fascinating platform for emerging artists as well,” she adds.

With a range of performances across 12-15 Indian cities, the actor says that this will reaffirm the faith of our people in the fraternity and integrity of the country. It will stand for the oppressed. Well, oppression of what kind? She adds, “India’s Constitution, while being constructed, took into account the prevailing inequality and oppression. There are underprivileged children. Our Constitution’s dream was to include them. Today when we talk about disenfranchisement, whether it is by CAA, NRC or healthcare, farmers, sanitation workers, there are so many people who are surrounded by an oppressed culture. A lot of the artistes have also felt the same. This is to rekindle our faith and hope in a Constitution that stood for sovereignty, peace and oneness.”

For her, the idea of love is “fraternity, unity and empathy. You cannot lessen this widening communal divide if you don’t speak the language of love.”

Swara is one actor who has been trolled incessantly for her opinions and statements on social media. And not just trolled, the brunt of being boycotted from work as well as social events, she has faced it all. She says, “Of course, there’s always a price to pay for the choices you make in life. And in mine, somehow it has been physical too, in the form of my work that has been taken away from me. This is in addition to all the hatred, trolling, targetting, negativity and fake news. I have been fighting not just the causes I stand for but all of this. But when we decide to take a position or make a choice, we also decide that we have to live by those choices.”

Actor Vidya Balan has come out in support of the film Kabir Singh against criticism that the 2019 blockbuster glorifies a misogynistic hero and misogyny.

Although she says she wouldn’t play the female protagonist in the film, she would definitely watch such a film because it represents a harsh reality. She adds that she is mature enough to understand there are two sides to every story.

184,14-2-20,No more chopsticks,"Food importers and local traders have turned cautious and voluntarily stopped Chinese imports after epidemic

The news came as a bombshell that coronavirus (COVID-19) from China had an outbreak. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the number of people killed by the virus surpassed 1,000 on February 11. Wuhan, which is believed to have been the origin, is in lockdown and the majority of border crossings into Hong Kong are now closed, WHO said. The question arises is how the virus is impacting the food and beverage industry worldwide? Well, authorities and industries are doing their bit to prevent spreading the virus into other countries. China, too, has responded in several ways by restricting travel inside the country, discouraging large gatherings, including for food service and out-of-home dining, and extending the national holidays.

As per Foodnavigator-asia.com, several countries have acted to ban the import of food items from China. One of these was Indonesia, which started with the ban of live animal imports from the country and is set to release a list of other banned food items soon. Agus Suparmanto, the Trade Minister of Indonesia, told the Foodnavigator-asia.com, “We are still in the preparatory stage, laying out details so we don’t target wrongly. Indonesia will only stop imports of products that could potentially spread the coronavirus.” He also told Daily Express that exports would not be affected.

Food importers have turned cautious and local traders have voluntarily stopped food product imports from the country. Even though there hasn’t been a nation-wide announcement about ban on Chinese food and beverage imports, but as per PTI, Manipur government has banned the import of packaged food items from China, Myanmar and Southeast Asian countries which do not comply with FSSAI regulations. The notification came after two cases of mild swine flu were detected in samples of people entering Manipur.

Some restaurateurs say that people are avoiding Chinese cuisine for the fear of getting infected by the virus. Many restaurateurs also say that they have started to look for alternative resources. “Lots of ingredients come from China. We buy them through distributers. But all supplies are approved by the food regulator. Right now, we don’t foresee any issues but there will be a crunch in supplies in the coming months. We may have to make some dishes unavailable from the menus till supplies resume,” chef Sharad Dewan, regional director-food production, The Park Hotels, told an Indian national daily.

Australian Industry Group (AiGroup) GM, International Competitiveness, Louise McGrath, told Food & Drink Business that impacts on different industries will be a delayed shock because of the timing of the outbreak. “Everyone expects a period of quietness at this time of year due to Chinese New Year. If it had happened at any other time of year the impact would be much more noticeable,” she told.

The Seafood Trade Advisory Group (STAG) said the last seafood airfreight cargo accepted to China was 26 January, with no landings since from Australia, New Zealand and the rest of the world. STAG told Food & Drink Business, “There is widespread dysfunction within China at the moment due to an increasing number of workers staying home.” The national body representing the seafood sector, Seafood Industry Australia (SIA) told food news website that it was a “rapidly evolving situation” with the loss of orders impacting many in the industry, from fishers, to exporters and freight companies.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/no-more-chopsticks.html
185,14-2-20,Enjoy your version of the classic,"For the ultimate grilled cheese, use both stovetop and oven

Grilled cheese is the ultimate comfort food, an adult treat that harkens back to childhood. I never met a grilled cheese sandwich I didn’t like.

Where I grew up, there was an old-fashioned drug store with a lunch counter. When the weather was good, my best friend and I would ride our bikes there and order grilled cheese and made-to-order orange-ades. The grilled cheese was made with fluffy white bread and American cheese on a griddle. It had one slice of cheese between the bread slices and was as thin as a sandwich can possibly be, as the bread was compressed during grilling. Still, I have a vivid and mouthwatering taste memory of this grilled cheese, as if I ate it yesterday.

At home, grilled cheese mostly meant Swiss cheese and rye bread or Roman Meal bread stuffed with sharp cheddar and grilled in a pan. I loved them both. When I lived in Chicago and needed comfort food, I would go to a Greek diner and order a grilled Swiss cheese on rye with bacon — enough said. Recently, I have mashed up the best grilled cheese sandwiches of my memory to come up with the ultimate grilled cheese recipe.

I used a sturdy white bread; Pepperidge Farm original white is my top choice. I use one slice of American cheese, melty cheese, on each side to hold everything together and then add a thick slice of whatever cheese I have on hand. It is usually Muenster, Swiss or sharp cheddar — but you can even use pimento cheese if it doesn’t have too much mayo in it.

I used to butter the bread and try to “grill” the sandwich on the stovetop in a non-stick skillet. But invariably, the cheese was still cool in the middle when the outside of the bread was brown. Making grilled cheese in a panini maker solved these problems, but then it wasn’t a grilled cheese. It was a crisp, flattened cheese bread. I wanted to recreate the perfect drug-store grilled cheese, but with more and better cheese. So instead of spreading the bread with butter or mayo, I took a note from the drugstore griddle and put a small bit of butter in the pan. Once it was melted, I swirled the bread in the butter, adding a thin coat to one side of the bread. I removed one piece of bread, stacked the cheese on the other, and then topped it with the first slice — butter-side out. If you’re adding other ingredients, like bacon, tomato, mushrooms, caramelised onions, etc, now is the time to do it.

Quick tip: I keep my bread in the freezer and start out with frozen bread. The rigid bread helps keep the structure of the sandwich intact before the cheese starts to melt and hold everything together. Using frozen bread also slows down the browning (burning) of the bread.

Don’t turn the heat higher than medium. I let the sandwich toast for one to two minutes, or until it’s crisp and lightly brown, and then flip it to brown the other side. Do this carefully, because the cheese isn’t melted yet and the sandwich won’t hold together on its own. But if it slips apart, don’t worry: At this stage, you can easily realign the bread.

Next, I pop the sandwich and non-stick skillet into a preheated 350-degree Fahrenheit oven for two to four minutes, depending on the thickness of the cheese and bread. This lets the cheese melt completely without the bread burning. It takes three to four minutes for the cheese to melt, and then your grilled cheese is ready.

Remove it from the heat, and slice on a plate or cutting board. You will have a super melty, gloriously brown and crispy grilled cheese sandwich with a buttery but not greasy crust. Whatever cheese you choose, I recommend at least one slice of melty cheese to hold things together. American cheese comes in white and yellow, and if I am making a grilled cheese with a fancy cheese too, I opt for the white.

Enjoy your version of the classic but don’t stop there. Grilled cheese lends itself to lots of flavour variations.

187,14-2-20,Manpreet 1st Indian to win FIH Male Player of Year award,"National men’s team captain Manpreet Singh on Thursday became the first Indian to win the International Hockey Federation’s (FIH) Player of the Year award, capping a memorable 2019 season in which he led the side to Olympic qualification.

The 27-year-old midfielder, thus, became the first from the country to win the accolade since the awards were introduced in 1999.

He beat competition from Belgium’s Arthur van Dorren and Lucas Villa of Argentina, who came second and third respectively.

Manpreet polled a total of 35.2 per cent of combined votes, which includes National Associations, media, fans and players.

Van Dorren, on the other hand, got combined vote share of 19.7 per cent while Villa polled 16.5 per cent in his favour.

Other players who were nominated for the award were Victor Wegnez of Belgium and Australian duo of Aran Zalewski and Eddie Ockenden.

Manpreet, who had represented India at 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics, has enjoyed a long career in the national team since he made his debut in 2011. He now has 260 international appearances under his belt.

Last year, Manpreet led India to victory in the FIH Olympic Qualifiers, securing their Tokyo Olympics spot.

Talking about the last season, Manpreet said: “If you look at our year, we did well in every tournament we participated in. Be it the FIH Series Finals in June or the test series in Belgium where we played the hosts as well as Spain and beat them.

“Our biggest goal in 2019 was to book our berth at the Olympics.”

India achieved that goal in style, beating Russia in the Olympic Qualifiers over two legs — 4-2 and 7-2.

Manpreet dedicated the award to his teammates, saying without their support it wouldn't have been possible.

“I am truly honoured to win this award and I would like to dedicate this to my team. I also thank my well wishers and hockey fans from around the world for voting in my favour. It is truly humbling to see so much support for Indian hockey,” he said.

FIH CEO Thierry Weil congratulated all the winners, including Manpreet on their achievements.

“On behalf of FIH, I would like to extend heartfelt congratulations from the whole hockey community to all winners of the 2019 FIH Stars Awards and also to all nominees.

“Thanks to their skills and performances, as well as their teammates, they invite fans all over the world to experience great emotions. We are very grateful to them,” he said.

Hockey India President Mohd Mushtaque Ahmad also congratulated Manpreet.

“He has matured over the years as a player and has proved his importance in the team. He has led India to important victories,” he said.

Besides Manpreet, young midfielder Vivek Sagar Prasad won the FIH Male Rising Star of the Year award, while striker Lalremsiami bagged the the 2019 FIH Women’s Rising Star of Year recognition.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/manpreet-1st-indian-to-win-fih-male-player-of-year-award.html
188,14-2-20,Kuchar grabs three-shot Riviera lead as Woods falters,"Matt Kuchar fired a sparkling seven-under 64 to seize a three-shot lead after the first round of the Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club.

South Korea's Lee Kyoung-hoon and Americans Russell Henley, Wyndham Clark, Adam Schenk and Harold Varner shared second on 67 with Rory McIlroy -- newly returned to world number one -- headlining a group of 10 on 68 that also included Australia's Jason Day and former Masters champion Patrick Reed.

Tournament host Tiger Woods on Thursday closed with a bogey to fall out of that bunch, cooling off after a hot start to post a two-under par 69 as he pursues a record 83rd US PGA Tour title.

Woods was still a teenager when he played his first US tour event at Riviera, but he has never won on the classic course in the Pacific Palisades west of Los Angeles in 12 prior tries, and his struggles continued on Thursday.

""I got off to a nice start on the front nine and just didn't hit many good shots on the back nine,"" said Woods, who opened with an eagle at the first and added two birdies before the turn but had two bogeys without a birdie coming in.

""Made a couple loose swings and made a couple good saves on the back nine for par, but just wasn't able to get any birdies on the back nine,"" Woods said.

Kuchar, meanwhile, started hot and stayed that way.

'A fun, fun day'

""It was a fun, fun day out there playing Riviera,"" said the nine-time US PGA Tour winner, who opened with back-to-back birdies at the 10th and 11th.

His seven birdies included a 28-footer at the 18th and a 33-footer at the eighth -- his penultimate hole of the day.

""Eighteen was a little bit more doable, basically a straight uphill putt,"" he said of his first birdie bomb. The downhill putt at the eighth was even more of a bonus.

""You can't count on that every day, but it sure is fun when they do go in,"" Kuchar said.

""To shoot a number like this, you kind of do most things well,"" he added. ""I felt like it was just steady golf, a lot of opportunities and I was able to convert on a good number of the opportunities today.""

Kuchar, who hit 14 of 18 greens in regulation, said missing in the right spot was the key to getting up and down when needed.

""That's definitely a big key here,"" he said.

McIlroy had two eagles in his round, but said he put himself on the defensive too often.

""There's a couple times today I hit good shots but was on the wrong side,"" McIlroy said.

After getting up and down for par from an awkward lie in a bunker at the 10th, McIlroy was scrambling until an eagle at 17, followed by another eagle at the first.

The chilly morning temperatures were a factor in his ""very sluggish start"" as McIlroy saw his three-wood into the 11th come up 40 yards shorter than the 285 yards he can usually expect.

Six holes later, with the weather warming up, he had 289 yards into the 17th and put a three-wood pin-high, 35 feet from the hole.

""So it just shows you what temperature does,"" said McIlroy, who drained the eagle putt.

Brooks Koepka, who had held the number one ranking for the last eight months, opened his week on 69, joining a big group that also included not only Woods but also 2016 Olympic gold medalist Justin Rose and fellow Englishman Paul Casey, defending champion JB Holmes and South Koreans Im Sung-jae, Kang Sung and Kim Si-woo.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kuchar-grabs-three-shot-riviera-lead-as-woods-falters-2020-02-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kuchar-grabs-three-shot-riviera-lead-as-woods-falters.html

“I know I still have a long way to go, but I’m willing to continue to put the work in until I reach my ultimate goal. My dream is to give India its first-ever mixed martial arts world champion,” she said after her first open workout session at National Sports Club of India on Wednesday.

The 25-year old made her debut in November 2019 against South Korea’s Nam Hee Kim and won the opening bout in just three minutes. And now with her second face-off scheduled against China’s Wu Chiao Chen at One: King Of The Jungle on February 28, she wants to finish the bout in the first round.

“My strategy is going to try and finish the match in the first round itself. In my debut game I won via TKO(punches), this time I want to knock out my opponent,” she said.

“I don’t look at my opponent’s age and experience. Rather I believe in my training and try to give my 100% on the ring.”

Speaking about the difference in training, challenges and adjustments she made during her switch from wrestling to MMA, Ritu said, “There’s not much difference in training. Power, speed and endurance are required in both. Just the skills required here are different. In wrestling, punching and striking were not allowed which is used in MMA.”

“It was slightly difficult to switch from wrestling to this but since I was fit from start, so it helped me and then I training with the best players in Singapore, my skills have also improved.”

However, she credits her wrestling background as an advantage.

“Hailing from wrestling background is helping me here in Mixed Martial Arts. If you see the world top 10 MMA fighters then seven of them have a wrestling background, so yes obviously it’s an advantage.”

The announcement ends days of speculation over the future of the 26-year-old attacking midfielder, a Moroccan international.

“Ajax and Chelsea have reached an agreement for the transfer of Hakim Ziyech. The player will join the Premier League club on July 1st 2020 and will finish the season in Amsterdam,” the Eredivisie champions said in a statement.

“The clubs have agreed a deal of €40 million euros. This sum could potentially increase to a maximum of €44 million, with variable factors.”

Chelsea confirmed the deal, praising Dutch-born Ziyech as a “prolific scorer throughout his career.”

“Ziyech is a left-footed attacker who is comfortable playing off the right flank and coming inside, as he has often done in recent years to such devastating effect for Ajax, or on the left to attack with width and deliver into the box,” Chelsea said.

The London-based side added: “The move is subject to the player agreeing personal terms and he will remain at the Dutch club for the rest of this season.”

Ziyech joined Ajax in 2016 from fellow Eredivisie club FC Twente for a fee of 11 million euros, and has now scored 49 goals in 160 appearances for Ajax.

Paris Saint-Germain cruised into the semi-finals of the French Cup on Wednesday after thumping Dijon 6-1 in a match that saw the French champions benefit again from comical own goals.

PSG were ahead just 47 seconds after kick off thanks to Wesley Lautoa shanking Mitchel Bakker’s low cross into his own net to the bemusement of his teammates.

It was the second own goal in a week to be scored for PSG, who also saw Lyon’s Fernando Marcal slam a stunning effort past his own goalkeeper at the weekend.

However the hosts were level in the 13th minute thanks to a impressive low curling effort from Mounir Chouiar, which squeezed past Kaylor Navas.

While the away side were far from full strength, with Angel Di Maria and Mauro Icardi on the bench and Neymar not even in the squad, Thomas Tuchel’s team did include Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani, who was making his first start in over a month after nearly moving to Atletico Madrid in January.

The Uruguayan was left waiting his 200th goal for the club in the 21st minute when he turned home Thomas Meunier’s cross, only for the strike to be ruled out for handball by the Belgian after a VAR check.

“It’s not that bad because he can score his 200th goal on Saturday (against Amiens) or Tuesday (against Borussia Dortmund). I can feel he’s there,” said Tuchel.

On the match, he added: “I’m happy because we deserved the victory. It’s a huge performance.”

Mbappe put PSG ahead a minute before the break, punishing Jhonder Cadiz’s miss when clean through seconds before by clinically slotting home a similar chance.

Thiago Silva added a third four minutes after the break with a header from a corner before Pablo Sarabia ended Dijon’s resistance by pushing home his 11th of the season on the rebound.

Senou Coulibaly watched on in horror with five minutes left when Mbappe’s cross looped off his thigh over helpless stopper Runar Alex Runarsson, before Sarabia tapped home his second in stoppage time from another Mbappe centre.

Later, Lyon coach Rudi Garcia knocked his former side Marseille out as Houssem Aouar scored an 81st minute winner.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/comedy-of-errors-2020-02-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/comedy-of-errors.html
202,14-2-20,SC refuses interim relief to Sajjan Kumar in 1984 anti-Sikh riots case,"The Supreme Court on Friday refused to grant interim bail to former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar, sentenced to life imprisonment in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case, and said it will hear his bail plea in summer vacations.

A bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde, Justice B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant also said it will consider medical report from the AIIMS on the health condition of Kumar after completing the hearing in the Sabarimala reference matter.

Kumar was awarded life imprisonment by the Delhi High Court on December 17, 2018.

203,14-2-20,EU calls for swift withdrawal of remaining restrictions in Kashmir,"The European Union on Friday sought swift lifting of existing restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir but at the same time noted the ""positive steps"" initiated by the union government to restore normalcy in the region.

The comments by the European Union came a day after a group of 25 foreign envoys concluded a two-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir to have a first-hand account of the situation over six months after the Centre announced withdrawing its special status.

""The visit confirmed that the government of India has taken positive steps to restore normalcy. Some restrictions remain, notably on internet access and mobile services, and some political leaders are still in detention,"" said Virginie Battu-Henriksson, EU Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.

""While we recognise the serious security concerns, it is important that the remaining restrictions be lifted swiftly,"" the official said.

Battu-Henriksson said the visit presented a ""welcome opportunity"" to see the situation on the ground and to interact with local interlocutors in Jammu and Kashmir.

""We look forward to continuing the dialogue with India on the situation in the region,"" the official added.

The visit was organised by the government to help the foreign envoys know about the situation in the Union Territory.

The EU official said the programme included meetings with civil and military authorities, some political representatives as well as selected representatives of civil society and the business community.

Last month, the government had taken 15 envoys to Jammu and Kashmir but the European countries had declined to be part of it.

After announcing reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir and withdrawal of its special powers, India imposed severe curbs including on movement of people as well as on mobile telephone and internet connectivity. The crackdown drew international criticism with several countries expressing concerns over the situation in Kashmir.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/eu-calls-for-swift-withdrawal-of-remaining-restrictions-in-kashmir-2020-02-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/eu-calls-for-swift-withdrawal-of-remaining-restrictions-in-kashmir.html
204,14-2-20,AAP will fight all local bodies elections across India to expand base: Gopal Rai,"Buoyed by its massive victory in the Delhi assembly polls, the Aam Aadmi Party has decided to contest all elections to local bodies across the country as part of an ambitious plan to expand its footprint beyond the national capital.

In an interview to PTI, senior AAP leader Gopal Rai said the party has convened a meeting of its national executive on Sunday to deliberate on expanding the party by projecting its ""positive nationalism"".

Rai, a confidante of AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, said the party has set its sight on contesting assembly elections in a number of states including Punjab in the first phase.

""The agenda of Sunday's meeting is to expand our organisation at the national level by including volunteers in large numbers and building party cadre across the country,"" he said.

Rai, a minister in outgoing Kejriwal government, said people will be able to join AAP's 'nation building campaign' by giving a missed call on the phone number -- 9871010101.

""We will reach out to people through this campaign and make them volunteers in large numbers. The party will contest elections of all local bodies across the country. AAP will fight upcoming local bodies elections in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat,"" he said.

Rai called BJP's nationalism ""negative"", asserting that AAP will expand its base by highlighting on ""positive nationalism"".

""In Delhi, we spread positive nationalism which is based on love and respect. The BJP's nationalism is based on hatred and divisive politics,"" he said.

""The experiment done by the AAP in Delhi has become a role model for the entire country. Our nationalism is positive nationalism which gives guarantee of good education, health care and livelihood to every section of the society including farmers,"" he said.

On beng asked about BJP's attack on Kejriwal for reciting Hanuman Chalisa on a TV channel in the run up to the assembly elections, Rai said for the Bhartiya Janata Party, religion is a ""political weapon"", but for the people of the country, religion is a belief.

""The BJP does not respect people of India and it sees every person as its vote bank,"" he said.

In the Delhi polls, the AAP recorded a massive victory winning 62 of the 70 seats while BJP bagged the remaining eight seats. The Congress drew a blank for the second consecutive time.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/aap-will-fight-all-local-bodies-elections-across-india-to-expand-base--gopal-rai-2020-02-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/aap-will-fight-all-local-bodies-elections-across-india-to-expand-base--gopal-rai.html
205,14-2-20,Failed to feel Delhi pulse: Shah,"Motormouths did BJP in, says HM

In a candid admission, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday said his assessment of Delhi Assembly elections went wrong and maintained that the statements like “goli maro” and “Indo-Pak match” (in reference to Shaheen Bagh) by party’s motormouths hurt the BJP’s prospects in the polls.

While maintaining that such remarks should not have been made, he said the Delhi poll results were not a mandate on the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

While Union Minister Anurag Thakur and West Delhi MP Parvesh Verma hogged the limelight for their hate speeches, Shah himself had asked voters to press EVM button in favour of the BJP with a force that Shaheen Bagh felt the current.

“No one has said bahu betiyon ka balatkar karenge (wives and daughters will be raped). But the rest — goli maro, Indo-Pak match — those also should not have made. The party distanced itself immediately,” Shah said, speaking for the first time since the Delhi election results were announced on Tuesday.

“All kinds of workers are there who may say something but the public knows how the party is. But this is not the outlook of the party. May be we have also suffered because of this. We don’t know exactly as voters could not write why they didn’t vote. But maybe this could have been a reason,” he said.

Shah, however, said the BJP does not fight elections just for victory or defeat but believes in expanding its ideology through polls.

Replying to a question, Shah admitted that the BJP may have suffered because of the statements made by some party leaders during the Delhi poll campaign.

The Home Minister said his assessment of Delhi elections went wrong but asserted that the result of the polls was not a mandate on the CAA and the NRC.

Shah said anyone who wants to discuss issues related to CAA with him can seek time from his office. “(We) will give time within three days,” he added. He blamed the Congress for the Partition on basis of religion.

While Shah has now come out against the hate speeches delivered by his party’s leaders throughout the poll campaign, both Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma repeatedly justified their polarising speeches, and no one from the BJP asked them even to apply restraint. Incidentally, the BJP lost the seats where Thakur and Verma made the controversial remarks for the first time.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/failed-to-feel-delhi-pulse--shah-2020-02-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/failed-to-feel-delhi-pulse--shah.html
206,14-2-20,Rumbling in Congress: Reinvent for survival,"Scindia calls for ideological change to remain relevant

The Congress drubbing in the Delhi Assembly elections has led to intense resentment in the rank and file of the party with senior leaders like Jairam Ramesh, Jyotiradtiya Scindia and Veerappa Moily calling for the need to “ruthlessly” reinvent itself to become “relevant”.

Voicing concern over the Congress debacle in the just concluded polls and the crisis it is facing in some States like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, Jairam said the grand old party needs to reinvent itself, while Moily too called for a “surgical” action to revive the party.

Incidentally, former Union Minister P Chidambaram on Tuesday tweeted his rejoice over the AAP’s massive victory over the BJP.

Scindia said the Congress needs to change its working style and ideology. Scindia said the country has changed now, and so his party needed to change its ideology and go before the people.

“This (Delhi Assembly result) is very disappointing. New thinking, new ideology and a new working mechanism are the need of the hour. The country has changed and in this context we should also overhaul our ideology and go before the people,” said the former Guna MP in response to query on Delhi Assembly election results.

Jairam said if the party did not change its course of action then it is staring at becoming irrelevant. The former Union Minister said the arrogance within the party has to go and regretted that even after six years out of power sometimes, some of the party leaders behave like Ministers.

On the leadership issue in the party, Jairam said local level leaders have to be encouraged and nurtured. “We are virtually non-existent in Bihar. We are almost extinct in UP but we are strong in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. In Haryana, we have come back,” he said.

At the same time Jairam claimed the Delhi election result was rejection of Home Minister Amit Shah, who was the chief campaigner of the BJP. “It is a resounding slap on his face and it is a rejection of the language used in the campaign, tactics used in the campaign,” he said.

Moily said the party is concerned and worried about the humiliating defeat in Delhi.

“We are concerned. The scenario of Delhi is that people (voters) didn’t take Congress seriously. They thought they should not divert their votes, our own vote banks which normally used to come to us, have gone to AAP,” Moily said.

“Congress requires total rejuvenation. You can’t point (fingers at) out one or two leaders (for electoral setbacks), accountability will have to be taken by every Congressman. Now, this is the time to act for rejuvenation of the party. It has to be revamped. Surgical action will have to be taken so that it starts yielding the results,” Moily added.

The knives were out with leaders blaming each other and raising questions on whether the grand old party has outsourced the task of defeating the BJP to others. AICC Delhi in-charge PC Chacko before resigning from his post sought to put the blame for the party’s decline in the national Capital on late Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, saying the Congress started losing ground here in 2013.

With party colleague Milind Deora slamming him for his comments, Chacko said he had not named Dikshit and his remarks were wrongly being interpreted to run a campaign against him.

Delhi Congress leader Sharmistha Mukherjee a day earlier expressed her annoyance over senior leaders of the party including former Union Minister P Chidambaram who praised Arvind Kejriwal’s AAP resounding victory in the Delhi polls. Sharmistha pointed that Congress’s abysmal showing in elections were due to no state-level strategy, no grassroots connect and exalted echo chambers etc.

“AAP won, bluff and bluster lost. The people of Delhi, who are from all parts of India, have defeated the polarising, divisive and dangerous agenda of the BJP,” said P Chidambaram has tweeted to which Sharmistha, chief of the Congress women’s wing in Delhi, replied: “With due respect, sir, just want to know -- has (the Congress) outsourced the task of defeating BJP to State parties? If not, then why are we gloating over the AAP’s victory rather than being concerned about our drubbing.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rumbling-in-congress--reinvent-for-survival-2020-02-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/rumbling-in-congress--reinvent-for-survival.html
207,14-2-20,Two institutes renamed after Sushma Swaraj,"Govt: Tribute to ‘invaluable contribution’ of ex-Minister

The Government on Thursday renamed Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra and Foreign Service Institute after late Sushma Swaraj. The decision to name the two institutes after her came a day before her 68th birth anniversary.

Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra, a cultural centre reflecting India’s connect with its diaspora, was renamed Sushma Swaraj Bhavan in honour of the late External Affairs Minister known for her empathy in reaching out to distressed Indians globally. Foreign Service Institute, a renowned institution where diplomats are trained, has also been renamed Sushma Swaraj Institute of Foreign Service.

The illustrious leader who brought rare empathy and a human approach to India’s diplomacy as External Affairs Minister in the previous Narendra Modi Government died on August 6 last year following a massive cardiac arrest.

The Ministry of External Affairs, in a statement, said the two institutions have been renamed in solemn tribute to the “invaluable contribution” of Sushma to Indian diplomacy, the cause of the Indian diaspora and the ethos of public service.

“The announcement is being made on the eve of her birth anniversary falling on February 14 in honour of the legacy and decades of public service of the former External Affairs Minister,” it said.

As External Affairs Minister, Sushma brought a sense of assertiveness in India’s diplomacy besides engaging the diaspora, a central focus of the country’s foreign policy priorities. Sushma was one of the most followed Foreign Ministers on Twitter globally.

She was known for helping Indians stuck abroad as she was quick to respond to their calls for help on Twitter. Sushma even became popular in Pakistan for her response to people wanting to get visas for medical treatment in India.

Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra located in the heart of the Capital was set up to recognise the contributions of the overseas Indian community to India’s growth and development. A museum in the Kendra depicts the history of migration of the overseas Indian community as well as their experiences and contributions.

Swaraj had many firsts to her credit -- the youngest Cabinet Minister in the Haryana Government, the first woman Chief Minister of Delhi and the first woman spokesperson for a national political party in the country.

She was Information and Broadcasting Minister in the 13-day Atal Bihari Vajpayee Government in 1996 and got the Cabinet portfolio again after he led the BJP to power in 1998. She was also the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha between 2009-14. Swaraj, a law graduate who practised in the Supreme Court, was elected seven times as a Member of Parliament and three times as a member of the legislative Assembly.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/two-institutes-renamed-after--sushma-swaraj-2020-02-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/two-institutes-renamed-after--sushma-swaraj.html
208,14-2-20,"14 die, 25 injured as bus rams into standing truck on Lucknow e-way","Fourteen people were killed and 25 injured when a bus rammed into a stationary truck on the Agra-Lucknow expressway in Firozabad on Wednesday night. “The toll in the bus accident has gone up to 14. Besides, 25 injured are undergoing treatment in different hospitals,” Senior Superintendent of Police Sachindra Patel said.

SP (Rural) Rajesh Kumar said the accident took place around 10 pm on Wednesday in the Nagla Khanagar police station area when the double-decker bus carrying passengers from Delhi to Motihari, crashed into the stationary truck.

There were around 50 people on the bus at the time of the accident, Kumar said.

The cleaner of the truck, who was also injured, said, “I was changing the deflated tyre of my truck by the side of the road when a speeding bus coming from behind dashed into it. My associates, including the driver, are badly hurt.”

One of the passengers, who was admitted to Etawah hospital, told news persons that he lost consciousness after the crash.

“When I regained consciousness, I found everything around me lying broken. I was on the upper floor of the sleeper bus when the accident occurred. I was brought here (Saifai hospital in Etawah) in an ambulance later. All the passengers were from Bihar. I don’t know what happened to the one who was sleeping on the adjoining seat,” he said.

Meanwhile, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath directed district officials to ensure proper treatment of the injured, a senior official said in Lucknow. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences to the families of the deceased and wished the injured a speedy recovery. “The road accident on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway in Uttar Pradesh has caused deep grief.

209,14-2-20,Candidates’ criminal cases to go public within 48 hrs of picking,"SC asks parties to upload details of pending cases on their websites

Holding that candidates for elections should not be selected merely on their “winnability”, the Supreme Court on Thursday directed political parties to make public within 48 hours details of pending criminal cases against them, in a far-reaching verdict aimed at decriminalising electoral politics.

The political parties were ordered to upload on their official websites and social media platforms details of the pending criminal cases against their candidates and the reasons for selecting them with the court observing there has been an “alarming increase” in the incidence of criminals in politics since the 2004 Lok Sabha elections.

The court said this should be done within 48 hours of the selection of the candidate for Lok Sabha and Assembly polls or at least two weeks before the first date for filing of nominations, whichever is earlier.

“The political party concerned shall then submit a report of compliance with these directions with the Election Commission within 72 hours of the selection of the said candidate,” said the Bench of Justices RF Nariman and S Ravindra Bhat.

The court also directed as to why other individuals without criminal antecedents could not be selected as candidates. Besides making available the details of the pending criminal cases on the official social media platforms of the political parties, including Facebook and Twitter, the court directed it should be also published in one vernacular and one national newspaper.

The reasons for selecting candidates having pending criminal cases should be with reference to their qualifications, achievements and merit and not merely on “winnability” at the polls, it said.

“It appears that over the last four general elections, there has been an alarming increase in the incidence of criminals in politics,” the SC said referring to the data placed before it.

“We have also noted that the political parties offer no explanation as to why candidates with pending criminal cases are selected as candidates in the first place.”

If a political party fails to submit the compliance report of the directives with the Election Commission, the poll panel “shall bring such non-compliance” to the notice of the Supreme Court “as being in contempt of this Court’s orders/ directions”, the Bench said.

The apex court delivered the verdict on a contempt plea which raised issues regarding criminalisation of politics in India and claimed that directions given by the top court in its September 2018 verdict relating to disclosure of criminal antecedents by candidates are not being followed.

The top court noted that 24 per cent of the MPs had criminal cases pending against them in 2004 while in 2009, it went up to 30 per cent.

In September 2018, a five-judge Constitution bench unanimously held that all candidates will have to declare their criminal antecedents to the Election Commission before contesting polls and called for a wider publicity, through print and electronic media about antecedents of candidates.

Referring to the 2018 verdict, the bench said, “In this judgment, this court was cognisant of the increasing criminalisation of politics in India and the lack of information about such criminalisation amongst the citizenry.”

The bench, which passed the directions on Thursday in exercise of its powers under Articles 129 and 142 of the Constitution, said the apex court had passed directives in the 2018 verdict “in order to remedy this information gap”.

“It shall be mandatory for political parties [at the central and State election level] to upload on their website detailed information regarding individuals with pending criminal cases (including the nature of the offences, and relevant particulars such as whether charges have been framed, the concerned Court, the case number etc.) who have been selected as candidates, along with the reasons for such selection, as also as to why other individuals without criminal antecedents could not be selected as candidates,” it said.

In its September 2018 verdict, the top court had left it to Parliament to “cure the malignancy” of criminalisation of politics by making a law to ensure that persons facing serious criminal cases do not enter the political arena as the “polluted stream of politics” needs to be cleansed.

During the hearing on the contempt plea, the EC had told the court that increase in number of MPs having pending criminal cases was “disturbing”. The poll panel had agreed with the suggestions of senior lawyer Gopal Sankaranarayanan, representing BJP leader and petitioner Ashiwini Upadhyay, including that all political parties should mandatorily upload on their website details of candidates with criminal antecedents along with the reasons as to why those without any criminal record could not be selected.

However, the EC said it was not agreeable to the suggestion regarding penalising the political party or its candidates under Article 324 of the Constitution for their failure to disclose criminal antecedents, as it does not have this power.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/candidates----criminal-cases-to-go-public-within-48-hrs-of-picking.html
210,14-2-20,NSA slapped against Dr Kafeel Khan for anti-CAA speech at AMU,"The Uttar Pradesh Police has slapped the stringent National Security Act (NSA) against Dr Kafeel Khan, who is in jail for allegedly delivering a speech at the Aligarh Muslim University against the amended Citizenship Act.

Dr Khan is lodged in Mathura jail despite a bail granted to him in connection with the speech in December.

""NSA has been slapped against Dr Kafeel Khan. He will remain in jail,"" Aligarh SSP Akash Kulhari told PTI.

The NSA allows preventive detention for months if the authorities are satisfied that the person is a threat to national security or law and order.

Dr Khan was arrested by the UP Special Task Force from Mumbai on January 29 in connection with the speech he had delivered during an anti-CAA protest at Aligarh Muslim University on December 12.

A case was registered against him at the Civil Lines police station in Aligarh on the charge of promoting enmity between different religions. After his arrest, Dr Khan was brought to Aligarh and then immediately shifted to the district jail in neighbouring Mathura.

This was done as a precautionary measure in view of the anti-CAA protests at the AMU campus and at Eidgah grounds in the old quarters of the city. Dr Khan's presence in Aligarh jail could have worsened the law-and-order situation in the city, the police had said.

The doctor was earlier arrested for his alleged role in the death of over 60 children within an week at the BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur in August 2017. Short supply of oxygen at the children's ward was blamed at that time for the deaths.

About two years later, a state government probe cleared Khan of all major charges, prompting him to seek an apology from the Yogi Adityanath government.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nsa-slapped-against-kafeel-khan-2020-02-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/nsa-slapped-against-dr-kafeel-khan-for-anti-caa-speech-at-amu.html

215,14-2-20,Cong''s ''disappearance'' led to BJP''s defeat in Delhi: Javadekar,"Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Friday said the ""sudden disappearance"" of the Congress was responsible for the BJP's defeat in Delhi Assembly polls as it led to a direct fight between his party and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).

The Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP swept the Delhi Assembly polls by winning 62 of the total 70 seats. While the BJP won eight seats, the Congress failed to open its account for the second consecutive election.

""The (BJP's) defeat in Delhi elections was because of the sudden disappearance of the Congress. It is a different subject whether the Congress disappeared (on its own), people made it disappear or whether their votes got transferred (to AAP),"" Javadekar said in a press conference here.

He said the Congress, which had got 26 per cent votes in Lok Sabha elections, could win only 4 per cent votes in Delhi elections.

""Because of Congress's disappearance, there was a direct fight between the BJP and the AAP. We had expected 42 per cent votes for us and 48 per cent for AAP, but our prediction failed by 3 per cent each. We (BJP) got 39 per cent votes, while the AAP received 51 per cent votes,"" he said.

The minister said that ups and downs were bound to happen in elections.

""But the BJP does an analysis of all these things,"" he added.

When asked about his remarks, in which he had described Kejriwal as a ""terrorist"", he said he had never made this kind of statement.

Earlier this month, Javadekar had said that Kejriwal had called himself an ""anarchist"" and there is not much of a ""difference between an anarchist and a terrorist"".

Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday said that hate speeches like 'goli maro' and 'Indo-Pak match' made by BJP leaders during the Delhi Assembly election campaign may have resulted in the party's defeat.

When asked about Shah's remarks, Javadekar said his observations are important.

""But there are other reasons for the defeat and the review will be done,"" he said.

""Ours is a party that keeps learning. We learn from our victories and defeats. So an analysis of the defeat will be done at the party level,"" Javadekar said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cong--s---disappearance---led-to-bjp--s-defeat-in-delhi--javadekar-2020-02-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/cong--s---disappearance---led-to-bjp--s-defeat-in-delhi--javadekar.html
216,14-2-20,Japan lets some passengers leave ship for quarantine on land,"Japan on Friday began allowing elderly passengers who test negative for the new coronavirus to leave a quarantined cruise ship and finish their isolation in government-designated lodging.

Japan's government has given passengers aged 80 or older in poor health or confined to windowless inner cabins on the Diamond Princess the chance to move from the ship to accommodation on land.

But only those who test negative for the virus that has so far infected more than 200 people on board the ship have the option to move.

The first of them departed the massive cruise ship on Friday afternoon, travelling in buses with blacked out windows.

At the wheel, one driver was dressed in a head-to-toe white protective suit, complete with goggles and mask.

A government official said 11 people had left, but declined to say whether more would depart Friday or offer further details. The move comes a day after the number of infections diagnosed on the ship rose to 218.

Senior health ministry official Gaku Hashimoto boarded the ship Friday morning to announce that all passengers ""who are considered to be high risk in general health"" would now be tested for the virus.

""Those who test positive will be transferred to the hospital. Those who test negative will -- at the request of the individual -- disembark and be transferred to accommodation provided by the government,"" he said in a statement in English read out by the ship's captain in a public broadcast.

There were more than 3,700 people on the ship when it arrived off the Japanese coast last week, but those diagnosed with the virus have been taken off the boat, along with some people suffering other health conditions requiring medical attention.

Ten of those hospitalised are now in serious condition, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Friday.

Excluding the cases on the ship, and an infected quarantine officer, Japanese authorities have so far diagnosed 36 people with the newly named COVID-19.

The newly diagnosed cases include a woman in her 80s whose positive test result emerged after she died in hospital.

The woman was reportedly the mother-in-law of a taxi driver in Tokyo who has also been diagnosed with the virus.

The Tokyo government announced on Friday two people who were at a new year party the taxi driver attended are also infected with the virus. One of the two had contact with tourists from Hubei, the Chinese province where the virus emerged, the government said.

A new case was also confirmed in southern Okinawa islands with a taxi driver in her 60s. She is likely to have had contact with passengers of the Diamond Princess when the ship stopped by at an Okinawan port, the prefecture said.

A doctor in Wakayama prefecture and a patient treated in the hospital where the doctor worked have also been diagnosed.

Officials in the region said they were still not sure if the doctor had infected the patient.

""It is difficult to trace the route of the infection"", governor Yoshinobu Nisaka told reporters. He said officials were asking people in the area ""to report suspicious cases of pneumonia so that we can immediately conduct tests"".

The hospital has been closed to visitors and medical staff are now being tested for the virus, Nisaka added.

Despite the new infections, government officials sought to play down concerns about the spread of the virus in Japan.

""There is not enough epidemiological evidence to suggest that the epidemic is spreading inside Japan,"" government spokesman Yoshihide Suga told reporters.

""We will keep collecting epidemiological information including on the routes of infection."" The Diamond Princess has been quarantined off Japan since early February after it emerged a former passenger who got off the boat in Hong Kong had tested positive for the virus.

The quarantine is due to end on February 19 and those on the ship have been mostly confined to their cabins and asked to wear masks and keep their distance from other passengers during brief outings on open deck.

Crew on board have expressed concern that their conditions -- including shared cabins, bathrooms and workspaces -- put them at greater risk of contracting the virus.

On Friday afternoon, the crew distributed iPhones to passengers on board, with the captain saying the handsets had been sent by the Japanese government and were loaded with an application that would help them get medical support.

Japan has evacuated hundreds of its citizens from Hubei Province, and officials said a fifth flight would be sent on Sunday to bring people home. The government raised the travel warning for Hubei to level three from two on the country's four-point system, advising people not to travel for any reason.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/japan-lets-some-passengers-leave-ship-for-quarantine-on-land-2020-02-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/japan-lets-some-passengers-leave-ship-for-quarantine-on-land.html
217,14-2-20,"Relative killed couple, 3 kids for just Rs 30,000, Bhajanpura killer held","A 26-year-old man was arrested on Thursday for allegedly killing five members of a family, including three children, over Rs 30,000 payment dispute in North-East Delhi’s Bhajanpura, police said.

Accused Prabhu Nath is a relative of the family and killed four of the family within a span of around four hours, police said. Decomposed bodies of an e-rickshaw driver Shambhu Chaudhary (43), his wife Sunita (37) and their children Shivam (17), Sachin (14) and Komal (12) were found in their rented house on Wednesday.

During interrogation, Nath confessed to his crime. He said he works in a coaching institute at Laxmi Nagar and also used to work as an agent of a money lender for collection of interest amount. He had borrowed Rs 30,000 from Shambhu and had disbursed the same in the market for interest earning,” DCP (Northeast) Ved Prakash Surya said.

On the day of incident at 3.36 pm, Nath had called Shambhu to Laxmi Nagar. When Shambhu went to Laxmi Nagar, Nath went to his house where Sunita was alone. He throttled Sunita’s neck and hit her on the head with an iron rod. When her daughter Komal returned from tuition, she too was killed in the same manner.

Nath killed Shivam and Sachin on their return from school by hitting them on the head with the iron rod. He then locked the house to meet Shambhu. They both had liquor. When they returned to the house, Nath fatally hit Shambhu on the head with the iron rod, Surya said.

218,14-2-20,Microsoft CEO Nadella to visit India on Feb 24,"Around the time US President Donald Trump will be visiting India this month, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella will also be in the country.

""Yes, Satya Nadella, CEO, Microsoft, will be visiting India later this month to address customers, partners, young innovators and developers,"" Microsoft said in a statement on Thursday.

Nadella is expected to attend a company event on February 24 and 25.

His visit comes barely a month after he had voiced his opinion on the new citizenship law (CAA). Nadella, who hails from Hyderabad and became the Microsoft CEO in 2014, said last month whatever was happening in India on this new legislation was just bad.

Talking to editors in New York in January, Nadella said he would like immigrants to come and set up startups in India. ""I think what is happening is sad. It's just bad. I would love to see a Bangladeshi immigrant who comes to India and creates the next unicorn in India or becomes the next CEO of Infosys,"" tweeted Ben Smith, editor-in-chief of buzzfeednews.com, who asked Microsoft CEO about the CAA at the meeting.

Later, Microsoft India issued a statement on behalf of Nadella. ""Every country will and should define its borders, protect national security and set immigration policy accordingly. In democracies, that is something that the people and their governments will debate and define within those bounds,"" said the India-born CEO.

""I am shaped by my Indian heritage, growing up in a multicultural India and my immigrant experience in the US.

219,14-2-20,Senate acts to restrain Trump's military powers against Iran,"The Senate approved a bipartisan measure Thursday limiting President Donald Trump's authority to launch military operations against Iran.

The measure, authored by Sen Tim Kaine, D-Va., says Trump must win approval from Congress before engaging in further military action against Iran. Eight Republicans joined with Democrats to pass the resolution by a 55-45 vote.

Kaine and other supporters said the resolution was not about Trump or even the presidency, but instead was an important reassertion of congressional power to declare war.

While Trump and other presidents “must always have the ability to defend the United States from imminent attack, the executive power to initiate war stops there,'' Kaine said. ""An offensive war requires a congressional debate and vote.'' The Democratic-controlled House passed a separate, nonbinding war powers resolution last month.

The House could take up the Senate resolution later this month, said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.

Two-thirds votes in the House and GOP-run Senate would be needed to override an expected Trump veto.

Answering a claim by some of Trump's supporters and Trump himself that the measure would send a signal of weakness to Iran and other potential adversaries, Kaine said the opposite was true.

""When we stand up for the rule of law — in a world that hungers for more rule of law — and say 'this decision is fundamental, and we have rules that we are going to follow so we can make a good decision,' that's a message of strength,'' Kaine said. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, agreed. Lee supports Trump's foreign policy, including toward Iran, but said Congress cannot escape its constitutional responsibility to act on matters of war and peace.

“What the American people and the entire world will see from the debate we're about to have in the Senate is that there is abundant support for the United States taking tough positions with regard to Iran,'' Lee said Wednesday.

""And as part of that we want to make sure that any military action that needs to be authorized is in fact properly authorized by Congress. That doesn't show weakness. That shows strength.'''

The principle of congressional approval is established for an important reason, Kaine said. ""If we're to order our young men and women ... To risk their lives in war, it should be on the basis of careful deliberation by the people's elected legislature and not on the say-so of any one person.''

Trump disputed that, arguing in two tweets Wednesday that a vote against Kaine's proposal was important to national security and pointed to the Jan. 3 drone strike that killed Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani.

“We are doing very well with Iran and this is not the time to show weakness. Americans overwhelmingly support our attack on terrorist Soleimani,'' Trump said.

""If my hands were tied, Iran would have a field day. Sends a very bad signal. The Democrats are only doing this as an attempt to embarrass the Republican Party. Don't let it happen!''

Tehran responded to the U.S. Attack on Soleimani by launching missiles at two military bases in Iraq that house American troops. The attack caused traumatic brain injuries in at least 64 U.S. Soldiers, the Pentagon said..

Democrats and Republicans alike criticised a briefing by the Trump administration shortly after the drone strike, saying US officials offered vague information about a possible attack being planned by Iran but no substantial details.

Kaine has long pushed for action reasserting congressional power to declare war. At Republicans' request, he removed initial language that targeted Trump in favor of a generalized statement declaring that Congress has the sole power to declare war. The resolution also directs Trump to terminate use of military force against Iran or any part of its government without approval from Congress.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/senate-acts-to-restrain-trump-s-military-powers-against-iran-2020-02-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/senate-acts-to-restrain-trump-s-military-powers-against-iran.html

223,14-2-20,US ready to meet India's energy demand; trade talks continue: White House,"The US is ready to supply oil and gas to energy-hungry India as much as it wants as there is a huge potential for bilateral cooperation in the key sector, a top White House official has said ahead of President Donald Trump's maiden visit to the country.

Larry Kudlow, economic advisor to Trump, said that talks are going on between India and the US on a trade deal that could be inked during the visit of the president.

He made the statement while responding to a question about the progress on a trade deal ahead of the presidential visit.

On Tuesday, Trump said he was looking forward to his first visit to India this month and signalled his willingness to sign a trade agreement with New Delhi ""if we can make the right deal"".

Trump will pay a state visit to India on February 24 and 25 at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Responding to another question on the increase in export of energy to India, Kudlow said there is a much greater potential.

""Could be, hope so. Let's remove all the barriers. They (Indians) need energy. We have the energy.

""When we had our bilateral meetings with the Prime Minister Modi, I said, you give me a number (to export energy from the US to India) and I'll meet it,"" Kudlow said.

In his State of the Union address last week, President Trump said: ""The United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, by far"".

In the last few years, America's export of energy to India increased from zero to USD 8 billion last year and this year it is expected to increase to USD 10 billion.

""Our energy trade touched close to USD 8 billion last year. Mind you, this was zero, a few years ago,"" India's new ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu said in his remarks at a reception hosted in his honour by the US India Business Council.

""In fact in 2013, I testified before the House Energy Committee advocating US energy exports to India. In 2017, our leadership decided to elevate our energy partnership to a strategic energy partnership,"" Sandhu said.

According to the US State Department, US energy exports are an important area of growth in the trade relationship. In 2018, India purchased 48.2 million barrels of US crude oil, a significant increase from 9.6 million in 2017.

India and the US have established a Strategic Energy Partnership (SEP) replacing the erstwhile Energy Dialogue. This was done during the last meeting held in New Delhi on April 17, 2018 between Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan and US Secretary for Energy Rick Perry.

The SEP has four primary pillars of cooperation -- Oil and Gas; Power and Energy Efficiency; Renewable Energy and Sustainable Growth; and Coal.

As a first step, they also announced the establishment of US-India Natural Gas Task Force to support India's vision for natural gas.

224,14-2-20,Mini Mufflerman special invitee at Kejriwal’s swearing-in,"Mini Mufflerman” Avyaan Tomar — who stole the hearts and was a rage on the social media platform by dressing up as Delhi Chief Minister and AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal — will be a special invitee at the swearing-in ceremony of Kejriwal at Ramlila Maidan on February 16.

However, the party said no Chief Minister or political leader from other States will be invited for the ceremony that is going to be specific to Delhiites.

An AAP functionary said Tomar has been invited for the oath-taking ceremony. Tomar, who is two-year-old, grabbed the headlines after he was spotted at the party office on the counting day, dressed like Kejriwal — with spectacles, party cap, a sweater and muffler. Many had clicked his picture that day.

The child even sported a moustache like the AAP chief. Avyaan lives at Mayur Vihar in East Delhi. His father Rahul Tomar is an AAP supporter.

After AAP’s Twitter handle posted image of “Mini Mufflerman” wearing spectacles similar to the AAP chief, it went viral within a short span of time winning hearts of users. “He will be the CM one day (with a heart eyes emoji),” wrote a user. “Adorable” and “so cute,” wrote others.

While inviting Delhiites to attend his swearing-in, Kejriwal said, “I look forward to your continued support and conviction that together we can take this model of governance to people across our country.”

He said education, healthcare, water, electricity, women safety and empowerment, among others have now become winnable, mainstream electoral issues. “Thank you for believing in us and for reposing your faith and generous support, without which we would have not been able to achieve any of these successes,” Kejriwal said. “Delhiites, your son is going to take oath as Delhi Chief Minister for the third time. You must come to bless your son. Sunday, February 16, 10 am, Ramlila Maidan,” Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi.

The AAP won 62 seats in the 70-member Delhi Assembly, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) bagged the remaining eight seats.

The Congress drew a blank for the second consecutive time in the Delhi Assembly polls. AAP’s Delhi unit convener Gopal Rai said Kejriwal will take oath with the people of Delhi who have reposed their faith in his leadership, Rai added. “In 2013 and 2015 as well, no political leaders and Chief Ministers from other States had been invited for Kejriwal’s oath ceremony,” he said.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mini-mufflerman-special-invitee-at-kejriwal---s-swearing-in-2020-02-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/mini-mufflerman-special-invitee-at-kejriwal---s-swearing-in.html

In a statement, his family said Pachauri, 79, underwent a major heart surgery before succumbing to his deteriorating health on Thursday. He was admitted to Escorts Heart Institute here on Tuesday.

Pachauri passed away at his residence in the national capital with wife, daughter and son by his side. “His courageous leadership allowed climate change to be recognized world over as the most pressing issue confronting the world and launched a new era of international deliberations and actions,” said his family.

The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) expressed grief over the passing away of its founding director.

""TERI is what it is because of Dr Pachauri's untiring perseverance. He played a pivotal role in growing this institution, and making it a premier global organisation in the sustainability space,"" said Mathur, who succeeded Pachauri at TERI in 2015.

In 2015, Pachauri was accused of allegedly sexually harassing a woman colleague after which he had to quit the post at TERI.

But before this episode, he had a distinguished career whose highest point came in October 2007 when he collected the Nobel peace prize as the head of the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), jointly with former US Vice President Al Gore.

Pachauri won the Padma Bhushan in 2001 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2008, the third and second highest civilian awards of the country.

In the statement issued by TERI on Thursday, its Chairman Nitin Desai hailed Pachauri's contribution to global sustainable development as ""unparalleled"".

""His leadership of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) laid the ground for climate change conversations today,"" Desai said.

""Today, the US-India relationship, is being seen, as the most transformational relationship of our times,"" India's new Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu said in his address to a gathering of American business community at a reception hosted in his honour by US India Business Council (USIBC) on Thursday.

""The relationship has enjoyed strong bipartisan support in the United States. This is an affirmation of our shared values, of our common commitment to democracy and pluralism,"" he said.

Sandhu said the economic partnership between the two countries has grown from strength-to-strength over the years.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set an ambitious target to make India a USD 5 trillion economy by 2024 and the US is a preferred partner in that endeavour, he added.

""Bilateral trade is growing at 10 per cent on a year-to-year basis and has reached USD 160 billion in 2019. Two-way investment between India and US reached USD 60 billion in 2018,"" he said.

""More than 2000 US companies have a presence in India. Over 200 Indian companies have invested USD 18 billion in the US creating more than 100,000 direct jobs,"" he added.

Sandhu said that USIBC under its president Nisha Desai Biswal has become a prominent powerhouse in the India-US policy sphere.

""She is a close friend, and true partner for India - one whom I have had the pleasure to have worked closely with from the Hill to Foggy Bottom,"" he said.

Biswal as the Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia during the Obama Administration played a key role in strengthening India-US relationship.

""She is also, without a doubt, one of the most recognizable faces of the United States in India,"" he said.

""But even as we celebrate the progress we have made, Nisha and I would agree that our task remains unfinished – that the business of this extraordinary partnership between India and the United States is very much a work in progress,"" Sandhu said.

Business, industry, academia, think tanks, civil society, and media all play an important role in building India-US relationship, he noted.

It is in this context that USIBC is an important player – as a strong bridge-builder, and a force multiplier; but most importantly as a mirror that reflects the expectations of the people, he said.

USIBC's role remains integral to the success of both governments, the ambassador said.

Meanwhile, Biswal said Sandhu has been part of this ""US-India story"".

This is Sandhu's fourth stint in the US as an Indian diplomat, which includes two previous postings in Washington DC and one at the Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations in New York.

Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia, Alice G Wells said: ""Ambassador Sandhu is a seasoned veteran of Washington and a true friend of the US-India partnership.""

Under Biswal, USIBC is playing an indispensable role in building the private sector linkages that are so vital to this relationship, Wells said.

Many of the US-India milestones achieved in recent years are due in no small part because of Biswal's efforts, Wells said.

228,14-2-20,Breast milk boosts brain development in babies,"With maternal factors, such as breast milk, having been shown to affect a baby's development, now researchers have found that the carbohydrate, the oligosaccharide 2'FL, found in breast milk enhances cognitive development.

In this cohort study of 50 mothers and their babies, the researchers analysed breast milk composition and frequency of feeding at 1 and 6 months of age.

Cognitive development was measured at 24 months using the Bayley-III scale, a standardised test of infant and toddler development.

""Through our high-throughput analytical platform we can quantify oligosaccharides like 2'FL and many others in hundreds of breast milk samples in a short period of time,"" said study co-author Lars Bode from University of California in the US.

""This technology allows us to associate differences in milk composition with specific infant outcomes like cognitive development, validating existing data from preclinical models or generating entirely new hypotheses,"" Bode added.

The findings, published in the journal PLOS ONE, showed that the amount of 2'FL in breast milk in the first month of feeding was related to significantly higher cognitive development scores in babies by 2 years of age.

The amount of 2'FL in breast milk at 6 months of feeding was not related to cognitive outcomes, indicating that early exposure may be more beneficial.

Using a statistical technique called mediation analysis, the researchers were able to independently evaluate the effects of breastfeeding in general, and the effects of the oligosaccharide 2'FL.

""This enhanced cognitive development in the first 2 years of life raises the question of possible long term impact on a child - in school and beyond,"" said study first author Paige Berger.

These observations allowed the team to conclude that the increased neurodevelopment provided by breastfeeding was due primarily to mothers who were producing more 2'FL for the baby to consume.

229,14-2-20,US brings new charges against Chinese tech giant Huawei,"The Justice Department has added new criminal charges against Chinese tech giant Huawei and two of its US subsidiaries, accusing the company in a plot to steal trade secrets from competitors in America, federal prosecutors announced Thursday.

The case comes as the Trump administration is raising national security concerns about Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer, and is lobbying Western allies against including the company in wireless, high-speed networks.

The new indictment brought by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn adds to the legal woes in the US for Huaweiy, which already faced bank fraud charges in that district and a separate trade secrets theft in federal court in Seattle.

The latest allegations accuse Huawei of plotting to steal the trade secrets and intellectual property of rival companies in the U.S. In some cases, prosecutors said, Huawei directed and provided incentives its own employees to steal from competitors by offering bonuses to those who brought in the most valuable stolen information.

The company also used proxies, including professors at research institutions, to steal intellectual property, prosecutors said.

A lawyer for Huawei did not immediately return a call seeking comment.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-brings-new-charges-against-chinese-tech-giant-huawei-2020-02-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/us-brings-new-charges-against-chinese-tech-giant-huawei.html

231,14-2-20,"Death toll in China's coronavirus nears 1,500 with 5,090 new cases","The death toll in China's novel coronavirus outbreak has spiked to nearly 1,500 with 121 new fatalities reported mostly from the worst-affected Hubei province while the confirmed cases of infection jumped to nearly 65,000, health officials said on Friday.

The hard-hit Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, has reported 116 new fatalities and reported 4,823 new confirmed cases on Thursday, the provincial health commission said on Friday.

The National Health Commission said, with 5,090 new cases the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases soared up to 64,894 as of Thursday.

The commission said it received reports of 121 deaths on Thursday with 5,090 new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection from 31 provincial-level regions.

Among the deaths, 116 were in Hubei Province, two in Heilongjiang, and one in Anhui, Henan and Chongqing respectively, the commission said.

The number of new cases in Hubei Province included 3,095 clinically diagnosed cases, which have been seen as confirmed cases. The new deaths also include eight who were clinically diagnosed.

The latest report brought the total confirmed cases in Hubei province to 51,986, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

The World Health Organisation on Thursday said a sharp rise of 254 cases of COVID-19 (official name for coronavirus) cases in China, due to a change in counting methods, did not represent a big shift in the epidemic.

Of the 254, Hubei and its provincial capital Wuhan reported 242 deaths, the single highest in a day so far.

""This does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak,"" Michael Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies programme, told a press conference in Geneva.

""We're not dealing, from what we understand, with a spike in cases of 14,000 on one day,"" he said.

""This increase that you've all seen in the last 24 hours is largely, in part, down to a change in how the cases are being reported."" Ryan also said he expected members of a WHO-led international mission to China to arrive over the weekend.

233,14-2-20,"Three openers fail seam and bounce test before Vihari, Pujara come to rescue","Hanuma Vihari's gutsy hundred and the seasoned Cheteshwar Pujara's 92 were the bright spots in an otherwise dreadful batting performance by India on the first day of their warm-up game against New Zealand XI here.

All the three designated openers -- Mayank Agarwal (1), Prithvi Shaw (0) and Shubman Gill (0) -- failed the seam and bounce test, falling cheaply.

With skipper Virat Kohli opting for an intense net session over the warm-up game, India managed only 263 with none apart from Vihari (101 retired) and Pujara able to score even 20 runs on a Seddon Park track that had liberal grass covering.

What would worry the Indian team management was failure of all the three openers.

Shaw and Gill were undone by the extra bounce while Agarwal failed to counter to seam movement.

New Zealand pacer Scott Kuggeleijn (3/40) got the ball to rear up awkwardly from length during his first spell and Shaw's dismissal was the ugliest one.

Kuggeleijn, who was hitting the deck hard, got one into Shaw's rib-cage leaving the batsman in no position to duck. The eyes were not on the ball with the bat face closed. The awkward hit ballooned up and was taken by Rachin Ravindra at short leg.

Agarwal, who has been in horrible form of late, then edged an away going delivery to keeper Dane Cleaver behind the stumps.

Another classic Test match dismissal was Gill, who was given the no.4 slot in absence of skipper Kohli.

The snorter from Kuggeleijn grew big on Gill, who tried defending but the thick edge flew to gully making it 5 for 3 in no time.

Ajinkya Rahane (18) was out by the end of the first hour, edging one to the slips, before Vihari and Pujara stemmed the rot and got a 195-run stand.

Once they saw of Kuggeleijn's first spell and the skiddy Blair Tickner, batting became easy in the second and third session.

Once the spinners were in operation, Pujara pulled Ish Sodhi over long leg for a six while Vihari also hit three down the ground off left-arm spinner Ravindra.

Pujara was finally out in the final session trying to hook Gibson even as Vihari got to the three-figure mark.

India lost the last six wickets for 30 runs but what stuck out like a sore thumb was another shot selection by Rishabh Pant when he tried an ugly hoick off Ish Sodhi's bowling only to be caught by the man at extra cover.

Not getting a single match in the limited-overs series must have dented Pant's confidence as he threw away his wicket when he could have scored a good 35 to 40 runs without any pressure.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/three-openers-fail-seam-and-bounce-test-before-vihari--pujara-come-to-rescue-2020-02-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/three-openers-fail-seam-and-bounce-test-before-vihari--pujara-come-to-rescue.html
