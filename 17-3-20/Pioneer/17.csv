0,17-3-20,Caught in a cleft stick,"Though Govt policy disallowed e-commerce platform owners from direct selling, the fine print permitted them to do so through a subsidiary or JV. And they have been doing so

Any announcement of foreign direct investment (FDI) is normally welcome in view of its contribution to capital formation, accelerating economic growth and adding to the foreign exchange kitty. Deviating from this normal practice, last month, the Union Minister for Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal was dismissive about the decision of the Amazon boss to bring a few billion dollars into India. He felt that Jeff Bezos was bringing money to make up for the huge loss the company was incurring in its operations in the country. Losses or gains are intrinsic to any business. So, what was so special about the terse observation by the Minister?

Amazon essentially operates the “market-place” model of e-commerce — a special dispensation carved out by the Narendra Modi Government under which 100 per cent FDI is permitted. The “market-place” is a platform where vendors sell their products to consumers even as its owner (say, Amazon) merely acts as a facilitator.

The market-place owner books orders, raises invoices, arranges deliveries, accepts payments, handles rejections, warehousing and so on but can’t undertake “direct selling.” Considering that the operator only provides services in lieu of a fee, there is absolutely no question of any loss (unless the infrastructure created by him remains idle which is clearly not the case). Yet, Amazon has been incurring huge loss. The money Bezos promised to bring is to plug this loss, instead of adding to the stock of capital, which is the raison d’être behind FDI. In this backdrop, the reprimand by Goyal was not unexpected.

The losses incurred by Amazon and others like Flipkart are due to huge discounts on the products sold on the platform as also expenses on promoting exclusive brands. But discount is normally given by the seller; this is also true of promotion. The service provider can’t do it unless he is also masquerading as the seller. To unravel the mystery, let us look at the 2016 guidelines. The permission for 100 per cent FDI in the “market-place” is subject to two main riders viz, “The entity cannot permit more than 25 per cent of total sales on its platform from one vendor or its group companies. Further, it can’t directly or indirectly influence the sale price.” The devil lies in these very conditions.

Sans any specification as to “who the vendor is”, a firm connected with the “market-place” (either its subsidiary or a joint venture (JV) with an Indian company) is eligible. In other words, each such entity could control up to 25 per cent of sales on the platform. So, you have companies like Cloudtail - an Amazon venture in partnership with a firm owned by Narayan Murthy — operating as lead seller on the platform.

Thus, contrary to the real intent of the policy which disallowed the e-commerce platform owners from direct selling to individual consumers, the fine print permitted them to do so, albeit through a subsidiary or JV. This is precisely what the e-commerce majors have been doing They were operating as direct sellers, controlling inventory, giving discounts and so on. But, why should they be burning cash?

The answer lies in their attempt to capture a sizeable chunk of the market even if it means a couple of billion dollars going down the drain. No wonder, small traders and businesses, whom the e-commerce platform was intended to help (as reiterated by Goyal, time and again) have suffered heavily. This is because the business that should have gone to the former was, in fact, appropriated by the latter i.e. the dominant seller owned by itself.

The All-India Online Vendors Association — an umbrella organisation of small traders — petitioned the Competition Commission of India (CCI) alleging abuse of market dominance against Flipkart India Private Limited, which is into wholesale trading/distribution of books, mobiles, computers and related accessories and e-commerce marketplace Flipkart Internet Private Limited. It is ironical that CCI saw nothing wrong in this practice.

The CCI ruled that looking at the present market construct and structure of online platforms in India, “It does not appear that any one player in the market is commanding any dominant position at this stage of the evolution of the market.” This was bizarre. That a few players connected to the owner of “market-place” are dominating the platform is visible even to the common man, yet the regulator thought otherwise.

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has rightly quashed the CCI ruling and ordered a probe. In another complaint filed on January 13 by the traders’ body Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh (DVM) alleging anti-competitive behaviour by Amazon Seller Services and Flipkart Internet, the CCI had ordered a probe. But the investigation has been stayed by the High Court of Karnataka for two months.

Meanwhile, in a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the Retailers Association of India (RAI) in early 2018 alleging violation of norms for FDI in e-commerce, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had even informed the Delhi High Court (DHC) on October 31, 2018, that it was investigating violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) against Amazon et al. But the proceedings are stuck due to the lackadaisical attitude of agencies and the court.

The judicial proceedings may take long to conclude. But prima facie e-commerce majors can’t get away from the fact that they have violated the spirit behind the policy on FDI in the “market-place.” They are also acting as dominant sellers on the platform and disingenuous bureaucrats have allowed them to do so by suitably crafting policy details.

A clarification issued on December 26, 2018 has not materially altered the position on ground zero. It says, “The owner of market-place or its subsidiary or its JV with Indian company can’t have ownership of the seller. A seller/firm on the platform can’t source more than 25 per cent of its inventory from a firm connected with the latter.”

The “market-place” owner can get around both, first by having less than 50 per cent shareholding in the seller firm and arguing he has no control (albeit majority) over the latter and second with its wholesale arm continuing supplies to the seller but within the 25 per cent threshold. The current state of affairs is doing no good to any stakeholder, be it foreign investors, small traders or consumers. Even as small traders are losing heavily, Amazon et al have a Damocles’ sword hanging over them for all time and the consumer, though a beneficiary currently, will pay heavily in the medium to long-term, as Indian retail gets increasingly cartelised by a few players. The very idea of attracting FDI vide the “market-place” is flawed. The Government wants to have the cake and eat it too. It wants foreign majors to invest heavily in infrastructure for procurement, handling, warehousing, delivery and so on (only to help small traders) but not allow them to sell.

With no permission for “direct selling”, no foreign entity would invest. Yet, if Amazon et al came, that is because they were allowed to sell albeit through the “back-door.” But when there was backlash from small traders, the Commerce Minister was forced to talk of action against these foreign companies.

The Government is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. If it doesn’t take any decisive action against Amazon et al, the wrath of small traders will snowball and could cost it politically in the State elections. On the other hand, if it acts then, it will tantamount to “retrospective” change of policy (with reference to what is written in the fine print) and affect its image as a good investment destination. But allowing things to linger on will only worsen the situation. It should take a clear-cut stance.

The Government should shun the “market-place” model and allow 100 per cent FDI in retail, both online and offline (at present, 51 per cent FDI is allowed in offline retail but that is subject to too many riders. That is as bad as barring FDI). This will fully legitimise the operations of Amazon et al, who are already in direct selling and preserve India’s global image. At the same time, permitting 100 per cent FDI in offline will create a level playing field for brick-and-mortar retail outlets.

It will help small traders by leading to all-round development of infrastructure and offering a wide range of choice for sourcing products. They can and will co-exist with foreign majors. It will be pro-consumer in the long-run with many players catering to their needs at competitive/affordable prices.

1,17-3-20,Prevention is better than cure,"The Coronavirus is more dangerous for cancer patients as their immunity is low. Hence, they must prevent exposure at all cost

Ever since the Coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China became a global pandemic, it has dominated all discourses and platforms with information flowing in from all sources, be it newspapers, electronic or digital media. Amid the worldwide hue and cry, medical professionals are analysing how infective the Coronavirus is, how much damage it can cause in terms of casualties and who are the people most at risk.

It is quite evident from all available information from other countries that COVID-19 or SARS CoV-2 infection has a higher infectivity as compared to other SARS viruses, though lesser mortality. What has been clear so far is that the elderly and people with co-morbidities like diabetes, hypertension, cardiac and lung diseases are at a higher risk of infection and also mortality. To make matters worse, it is being discovered that smokers have a higher risk of infection as their lungs are already compromised due to smoking.

In India, with 113 confirmed cases and two deaths so far, we are yet to know how things would turn out in the next 15 to 20 days and whether those who came into contact with the patients would turn symptomatic or not. A pandemic spreads in four phases and the country is entering the second phase where person-to-person contact has already caused others to turn positive.

Oncologists encounter cancer patients who are either under treatment or on follow-up. What concerns doctors is whether this illness behaves the same way in cancer patients or differently from the normal population. Cancer patients under active treatment have a weaker immunity due to the disease as well as the treatment than cancer survivors or healthy people. This means they can catch an infection much more easily than others. Age and co-morbidities are other factors that increase the chances of the Coronavirus infection being fatal in this population.

A recent research published in a leading international journal says that data of Coronavirus patients collected in China showed that there was a higher proportion of cancer patients among those affected by it, with most of them being lung cancer patients. These were older patients and many had baseline computerised tomography (CT) scan abnormalities in their lungs. Figures from the research showed they had more intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. Mortality was also higher in cancer patients, lesser in cancer survivors and least in the rest of the population.

The medical profession demands healthcare professionals to be available for the care of their patients, especially during an outbreak, even if it adds to the occupational hazard of catching the infection themselves.

A breakthrough advancement grossly underutilised in medicine, which could prove to be a boon in the prevailing situation, is telemedicine. Most of the Government institutes like the Tata Memorial Hospital, PGI Chandigarh and AIIMS in various cities and many more, are well-connected through the NKN (National Knowledge Network) and this should be activated now as this is the need of the hour. In the current scenario, it appears to be an intelligent and resourceful way of allaying patients’ apprehensions and attending to patients who are on follow-up and also those who are asymptomatic. Also it would help in basic care to be provided near their homes in coordination with the treating expert. This would eventually help limit the movement of patients and relatives and protect them from not just inadvertent exposure but also reduce the risk of exposure of doctors and other paramedical staff.

As the old adage goes, prevention is better than cure. It is best to avoid exposure to the virus, which essentially means avoiding non-essential travel or going to crowded places and observing high measures of hand hygiene. Patients on active treatment and more so old patients and those with the mentioned co-morbidities need very strict implementation of these preventive measures and should be more cautious of signs and symptoms.

They should continue to take cancer treatment as per instructions from the treating oncologist along with preventive measures. Whether their treatment should be continued or can be delayed would depend on the diagnosis and has to be discussed with the treating oncologist in detail. Fear of catching the infection should not prevent them from approaching their doctor. Another important preventive step is for the patients to be accompanied by the minimum number of caretakers. Though everyone has to be aware and take preventive measures, it is more relevant for cancer patients undergoing active treatment and in cancer survivors as well.

2,17-3-20,Will superstar ideas deliver a superhit?,"Rajinikanth plans to bring in a welcome change in Tamil Naidu politics and the idea he proposes looks encouraging and inspiring. But as the saying goes, the proof of the pudding is in the eating and the voters will be the litmus test of the thalaivaa’s Utopian ideology

The bugle for the 2021 Tamil Nadu (TN) Assembly election was sounded on March 11 by none other than the superstar of Tamil movies Rajinikanth, who is being seen as a rallying point for all non-All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and non-Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) parties in the State. Though Rajinikanth is yet to announce the name or programmes of his yet-to-be-launched political outfit, the promotional teaser he presented before fans and loyalists evoked a positive response from his well-wishers and critics.

When he made his political ambition known on December 31, 2017, there were many who doubted whether the actor was serious. Spiritual politics was something beyond the comprehension of an average Tamilian, who grew up watching the Dravida Maya (the illusion of being part of a make-believe world of Dravidianism) propagated by EV Ramasamy Naicker and CN Annadurai whom the later day politicians described as Thanthai Periyaar and Perariyaar (Tamil for great father and father).

TN is yet to recover from the shock of the demise of Jayalalithaa on December 5, 2016. The vacuum was further aggravated by the departure of M Karunanidhi, the DMK founder in August 2017. Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi were the pillars of State politics and their exit has led to an irreparable loss to both the parties. The truth is that both the AIADMK and the DMK don’t have leaders who could match the stature of Amma (Jayalalithaa’s followers addressed her as mother) and Dr Kalaignar (ultimate artist), as Karunanidhi wanted people to address him. It is at this juncture Rajinikanth is entering the arena. Though another star Kamal Haasan tested the political waters in the State, his Makkal Neethi Meiam party was submerged by the giant tidal waves of the two Dravidian parties in the 2019 Lok Sabha election.

“The problem with Kamal Haasan is that he is not clear in his ideology or programmes. One need not be a good orator but should have the capability to make his followers understand what he stands for,” says Sam Rajappa, veteran journalist.

It is to this world of uncertainty that Rajinikanth made an entry with his brand of spiritual politics. He made it clear that professional politicians (numbering more than 50,000 each in the AIADMK and the DMK) would not have any place in his political system. “We will run the Government and the party with a minimum number of people. Party workers are needed only at the time of elections. Once we do away with thousands of party posts across the State, corruption will die a natural death,” says the actor while explaining his party’s ideology. It is a strange coincidence that this has similarities to what was proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi (minimum government and maximum governance). Legal luminary Nani Palkhivala used to cite “too much government and too little governance” as the main reasons behind India’s backwardness in his speeches and writings. For the first time in TN’s history, a would-be politician has come out stating that the Chief Minister (CM) and Ministers should be from among the people. Rajinikanth declared that he would not be the CM because he is not cut out for the job. This is something which has gone down well with the people of TN who have seen politics as a dog-eat-dog world where friends turn foes and long-time rivals come together to consolidate power.

People will fall in line when Rajinikanth names the chief ministerial candidate and extend their support to the latter. The party head, who in all probability would be the actor himself, will be the de-facto Leader of Opposition because a committee headed by the former would act as a watchdog to ensure transparency, simplicity and honesty of the Government and governance.

Cynics may say this won’t work in India and will point to the Manmohan Singh-Sonia Gandhi arrangement during the 2004 to 2014 tenure of the UPA Government. Well, it functioned well. Sonia wanted a servile Prime Minister and Manmohan proved to be the right person for the job. But Rajinikanth is no Sonia and he would never opt for a Manmohan.

Rajinikanth also declared that 50 per cent of the party candidates would be people below the age of 50 with sound educational qualifications and the remaining seats would be allocated to professionals and retired bureaucrats. For some, this may sound like an Utopian concept but it is time for a change in the political ecosystem of TN which has been incapacitated by the stale Dravidian ideology.

While conventional politicians expressed their reservations about Rajinikanth’s way of thinking, he found support and encouragement from the most unlikely source. Subramanian Swamy, the BJP leader who has been a critic of the cinema and drama-based politics of TN was the first to extend a hand of cooperation to the actor. “Rajinikanth has come of age and has started thinking differently from conventional politicians. His spiritual politics has imbibed energy from Indian heritage and culture and this will bring TN back to the national mainstream. The spiritual politics he speaks about is nothing but the Hindutva way of life and the State’s future lies in this ideology,” says Swamy who reveals that he does not know what awaits the BJP in the State.

Rajinikanth earned the goodwill of the people when he spoke against the Dravidian ideology of insulting Hindu gods and goddesses. While addressing the Tughlaq magazine’s anniversary recently, he came down heavily on Ramasamy Naicker for garlanding pictures of Lord Rama and Sita with slippers. Naicker, who is portrayed as a revolutionary leader by the Dravidians, stood only for the rights of the intermediate castes. There is no need to look further to find the root cause of the honour killings in TN despite more than 50 years of Dravidian rule. The AIADMK and the DMK share between them 60 per cent of the votes. The remaining 40 per cent is split between fringe groups, including the Congress and the BJP. The Congress which ruled the State till 1967 has become servile to the DMK and the BJP is yet to take root here. Though the Paattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), a political outfit launched by the Vanniyar community, gave hope of a refreshing change with its out-of-the-box ideas, the party is yet to make major inroads. There is no dearth of fringe groups and leaders in TN but they are all riding on the shoulders of the DMK or the AIADMK. Well, Rajinikanth speaks of a welcome change and the idea he proposes looks encouraging and inspiring. But as the saying goes the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Over to the voters!

3,17-3-20,Registration must for overseas passengers,"Intensifying its efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak, the State Government has made registration of those coming to the State from abroad mandatory, informed Chief Secretary Asit Kumar Tripathy at a Press conference here on Monday.

Anyone coming to the State from abroad has to register himself or herself mandatorily in the toll-free number ‘104’ or the online portal https://covid19.odisha.gov.in. This should be done within 24 hours of arrival with basic details and phone numbers. However advance registration before arrival would be highly preferable. They would be required to be in home quarantine for 14 days, Tripathy said.

They would be given an incentive amount of Rs 15,000 for registration and home isolation. Their locations would be tracked during their home isolation and mandated number of calls would be made every day to keep a close watch and give appropriate medical guidance, he said.

However, to trace and track the persons who have already entered the State on or after March 4, a 48-hour period from 6 am of March 17 to 6 am of March 19 has been allowed for them to register themselves. Registrations can be done by the passengers or relatives or friends.

Anyone not complying with the instructions would be punished under the provisions of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), he said. This regulation would be in force till April 15 and may be extended basing on the situation, the Chief Secretary added.

Notably, Odisha is the first State in the country to have made such a regulation to combat the COVID-19.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/registration-must-for-overseas-passengers.html

In consultation with the municipal corporations of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack, the police enforced social distancing measures by preventing people from congregating in large numbers.

All shopping malls in the jurisdiction of the Twin City Police Commissionerate would remain closed till March 31.

The closure order in respect of malls would not cover shops and commercial establishments selling groceries, vegetables, fruits, milk, medicines and other daily essential requirements

All commercial establishments, Government offices would have to take strict social distancing measures like:

(1) Limit the number of persons entering into their premises at any given time.

(2) Ask customers and employees to maintain six-feet distance.

(3) Don’t hold any promotional events, workshops, entertainment programmes, non-essential meetings and conferences, etc.

(4) Owners, occupants, managers of such commercial establishments/offices must ensure strict hand hygiene and respiratory etiquettes of their employees and provide for hand-wash with soaps and water and/or alcohol-based sanitization liquids. They would also ensure sanitisation of table surfaces, doorknobs, light switches, handles, phones, keyboards, toilets, etc.

(5) Not permit any employee with fever and dry-cough to work in their premises.

The order came into effect from Monday. Any establishment office failing to comply with the orders shall be liable to fine/prosecution/closure as may be considered necessary under the law. All police officers above the rank of ASIs may visit any such establishment and initiate appropriate legal action for violation of the order.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/city-police-orders-social-distancing-measures.html
5,17-3-20,State to get less Central taxes in coming years,"In coming years, Odisha would be getting a lesser share from Central taxes, according to the Fifteenth Finance Commission (FFC) recommendations.

Based on FFC recommendations, the Central Government has already curtailed its grants to the State by Rs 3,000 crore for 2019-20.

In coming years, the State would also receive lesser amounts Central grants as the FFC has adopted 2011 population growth rate as its mandate replacing 1971 population criteria for determining devolution of Central taxes.

Odisha’s share of the country’s total population declined to 3.53 per cent in 2011, which was 4.04 per cent in 1971. So, the State would get less share from Central taxes, which would pose serious problem for the State, said officials.

While earlier Odisha was getting grants at 4.641 per cent, now it is getting 4.629 per cent under the revised formula of FFC.

During the last financial year, Odisha had received around Rs 37,000 crore from the divisible pool of Central taxes. However, it would receive Rs 34,000 during the current year.

While mining royalty contributes 25 per cent to States’ own revenue, non-revision of mining royalty for years has added to the woes. Royalty on coal, iron ore manganese and other major minerals have not been revised despite repeated requests made by the State Government.

Again, as mining blocks being auctioned and they would take time for operation, the State is likely to earn less royalty.

The State may opt for more market borrowings to make up its fund need.

6,17-3-20,"‘Increase Home Guards, Civil Defence spending share’","The State Government has requested the Union Government to enhance Central share of financial assistance for Home Guards and Civil Defence to 50-basis point.

Now the Central and State shares for spending towards Home Guard and Civil Defence is 25:75.

As many as 16,865 Home Guards are now serving as an auxiliary force to Odisha police.

They are engaged in maintaining internal security, providing essential services during emergency, traffic management and all sorts of services.

With growing requirement and pressure on the State exchequer rising, the State has appealed to the Centre to hike the share basis to 50:50.

Several State Governments have also put this demand, according to sources.

As the Home Guards are participating in the disasters for rescue operations, they require skill training to face situations. Establishment of a training institute is required, argued the State Government.

Similarly, Civil Defence Organization is having volunteers in several urban zones of the State.

These volunteers are serving in 11 districts of Khordha, Angul, Sundargarh, Koraput, Jagatisnghpur, Kendrapada, Bhadrakh, Baleswar, Ganjam, Puri and Dhenkanal.

They have displayed outstanding performance in the time of natural disasters. Civil Defence volunteers have received President and Chief Minister’s awards for their exemplary work during the time of disasters like Cyclone Fani.

7,17-3-20,America’s big gamble,"The US-Afghan peace deal has complicated matters. Russia and China have moved dexterously to protect their interests in the region. Both can leverage ties with Pakistan to contain the Taliban

Afghanistan’s peace process has stumbled as talks between the Government and the Taliban in Oslo, Norway, could not begin on March 10, as President Ashraf Ghani’s rival, Abdullah Abdullah, held a parallel swearing-in ceremony on March 9, repudiating the results of the September 2019 election. Abdullah had challenged the 2014 verdict, too, but accepted a US-brokered deal, wherein he was to be made Prime Minister, but was instead given the designation of Chief Executive Officer. In Afghanistan, observers believe that Abdullah enjoys more support from major political parties and players.

On March 10, the UN Security Council unanimously recognised the Doha deal (February 29, 2020) between the US and the Taliban as part of “significant steps towards ending the war” in Afghanistan and to provide “sustained support” to achieve peace through negotiations. However, experts observed that the Doha deal contradicts US commitments to the internationally recognised Government headed by Ghani. The resolution was amended to allow Beijing to promote the Belt and Road Initiative for reconstruction of Afghanistan while Moscow inserted a paragraph regarding “the urgent need for all Afghan parties to counter the world drug problem with the goal of combating traffic in opiates originating from Afghanistan.”

Washington’s hurry to sign the deal with the Taliban without resolving the deadlock in Kabul does not bode well for the region. Many have questioned the bilateral pact as the Taliban did not renounce the Al Qaeda and made no commitments regarding the rights of Afghan women (the excuse for the 2001 invasion) or human rights of Afghans. The Taliban pledged to prevent the use of Afghanistan’s territory for terrorist attacks on the US and “its allies” but was silent about its bases in Pakistan, Ayman al-Zawahiri, who escaped to Pakistan in 2001 with Osama bin Laden and Sirajuddin Haqqani.

Excluded from the deal, President Ashraf Ghani refused to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners in exchange for 1,000 Afghan Government prisoners but later offered to release 1,500 by the end of March and the remaining 3,500 in groups of 500 every fortnight after the intra-Afghan talks begin. Ghani is demanding reduction in violence as the Taliban continues attacks in rural areas though it has spared cities and district headquarters after Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar had a telephonic conversation with US President Donald Trump. Ghani also wants all released prisoners to give a written promise not to return to the battlefield. The Taliban insists that all the 5,000 prisoners must be released before talks begin.

The deal is contentious as it puts the fate of the new Kabul Government in peril as few expect the Taliban to settle for power-sharing. Reports from Washington suggest the US Government has “persuasive intelligence” that the Taliban will renege on its promises; Trump admitted on March 6 that the Taliban could “possibly” overrun the Afghan Government after troops withdraw. Pointing out that at the pinnacle of the Taliban power in 2000, only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had recognised the regime, Brookings scholar Bruce Riedel said President Trump’s agreement “is strikingly reminiscent of Nixon administration’s deal with North Vietnam in 1973, which excluded the South Vietnam Government.”

Former director of National Intelligence, John Negroponte, observed that the deal lacked a meaningful enforcement mechanism and peace between the Afghan parties requires continued US support to the current Government and retaining at least some military capability in the event of large-scale conflict. He said the bilateral agreement opened the door to differing interpretations about what was agreed, as already evident in the prisoner exchange issue. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has admitted that the Taliban made over 70 attacks on the Afghan Government forces after signing the agreement and said the accord would not move forward if the Taliban reneged on its promises.

Some observers wonder if complete troop withdrawal is envisaged, as this would mean shutting nearly 400 US and coalition bases, including camps, forward operating bases and combat outposts. Given Washington’s renewed assertion vis-à-vis Moscow, Beijing and Tehran, it is unlikely that it would give up bases in Afghanistan, the heartland of the great game. The alleged secret annexures to the Doha deal possibly include retention of bases, with passive US military presence.

There are misgivings in Kabul. A day before the pact was signed, Afghan Vice President Amrullah Saleh recalled the horrors of the Taliban rule from 1996 and said people fear a return to that medieval wasteland, which Pakistan will use to spread its influence across Central Asia and against India. In the recent elections of 2019, a suicide squad attacked his office, killing around 30 people, including two of his nephews. Akram Gizabi, chairman of the World Hazara Council, said the deal is based on American war fatigue and Zalmay Khalilzad is an old associate of the Taliban from 1996, when the US Government held secret negotiations with the Taliban to build oil and gas pipelines through Afghanistan.

Currently, most analysts believe that Pakistan’s intelligence services, particularly the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), could emerge stronger if the talks produce some kind of power-sharing between the Taliban and the Kabul Government. A stronger Taliban will quickly overwhelm the regime and increase Pakistani heft in the region, at least for some time. But this could also encourage groups like the Tehrik-i-Taliban (Pakistani Taliban) to try to take control of the Pakistani State. Islamabad could, thus, find itself riding the proverbial tiger.

Clearly, Washington’s initiative has complicated matters in Afghanistan, in both the short and the long term. Russia and China have moved dexterously to protect their interests in the region and both can leverage their ties with Pakistan to contain the Taliban, if necessary. Washington also needs Pakistan to stabilise the region; Islamabad will have to show smart diplomatic skills. Iran will lean on Russia and China.

New Delhi cannot use Islamabad’s good offices to establish working relations with the Taliban, should it manage to seize power in Kabul. The IC-814 experience is fresh in many minds. India contributed handsomely to Afghanistan’s reconstruction in the post-Taliban years, especially towards the rehabilitation of landmine victims.

We have much to offer a Government that desires infrastructure development, trade and extraction of the country’s untapped mineral resources. The invitation to be present at Doha was not only recognition of India’s positive contributions but also highlighted the failure of multilateral attempts at peace, such as the Heart of Asia process. India will have to watch how events unfold in Kabul.

8,17-3-20,The Corona diplomacy,"With its humanitarian initiative on a shared strategy to contain the virus, the Modi Govt has kept Saarc relevant

By pledging $10 million to a pool of funds and offering to share expertise to combat the dreaded Coronavirus in South Asia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not only seized the humanitarian initiative beyond the borders but has found a good enough reason to revive regional cooperation. With this move, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which was running aground because of India-Pakistan tension and anxieties among sub-continental nations over dependencies on China, may just become relevant. Skirting the discomfort of politics, there is at least an engagement over shared concerns that has broken the chill among contiguous neighbours. Every nation responded to India’s call although Pakistan did indeed appear churlish and immature by using the platform to raise the lockdown in Kashmir yet again. But Pakistan’s folly has worked to India’s advantage as a benevolent first mover. Like the Kartarpur corridor, the Corona alliance demonstrates that people’s lives are not held ransom to diplomatic concerns. Even Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who has been unhappy about the way India was emaciating SAARC by focussing on other regional groupings, joined the tele-conference although he had just had a kidney transplant. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani raised the issue of his nation’s porous borders with Iran and said a united rapid response system based on telemedicine and physical teams could work to everybody’s advantage. Undoubtedly, desperate times call for desperate measures. Although the combined virus cases of SAARC nations may still be on the lower end of the graph, there are fears of escalation given the densely-clustered population in the region. SAARC nations make for 20 per cent of the global population and a flaring spread here could be deeply problematic and accelerate the scare economy. So a coordinated and a uniform containment approach could prevent South Asia from just tipping over. Already, much politics has been claimed over the disease. First was China’s “keep it under wraps” policy and economic heft in global businesses that prevented Coronavirus from being declared a global pandemic. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has been accused of delaying the declaration and labelling Europe the second epicentre. Second, with most pandemic viruses assigned to Asian origins, India and its neighbours would have a greater stigma in the battle going forward, something which has devastating social and economic impacts. Besides, with Western countries crumbling under oversaturated health networks and melting economies, India has to evolve its own template of aggressive containment with resources particular to the region — a protocol which has been upticked by the WHO, too — and use it to battle the menace in this part of the world. Third, India has an experience in handling mass outbreaks, like Nipah, every season and should use it to strengthen its medical diplomacy. In fact, India has already moved fast on issues that will redefine global stakes of the future. Climate change was one, where India led the fight against developed economies and even steered the International Solar Alliance. And if it does manage to get ahead in disease control this time, it can claim an expertise in the region that is anyway bowing to Chinese dominance. SAARC could, therefore, become a platform for new diplomacy.

The resuscitation of SAARC couldn’t have come at a better time. According to a World Bank report, South Asia is “one of the least integrated regions” in the world and given SAARC’s history and existing grids, it could still be the connective tissue for protecting the region’s resources and interests. It could work around political differences much like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) does, meeting regularly on health, pandemics and cultural activities. There was some momentum recently when 80 agricultural experts and senior officers from SAARC nations addressed climate change and presented their papers at a regional summit. Given the porosity of borders in South Asia, the SAARC module could work in a crisis such as this. Although the Modi Government has consistently amped up the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), it is largely seen as a strategic and security alliance. Besides, it has not quite yielded a free trade arrangement between Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal. Expressly intended to sideline Pakistan in the garb of a counter-terrorist network, its joint military exercises have not attracted enough traction either. In effect, Bimstec works only as India’s watchdog of growing Chinese interests in the littoral States. SAARC could then work as a sub-continental people-to-people platform that could be used as a humanist, soft tool.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-corona-diplomacy-2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/the-corona-diplomacy.html
9,17-3-20,Taxing the driver,"The excise hike in petroleum prices is understandable given the spread of Coronavirus but it has to be a temporary step

The Coronavirus has spooked the stock markets — gains of the past 11 years following the global financial crisis have been wiped out in just over 20 trading sessions in India and the rest of the world. Some of this is undoubtedly due to the automated algorithms controlling trading but even as humans wrested control, there is a complete lack of confidence in the markets. That is because the lockdowns imposed by Governments across the world will have significant impacts on economic activity and sectors. Effects will likely be even more severe than those of the 2008 crisis as there will be thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands of dead people at the end of it, if at all the end can be in sight right now. Without economic activity, tax collection is likely to nosedive. In this environment, most Governments have cut taxes to encourage economic activity. Thus, raising taxes on mobile phones was not necessarily a move that can be defended. But the Government is justifying the increase in excise duties on fuel by saying some benefits of cheap crude have already been passed on to the consumer. While we know that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is railing against this, the fact is that the Government is taking advantage of the fall in global crude prices. Surely, people at the pump could have been given a break but the fact is there will be major costs to the Coronavirus outbreak in India, whether for quarantine centres or testing kits. And then there will be other costs as well — that of reviving and rebuilding economic activity when the crisis subsides. Aviation, travel and tourism sectors have already taken a massive hit. There will be companies who may not be able to survive the outbreak and reconstruction means money that’s going to be in short supply. We must not expect things to get any easier over the weeks or months. Question is while even Rs 1 excise duty hikes have inflated revenues before, will this one work in a low-consumption scenario?

However, this excise duty hike must be a temporary step only as this can start pinching customers when Saudi Arabia and Russia start playing nice with each other again. While taking advantage of the situation to raise some money in tough times is not a bad thing to do, this must just be a stopgap.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/taxing-the-driver-2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/taxing-the-driver.html

13,17-3-20,Monkey population reduces by 33% in Himachal,"The population of monkeys has reduced in Himachal Pradesh by 33.5 per cent a spokesperson of the State Government said on Monday, saying this came out in a survey on population of macaques conducted in the state, except for Lahaul-Spiti.

Salim Ali Center for Ornithology and Natural History (CASON) Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu assessed the population of macaque and presented its report to the State Government recently.

The analysis of the data reveals that the rhesus macaque population has been assessed at 136,443 in comparison to 205,167 of 2015, which is the 33.5 percent decrease in population. Similarly, average troupe size has also decreased resulting in lowering of density hotspots from 263 to 226.

The spokesperson said Himachal Pradesh Forest Department has been undertaking various measures for controlling the population of rhesus macaque. According to the report decrease in the population is a result of various measures adopted by the Forest Department such as mass sterilisation programme, better garbage management, widespread public awareness campaigns, habitat enrichment model adopted by the State and declaration of rhesus macaque has vermin in 91 Tehsil and Sub Tehsil and Shimla Municipal area.

He said that eight Monkey Sterilisation Centers are operational in the State, in which 35 thousand monkeys are sterilized ever year.

15,17-3-20,Capt Amarinder Govt completes three years,"Congress-led Punjab Government on Monday promised to do in the next two years of its term what it was trying to accomplish in the past three. Asking for “a chance” on the completion of three years of his government, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh announced to give one lakh government jobs in the next two years.

Capt Amarinder gave his Government 75 marks out of 100 in a report card, presented by him and his ministers on Monday, with promises of a better performance in the subjects of employment generation, transport sector, illegal mining, corruption, affordable power, among others.

“Out of the total 424 poll promises, the government has implemented 225, while 96 have been partially implemented, and the remaining 103 would be implemented in the coming two years,” said Capt Amarinder while addressing the media in the media conclave along with all the Cabinet Ministers, party MPs.

“We have taken action on more than 75 percent of our promises made to the people of Punjab...I am confident that in the next two years, we should be able to fulfil all our commitment,” he said.

He said: “The Congress party works in a different way, and to ensure that all promises be implemented, the party high command has set up manifesto implementation committee and we will implement the entire manifesto.”

Even as he reiterated “one another time” his “commitment” to punish the guilty of sacrilege, bringing down power rates, de-monopolizing transport business, checking illegal mining, eliminating corruption, among other promises, the Chief Minister could not come up with clear answers on these burning issues riding high on which he came to power in 2017.

Contrary to the people’s high expectations, the Chief Minister did not make any major announcements, except announcing one lakh government jobs, and providing new bus permits in an attempt to end monopolization in transport sector besides reducing road tax.

He also announced to put in place the corrective measures to check illegal mining by Baisakhi, setting up 750 rural sports stadiums to promote sports and improve youngsters’ health, implementing Lokpal Bill covering all from Chief Minister downwards, binging Anti Red Tape Legislation, Land Leasing and Tenancy Bill, besides the State Drug legislation to deal with drug related cases.

Making concluding remarks during the conclave, the Chief Minister announced that one lakh youth will be provided government jobs over the next two year in total 17 state government departments, primarily in health, education, police, and electricity board.

“These jobs will be filled up through a transparent and merit-based system of selection…We also aim to cross the target of 20 lakhs employment facilitation by 2022 of which we have already achieved 12.17 lakh jobs as on today,” he said.

Underlining that the Government has decided to rationalize the electricity tariff in a manner that reduces their burden making it more affordable to the common man, the Chief Minister said that the final details of the new power tariff could be given only after the approval of power regulator — Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission.

“Since the decision to regulate tariff is the jurisdiction of the power regulator, the state is submitting its proposal in this regard to the regulator,” he said while refusing to give details of the proposed tariff reduction and how to counterbalance the loss to be suffered by the State by reducing the domestic tariff.

To ensure “no monopoly” in the state transport sector, the Chief Minister announced that the State Government would soon provide 5,000 new permits for small or mini buses, and 2000 new permits for stage carriage on commercially viable routes.

“After the Supreme Court has upheld the decision of the Punjab and Haryana High Court on illegal extension of routes, I have directed the Transport Department to cancel all such permits,” he added.

Besides, he also announced to bring down the road tax and cess on ordinary buses from Rs 3.08 to Rs 2.96 as well as special one-time amnesty scheme for settling penal interest on non-payment of government dues by transporters, which the state Finance Minister Manpreet Badal claimed that the state would be able to “absorb”.

Facing criticism not only of the opposition but also his own party men over the issue of illegal mining, the Chief Minister said that the state was coming up with new guidelines “before Baisakhi”.

“The Department would examine all aspects and suggest corrective measures witing the next two-three weeks,” said the Chief Minister.

He said: “The sand mafia will not be allowed….I have asked the Minister to thoroughly review and make this system fully transparent…our aim is to ensure steady supply of sand at affordable rate at the pithead with proper use of technology to check any illegal activity by the contractors or illegal miners.”

On the promise of waiving off entire debt of the farmers, the Chief Minister said that the Government has waived off the farmers’ debt “as per our capability”.

“What Punjab has done, it is highest in the country…the maximum limit is Rs two lakh…we cannot go beyond that. And those, who have been left out due to some paper work, would be covered now. Besides, the government will start the debt loan waiver scheme for the farm landless labour as soon as the COVID-19 measures are over,” he said.

The Government will provide relief of Rs 520 crore to 2.85 lakh agricultural landless members if cooperative societies.

He also declared that the Government was soon to take further action in the sacrilege and subsequent police firing cases and would go to the bottom of the cases.

“Let me reiterate that all those persons, whether big or small, who are guilty of ordering firing upon innocent persons protesting the be-adbi of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji will be brought to book, also those responsible for be-adbi of our Guru cannot escape the punishment they deserve,” he said.

Also declaring that the Government has adopted zero tolerance policy against organised crime, he said a Special Operations Group (SOG) has been set up as anti-terrorist crack unit. “One village, one police officer scheme has also been launched to improve people-police interface,” he added.

Declaring that he will not allow mining, liquor, drug and transport mafias, or goondas, gangsters and terrorists to disturb the state’s peaceful environment, the Chief Minister said: “I will be absolutely harsh...As an ex-fauji, I know how to deal with them...Everyone will get a free chance to make the most of the opportunities in Transport and other sectors.”

Vowing to completely eliminate all the mafias from the state, the Chief Minister said his government was working to end all this since taking over Punjab’s reins, “but these things take time.” “We have done our best, and we could not have done any better considering the situation,” he said, complimenting his cabinet colleagues and officers for the excellent job done by them.

Claiming to work hard to break the back of the flourishing drug economy in Punjab, the Chief Minister said: “Let me clearly state that any person, irrespective of his position or political affiliation, if found involved in drug trade, will be taken to task. Drugs and drug peddlers have to go from Punjab whatever it takes,” he said.

Apart from medical colleges at Mohali, Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur, two more medical colleges have been planned at Gurdaspur and Malerkotla, he also announced.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/capt-amarinder-govt-completes-three-years.html
16,17-3-20,"Have no differences with Sidhu, says Punjab CM","Armed with the queries regarding cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu starting his new inning by starting a YouTube channel or directly approaching he party high command, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday played down his differences with his party colleague saying that he has no issues with it.

Capt Amarinder maintained that anyone can start a channel or can even discuss any matter with anyone in the party.

Notably, the former Minister Sidhu, who has been at loggerheads with Capt Amarinder, was blamed for his “inept handling” of the Local Government Department for the party’s “poor performance” in the urban areas during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

In June, the Chief Minister had divested Sidhu of the Local Government and Tourism and Cultural Affairs Departments, allocating him the Power and New and Renewable Energy portfolio after which he had resigned from the Punjab Cabinet.

When asked about the status of the Congress MLA in the party, the Chief Minister on Monday said that he was a Congressman and “we will certainly consider all his wishes” in taking any decision.

Capt Amarinder said that he had known Sidhu since he was a two-year-old and had “no personal issues with him”.

To a question about Sidhu meeting the central party leadership on Punjab issues instead of raising these with the state leadership, the Chief Minister said, “He is welcome to discuss any issue with anyone in the party...If he has anything, which he would like to discuss, he is welcome.”

Sidhu, the previous month, had met Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Delhi and apprised them of a roadmap for the “revival” of the Congress-ruled state ""to its pristine glory"".

Commenting on Sidhu's YouTube channel, Capt Amarinder said: “That is up to anybody. If I want to run a channel who can stop me.”

“WILL DEFINITELY CONTEST NEXT POLLS, STILL YOUNG ENOUGH”

Three years after he declared 2017 state assembly elections to be his last polls, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday asserted that he will be contesting the next assembly elections in the state. “I am still quite young. Do you think I’m too old to fight the polls,” quipped Capt Amarinder.

In 2018, Capt Amarinder had said that he would not hang up his boots until the State was taken out of the “mess”. In 2019, the scion of the erstwhile Patiala's royal family had said that he would not quit politics until Punjab's number one position was “restored”, and he might fight the next assembly polls, if needed.

DON’T GO BY KEJRIWAL’S DRAMA

Dismissing the power subsidy being given by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Government in Delhi as a “drama” by Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister said that there was “no comparison” between Punjab and the national capital as the latter had no farmers or police to take care of.

Kejriwal had reduced domestic tariff through cross subsidy, he said, pointing out that the Punjab Government was already giving much higher subsidy than Delhi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/have-no-differences-with-sidhu--says-punjab-cm.html
17,17-3-20,Cabinet reviews preparedness,"Amidst coronavirus scare, Punjab Government on Monday decided to extend the services of the “retiring” doctors and paramedical staff, working with the State Government in the Health and Family Welfare Department even after their retirement, till September 30, 2020. The decision came days after the State Government announced to doing away with the extension policy and bringing down the employees’ retirement age from 60 to 58.

For the same, a resolution was passed at the meeting giving ex-post facto approval to the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s decision on extending the services of the doctors and paramedical staff working with the Government in the Health and Family Welfare Department till September 30, 2020.

At the same time, the Cabinet also issued a strong appeal to the people not to panic in view of the coronavirus threat but to take all necessary precautions, while avoiding crowded places and mass gatherings.

Taking stock of the situation and the state’s preparedness to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak, the Cabinet also reviewed the reports of seven-member Group of Ministers (GoM) constituted earlier by the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh under the chairmanship of Local Bodies Minister Brahm Mohindra to oversee the preventive measures undertaken to combat the threat. The GoM comprises Om Parkash Soni, Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Razia Sultana, Balbir Singh Sidhu, Vijay Inder Singla and Bharat Bhushan Ashu.

Though Punjab has, so far, reportedly only one confirmed case, no effort is being spared by the State Government to ensure stringent measures against the spread of the disease, which has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Appreciating the efforts of all Departments of the Government of Punjab, the Cabinet appealed to the people to be fully prepared and take all precautions as advised by the Health and Family Welfare Department from time-to-time.

The Cabinet, in its resolution, further appealed to the people to avoid going to crowded places and mass gatherings, to maintain hand and respiratory hygiene, and to ensure the cleanliness of their surroundings. People are also advised to wash their hands frequently with soap and water or hand sanitizer and they should avoid touching their face.

The people have also been advised to avoid non-essential travel, said the resolution, adding that the people who are having cough, sneezing and fever should immediately contact 104-Medical Helpline of the Health and Family Welfare Department or the Control Rooms of their respective district.

Following discussions at the meeting, the Cabinet also appealed to people to either defer wedding functions or ensure that no more than 50 people are present. It also appealed to religious and dera heads to limit the gatherings and educate their followers about the coronavirus dangers.

During the Cabinet meeting, the Chief Minister asked all the Ministers to closely monitor the situation and ensure the implementation of the curbs in their respective districts, in close coordination with the administrative and civic officials.

He urged them to hold regular meetings with the local administration to maintain visibility in their districts and boost the confidence of the people. Capt Amarinder directed the Health Department to ensure that ventilators are available in all district hospitals to deal with the exigency. He further ordered private and state-run buses to carry hand sanitizers for the use of passengers to ensure hygiene in the vehicles and secure the travelers.

Notably, all Government and private schools have already been closed till March 31 in the State. However, medical colleges (senior year students) have been kept open as a support system. The Cabinet decided that MBBS students, who were not employed, should be contacted and asked by the Department to stand by on a voluntary basis.

Detailed instructions have also been issued for closure of all cinema halls, gyms and swimming pools in the state from the midnight of March 14 till further orders. All large public gatherings including sports, conferences, cultural events, fairs and exhibitions, wedding functions, are also prohibited till further orders. The Cabinet has, however, left the decision on closure of malls and marriage palaces to the GoM.

The meeting was informed that the Deputy Commissioners were geared up to launch house-to-house awareness campaign involving all health workers, who are being trained for the purpose, from March 19 to 26.

Training of all the staff of all departments in districts will be completed by March 18, said the state Principal Secretary (Health and Family Welfare) Anurag Aggarwal during the meeting, adding that teams of two to three officials, headed by Group A and B officials, will also be formed by March 18.

“These teams will be assigned villages, areas, locality, wards or colonies keeping in view the population, which will contact each and every household in their assigned areas to educate and inform every individual about the precautions and to inform about any person with symptoms. This will be completed by March 26,” he said.

He informed the Cabinet that 100 samples had been sent for testing till date, of which only one was positive and 95 negative for COVID-19, while the results of four samples were still awaited.

“Medical teams with security personnel have been deputed at both the airports for the screening of the passengers. Mandatory screening of all passengers is being done and self-declaration form is being taken from each passenger to ascertain the travel history of any foreign country from March 13 onwards,” he said.

Adequate stock of PPEs (Personal Protective Equipment), N95 Masks, Triple Layer masks and gloves were available with the Health and Family Welfare Department for COVID-19. Further, procurement of more PPE, N95 Masks and Triple layer masks was under process.

23,17-3-20,UT admn to seek MHA's view on retirement age,"The Chandigarh Administration has decided to approach Union Ministry of Home Affairs to take decision on the issue of retirement age of its employees.

The decision in this regard was taken at the meeting held under Punjab Governor and UT Administration VP Singh Badnore with senior UT officers on Monday here.

The development comes at a time when the Punjab Government has recently decided to reduce the retirement age of its State employees from 60 years to 58 years.

The Administration had recently recommended the UT Administrator that the Punjab civil service rules should be followed by the Chandigarh Administration.

UT Adviser Manoj Parida while talking to the mediapersons on Monday said that the Administration has decided to refer the issue of retirement age of UT employees to the MHA. There are two options, either we will go with Central service rules or with Punjab service rules, he said.

Till the time the Union Ministry takes a final decision on this, we will continue to follow the existing service rules, he added.

The Administration follows Punjab service rules and pay scale for its employees. While presenting Punjab Government’s budget recently, Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal had announced the reduction of retirement age of state employees to 58 years from 60. Employees who have turned 59 would retire on March 31 and those who have completed 58 but are still not 59 would retire on September 30.

If the Administration continues to follow Punjab service rules, the decision will affect a total of 590 employees. There are a total of around 24000 UT employees.

Parida said that while about 240 employees will retire on March 31, another 350 in September as per Punjab’s service rules.

At present, the retirement age for Central employees in most of the services is 60 years, though it is 65 for professors in all Central universities as also for Central Government doctors.

In Administration, the employees who turn 58, which is the retirement age, can be given two extensions of one year each.

ADVISORY COUNCIL MEET LIKELY IN APRIL FIRST WEEK

UT Adviser Manoj Parida said that if situation related to Coronavirus remains under control, a meeting of Administrator’s Advisory Council will be held in first week of April.

The agendas of allowing Apartment Act in Chandigarh and how to deal with stray dogs will be taken up at the Advisory Council meeting, he said.

Advisor said that the long pending issue of whether to allow Apartment Act in Chandigarh or not will be discussed in the Advisory Council. A large section of people have demanded that the Act should be reintroduced in Chandigarh, he said.

The Apartment Act allows bifurcation of the big plots, which interests the owners of many kanal houses in the city.

On the issue of dangerous breeds kept as pet dogs in Chandigarh, the Advisor said that we are mulling to take up this issue in Advisory Council meet. It would be discussed if we can categorize the dog breeds to be allowed to be kept as pets. For this, best practices in India or abroad would be looked into, he said.

The decision came after a recent incident of a pet Pitbull attacking and biting a 25-year-old woman on her right arm and leg in Sector 30 here. The dog’s owner, identified as Prem Chand, was booked after the incident.

Pitbulls were created by crossbreeding bulldogs and terriers to produce a dog that combined the strength of the bulldog with the gameness and agility of the terrier. In the UK, these dogs were used in blood sports such as bull-baiting and bear-baiting.

When asked about the problem of stray dogs in the city, Parida said that the proposal to keep the stray dogs in confinement would also be taken up at the Advisory Council meeting.

On a question related to illegal PG accommodations, Parida said that the Administration would soon put a cap on number of occupants to be allowed in PG facility besides putting a cap of number of rent-deeds to be allowed in a house.

Ignoring the people’s mandate, JJP aligned with BJP and formed the coalition government,"" the INLD leader said, adding that after four month of this coalition government, the situation in the party has become such, that JJP’s 10 MLAs cannot sit together or hold a meeting to discuss on implementing its election manifesto,"" he said.

In October, 2019, after formation of BJP-JJP government in the State, Ajay met his younger brother Abhay which triggered hope that the festering family feud that resulted in the vertical split of the Indian National Lok Dal may soon be a thing of the past. JJP emerged from a split in the INLD (INLD) which itself had been cause by infighting among the Chautala family. Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) was ousted from the power in Haryana in early 2005 and never regained it since then either on its own or in alliance.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---will-leave-politics-if-i-lose-fresh-election-against-dushyant-----abhay-chautala.html

39,17-3-20,Did IGNFA authorities blunder by allowing Europe tour?,"The administration of the prestigious Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy (IGNFA) here seems to have blundered by allowing the Europe tour of the trainees of the Indian Forest Services (IFS) at a time when threat from novel coronavirus was at its peak.

As one trainee has been reported positive for COVID-19, this mistake on part of the authorities has put the lives of more than 1,200 employees and their families residing in the sprawling campus of Forest Research Institute (FRI) where the IGNFA is located, under threat. The trainees left for Europe excursion on February 28 in four groups.

The destinations of these groups were the countries of Spain, Finland, Estonia and Russia. It is learnt that Italy was also on the itinerary of the tour planners but Italian authorities denied permission to the group due to the threat of virus. The trainees returned to the country on March 11.

Here administration of the IGNFA again erred by not getting these trainees quarantined in Delhi itself.The trainees including one patient of the disease traveled all the way back to Dehradun from Delhi exposing people they contacted to the threat of the COVID-19. In Dehradun, the health department of Uttarakhand was informed about return of these trainees from Europe following which a team was sent to the academy.

In Dehradun, two trainees from the group which had gone to Spain and four who have returned from Finland showed symptoms similar to COVID-19 after which their samples were taken and all the trainees were sent for quarantine. It is learnt that the samples of IFS trainees were taken in academy hostel itself which again is the violation of the norms prescribed for quarantine. The authorities went into tizzy when the sample of one trainee who had visited Spain was found positive for the disease on Sunday.

This trainee was rushed to the Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) where he is kept under the observation of the doctors. Invoking the powers given to him under the Uttarakhand Epidemic Diseases (COVID-19) Regulation Act 2020, the district magistrate of Dehradun, Ashish Kumar Srivastava ordered that ‘ A to E blocks’ and western wing of F block of new hostel of IGNFA would be a quarantine zone. Similarly, the eastern wing of F block was made an isolation ward. The administration has also made strict security arrangement in and around the campus.The efforts by this correspondent to get the version of IGNFA officials on the issue were not successful.

Medical experts opine that gross negligence occurred on part of the authorities in organising the Europe tour at the time when the hot spot of disease had already shifted there from China. Spain from where the trainee has got the infection has so far reported 8744 cases of coronavirus with 297 deaths. They fear that IGNFA could become the centre of spread of virus in Uttarakhand.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/did-ignfa-authorities-blunder-by-allowing-europe-tour-.html

41,17-3-20,Stress borne suicidal tendency dangerous for youth: Poddar,"Member of Parliament Mahesh Poddar has expressed concern over the incidents of suicide due to depression by the youth of the country, especially the students. He said that increasing depression among the youth is a big problem and in a country like India where most of the population is young, it is a matter of top priority to overcome this problem. Poddar took up the matter in the Rajya Sabha during zero hour. He demanded to seriously discuss the matter in the House and the government should take necessary measures to control depression among the youth.

Poddar said in the House that according to the data provided by the Ministry of Human Resource Development in the Parliament recently, some shocking details about depression and mental anguish of students in our country have come to light. Data provided by states and union territories shows that between 2016 and 2018, around 10,000 students committed suicide every year in India. There have been 29,542 incidents of suicide in the country in the last three years, of which 4,235 occurred in Maharashtra, 2,744 in Tamil Nadu, 2,658 in Madhya Pradesh and 2,535 cases in West Bengal.

India has the highest suicide rate among children aged between 15–29 years globally and a recent NCRB report states that an average of 28 students commit suicide every day. The common belief is that youth are depressed due to studies and career and are motivated to commit suicide. But an analysis has shown that academic stress is no longer the primary cause of youth suicide. According to the NCRB 2018 data, only 1,529 suicides occurred due to failure of examination, out of an average of 10,000 suicides occurring annually. The remaining incidents were due to family issues, love affair and illness.

Poddar said that there is still not enough discussion in our society about depression and suicide. “The solution to any problem is possible only when we consider it a problem. The problem is that we are not ready to treat depression as a disease and treat it properly. The breakdown of joint families, neglect of our traditional family-social values and blindness of western physical lifestyle is also a big reason for this problem. There should be an open discussion on this subject in all the forums of family, society, politics, etc.

The solution of this problem is possible only if psychiatric consultants are appointed in educational institutions and workplaces,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/stress-borne-suicidal-tendency-dangerous-for-youth--poddar.html

The IMA on Monday came out of its shell, for which it had in the past won more tongue lashing. The first thing that the IMA did was to give a big hand and moral support to civil surgeon Palamu Kennedy saying “ This CS Kennedy opened an extra OPD for visitors having cold cough sneeze and fever on Sunday and examined the visitors on the inaugural day without any panic on his face.”

Vishal Gaurav in his message cleared the big fear and apprehension that chicken eating at this time when coronavirus is most talked about thing is to be strongly avoided said, “Eat whatever you like. Chicken is no forbidden.

Eat as you like. Have other food like fish and meat. Chicken, fish and mutton do not matter anything.”

Gaurav took another common query that a poor man eats stale boiled rice say overnight boiled rice with salt, red or green chili and does the poor man expose himself to cold and cough to which he said “ Cold and cough is no coronavirus. It is a seasonal flu. It can happen to anyone. regards cold overnight boiled rice there is no restriction at all. It depends upon the immunity of the eater of such rice if his or her body bears it well.”On the question of that fingers be not taken down to eyes and ears the doctors attending it looked divided as while Vishal Gaurav said, “Avoid taking your hands right up to your eyes and ears as it is a risk” while on the other hand Arun Shukla president of IMA said quite loudly, “Such curbs are impractical. One cannot be so mindful as to where his hands are going.”

Although this division of opinion was there the doctors had one point of agreement, “Do not panic. Do not get nervous. This phase will be over once Palamu takes to its record history of high temperature.”

Secretary Anwar Nezam was all praise for the Modi government for taking immediate steps in curbing containing and minimising the risk to health here unlike Iran and Italy which got devastated by the catastrophe of this virus. Anwar Nezam spoke of visa curbs, travel scanning and other measures.

He too said no country can afford to make mask available to its entire population.

He referred to Korea which did but he added the demography of Korea is no match to our vast India. Anil Kr Srivastava said, Doctors use masks in OTs and other purposes which are thrown as a mask has a six hour life.

I tell you the discarded masks are now re cycled and sold in market. So beware of this huge health risk.”

The IMA spoke in common language avoiding any larger and noisy medical jargons. The IMA appealed to the people live life of your own without risking the others.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ima-dispels-apprehension--panic-over-coronavirus.html

Though thousands from the Gwalior-Chambal area have resigned from the Congress party along with the MLAs there are many Scindia loyalists who have not yet left the Congress party. Notable names include DCC President Devendra Sharma, senior Congress leader Chandra Mohan Nagori and Ashok Sharma. Currently the political situation in Gwalior is murky and only time will say how things pan out.

The Scindia family of Gwalior has always played a leading role in shaping the political destiny of Madhya Pradesh during its existence of sixty four years.

The current scenario in Madhya Pradesh has once again brought to the front the role of the Scindia family in determining the political future of the State.

The resignation of 20 Congress MLAs loyal to Scindia has thrown the Kama Nath ministry into a minority government. And once again a scion of the Scindia family has become the kingmaker in Madhya Pradesh.

63,17-3-20,Ranchiites start hoarding ration fearing lockdown,"While the fear of Coronavirus has led to a shut down of malls, movie theaters and educational institutions in Jharkhand, some Ranchiites have started stocking ration and other edibles predicting a complete lockdown in future. Rumours spread on social media platforms coupled with the prediction of transportation blockade have resulted in a heavy rush at grocery stores and supermarkets lately.

44-year-old Bansidhar Sarangi, a cricket coach based out of Ratu Road, is one of the many city residents preparing for a possible lockdown. Sarangi has stocked ration for two months and other edibles at home fearing that grocery stores will soon run out of stock. “The owner of my grocery store told me that drivers who bring ration and other edibles to Ranchi might stop doing the trips amid Coronavirus fear. This will cause acute shortage of ration and other daily-use-products across the shops in Ranchi,” he said, adding that last weekend he bought ration for the next two months.

People who bought 5Kg rice have bought 15Kg in the past week or so,” he said.

Rumours spread over social networking platform, WhatsApp, have added fuel to fire and caused panic among many residents of the city.

This shut down will soon affect other cities and cause crisis of ration and edibles, the message added. Similar posts have also gone viral on other platforms such as Facebook.

67,17-3-20,Seminar held on Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act,"National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP), India's apex body representing the rights and interests of persons with disabilities in association with Arushi, organised a state-level seminar on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (RPWD Act) 2016 here on March 16 and 17 at Courtyard by Marriott.

India legislated the RPWD Act in December 2016 and in doing so ensured its commitment to the international community to bring its domestic law in harmony with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which it ratified in October 2007. With the passage of this law, the Persons with Disabilities Act of 1995 stood repealed.

“It is crucial to create awareness about the provisions under the newly enacted law and the various developments that have taken place under it. State-level implementation of the RPWD Act 2016 is important as disability is considered a State subject. The Act acknowledges 21 categories of disabilities and looks at disabilities as a mainstream human rights issue. However unfortunately implementation of this Act varies across States,” said Arman Ali, Executive Director, NCPEDP.

“The new RPWD Act is a game changer as it holds the private sector accountable as well. The responsibility of implementing the RPWD Act 2016 should not be solely on the Social Welfare Department and needs to include other departments like education, health as well,” added Arman.

Krishna Gopal Tiwari, Director of Social Justice and Disabled Welfare Department, Madhya Pradesh Government at the seminar said, “The RPWD Act 2016 focuses on the all-round development of persons with disabilities and hence it becomes more important to have awareness on the same. While special schools are important much emphasis should be laid on inclusive education for children with disabilities.”

Other speakers included Mohd. Kaleem Siddiqui, Asst professor, Digdarshika Institute, Bhopal, Sunil Sharma, Asst Director, Social Justice Department, Dr Ganesh Joshi, Composite Regional Centre, Bhopal and sector leaders such as Dr Rohit Trivedi, Executive Director, Arushi as well over 100 representatives from Disabled People’s Organisations across different districts in MP and Chhattisgarh.

Sunil Sharma, Asst Director, Social Justice and Disabled Welfare Department highlighted the status of implementation of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2016 in the state of Madhya Pradesh.

Sharma mentioned that District Level Committees have been formulated in 50 out of the 52 districts, however no persons with disabilities have been made a part of these committees. He further added that special judges and special courts have been notified in few of the districts. The Seminar was supported by Axis Bank.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/seminar-held-on-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities-act.html

The Directorate called for a meeting with various stakeholders involved in manufacture, supply and sales of sanitizers and protective masks in a bid to get a clear picture on the status of the two commodities – recently included in Essential Commodities Act by the Government of India amid Coronavirus fear.

While suppliers, during the meeting, assured to provide around 10,000 bottles of sanitizers, the Directorate could not get assurance of more than 200 masks by the stakeholders. “Masks do not come under the purview of the drug control directorate, but we will be able to control their supply as they are mostly sold by medicine stores,” said Drug Director Ritu Sahay.

The State governments can carry out operations against order speculators and those involved in black marketing of sanitizers and masks, officials from the Drug Control Directorate said. Offenders may be punished with an imprisonment of seven years or fine or both, they added.

While the virus has claimed over 5000 lives across the globe, primarily in Italy and China, it has affected more than 80 people in India and caused two deaths. No cases of Coronavirus have been reported in Jharkhand so far. However, nearly 100 people here are under observation after returning from countries affected by the virus. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared Coronavirus a global pandemic. The demand for hand sanitizers and surgical masks skyrocketed since Coronavirus entered India through Kerala earlier this year. In Ranchi, N95 masks disappeared from medicine stores and even hospitals. Shopkeepers said that there was no supply of masks in Jharkhand. Since the demand for N95 masks was high in Delhi, the manufacturers could not supply masks to Ranchi, they added.

According to the official website of the World Health Organisation (WHO), on December 31, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The virus did not match any other known virus. This raised concern because when a virus is new, it is not known how it may affect people, One week later, on January 7, Chinese authorities confirmed that they had identified a new virus. The new virus is a coronavirus, which is a family of viruses that include the common cold, and viruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

The work in the navigational channel having 1-km length and 100-meter width carried out by the Dredging Corporation of India was completed on February 26 this year.

He appealed to local fishermen to use the designated channel and not to use any shortcut while venturing into the sea. The PPT marine department has already installed four temporary buoys in the channel with proper marking, which is clearly visible, Roy informed.

To impart training to the fishermen, the PPT Seior Hydrographic Surveyor would conduct a programme regarding GPS coordination with proper latitude and longitude. Roy cautioned that fishing trawlers not following the designated channel would be at risk of stranding.

Notably, an Integrated Fishery Harbour is operational at Paradip located in the Mahanadi right bank, for which maintenance dredging is required in regular intervals. The harbour is presently managed by the State Fisheries Department. The local fishing community has been facing difficulties as the river mouth has been silted up over the years and the fishing vessels face hindrance to navigate during approach/exit from the harbour. The river mouth was last dredged almost 20 years back.

On the steps undertaken by the PPT to prevent any possible outbreak of COVID-19 in the locality, Roy said the ships coming to the port from the countries, where there is reporting of maximum outbreak of corona virus are subjected to quarantine of mandatory 14 days in the anchorage area and the Master of Vessel sends the health status of its crew members twice a day to the designated medical team of PPT. After quarantine period, the Port Health Officer or the Chief Medical Officer, PPT boards and screens the crew and if everything is alright then the ship is allowed to undertake cargo operations. As the Limited Pratique is in place, no shore leaving permission is given to the crew.

In case of Indian crew, if there is any essential requirement then he is subjected to medical screening and thermal scanning. Disposal of waste or faecal matter from the ships berthing locally is not permitted.

Cautioning about hard summer days ahead, Roy appealed to the inhabitants of township to cope up with one-time water supply very soon. Repair work of the Taladanda Canal would begin in Cuttack and continue till May 31. Hence, the port administration is trying to revive the water intake point at Choudhurygada and draw maximum possible water in next few days. The reservoirs of PPT can meet the water demand for 30-35 days with one-time supply; otherwise the capacity is for 17-20 days.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ppt-urges-fishermen-to-use-designated-channel.html

83,17-3-20,"5 yrs on, XIMB R'kela campus still a pipedream","It was March 4, 2015, when Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik had declared the Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar’s second campus at Rourkela. It had created hope and enthusiasm among the residents who were disheartened over the IIM issue.

Rourkela fulfilling all criteria was a strong contender for the IIM, but at the last moments, the State Government had decided to establish the IIM at Sambalpur owing to a strong lobby.

However, looking at the dismay spreading in Rourkela over the IIM, the CM had assured establishment of the XIMB branch at Rourkela. But till date the assurance of the CM has not translated into action.

The agitation for IIM at Sambalpur put the Union HRD Minister under pressure to write a letter to the Chief Minister, Odisha for his suggestion on establishing the IIM in western Odisha and especially in Sambalpur. The Chief Minster in response had recommended Sambalpur as the Centre was prepared to relax the criteria.

Even though that time the opposition party leaders including BJP and Congress here were not against IIM in Sambalpur, they very cunningly were targeting Patnaik, saying that they would have been happier if Rourkela was recommended for the IIM. While the BJD was at a back foot in Rourkela, the Chief Minister suddenly declared of the second campus of premier management institute, Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar (XIMB) at Rourkela.

While the BJD said the Chief Minister’s recommending Sambalpur for the Odisha IIM and declaring the XIMB campus for Rourkela is a double bonanza for western Odisha, the Opposition blamed that to cover up the apathy against Rourkela, the CM had made a false declaration.

However, the sudden declaration for a second XIMB campus at Rourkela by Patnaik saved the BJD here at that time. While simply welcoming the steps, the opposition parties preferred to keep themselves away from making further comments. Political slugfest over management institution apart, the XIMB decision was widely hailed by the intellectuals and students at that time.

But since then there has been no new development on the project. As a result, the BJD under fire of the opposition parties again. It is alleged that the XIMB campus declaration was a political game plan of Patnaik to divert attention of the people from the IIM setback.

Even when it was declared that the RSP will provide land with other supports, it was ascertained that the campus will be in Rourkela city itself. But neither from the RSP source, nor from the State Government is there any confirmation regarding this management school.

Interestingly, while the BJD is on back foot on the issue, the other major political parties like the BJP and the Congress keep mum on it now. Even the social and other organisations do not raise the issue to mount pressure on the Government. It may be noted here that not only Xavier campus but also many projects which carry importance for Rourkela are limited either to assurance or laying of foundation stone so far.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/5-yrs-on--ximb-r-kela-campus-still-a-pipedream.html

The delegation accused the administration of blindly following the government and adopting double standards in initiating action against the accused.

“Even the apex court has observed that the move to put up hoardings of those accused of violence during anti-CAA protests is not supported by any law. The government was directed to remove the posters by March 16 and initiate legal proceedings,” said Congress leader Saroj Shukla.

“But instead of taking any action, the administration promptly acted against Congress leaders in the recent matter. These leaders put up hoardings pointing out that the chief minister and other Bharatiya Janata Party leaders were also involved in violence earlier and suggested that the accused BJP leaders should first compensate losses for the damages they caused and then realise money from anti-CAA protesters. The Lucknow police acted promptly where Congress leaders were accused. Is it not a travesty of justice?” Shukla asked.

On Sunday, two Congress leaders were arrested for putting up ‘indecent’ posters relating to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya. The posters were put up late on Friday night and were removed on Saturday.

Depicting photographs of the chief minister and deputy chief minister, the posters listed the criminal records of both and five other BJP leaders — Sangeet Som, Suresh Rana, Sanjeev Balyan, Sadhvi Prachi and Umesh Malik.

94,17-3-20,"Yogi: Those damaging public, pvt property to be dealt with severely","Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath reiterated that those who damaged public and private property during anti-CAA protests would be severely dealt with and “no one would be allowed to take law in their hands in UP”.

“People have the right to protest. But no one has the right to damage public and private property in the process. The authorities would severely deal with such elements as it is the government’s duty to protect life and property of the citizens,” Yogi said at a function in Lucknow on Monday.

The chief minister’s statement came against the backdrop of the Bharatiya Janata Party government facing flak over putting up hoardings carrying pictures and addresses of people, who allegedly damaged property during protests against the new citizenship law in Lucknow on December 19.

“People opposing Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) should first read it as it is meant to give citizenship. There is not a single clause which talks about taking away citizenship of anyone,” Yogi said.

Talking about development of the state, the chief minister said that his government was implementing the policies of the Union government in toto and its result were clearly visible.

“The state, which was lagging behind in all development indices, is now galloping on the path of development. Investors who were previously leaving the state, have now started investing in UP because of the trust that this government has given to them,” he said.

Yogi claimed that the state government has made 1.37 lakh appointments in the last three years. He even claimed that the state generated over 35 lakh jobs because of fresh investments in the last three years.

“The first Investors’ Summit was organised in February 2018 and defence expo (DefExpo) was organised in February 2020. In two years, investments on a large-scale have been made. Besides, One District One Product (ODOP) scheme has been a great success. The result is that the per capita income of UP has gone up to Rs 70,000,” he said.

The chief minister said that connectivity was the biggest incentive for investment.

“Today, UP has seven airports and work is underway on 11 airports. Asia’s biggest airport is coming up in Jewar (Noida). Similarly, the government has spread the network of roads by starting the construction of Purvanchal Expressway, Bundelkhand Expressway and Ganga Expressway. This will make UP the most sought after destination,” Yogi said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/yogi--those-damaging-public--pvt--property-to-be-dealt-with-severely.html
95,17-3-20,Adityanath govt pursuing vendetta politics: AKY,"Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav alleged that the Yogi Adityanath government was pursuing vendetta politics, targeting its political opponents and framing them in cases to intimidate them.

“The Yogi government files fake cases against political rivals. I did not register fake cases against anyone. Congress started the politics of vendetta and I and my family members were implicated in cases through PIL in courts and now the present UP government has adopted the same tactics,” the former chief minister of UP said while participating in a television programme on Monday.

Yadav denied that he had acquired assets in India or abroad. “I am not buying any hotel or island and such allegations are baseless. The chief minister does not know what an island is. He never went to England or the USA, I have been to both places,” the SP chief said.

Chiding the Yogi government, the SP chief said that it was only carrying forward projects initiated by the previous Samajwadi Party government.

“There were two investors’ summits in which MoUs were signed for solar power projects but no fund was allocated for them in the budget. This BJP government is only signing MoUs but there is no work on the ground. I want to ask the government why investment is not coming to UP and how much budget has the government set aside for solar energy in the budget,” he said.

Akhilesh Yadav also accused the BJP regime of coming to power by making false promises. “This government has completed three years but the BJP has nothing substantial to project as its achievement,” he said.

The SP chief further said the Yogi government needed to be more transparent about parameters based on which it decides which city should come under the Smart City Project.

“Also, if saving cow is the first priority of this government, why has it not hiked the budget for it?” he asked.

Denying that he was inaccessible to party men and people, Yadav said, “I have only two places — Lucknow and Saifai. I meet people at both places and will continue to do so for the rest of my life. I don’t even go to Delhi as I do not like the water there.”

The SP chief also said that his party would consider forging alliance with smaller political outfits. “We want to form a coalition that competes with the BJP. We will fight polls alone but a some adjustments could be made,” he said.

Akhilesh Yadav blasted the Yogi government for its decision to put up hoarding with details of people accused of inciting violence during the anti-CAA protest in Lucknow on December 19. He also criticised the state government for the ordinance that would empower the government to seize property of those found guilty of damaging public and private property.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/adityanath-govt-pursuing--vendetta-politics--aky.html

“As against 201.59 million units supplied to rural areas in 2015-16, 305.84 million units were supplied in 2018-19. This allowed 18-hour uninterrupted power supply in rural areas, 20-hour electricity in tehsil headquarters and 24-hour power supply in district headquarters. Besides, a record 1.24 crore power connections were given in the last three years,” Sharma said.

111,17-3-20,SC to hear BJP plea today as MP defers floor test as ‘virus reprieve’,"The political drama surrounding the confidence test of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath on Monday reached the Supreme Court, which decided to hear on Tuesday the plea of the BJP to order floor test within 12 hours.

The BJP moved the SC after Speaker NP Prajapati ignored the direction of Governor Lalji Tandon to hold the floor test on Monday, and instead adjourned the House till March 26 in wake of the coronavirus epidemic.

Late on Monday, Nath met the Governor after the latter issued a fresh direction to the CM to hold floor test on Tuesday. The CM later claimed his Government enjoys majority, and ruled out holding a floor test in the Assembly as demanded by the BJP. Nath also dared the Opposition party to table a no-confidence motion against his 15-month-old Congress Government if they wanted to test its strength in the House.

Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Hemant Gupta will hear the BJP’s plea filed former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. After parading the MLAs before the Governor, Chouhan told the media the State Government has lost majority and has no right to remain in power.

Earlier Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Govind Singh raised coronavirus threat to seek to defer the confidence motion. After finishing his customary address to the Assembly, Tandon left the House, asking the MLAs to “respect the House” and “follow the constitution”.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sc-to-hear-bjp-plea-today-as-mp-defers-floor-test-as----virus-reprieve---.html

As the proceedings began in the Assembly, Governor Tandon urged the legislators to follow the Constitutional traditions, maintain dignity of democracy and act peacefully in the current situation prevailing in the state.

After finishing his customary address, Tandon left the House within minutes, asking the MLAs to ""respect the House"" and ""follow the constitution.

127,17-3-20,CD initiates preventive measures against COVID-19,"The Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) has finally started to take some preventive measures on its compound after the first case of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported in the city.

However, these measures appear to be inadequate considering the fact that hundreds of people from across the city visit the MCD compound daily for various works. The Central and State Governments have taken various precautions against coronavirus but MCD did not initiate any precautionary measures until Monday within its own compound.

While talking to The Pioneer, the municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey said, “We have cancelled all the bookings of Town Hall till March 31 and have also set up a camp in the compound to distribute sanitisers and masks among the people.

We have also appealed people to pay their property tax online to avoid visiting the MCD. Besides, the employees working in the corporation have been told to use masks and sanitisers for their safety,” added Pandey.

However, due to the holidays last week, reportedly about 1,000 persons arrived at MCD on Monday to pay property tax. Besides, the cash depositing counters were reportedly shifted last week with the other counters in the same room which became very congested by noon and the number of people wearing masks was negligible.

Pandey further said, “We have prohibited the use of the open gym in Gandhi Park and around one lakh pamphlets are about to be printed to spread public awareness.”

Meanwhile, the kiosk set up by MCD to distribute masks saw all the masks being exhausted in less than fifteen minutes.

The locals waited in queue to get the masks but the stock of masks did not arrive for almost an hour due to which some people had arguments with the staff about the delay.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cd-initiates-preventive-measures-against-covid-19.html

Till now there have been no positive cases in the state, she added saying the State was acting as per World Health Organisation and Central Government guidelines. Border management — including the one with Bangladesh and other States — was being done with utmost sincerity she said.

133,17-3-20,Yes Bank probe: ED summons Anil Ambani,"Reliance Group Chairman Anil Ambani was on Monday summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and asked to appear before it in connection with its money laundering probe against Yes Bank promoter Rana Kapoor and others.

However, Ambani has sought exemption from appearance on personal grounds and the agency has summoned him again later this week to appear before its Mumbai office to record his statement under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The Yes Bank had an exposure of about Rs 12,800 crore which has turned NPA, officials said.

Ambani has now been asked to appear on Thursday, they said, adding, the agency is probing if bribes were paid to the loans.

In a statement last week, the Reliance Group had said that its entire debt from Yes Bank was fully secured and was availed in the ordinary course of business.

Ambani’s nine group companies are stated to have taken loans of about Rs 12,800 crore from the bank.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had told a Press conference on March 6 that the Anil Ambani Group, Essel, ILFS, DHFL and Vodafone were among the stressed corporates Yes Bank had exposure to.

All the big companies who had taken large loans from the crisis-hit bank, which later turned bad or were in the red, are being summoned for questioning in the case to take the investigation forward. Promoter of Avantha Group Gautam Thapar, who has been named as an accused along with Rana, is also being summoned for questioning, they said.

Yes Bank promoter Rana Kapoor, 62, is undergoing ED custody after he was arrested by the central probe agency early this month. A Mumbai court on Monday extended Kapoor’s custody till March 20.

The ED has accused Kapoor, his family members and others of laundering “proceeds of crime” worth Rs 4,300 crore by receiving alleged kickbacks in lieu of extending big loans through their bank that later allegedly turned non-performing asset (NPA).

145,17-3-20,Parl nod for three Central Sanskrit varsities,"Parliament on Monday approved the Central Sanskrit Universities Bill, 2019 to upgrade three deemed Sanskrit universities into Central universities after some minor amendments. The Bill brought by HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank was passed by voice vote in the Rajya Sabha. It was passed by Lok Sabha in December last year and was introduced in Rajya Sabha on March 2 but could not be taken for discussion due to the logjam in the upper house.

The Bill seeks to upgrade three deemed to be universities in Sanskrit -- Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, Sri Lal Bahadur Shastri Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeeth, and Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeeth Tirupati -- into central universities. Since Rajya Sabha has passed the Bill with amendments, it would now go to Lok Sabha again. As per the proposed legislation, Sanskrit Central Universities will be set up by converting three deemed Sanskrit universities, presently functioning in the country.

Replying to the debate, Pokhriyal said the Modi government is committed to strengthen all Indian languages. Speaking about the spread of Sanskrit, he said that around five crore students were studying the language in the country itself. Besides, there were many countries across the world where the language was being taught, he added. “All languages are important for us. We are committed for the growth of all languages that are spoken in the country,” the minister asserted.

Cutting across party lines, several members supported the bill during the debate. Congress MP Jairam Ramesh, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy of AITC and Prashant Nanda of BJD spoke in Sanskrit. However, DMK members opposed the bill saying it was “against” classical languages like Tamil.

Initiating the debate, Jairam Ramesh said that though he supports the bill as it will help the cause of Sanskrit, which is a scientific language and part of cultural legacy, the government was neglecting other classical languages.

“Sanskrit has always been a monopoly of few and that is a matter of great sadness and tragedy for India. We have to make this monopoly into a treasure of many and that is what this bill hopes to accomplish,” he said.

However, the government is ignoring other classical Indian languages such as Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Odia which are spoken by millions of people, while Sanskrit is spoken only by hardly 15,000 people in India, he added.

The Congress MP also suggested that Sanskrit universities be named after Sanskrit scholars such as Panini.

Supporting the Bill, Sukhendu Sekhar Ray of Trinamool Congress (AITC) spoke in Sanskrit and termed it as “mother language”. Ram Gopal Yadav of SP suggested that there should be a provision for students union in the three universities rather than a student council, in which members were nominated by the faculty.

Prashant Nanda of BJD, who also spoke in Sanskrit, supported the bill said that the language has scientific importance. Kahkashan Perveen of JD(U) also backed the bill and said that the government should also consider to upgrade the Sanskrit University in Darbhanga, Bihar, which was the second such varsity opened in India in 1961.

L Lakshmikanta Rao of TRS, K K Ragesh of CPI-M and Binoy Viswam of CPI also participated in the debate. Supporting the bill, V Vijayasai Reddy of YSRCP suggested the government ask MPs to adopt one village in their constituency to promote Sanskrit language.

However, M Shanmugam of DMK opposed the bill saying that it was against classical languages such as Tamil. Vaiko of DMK also opposed the bill saying: “If this bill is passed then not only South Indian languages but others like Punjabi and Odia will be in jeopardy. He also said that Sanskrit is a “dead language” and Tamil is the only alive ancient language.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/parl-nod-for-three-central-sanskrit-varsities.html

148,17-3-20,Raj Govt moves apex court challenging CAA validity,"The Congress-ruled Rajasthan Government moved the Supreme Court on Monday challenging the validity of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, saying it was violative of “basic structure principle of secularism” and fundamental rights of equality and life.

It became the second State after Kerala to move the top court invoking Article 131 of the Constitution under which a state is empowered to directly move the top court in case of a dispute with the Centre.

The newly amended law seeks to grant citizenship to non-Muslim migrants belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, Jain and Parsi communities who came to the country from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan on or before December 31, 2014. “Pass a judgement and decree that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 is violative of Article 14 (right to equality) and Article 21 (right to life) of the Constitution of India as well as violative of basic structure principle of secularism. Thus Act 47 of 2019 (CAA) be declared as void under Article 13 of the Constitution,” said the plea filed through lawyer DK Devesh.

Article 13 of the Constitution, under which the CAA is sought to be held as unconstitutional, says any law “inconsistent with or in derogation of the fundamental rights” can be held unconstitutional to the extent of its contravention of fundamental rights.

The plea said the CAA be declared “ultra vires” to the provisions of the Constitution of India.

Besides, the plea has stated that the Passport (Entry to India) Amendment Rules, 2015 and Foreigners (Amendment) Order are ultra vires the Constitution and be declared void.

It said the CAA, the amended Passport Rules and Foreign Order are class legislations harping on the religious identity of an individual, thereby contravening the principles of secularism, which has been recognised by the court as a basic structure of the Constitution.

150,17-3-20,Maha to punish those spreading fake news,"In an effort to deal sternly with the people circulating ‘fake’ messages relating to Coronavirus, the Maharashtra Government has warned that any person/institution/organization “is found indulging in such activity” will be punished under the just notified regulations under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897.

Having invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 on Saturday, the State Government wants to put regulation number six which deals with dissemination of fake messages in print, electronic and social media, to an effective use.

The Regulation Six of the notification under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 on March 14, 2020 reads thus: “No person/Institution/organisation will use any print or electronic or social media for dissemination of any information regarding Covid-19 without ascertaining facts and prior clearance of the concerned authorities.

The authorities, whose prior clearance is essential for dissemination of any information regarding Covid -19, are: Commissioner—Health Services, Director—Health Services, Director—Medical Education & Research, or the (district) Collector. “This is necessary to avoid spread of any unauthenticated information and/or rumours regarding COVID-19. If any person is found indulging in such activity, it will be treated as a punishable offence under these regulations,” the regulation number six States.

Explaining the rationale behind coming out with regulations governing the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, Maharashtra Health Minister said: “There a lot of circulating on various media networks on Coronavirus which need to be scotched to avoid panic among the people”.

“For instance, some of these unauthenticated messages claim that there are different types of cures available for Covid-19. But, as of now, there is no such cure available for the disease anywhere in the world,” Tope said.

The regulations, issued by way of notification singed by state Principal Secretary Dr. Pradeep Vyas, are extremely significant considering that it has specifies that –”officers empowered under the Act are authorised to isolate and /or admit a person who develops symptoms stimulating out of COVID-19 infection as per the case definition criteria published by World Health Organisation or Government of India from time to time. The empowered officer may initiate action under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code ( 48 of 1860) against the person who refuses to comply with such advice of isolation and /or admission”.

Among other things, the notification States that all government departments/organisations’ staff shall be at the disposal of the Collector/Municipal Commissioner or other officers of the concerned areas for discharging containment duties, and if needed they are empowered to requisition the services of any other person.

In the event of Covid-19 being reported from a particular area, the authorities will take a series of actions like sealing the geographical locality, barring entry-exit of population from that area, restricting vehicular movements, closing all public amenities like schools, colleges, malls, etc., initiating active/passive surveillance of Covid-19 cases, isolating the suspects and their contacts, taking over any government/private building to serve as a ‘quarantine facility’ and any other measures as required for containment of the disease.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/maha-to-punish-those-spreading-fake-news.html

154,17-3-20,Rahul creates uproar over bad loans in LS,"Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday raised in Lok Sabha the issue of bad loans and sought a list of 50 top wilful defaulters and “stealing of money by large number of people” even as his party staged a walkout protesting that its leader was not allowed to ask a second supplementary on the issue.

The Congress members wanted Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman to respond to Rahul’s question but Minister of state Anurag Thakur answered his query.

The House soon witnessed noisy scenes and a walkout by Congress members as Rahul was not allowed to ask a second supplementary related to wilful defaulters during the Question Hour.

The protests came after Speaker Om Birla announced the end of Question Hour at noon as the designated time for it is 11 am to noon.

While asking the first supplementary, Rahul said he wanted to know the list of 50 top wilful defaulters, including funds given and the amount written off by banks but did not get a proper answer in the written reply.

“The Indian economy is going through a difficult period. Banking system is facing difficulties, banking is failing and many more banks are going to fail. One of the main reasons for the failure of banks is stealing of bank money by a large number of people.

“The prime minister had said those who have stolen the money will be brought back and punished. But I have not got the answer to my simple question,” he said.

When Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur started replying to the question, Rahul and Congress leader in the House Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury protested, saying Sitharaman, who was present in the House, should reply.

However, the Speaker said normally the junior ministers answer during the Question Hour. Thakur said the Congress was trying to put the blame on the NDA government for irregularities committed in banks during the previous UPA regime.

The Minister said the Narendra Modi government reviewed the asset quality of banks and performance of banks has improved to a great extent due to various steps taken by the Government.

“The list of all bank defaulters above Rs 25 lakh loans is available on the website of the Central Information Commission. I have the list and if the Chair allows me, I am ready to table it in the House,” he said.

Thakur said Rs 4.8 lakh crore defaulting loans were recovered ever since the Modi government came and a number of steps were taken, including enactment of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, so that the guilty can be punished.

Referring to the recent Yes Bank crisis, Thakur said the union finance minister had already said banks are safe and the money deposited in Yes Bank is also safe.

He said there were many instances of irregularities during the UPA Government and that include forcing bankers to buy paintings at exorbitant price —in an indirect reference to Rahul Gandhi’s sister Priyanka Vadra selling a painting to the Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor, who was recently arrested.

The Speaker then ended the Question Hour and moved to the next item of the agenda.

With this, Rahul protested saying he should be given the opportunity to ask the second supplementary as is the norm. However, the Speaker ignored his request and continued with the business of the House.

Congress leader was immediately joined by Chowdhury and other members. At least a dozen Congress members rushed to the Well of the House and started sloganeering saying grave injustice has been done to Rahul. As the Speaker continued to ignore the protests, the Congress members staged a walk out.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/rahul-creates-uproar-over-bad-loans-in-ls.html

Replying to a debate on the demand for grants of his ministry, which was later passed by the House, Gehlot said ‘divyang’, a term for people with disabilities, across the country will have a standard identity card through which they can avail of benefits meant for them anywhere.

As of now, he said, the certificate issued in one district is not accepted in another district.

The Indian cricket team for the physically challenged, he noted, has been winning the world cup cricket for the disabled for the last three times. Over one-third members of the Indian team have won medal in Paralympic Games, he said, lauding the efforts of divyang.

In the last five years some of key decisions taken by the Government was to accord constitutional status to the Other Backward Classes (OBC) Commission and giving reservation in educational institutions based on economic criteria.

He said that the Government has brought Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens (Amendment) Bill, which is being scrutinised by a standing committee, and it has provisions for day care centre and old age homes, which would be run with the help of NGOs.

While he asserted that allocations under various scholarships had increased by a big margin under the BJP-led NDA Government, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury took a dig at his claims, saying “zero increase” under several provisions and underutilisation or reduction in budgets of various programmes were its “historic achievements”.

The mandate of the Social Justice Ministry is very large, he said, attacking the Government for the deaths of 282 sanitation workers.

Over 60,000-70,000 children every year are forced to beg by criminals, he said.

“You have no numbers. What is your priority,” Chowdhury said while also highlighting drug menace in parts of the country, including Punjab.

Responding to him, Gehlot said de-addiction camps have been set up in 28 districts of the states. Over Rs 137.72 crore was spent during 2009-14, when the Congress-led UPA was in power, while over Rs 242.55 cr was spent by the NDA Government in 2014-19.

The issue of begging, he said, is a State subject, and the Centre issues advisories to states from time to time in this regard.

Gehlot said the ministry has become “active” in the last five years and has taken several historic decisions.

He said a high-level board was also constituted for nomadic tribes. For divyang, 132 camps were set up in 126 districts to give assistance, he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---govt-working-on-comprehensive-policy-for-elderly-citizens---.html

158,17-3-20,Allay CAA fear to stem rumour: RSS to Govt,"Accusing parties opposing CAA of trying to convert it into a political issue to create confusion among the public, the RSS said on Monday it was the duty of the ruling party and the Government to clear the air.

RSS General Secretary Suresh Joshi said repeated appeals by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah to political parties to “understand” the Citizenship Amendment Act had not yielded a positive response.

He called on the political parties to come together on issues of national interest.

“Unfortunately the national issue has became political. Any country in their national interest- to take care of its citizens, prepare the list of its citizens, and no outsiders should be allowed to stay after a certain period, there are limitations...But unfortunately on the national issues- for political reasons- leaders of political parties are trying to create confusion in society,” Joshi said.

Speaking to reporters here, he said the Prime Minister and Home minister have appealed to political parties to understand the CAA, but those who want to create confusion and chaos in the country were “misguiding” the people.

He said all political parties should honestly think about it and cooperate with the government and also try to clear their confusion.

“...Everyone has the right to oppose (if) something is not correct for the nation and say it should not be implemented. But whatever is in the interest of the nation everybody should try to understand and support it,” he added. Joshi addressed the press in the backdrop of the Akhila Bharatiya Karyakari Mandali baitak held here on March 14.

RSS' highest decision making body, the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS), was scheduled to meet from March 15- 17 here, but was called off due to COVID-19 concerns.

Asked if RSS would directly involve itself against the propaganda opposing CAA and NRC, Joshi said the Sangh directly is not involved in it, but there are several organisations that support the movement in its favour and naturally its swayamsevaks are supporting them.

Stating that the forces supporting CAA are huge, he said all political parties should come together for a dialogue regarding this. “BJP as a ruling party has to take some initiative to initiate a dialogue.... The Home Minister and Prime Minister have appealed to the political parties to come and try to understand, but I don't think there is a positive response,” he added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/allay-caa-fear-to-stem-rumour--rss-to-govt.html

A bench of Justices Arun Mishra and MR Shah while dismissing the anticipatory bail pleas of Navlakha and Teltumbde said their petitions cannot be maintained in view of the bar contained in 43D(4) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967.

Section 43D(4) of the UAPA bars grant of anticipatory bail to a person accused of having committed an offence punishable under this Act. “The special leave petitions are, accordingly, dismissed. However, since the protection has been enjoyed by the petitioners approximately for one-and-a-half years, three weeks time from today is granted to them to surrender. The petitioners shall surrender their passport forthwith with the investigation agency/officer,” the bench said. During the hearing, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Teltumbde, said that the offence under section 120B of IPC is not laid down in the FIR and contended that some documents which the Maharashtra Police recovered was from another person's computer.

He said that these documents are not even emails so as to justify their credibility.

164,17-3-20,IMF calls for coordinated action to provide stability to global economy,"The IMF on Monday called for increased coordinated action to boost confidence and provide stability to the global economy, amidst fast spread of coronavirus that has killed over 6,500 people worldwide and resulted in lockdown-like situations in several countries.

“Many governments have already taken significant steps, with major measures being announced on a daily basis - including yesterday’s bold, coordinated moves on monetary policy,” International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a blog post.

“But clearly, even more needs to be done. As the virus spreads, increased coordinated action will be key to boosting confidence and providing stability to the global economy,” she wrote.

Asserting that the case for a coordinated and synchronized global fiscal stimulus is becoming stronger by the hour, she said that during the Global Financial Crisis, for example, fiscal stimulus by the G-20 amounted to about 2 per cent of GDP, or over USD 900 billion in today’s money,

in 2009 alone.

“So, there is a lot more work to do,” she said and called for additional fiscal stimulus will be necessary to prevent long-lasting economic damage.

“Fiscal measures already announced are being deployed on a range of policies that immediately prioritize health spending and those in need. We know that comprehensive containment measures - combined with early monitoring - will slow the rate of infection and the spread of the virus,” she said.

Governments should continue and expand these efforts to reach the most-affected people and businesses - with policies including increased paid sick leave and targeted tax relief, she added.

In advanced economies, she said, central banks should continue to support demand and boost confidence by easing financial conditions and ensuring the flow of credit to the real economy. For example, the US Federal Reserve just announced further interest rate cuts, asset purchases, forward guidance and a drop in reserve requirements.

“Policy steps that we know have worked before - including during the GFC- are on the table.

Emergency actions taken by the Federal Reserve late Sunday to prop up the economy and get financial markets running smoothly again may have raised fears even further, some investors said.

The selling was just as aggressive in markets around the world. European stocks and crude oil were both down close to 10%. The world’s brightest spot may have been Japan, where the central bank announced more stimulus for the economy, and stocks still lost 2.5 per cent.

This completes two-thirds of the exercise for approval of the Budget for 2020-21.

Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha had debated on Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s second Budget in the first half of the current session and in the second part, the lower house of Parliament passed the Appropriation Bill. In the third stage, the Finance Bill, which details the tax proposals, will be discussed and approved.

The house passed the Appropriation Bill, envisaging spending of Rs 110.4 lakh crore during the financial year 2020-21 after Speaker Om Birla applied ‘guillotine’ on demands of grants for various ministries.

With Parliament having very limited time for scrutinising the expenditure demands of all the ministries, it takes up discussion on spending or demands for grants for a few ministries during a pre-decided period of time. Once this is over, a guillotine is applied.

Once the speaker applies the guillotine, all the outstanding demands for grants, whether discussed or not, are put to vote at once and passed. After this, Appropriation Bill was taken into consideration and passed.

This year, the Lok Sabha discussed demands for grants of ministries of tourism, railways and social justice and empowerment.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman moved the Appropriation Bill, which was passed by voice vote.

The Lok Sabha will now discuss the Finance Bill, which essentially contains the government’s tax proposals.

Once the Finance Bill is passed, the budget exercise is complete.

Both appropriation and finance bills are classified as money bills which do not require the explicit consent of the Rajya Sabha.

177,17-3-20,EU set for virus talks today,"The European Union (EU)’s top official on Monday called for more coordination and insisted on the need to keep the 27-nation bloc’s internal borders open as much as possible as member states implement measures to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

After the surge of COVID-19 cases in Europe led the Italian Government to put the country on lockdown, other member states have implemented drastic measures and travel restrictions, including partially closing their borders.

“Our measures to contain the Coronavirus outbreak will be effective only if we coordinate on the European level,” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said. “We have to take exceptional measures to protect the health of our citizens. But let’s make sure goods and essential services continue to flow in our internal market. This is the only way to prevent shortages of medical equipment or food.”

EU leaders are set to hold a summit via video-conference on Tuesday on efforts to contain the spread of the virus, which has now infected more than 50,000 people across Europe, and claimed more than 2,000 lives.

With Italy reporting the most virus cases and deaths anywhere in the world except China, neighbouring countries including Austria and Slovenia have moved to slow traffic. But other EU nations, including Germany, Poland, Slovakia and Cyprus have also introduced restrictions that could damage the bloc’s economy and slow down the circulation of medical equipment.

Austria, Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland, Lithuania and Germany plus non-member Switzerland have notified the commission that they have taken immediate steps under the EU’s border rule book allowing member states in exceptional circumstances to reintroduce border checks for a limited period. The EU’s borders code stipulates that the initial period of 10 days can be renewed for up to two months.

The different approaches in different countries are raising concerns that vital medical equipment may be blocked. The EU is urging its members to put common health screening procedures in place at their borders to limit the spread of the virus, but not to block the transport of important medical equipment.

In a series of guidelines for border management measures, the commission urged member states to facilitate the circulation of workers, to ensure an efficient movement of goods and to impose restrictions only when they are “duly motivated” and science-based.

“Member States should preserve the free circulation of all goods. In particular, they should guarantee the supply chain of essential products such as medicines, medical equipment, essential and perishable food products and livestock,” the commission said.

Jon Worth, a visiting lecturer at the College of Europe in Bruges, said he was not surprised that member states decided to restrict the movement of people at their borders given that health care is a matter of national responsibility in the EU.

“But the single market is definitely the EU’s responsibility and they have to make sure the chain of supply does not break down,” he told The Associated Press on Monday. “That will be the short-term challenge to come.”

European Council President Charles Michel, who chairs summits of prime ministers and presidents from the 27 EU nations, announced the video conference in a tweet, calling what will be the second meeting of its kind within two weeks.

“Containing the spread of the virus, providing sufficient medical equipment, boosting research and limiting the economic fallout is key,” Michel said.

Michel called the summit shortly after he held talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Macron’s office said their conversation allowed them to make decisions about measures to take at the external borders of the EU which will be announced in the coming hours. No details were provided.

European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control figures released Monday show that 51,771 coronavirus cases have been reported in Europe, most in Italy, Spain, France and Germany. A total of 2 ,316 people have died, the overwhelming majority in Italy.

For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.

180,17-3-20,Lockdowns erupt as world infections surpass those in China,"Monday marked another milestone in the global battle to outwit the new coronavirus, as reported infections in the rest of the world overtook those in China. Millions of people in Europe and the United States began holing up at home amid rapid-fire border closures announced by one nation after the other.

Spain officially became the fourth-most infected country in the world, surpassing South Korea as its arc of contagion curved higher.

Only China, Italy and Iran have more confirmed cases of COVID-19 than Spain, where the number of infections increased overnight by roughly 20% to 9,191 and the number of fatalities rose to 309, according to the Spanish Health Ministry. The actual figure was presumed to be even higher, because Spain switched to a new system of reporting.

Spain’s interior minister said European Union nations on Monday would discuss possibly closing the country’s borders. “It is a real possibility to fight against the expansion of the virus and to guarantee the health of European citizens,” said minister Fernando Grande Marlaska.

Portugal and Spain have already halted tourism across their 1,200-kilometer (750-mile) shared border. Goods and workers will still be allowed to cross. Spain has also already deployed the army to the streets, ordered its 46 million people to stay home and taken control of private hospitals. Marlaska said a total lockdown could be the next step. Nearly 500 people are under intensive care in Spanish hospitals for the virus, 70% of them in Madrid, the capital.

The measures echoed those already in place in Italy and now being rolled out in other parts of Europe and the United States. Serbia called out the army to help enforce the virus restrictions.

Among the most drastic measures, the Swiss city-state of Geneva banned gatherings of more than five people, though exceptions were made for business meetings that followed public health rules.

Businesses in Iran’s capital remained open, however, even as other countries in the region moved toward full lockdowns, with Lebanon largely shutting down and Iraqis racing to prepare for a curfew set to begin later this week. The divergent approaches adopted by local authorities reflect continued uncertainty over how to slow the spread of a virus that has infected around 170,000 people worldwide and caused more than 6,500 deaths.

Some have opted for an even more aggressive response. Israel, where the number of confirmed cases has more than doubled to around 250 in recent days, has authorised the use of phone-snooping technology long used against Palestinian militants to track coronavirus patients.

185,17-3-20,Das hints at rate cut; RBI presser turns a whimper,"The RBI on Monday hinted at a rate cut but stopped short of a decision, belying market expectations at a hurriedly called presser even as it announced some liquidity enhancing measures to contain the economic fallout from the coronavirus.

But Governor Shaktikanta Das was quick to assure that the Reserve Bank has “enough policy tools and stands ready to take any measures” needed to help the economy tide over the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

To a question why the rates were left unchanged at 5.15 per cent, Das said, “according to the prevailing law, the rate cut call has to be taken through the monetary policy committee, but I don’t rule out anything. Depending on the evolving situation, we will decide on the timing of our action.”

In two liquidity enhancing measures, Das announced another round of $2 billion dollar-rupee swap on March 23, and in another measure he said the RBI will continue to conduct the long-term repo operations (LTROs) of up to Rs 1 lakh crore as and when the market needs it.

On March 16, the RBI conducted the first dollar-swap for $2 billion under which the central bank buys rupee from the market by selling the dollars.

On the LTROs, it has already conducted four rounds worth Rs 1 lakh crore operations since February 14, after announcing it at the February 6 policy review.

Given the short notice for the press meet amidst the continuing mayhem in the market and the rising call for rates cuts to the tune of 65 bps by June including a pre-term cut of 25 bps by some analysts, the meeting spawned too much expectation of a rate cut.

Had he announced a rate cut, it would have been the first inter-meeting rate reduction since the monetary policy committee was instituted in February 2016.

The hurriedly called presser comes amidst widespread call for an inter-meeting rate cut following similar steps by the world’s leading central banks like the US Fed which in a span of 10 days has cut the policy rates to near zero levels.

Similarly, the Bank of England had also slashed the rates by 50 bps and so did the European Central Bank.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/das-hints-at-rate-cut--rbi-presser-turns-a-whimper.html

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on Monday assured that crippled Yes Bank has enough funds to meet any requirements and promised that the central bank will step in with additional liquidity support if needed.

Under the reconstruction scheme, which the governor said is progressing as planned, the private lender has received over Rs 10,000 crore from eight financial institutions, including Rs 6,050 crore from SBI.

191,17-3-20,What now?,"Facing life without entertainment has people thinking how they’d fill the extra time in home quarantine

Overheard as the entertainment world stalled in response to the coronavirus outbreak: “What are we going to do now, read books?” That’s exactly what Pamela Milam will be doing, and lots of them.

Milam is a selection reader for the Women’s National Book Association, a nonprofit established in 1917 to support, well, reading. She and her colleagues began a marathon this month to make it through as many as 100 books each as they help develop the organisation’s annual Great Group Reads list for National Reading Group Month in October.

She’s also an avid theatre-goer. She lives in the heart of Times Square and goes to the theatre about once a week, but when Broadway and many other entertainments canceled, cut back seating or postponed performances last week, Milam knew exactly how she’d fill the extra time.

“I’m happy snug on my couch. I’ll do my best to make the most of that,” she said. Many concert tours, awards shows, festivals, museums, sporting events and more have shut down to help “flatten the curve” as the virus spreads around the globe. Bans on big and medium-size gatherings are proliferating, prompting more people to hunker down at home.

“We’re catching up on our reading. I just started Love in the Time of Cholera. It seemed appropriate,” said Beverly Pfeiffer in Silver Spring, Maryland, of the Gabriel Garcia Marquez classic that, spoiler alert, doesn’t actually involve cholera.

Other people are working more, especially now that they’re doing it from home. Some have upped their kitchen game by taking on fussy recipes and baking projects. One company that offers online courses has seen a huge jump in business, as has another that sells digital photo scanning services.

Interior designer Genevieve Gorder, co-host of the Netflix series Stay Here, asked followers on Instagram to share home improvement goals that had been lingering at the bottom of to-do lists. Cleaning blinds, a basement sort-out and deck repairs are now on front burners.

Devotees of opera and art are being treated to special live streams and virtual tours. Museums have joined a social media movement started by the Museum of the City of New York to offer art and other imagery using the hashtag #MuseumMomentofZen.

While a few are heading outdoors, some folks who are shunning or shut out of their exercise classes are working out new routines at home.

Cynthia Shaw in Brooklyn is a classical pianist and piano teacher who regularly gathers with students and friends who play for each other. Since many in their group of eight or so are older, including some in their 80s, they’re giving up their monthly home gatherings for now, but played Sunday using a video conferencing platform instead. “Some of the older members had a hard time figuring it out, but they did,” she said. “I had my computer set up next to the piano. I played the first movement of a Beethoven sonata. People played Chopin. There was some Gershwin. I think we’ll do it again.”

Elsewhere, the TV binge is definitely on with some new gems on offer. The Walt Disney Co will release Frozen 2 on Disney-Plus several months early to give families cooped up by the coronavirus a welcome distraction, and give its streaming service a boost. For documentary lovers, Netflix is rolling out new features and series from acclaimed creators, including The Innocence Files, Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich and David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet.

Psychotherapist Jeff Larsen in San Diego has a plan, for himself and his clients. “It’s all about slowing down,” he said. “So absolutely pick up that book that’s been gathering dust, watch that movie or binge-watch that TV show that you haven’t had time to watch. Most importantly, it’s the mindset that we, as humans, need to have going into this time period. It’s always a good thing when we can slow down and simplify our lives.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/what-now--2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/what-now-.html

While many international sporting events have been postponed or cancelled, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe promised on Friday that Tokyo would host the Olympic Games as planned in July and August, despite questions raised by the pandemic.

Thomas Bach said on Thursday that his organisation would follow the recommendations of the World Health Organisation regarding a possible postponement.

It was only when Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi tested positive for the virus on Friday that football’s UK governing bodies called a temporary halt to the season.

Rooney, currently playing for second tier Derby, felt they should have acted quicker and the former England captain said he would “never forgive” the authorities if his family fell ill as a result.

“Why did we wait until Friday? Why did it take Mikel Arteta to get ill for the game in England to do the right thing?” Rooney wrote in the Sunday Times.

Valencia said all those affected were ""now at home, in good health and obeying self-isolation measures.""

Garay, who was set to miss the rest of the season with a knee injury, became the first player in La Liga to confirm a positive test earlier on Sunday.

""Clearly I've got off on the wrong foot in 2020,"" Garay wrote on social media. ""I've tested positive for the coronavirus, I'm fine and now just listening to the health authorities, at the moment in isolation.""

Valencia confirmed more cases shortly after Garay's announcement. ""Valencia CF confirm five positive cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus have been detected amongst first team staff and players.

“All of these persons are now at home, in good health and obeying self-isolation measures.”

Valencia played behind closed doors on Tuesday in the Champions League against Atalanta, the Serie A team based in Lombardy, one of Italy's worst-hit regions by the virus.

The club announced on February 28 they would be suspending all non-sporting activity with the first-team after a journalist attending the opening game against Atalanta was confirmed to have tested positive.

All engagement with the media before and after subsequent matches against Real Betis on February 29 and Alaves on Friday was cancelled, while a tribute to the club's former player David Villa was also called off.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/valencia-confirm-five-positive-tests-for-coronavirus.html
196,17-3-20,"Bhuvi, Bumrah gave me nightmares: Finch","Australia’s white-ball captain Aaron Finch has revealed he Had nightmares during India’s 2018 tour when pacers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah were taking his wicket “for fun”.

Opening the innings, the Australian captain struggled across all three formats during the India series, specially while trying to navigate Bhuvneshwar's inswinging deliveries.

“I’d wake up in a cold sweat, he’s (Bhuvneshwar) got me out a lot with the ball moving back in,” Finch said in Amazon’s recently released docu-series titled 'The Test'.

The Indian seamer had scalped Finch’s wicket four times, including during all three ODIs and one T20I, in the six-match limited overs series.

Finch also said that he would wake up at night just thinking about facing Bumrah the next day.

“There were times that I’d wake up in the night thinking about getting out. Thinking I’m facing Bumrah again tomorrow, he’s getting me out for fun,” Finch said.

India enjoyed an unprecedented summer, winning the Border Gavaskar Trophy 3-1, their first-ever Test series win on the Australian soil. It was followed by a 2-1 victory in the ODIs, while the T20 series ended in a 1-1 draw.

Bumrah was instrumental in India's historic Test victory. The right-arm pacer emerged as the joint highest wicket-taker in the four-match series, claiming 21 wickets.

The Test, which is an eight-part series, shows the Australian cricket team’s journey of redemption from the 2018 ball-tampering scandal to a successful defence of the Ashes.

The series also features behind-the-scenes footage of Australia's first-ever Test series loss to India on home soil and the World Cup semifinal exit.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bhuvi--bumrah-gave-me-nightmares--finch.html
197,17-3-20,Sportsman doesn't necessarily to be spurred on: Chappell,"Cricketing great Ian Chappell feels a sportsman “doesn’t necessarily” need a crowd to be “spurred on” but he acknowledges the eeriness of empty stands at SCG where Australia thrashed New Zealand in Friday’s ODI.

“I’m one who believes you don’t necessarily need a crowd to be spurred on as a sportsman; it’s the thrill of a close contest that gets the juices flowing,” Chappell wrote in ESPNcricinfo.

“Nevertheless it was a strange silence that accompanied scintillating boundaries and landmark scores at the SCG.”

The astute former Australia captain also spoke about the positive side of watching a cricket match without cheering fans.

“The upside was the absence of mindless chatter over the PA system; it was good to enjoy a game of cricket where you could hear yourself think.”

Aware of the enormity of the situation, the unprecedented developments of the past couple of days took Chappell to the days of the two world wars.

“The cancelling of major cricket matches is a rare occurrence and casts the sport back to the dark days of the two world wars.

“Test matches were suspended in early 1914 and didn't resume until late 1920 because of the First World War. The gap in competition was slightly longer during the Second World War, stretching from August 1939 until March 1946.”

He also shared an anecdote from a game held at a time when the second world war was at its peak.

“Jack Robertson, a successful opening batsman for Middlesex and England, was batting at Lord’s in 1944 when the air-raid sirens erupted. The players and umpires all lay flat on the ground as they had been trained to do until the danger passed.

“On resumption, Robertson casually lifted the first delivery over the boundary for six,” Chappell wrote.

On Friday, in keeping with the guidelines issued by the higher ups, the cricketers from both sides maintained safe distance, something that did not escape Chappell's attention.

“The finish provided another unusual sight: the opponents didn't shake hands or hug but acknowledged each other in a variety of different ways from the recommended safe distance of a couple of metres.

“These are indeed strange and difficult times but the main priority is to stay healthy — a worthwhile objective,” he concluded.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sportsman-doesn-t-necessarily-to-be-spurred-on--chappell.html
198,17-3-20,How far can we take love?,"Actor Tillotama Shome asks this all-important question through her new film on social conflicts in human relationships, Is Love Enough? Sir. By Chahak Mittal

Marriage is a highly regulated institution in Indian society, even when it is a result of a love match. Suddenly, it becomes a matter of a social contract, where the whole caste, class and education dynamic comes into play. We may claim urban aspirations and refinements but class differences in love and relationships aren’t typical of Jane Austen’s England. They exist just as overtly and not so overtly even today.

Actor Tillotama Shome’s forthcoming feature film, directed by Rohena Gera, Is Love Enough? Sir, revolves around the relationship between a rich man (played by Vivek Gomber) and a housemaid (played by Tillotama). The latter struggles to acknowledge her feelings for Vivek, keeping in mind the restrictions and prejudices of society, something she doesn’t want to be defined by. The film comments on the deep-rooted class differences in India and how a relationship between two people from different strata is looked at only in an exploitative set-up and never part of a normal discourse. The interesting bit about this film is that the housemaid is as much aware and doesn’t want to cross the line for her own sake rather than giving in to the comforts of a rich life.

How difficult was it internalising this conflict? Says Tillotama, “Love, they say, is blind. But I think there are a lot of factors — social, propriety, status, a person’s background — which matter more. Marriage is a social contract and all these things are properly scanned before marriages get fixed. So I think, love is not so blind at all. It’s actually quite harshly determined. Like any other contract, there is a lot of scrutiny even here. It is not only about love but about a lot of things other than the pure emotion it is meant to be. We will never choose to fall in love across the class barrier. Which is why the film questions — is love enough for two people to be together?”

Throughout her career graph, Tillotama has embodied characters from the lower strata of society, the last being Nayantara’s Necklace. Why did she say yes to Sir? “When I was offered the role, I felt the story was about the very thing that we would criticise if it happened in reality or even feel guilty about. We live in a society where we judge people who work for us or belong to the lower strata and we cannot imagine falling in love with them. I felt that this is the reality of the world I live in. No matter how progressive and liberal I think I am, ultimately, I have this prejudice that breathes and grows inside me. Even after watching so many great films or reading books, I myself would not choose to have feelings for someone who works at my home. I can watch Parasite and be blown away by it but I can’t pretend that I don’t have biases in my own head. It would never allow me to fall in love with such a person because of the work s/he does,” she tells us.

Certainly. But that leaves us with another question — how far can we take it even if we do fall in love with our house-help? Tillotama feels that it completely depends on a person’s choice. She says, “It depends on how much can I transgress? How much am I willing to loiter or take on society’s judgement? How much courage and strengths do I have to battle the prejudices and comments that society’s going to throw at me for the rest of my life? It’s because I have done something that doesn’t fit into people’s idea of propriety. Hence, it comes down to a deeply personal choice.”

At the same time, the Hindi Medium actor feels that one cannot be prescriptive about it. “We are not talking about making inter-class relationships mandatory. It is not some moral science lesson. It is a choice that each one of us needs to reconcile with deep within ourselves and accordingly decide whether we can we live with it. Decisions happen when you challenge your own mentality. So we cannot be prescriptive about it ki ‘karna hi chahiye’,” she adds.

Films like Bobby (1973), Raja Hindustani (1996), Laadla (1994) and more have been examples of the class divide though all of them were done in a masala entertainer format. What stands out in Sir is the process of realisation and actualisation of the choice in the real world. Says Tillotama, “In Sir, the explanation is more from the point of time when they acknowledge their feelings for each other. It is about acknowledging each other and becoming suddenly aware of their desires and acting upon them. In a typical love story, girl and boy meet and realise that ‘oh, there’s something between them,’ kiss and follow it up with a ‘happily ever after’ phase. But here, only the acknowledgment of their desire is more important for them because this isn’t something they had planned or expected. They certainly don’t know how to articulate it or do anything about it. It’s a helpless situation and it’s almost becoming a prisoner of your own desires because the expression of it is not something that the society would embrace happily or even have any taste for.”

She adds that such an affair is only something that can be accepted in the world of pornography in India. “If you search or talk about such stories, the only thing that comes up is pornography. I realised that the only situation in which we can imagine a home servant and the owner together is in the most exploitative context of pornography,” says she.

Be it Nayantara’s Necklace, where Tillotama’s character is a social wannabe who faces a moral question in the end or Qissa: The Tale of a Lonely Ghost, where her character’s life is disrupted and shaped by India’s brutal Partition, Tillotama’s roles have always pushed the frontiers of societal gaze. How does she select her roles? “If I get to learn a new accent, dialogue, language or some kind of action/physical activity, I would definitely go for it. I like to constantly add something new to my skill set. The other major factor is the script. It has to be the hero. If it’s not a hero on the pages, it can’t be that on the screen. These are two primarily important things that I look for. But yes, at the same time, I don’t want to be the flag-bearer of independent, serious cinema. I am an actor and don’t want to take myself too seriously. I am very much open to do all kinds of works,” she tells us.

Well, her recent role in web series, Mentalhood, of a loud-mouthed Punjabi woman proves that. She says, “She may be loud and crass but she is still a human.” And she is a humane artiste.

199,17-3-20,Khan Baba forever,"Ustad Bismillah Khan was the most simple, humble and divine artiste, says Dr Kavita Arya as she pens a memoir on his 104th birth anniversary

As an admirer and a resident of Ustad Bismillah Khan’s city, Varanasi, I enjoyed the privilege of visiting him at his residence several times. He was very affectionate to me and treated me as his granddaughter. Nai Sadak, Beniyabaagh that time was one of the dirtiest, narrow and poverty-stricken lanes of Varanasi. I would wonder how a legend like Khan had the humility to bloom in its deepest recesses. But Bismillah sa’ab himself described it as “Banaa” and “ras”, a place with the essence of delight. That’s why he has become a metaphor of the city itself.

The title of Bharat Ratna had not been conferred on him back then but he had already carved his place in my heart. I remembered the day I went to his house. Finally, we were in front of an unassuming door, which had a modest nameplate bearing his name. With nobody to guard, none to stop or ask any question, it was open and led straight to an inner verandah. The cemented floor was dotted with repaired patches here and there; the walls, too, had not been white-washed for a long time and wore an old look. A few family members were there, engaged casually in the daily core. Habituated to see unknown visitors, they gave us a cursory look and without asking any question a teen-aged girl pointed towards the staircase. Everything seemed so informal, natural and homely that we began feeling as if we were in our own home.

No one accompanied us but as indicated, we reached straight to the second floor room in which Ustad lived. The room and the adjacent terrace served as his usual place to meet visitors who often included national and international celebrities and dignitaries. The room, like the rest of the household, had nothing to boast of, without any pomp and show that one might expect in the house of a great artist. It had a tin shade without any false sealing and a simple table fan kept in one corner.

Surrounded by nearly a dozen people, he was sitting on a simple cot knitted with packthread. Talking to everyone with his characteristic affection, he saw us hesitating at the door and called us in. I looked around for a vacant chair; there was none. Without waiting or asking anyone, Ustadji himself went out and brought two plastic chairs. It is difficult for me to believe that the great old man of Indian music himself brought a chair for me, a college student. With the conversations going on in the room, I came to know that the visitors were family members of Daler Mehndi, the renowned singer. Baba, as I started calling him from that very day, did not know who Daler Mehndi was. That lack of curiosity was not unusual considering he did not worry about his self-image at all. That day, too, he was wearing a simple lungi and a multi-holed vest. His unconsciousness about appearances was no less remarkable than his music. Within seconds I was oblivious of the filth and stink outside and his great stature. But I can never forget the eternal gleam on his face and his blissful eyes. It seemed as if he survived only by the nectar and rhythm of music.

In later years of my life, I met a number of artists and well-known people but none was so simple, humble and heavenly. When I touched his feet, he blessed me with an affectionate smile, asking me which class I was studying in and if I could sing. I sang a film’s song, “Kabhi khwab mein ya khayaal mein...” He appreciated my immature singing and repeatedly blessed me with many words in such a way that visitors became curious about me. Baba said, “Everyone should sing. It is necessary. Keep singing, whether you are cooking or washing clothes or taking a stroll, just keep singing.” He loved cold drinks and offered it to everyone. When he got Bharat Ratna, people suggested he should buy a ceiling fan and give a facelift to his house. His reply was again characteristic, “Has the Bharat Ratna changed the colour of my blood or has it changed my face?” He could have asked anyone to improve his lane; the authorities would have done so without making any fuss but the thought of seeking any such favour never crossed his mind.

I used to visit him every now and then but couldn’t go for a long time when I was busy with my research work. Later I went to seek his blessings after my marriage to Rishi. Baba blessed me profusely and complained in the same breath, “Your husband? Blessings to both of you. Where were you all these years? Don’t you think you should see your Baba? As atonement, you will have to cook my meal today.” And then he jokingly added, “Don’t be afraid, my granddaughters will help you... And you gentleman, you have got the best of them as your life partner. She is a gem. She sings so well. You also sing?” Rishi, a regular singer, sang two songs but Baba was not impressed and said: “No, not up to mark. You have to put your soul into it. Then only the sur shall arrive some day. It has visited me just twice or thrice in my whole life, the rest that I play is just a feeble remembrance of those rare moments.”

While talking or listening to someone, Baba would suddenly start punctuating the song with his immortal voice. Those sporadic punctuations formed the most precious and memorable moments for the gathering. Coming out of his lane, I asked Rishi, “You have always been a better singer than me but why could you not give your best today?” He replied, “Ignorance is bliss. You are ignorant of his stature; to you, he is simply your Baba. I know how great he is. It was the consciousness of his greatness that kept hovering upon me as long as I was sitting in his presence.”

But Baba himself was never conscious of his own presence. It was only the music that mattered. In his own words, it was ibaadat. I find no parallel for this word in any other language. Any place where he could sit and sing was ibaadat for him . Often, it used to be the Hanuman temple at Manikarnika Ghat. Baba had a great reverence for Kashi Vishwanath and swore in typical Banarasi Boli when terrorists attacked the Sankat Mochan. He used to say, those who spread hate are neither Muslim nor Hindu.

Sometimes I miss him and want to ask, “Baba, don’t you think you should come and see your granddaughter?” But then I wonder, had he been alive, how much pained he might have felt in the atmosphere prevailing today.

200,17-3-20,"Met Opera, orchestras cancel performances","The Metropolitan Opera canceled performances and rehearsals through March 31 due to fears of the coronavirus spreading, leaving singers scrambling to get home and costing the financially-challenged company millions of dollars.

The move was announced Thursday, one day after US President Donald Trump announced a suspension of travel to the US from Europe for 30 days starting Friday. Met General Manager Peter Gelb said it was too early to determine whether the company will resume for any part of the remainder of its season, which runs through May 9. “With health authorities urging social distancing with greater emphasis, it is simply untenable for us to continue to perform, as it puts our artists, staff and audience at risk,” Gelb said.

Among the 21 canceled Met Opera performances were this Saturday’s matinee of a new staging of Wagner’s Der Fliegende Holländer (The Flying Dutchman) that was to have been televised to film theaters around the world. Also canceled was a March 29 recital by Soprano Diana Damrau with Royal Opera music director Antonio Pappano at the piano. “We do not have business interruption insurance. In fact, I don’t believe any of the performing arts companies, or at least none of the others I’ve been talking to, have it,” Gelb said in a telephone interview. “There are many ticket buyers who we hope might consider gifting us the tickets they’ve already purchased rather than asking for refunds.”

Gelb said the orchestra, chorus and other full-time union members will be kept on payroll at least through the end of March. Many of the Met’s singers and conductors travel regularly from Europe. Soprano Anna Netrebko posted on Instagram that she would not be traveling to New York for performances of Puccini’s Tosca that had been scheduled to start March 26. Gelb said if the season resumes, it would be more difficult to pull together productions that have not yet been on stage this season. “Our casting is totally compromised because many of the artists who were scheduled for these performances can’t even get to this country,” he said. “And those who were in this country would like to get out.”

Carnegie Hall also announced it was closing its doors at midnight Thursday for all public events through the end of March, canceling performances from The Philadelphia Orchestra, Angélique Kidjo, the Castalian String Quartet and Musical Armenia. The New York Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony and Los Angeles Philharmonic also announced plans to close.

The Philadelphia Orchestra and music director Yannick Nézet-Séguin went ahead with Thursday night’s world premiere of Iman Habibi’s Jeder Baum spricht (Every tree speaks) at an empty Verizon Hall and streamed the performance on its website.

201,17-3-20,Animal farm,"Known as the most prestigious practitioner of Gond art, Bhajju Shyam’s work has a rare uniqueness that embodies the entire range of human emotions through folk imagery. By Uma Nair

Gond artist Bhajju Shyam has carved a space for himself in India’s art landscape by combining tradition and simple beliefs with acquired techniques of expression. And he uses folk motifs as urban metaphors. For example, he had once pictured an airport as a gobbling bird. So there is a rootedness that informs his works, some of which are on display at the Ojas Art Gallery.

Among 50 artworks of different genres of folk and indigenous arts of the country, the work of Padma Shri Bhajju Shyam stands tall. There is not just compositional control but a felicity and fluidity with contours and colour tones. Known as the most prestigious practitioner of Gond art, Shyam’s work has a rare uniqueness that embodies the entire range of human emotions through animal imagery. In an interview to me last year he had said, “I’m constantly finding new subjects and metaphors from the stories of the Gond art tradition. That comes from the cradle, we are born with it and I cannot deviate from my being. My inspiration is my uncle Jangarh Singh Shyam. Whenever I mixed colours for him in his palette, he would share stories and thoughts with me. They stayed on and I draw on them for my interpretations.”

Saila Haathi

Another delightful work is Saila Haathi or the dancing elephant. Acrylic and ink become his favoured medium here. The elephant is both subject and object, myth and reality. It belongs to the figment of Bhajju’s imagination as well as the folk lore that he loves to transcend. But the elephant also brings us face to face with man’s greed and selfishness, the truth that this beautiful giant is on the way to extinction. Remember the persecution and cruelty meted out to elephants in the temples of Kerala and many other places? This image becomes a mascot of malpractices and the last cry of an animal that is pleading to humans.

Nau Rupi Macchli

The piece de resistance among the artist’s works is Naur Rupi Machli, which translates as a fish-shaped boat. You have to admire the intricate details of Gond art and the thoughts behind the creation in this beautifully-painted work of two large fish, a bird and smaller fish around them. Characteristic of Gond art are Bhajju’s teeming decorative patterns that fill the images. In order to highlight these patterns — which each artist develops for her/himself as a unique signature it — are their neatness and accuracy. Bhajju’s versatility stands out for his perfection in the geometric patterns that he creates. That expertise comes from helping his mother with digna or the geometric pattern before he apprenticed under the masters of Jangarh. The colours are both neon-tinted and flat, yet he weaves in a robust balance of darkness and light to create a surreal syntax.

Pawan

In another work titled Pawan, we see an idyllic simplicity. Worms and reptilian species dot the “tree of life” canvas but what stands is the continuity of tradition through antiquity that seems as just as relevant to modern contexts. Bhajju has a distinct approach and understanding; we see the way he fills in the details even as he plays with the beauty of concentric and geometric circles. There is a strong sense of symbolism in the manner in which he uses juxtaposition. While this varies from modern sensibility, it becomes a delicious blend of indigenous and contemporary explorations.

It also draws attention to the symbiotic relationship between nature and the individual. So when we see the work, there is a holistic pattern and aura of indigenous wisdom.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/animal-farm-2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/animal-farm.html

203,17-3-20,The right chord,"Mohiniyattam dancer Sruthi R Krishna says that the dance form has inspired her for its Abhinaya (expressions) as it directly and easily connects with the audience

What has been your guiding force that made you achieve so many accolades at such a young age?

It’s strongly and purely my parents motivation and strength which has encouraged me to work day and night. My amma (mother) has always stood with me, right from my studies to various dance practices and performances. Even my Guru Dr Jayaprabha Menon has always remained my greatest inspiration. Every new class or a lesson taught by her is a great learning.

What made you choose Mohiniyattam as your specialisation?

I have been learning dance under prominent gurus since I was five years old. Mohiniyattam is the classical solo dance form of Kerala and has always inspired me with its Abhinaya (expressions) as it directly and easily connects with people. Its delicate body movements and subtle facial expressions brings a flow in your body. The other most important and beautiful factor is its grace which is very difficult to bring out.

How do you think classical Indian artforms have evolved over the years?

The classical Indian artforms have evolved overtime in terms of the facial expressions, footwork, hand movements, synchronisation and many other such factors.

How do you see your peers following classical artforms since youth are more inclined towards pop culture?

Even though pop culture is known and liked by many I feel that even now classical artforms, be it dance, music or anything else, is highly appreciated and valued by many, even youngsters. I have participated in various competitions held by Delhi University. There I have always see a rise in the number of participants for classical programmes every year. In fact, other state and district level competitions are conducted in and around Delhi for youngsters and kids who focus on classical artforms to inspire students.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-right-chord-2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-right-chord.html

Global health guidelines may have warned against large gatherings and public events owing to the Coronavirus pandemic but can that ever dampen Bollywood’s mood to celebrate, especially when the event in question is about scooping up awards and enjoying live performances by the superstars?

If you were at the Zee Cine Awards, pandemic would probably be the last word in your mind. It was a star-studded gala where Hrithik Roshan, Ranveer Singh and Sara Ali Khan’s dance performances had them asking for more. Of course, for the sake of caution, the general public was not allowed entry and there was no red carpet either.

Among B-Town A-listers spotted keeping the shutterbugs busy with their style quotient and posing were Ayushmann Khurrana, Kartik Aaryan, Ananya Panday, Taapsee Pannu, Kriti Sanon, Nora Fatehi, Rakul Preet Singh, Tara Sutaria and Urvashi Rautela. Govinda came with wife Sunita, while fashion designer Manish Malhotra was spotted giving photo-ops.

Ranveer Singh lived up to his image of being an outrageous dresser, flaunting shock value in fashion as always in a shiny black coat that had gaudy, multi-coloured motifs all over. He insisted on keeping his deep-tinted Harry Potter shades on even when he was sitting inside the dimly-lit venue.

If you do keep track of who won what, Ranveer won the Best Actor (Male) in a Leading Role award for his performance in Gully Boy while actress Taapsee Pannu won the Best Actress award for her role in Badla. Posting a photo with the trophy on social media, Taapsee wrote, “The first one for ‘Naina Sethi’.”

Ranveer returned on stage to collect the Best Onscreen Pair trophy along with Siddhant Chaturvedi for Gully Boy, while Siddhant was also declared Best Male Debutant for the same film. Ananya Panday won Best Female Debutant for Student Of the Year 2.

“Blessings on Blessings on Blessings,” wrote Ranveer alongside an image in which he is seen flaunting his trophies. Ayushmann Khurrana was declared “Best Entertainer of the Year” while Kartik Aaryan won the Best Comic Performance award for his role in Pati Patni Aur Woh.

The Best Music award winners were Sachet-Parampara for Kabir Singh while Parvez Shaikh, Paul Jennings, Oh Sea Young and Franz Spilhaus shared the Best Action trophy for War. The Best Choreography award went to Bosco-Caesar for the number Jai Jai Shiv Shankar in War, and the film also won Best Visual Effects.

205,17-3-20,Professional Manjrekar respects BCCI's decision,"Dropped from the BCCI commentary panel for the South Africa ODI series, former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar on Sunday said he always considered commentating a privilege and accepted the decision as a professional.

One of the most accomplished voices among Indian experts, Manjrekar, who got embroiled in controversies in recent years for some of his views on air, was axed from the BCCI’s commentary panel for the South Africa series recently.

“I have always considered commentary as a great privilege, but never an entitlement,” the 54-year-old wrote on his twitter handle.

Cricket Australia, however, deferred a decision on the final, scheduled to be played from March 27, given the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic situation, according to cricket.Com.Au.

CA chief executive Kevin Roberts said the Shield final round had been cancelled “in an effort to reduce travel"" and he hoped it would “contribute to the global effort to slow, and eventually stop, the spread of coronavirus”.

“At times like this, cricket must take a back seat for the greater good,” he said.

“We have been in consultation with relevant government agencies, our own medical team and an infectious diseases expert for quite some time now, and we have taken all their advice into account in making these decisions.”

The CA chief added: ""The decisions are not something we are accustomed to in cricket ... It has become evident that we must play our part in helping limit the spread of the virus by reducing person-to-person contact wherever possible. These measures reflect that.”

Spectators had already been banned from the three matches due to be played this week at the WACA in Perth, Karen Rolton Oval in Adelaide and Melbourne’s Junction Oval.

In the final round matches, due to begin Tuesday, South Australia were to host Queensland while NSW were to travel to play Western Australia in Perth. Victoria were set to host Tasmania from Thursday.

One option being considered by CA is awarding the NSW Blues, the current league leaders, the title if the final cannot be played.

If that happens, it would be the state’s 47th Shield title, and first since the 2013-14 summer.

If the public health situation improves in the next week, the final may proceed as planned with Victoria likely to be the Blues’ opponents.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ca-cancels-final-round-of-sheffield-shield.html
216,17-3-20,Modern cricketers need to adapt to all formats: Jaffer,"Ranji Trophy great Wassim Jaffer feels that the modern day cricketer needs to be good at all formats of the game to truly earn respect of the cricketing community. Jaffer recently called time on his 24-year professional career in which he scored nearly 19,500 first class runs.

Jaffer feels that players like him and the likes of Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman from his days with the Indian team are under appreciated.

“I think the time has changed. Even in my time I feel a lot of players like Rahul Dravid or VVS Laxman, I don't think they got their value,” Jaffer told cricket.com.

“A player playing with them in a Test match knows how important those players are. But you know we have to go with the time. A lot of importance is given to T20 cricket.

“The people who are in marketing business or advertising business want somebody who is seen more on the TV, somebody who is glamorous or someone who plays the brand of cricket the crowd likes.

“But you can’t devalue someone who plays T20 cricket because that's the demand of the game nowadays. What I feel is, in today's age and day, the cricketer needs to adapt himself to all three formats. You can’t just play Test cricket or you can't just play T20 cricket.

“You will be recognised and respected only if you fit in all three formats. I am not saying Pujara is not respected, but then obviously he is going to play only Test cricket and no other format.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/modern-cricketers-need-to-adapt-to-all-formats--jaffer.html

Ferguson returned home following the postponement of the ODI series against Australia. The first match was played in front of empty stands.

A bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud said there cannot be 101 excuses for not granting gender equality in the armed forces and a level playing field is needed.

Denying permanent commission to women officers who have served the nation would result in a serious miscarriage of justice, it said.

The bench, also comprising Justice Ajay Rastogi, rejected the Centre's stand that sea sailing duties cannot be granted to SSC (Short Service Commission) women officers in the Navy because its Russian vessels do not have washrooms for them.

Such arguments, the court said, are contrary to the Centre's policy of 1991 and 1998 which lifted the statutory bar on the induction of women officers in the Navy.

The bench quashed the prospective effect of the policy barring women officers inducted before 2008 from being granted permanent commission in the Navy. It also granted pension benefits to women officers who have retired and were not granted permanent commission.

It said there cannot be gender discrimination in granting permanent commission to women officers in the Navy after the statutory bar was lifted by the Centre to allow entry of women.

""Once statutory bar was lifted to allow entry of women officers then male and female officers are to be treated equally in granting permanent commission,"" the court said.

""To undertake the immediate restoration of cables or signalling in this section, trains were run on single line (down line) between Dwarka Sec-9 to Dwarka Sec-12 stations of the Blue line till 11:30 am, resulting in bunching of trains during peak hours and delay on the Dwarka-Dwarka Sec-21 section,"" it added.

Subsequently, the DMRC said, normal movement of trains was restored on the affected section.

""The theft of these cables is a matter of grave concern for the DMRC which it has been facing for quite some time now. The miscreants, despite all the preventive measures put in place by DMRC, somehow manage to enter the premises putting their lives at risk to steal these cables for petty gains,"" it said.

""The DMRC lodges the FIR in such cases and breakthroughs have also been made in the past by the police. However, in recent times such incidents have witnessed a spurt with 14-15 such cases reported on Airport Line alone in the month of February 2020,"" it said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/train-services-affected-on-blue-line-due-to-signalling-cable-theft--dmrc-2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/train-services-affected-on-blue-line-due-to-signalling-cable-theft--dmrc.html

228,17-3-20,Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu has set its foot in India,"Being home to 130+ Crore people and many martial art forms, it’s hard to believe that almost no one has heard about Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) and it has only recently started to take off in India and produced its First Black Belt.

Arun Sharma, Founder and Head Instructor of BJJ India and Jeet Kune Do Athletic Club India, recently earned his BJJ black belt after 13 years of training in the Art, from multiple times world champion and a 4th Degree Black Belt Rodrigo Teixeria from Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.

Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu is a form of martial art that was developed by the Gracie family in the early 1910s. It is also known as The Gentle Art of Self Defense as it teaches its students to defend themselves without hurting the assailant by relying on techniques that are based on leverage and principles of physics, which also gives the smaller person to defend themselves against a bigger attacker without relying on speed and strength.

BJJ is also the fastest growing sport around the Globe. It is already a mainstream sport in the American and European countries and India is catching up with the rest of the world rapidly.

Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu can be practised as an art of self-defence, a sport or as a part of fitness regime. Some people also do it as an activity to socialise as worldwide BJJ community is known for being welcoming and friendly.

In the past 13 years, Arun has taught more than 150 free seminars in the rural areas of the country. His vision is to spread the art of Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu in India and he plans on doing it by making 1000 instructors which will allow people to see it as a viable career path as well.

Arun’s journey in martial arts started at the age of 12 after he witnessed two of his friends getting killed with a knife. He started with Shaoling kung fu, Jeet Kune do (JKD) and Filipino Kali before ultimately finding that his true self and passion lied within Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu.

There weren’t any Jiu-Jitsu Instructors in India when he started training. In 2004, the internet was not readily available in India so he used his father’s work computer to watch videos of BJJ. That changed when Rodrigo Teixeria started visiting India from Brazil to give Arun private training without charging any fees.

Arun has been training the Indian special forces and NSG along with various other Military and Law Enforcement Agencies since he was 18 years old.

“Jiu-Jitsu for me is self-improvement every day and exorcising the demons within. Jiu-Jitsu has made me calmer, it has given me the skill of understanding that you can defend yourself without hurting the aggressor. It has taught me that you can be anywhere in the world and still help people by spreading the art. “I was an introvert and shy kid in school and it has really helped me out to bring out my personality, of helping people out and of making my passion, my career"" said Arun.

Arun’s Martial arts academy BJJ India, located in Malviya Nagar, Delhi, has now over 200 students enrolled with them. His students have participated in numerous tournaments and have accumulated over 15 Gold medals so far in the Nationals and International tournaments and now he hopes and envisions to spread the art in the upcoming times in India.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/brazillian-jiu-jitsu-has-set-its-foot-in-india.html
229,17-3-20,Doubts grow in Japan over Olympics,"Doubts are growing in Japan about the Tokyo Olympics, with growing opposition to holding them as scheduled and some urging officials not to risk lives by pressing ahead during the coronavirus emergency.

Officials like Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach have repeatedly insisted preparations should continue to light the Olympic flame on July 24.

But with events from the Premier League to NBA basketball scrapped, and Japanese sport also at a standstill, even US President Donald Trump has suggested putting the Olympics on hold.

Japan has seen relatively few cases, with 814 testing positive and 24 dead. But some people on the streets of Tokyo voiced concern for the fans that would pour in from abroad.

Koki Miura, a 27-year-old employee at an internet company, said: “To be honest, even if Japan overcomes this crisis, we wouldn’t receive visitors from the world. I think we’d better not hold it.”

“We cannot sacrifice people’s lives for it,” added Miura, who said the Games should be postponed — if not cancelled outright.

Public opinion in Japan appears to be moving against the Games. A poll for public broadcaster NHK taken on March 6-9 suggested 45 percent were opposed to going ahead as planned, with 40 percent in favour.

And a new poll of more than 1,000 people released Monday by Japan’s Kyodo news agency showed 69.9 percent of respondents believe Tokyo will not be able to hold the Games as scheduled.

Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike has said it is “unthinkable” to cancel the Olympics but the decision rests with the IOC, which is planning emergency talks with international sports federations on Tuesday, according to an IOC source.

Bach has stressed the IOC will follow World Health Organization recommendations regarding a possible postponement. But he has also acknowledged that the cancellation of qualifying events was posing “serious problems”.

At the beginning of March, Bach said the IOC would show “flexibility” regarding qualifications for the Tokyo, and encouraged “all athletes to continue to prepare” for the Games.

‘Look at the panic’

Masao Sugawara, a 90-year-old pensioner, said: “Personally, I think it would be safer to postpone the Olympics for a year, just as President Trump said. Look at the panic.”

“Of course it would be disappointing, though,” he admitted.

Manfred Otto, 45, a half-Japanese, half-German lawyer, said he was “worried” about the Games and stressed: “We really need to be careful.”

“If the outbreak does not get controlled by June or July, I think we should postpone it,” said Otto.

The betting odds are increasingly shifting towards the opening ceremony not taking place on July 24. Bookmaker Paddy Power is offering 4-1 against the Games opening on time.

This comes as the virus — which has killed 6,400 people worldwide — shreds the international sporting calendar, with almost no elite sporting action taking place last weekend.

Preparations for the Games have already been affected, with qualifiers cancelled, test events scaled back and the Olympic torch arrival and relay altered.

Plans have been scrapped to involve hundreds of children in the torch’s arrival ceremony, while an exhibition and three events to display the flame have also been axed.

Cancelling the Olympics would be a heartbreaking decision for Tokyo residents who rushed to buy tickets, and authorities whose preparations have won widespread praise — with the majority of venues ready well ahead of schedule.

Hisaya Suzuki, 47, said he had tickets to see baseball, Japan’s most popular sport.

“It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so I really wanted to take my son,” he said, but added: “If there will be negative consequences, it may be wiser to pause it (the Games).”

Sugawara said the magnitude of the coronavirus trumped sporting considerations.

“I am 90 years old. Except for wartime, I have never felt so worried.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/doubts-grow-in-japan-over-olympics.html
230,17-3-20,No deadline for decision on Olympics: IOC official,"The leader of the IOC’s co-ordination commission for the Tokyo Olympics said there is no May deadline to cancel the games and he remains confident the event will go ahead despite sports coming to a virtual standstill globally.

John Coates, who will have to go into government-mandated self-isolation when he returns to Australia this week from Olympic business in Europe, told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper: “It’s all proceeding to start on the 24th of July.”

Dick Pound, a former IOC vice president, said in an interview with the Associated Press last month that the end of May loomed as a possible deadline for the IOC to make a call on the Tokyo Olympics.

But Coates, an IOC vice president and head of the Australian Olympic Committee, told the paper in a telephone interview from Switzerland that the IOC didn’t recognize the deadline and he thought Pound had backed away from it, too.

“It’s never been the IOC’s position. It was Dick’s idea. There is four months to go,” Coates told the newspaper on Monday.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/no-deadline-for-decision-on-olympics--ioc-official.html

The ceremony will take place in the presence of Greece President Katerina Sakellaropoulou and a small delegation of the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee, said the Hellenic Olympic Committee. “The Panathenaic Stadium will be closed to the public,” it said.

“Tokyo 2020 has been informed that the Greek leg of the Olympic Torch Relay has been cancelled.

232,17-3-20,‘Football can wait’,"Italy coach Roberto Mancini said on Sunday he was ready for the European Championship to be postponed until 2021 amid the coronavirus pandemic.

“We would have won the European Championship this summer, we can also win it in 2021,” Mancini told Italian television station Rai Sport.

“Let’s wait to see what UEFA decides, but I adapt to everything, right now the priority is to save lives.”

Italy are set to host the opening match in Rome on June 12, in a tournament which will be played in 12 countries across the continent.

“The fact is that the problems we are having now other nations will have shortly,” continued the former Manchester City and Inter Milan coach.

“First of all we need to protect people’s health, we have to wait for the peak, then when this situation begins to ease off we could start talking and decide everything later.

“When we return to our normal life, to football, we will be happier, we’ll find freedom, be able to go back to matches at the stadium, have fun,” added the 55-year-old.

“These dramatic situations can make you become better. I hope so.”

Italy won all 10 of their Euro 2020 qualifying matches as they roared back under Mancini’s guidance having failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.

233,17-3-20,CL could be concluded with 4-day finals,"In the wake of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the Champions League can see both semi-finals and the final played over a four-day period in Istanbul.

According to a report in telegraph.co.uk, this idea is among a series of proposals to be put forward during emergency Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) video conference meetings on Tuesday.

If the idea is agreed, the same would apply to the Europa League where the final is due to take place in the Polish city of Gdansk.

Another idea which would be considered during Tuesday’s meet is to condense all the games, including the quarter-finals and semi-finals, which would normally be over two-legs, home and away, into one-off matches to crammed into one week.

The UEFA plan would see the remaining last-16 ties being played as normal once football is allowed to return. During the meeting, they could also look at postponing Euro 2020 for an year.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/cl-could-be-concluded-with-4-day-finals.html
234,17-3-20,Euro 2020 fate to be determined today,"A decision over whether to postpone football’s Euro 2020 by up to a year, with all the sporting and financial consequences that would entail, is set to be made when UEFA holds a crisis meeting on Tuesday as Europe battles the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

European football’s governing body will hold a videoconference with representatives from all 55 member associations as well as from clubs and players bodies. UEFA will then hold an executive committee meeting at 1400 (1300 GMT) at their Swiss headquarters.

The future of the European Championship, due to take place for the first time in 12 different cities spread across the continent from June 12 to July 12, is up in the air along with those of the Champions League and Europa League.

The “dark scenarios” that UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin warned against envisaging when he spoke at the organisation’s congress in Amsterdam just two weeks ago now have to be considered.

All of Europe’s leading domestic leagues ground to a halt last week, while UEFA suspended all Champions League and Europa League games due to be played this week. Both tournaments are still in the last-16 stage.

Europe has become the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, with Italy and Spain on lockdown, France gradually following suit, and other countries closing borders to halt the spread of the outbreak. More than 1,800 people have died in Italy, which is supposed to host the opening game of Euro 2020 in Rome.

Postponed for a year?

The head of the Italian football federation, Gabriele Gravina, has already proposed that the Euro be postponed, with Italy coach Roberto Mancini calling for it to pushed back 12 months.

“We would have won the European Championship this summer, we can also win it in 2021,” Mancini told television station Rai Sport.

It is a position that many around the continent are coming round to amid much uncertainty as to when club football can resume.

“UEFA has no choice. They have to postpone the Euro and the Champions League,” one senior figure in the world game said, although finding agreement across the board may not be easy.

“There are people who want to play, and others who don’t,” French football federation president Noel Le Graet told broadcaster TF1 on Sunday.

German broadcaster ZDF reported that two possible options are on the table for the European Championship.

One is to push it back to 2021, although that is not as simple as it might appear, as it would need FIFA president Gianni Infantino to agree to halting the inaugural edition of his highly lucrative Club World Cup, due to take place in June and July next year in China with some of Europe’s top club sides involved.

FIFA offered “no comment” on Monday on the matter.

There is also the issue of the women’s European Championship, scheduled to run from July 7 to August 1 next year in England, with the final at Wembley. The London venue is also supposed to hold the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020.

The alternative option, according to ZDF, is to maintain a Euro 2020 by playing it towards the end of the year.

That supposes that the crisis will have calmed down by then, and there is also the issue of all the other football that has been suspended.

Le Graet said “it is probable” that all friendly matches scheduled to be played at the end of this month will be postponed. Play-off matches to decide the last four berths at Euro 2020 can be expected to go the same way.

In any case, world governing body FIFA has already moved to say that clubs no longer need to release players for the scheduled international dates.

They may come to a decision to try to complete the Champions League and Europa League by curtailing the competitions, meaning ties up to the semi-finals could be decided in one-off matches.

From a financial viewpoint, UEFA would undoubtedly prefer postponing their flagship tournaments to cancelling them altogether, or playing matches behind closed doors.

In any case, the European Leagues grouping of almost a thousand clubs in 29 countries across the continent warned that “cooperation, coordination and flexibility are going to be essential”.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/euro-2020-fate-to-be-determined-today-2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/euro-2020-fate-to-be-determined-today.html
235,17-3-20,SC seeks response of MP govt on Chouhan's plea seeking floor test,"The Supreme Court has asked the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh to give by Wednesday its response to former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan's plea seeking a direction for an immediate floor test in the assembly.

A bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud on Tuesday said it will issue notice to the state government and others, including the secretary of the legislative assembly, for tomorrow at 10.30 am.

Chouhan and nine other BJP lawmakers, including leader of opposition in the state assembly, moved the Supreme Court on Monday just after Speaker N P Prajapati cited coronavirus concerns and adjourned the house till March 26 without taking the floor test, apparently defying Governor Lalji Tandon's directions.

Appearing for the senior BJP leader and three-time chief minister, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said ""the rationale in this case is that a floor test is required and usually the other side appears in such cases"".

Taking note of the submission, the bench said, ""We will have to issue a sought notice and keep it for tomorrow morning.""

The bench then took note of the submission of senior advocate Maninder Singh appearing for 16 rebel Congress MLAs that they be also allowed to become parties to Chouhan's petition.

Singh said 22 Congress MLAs have resigned from the assembly and the resignations of six lawmakers have already been accepted.

He said the remaining 16 MLAs also want their resignations to be accepted.

The bench granted Chouhan the liberty to serve the copy of the petition to the state government, speaker and others through e-mail besides traditional modes of service notice.

On Saturday night, the Madhya Pradesh governor wrote to Nath asking him to seek a trust vote in the assembly soon after the governor's address on Monday, saying his government was in a minority.

After the speaker accepted the resignation of six Congress MLAs on Saturday, the party now has 108 legislators.

These include 16 rebel legislators who have also put in their papers but their resignations are yet to be accepted.

The BJP has 107 seats in the House, which now has an effective strength of 222, with the majority mark being 112.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-seeks-response-of-mp-govt-on-chouhan-s-plea-seeking-floor-test-2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sc-seeks-response-of-mp-govt-on-chouhan-s-plea-seeking-floor-test.html

The DSGMC said only those foreigners who are staying in India for more than 15 days will be allowed to visit gurdwara premises as a matter of precaution and preventive measures.

Speaking to The Pioneer, Manjinder Singh Sirsa president, DSGMC, said the committee is following all measures ordered by the Government of India. “We are preparing langar (food served to devotees) in house only. In the wake of coronavirus, no outside items shall be cooked/prepared in kitchen,” Sirsa said, adding, “We have conveyed that all the devotees have been requested to take langar prasad from main langar halls only.”

“All the gurdwara sevadar henceforth will start services in gurdwaras after sanitising them and washing their hands with soaps and take every possible precaution to check transmission of coronavirus,” said SAD leader.

239,17-3-20,"Virus-hit Sensex tanks 2,713 pts; Rs 7.6L cr lost","Indian share market joined the global sell-off on Monday with the Sensex logging its second-biggest drop in a day even as the RBI hinted at a rate cut but stopped short of a decision, belying market expectations at a hurriedly called presser. The Central bank did announce some liquidity enhancing measures to contain the economic fallout from the coronavirus.

The market mayhem may not yet be over as the US indices tanked by nearly 10 per cent when it opened late in the evening despite the fact that the US Fed on Sunday made its second emergency rate cut in less than two weeks, slashing the benchmark borrowing rate to a range of 0-0.25 per cent, where it was during the 2008 global financial crisis.

The 30-share BSE Sensex plunged 2,713.41 points or 7.96 per cent to finish at 31,390.07. Likewise, the broader NSE Nifty gave up the 9,200 level, slumping 757.80 points or 7.61 per cent to end at 9,197.40.

It eroded Rs 7.62 lakh crore of investors’ money.

This was the second biggest drop for the benchmarks in absolute terms. The Sensex and Nifty had plummeted 2,919.26 points and 868.25 points respectively on March 12.

Asian markets nosedived after China’s factory output and retail sales data came in sharply lower, fanning fears of a coronavirus-triggered economic slump. Bourses in Shanghai dropped 3.40 per cent, Hong Kong 4.03 per cent, Seoul 3.19 per cent and Tokyo cracked 2.46 per cent. European markets too tumbled up to 8 per cent as much of the region went into shutdown mode. Brent crude oil futures melted 7.53 per cent to USD 31.30 per barrel. The rupee depreciated 55 paise to 74.31 per US dollar (intra-day).

During market hours when the news came in that RBI Governor Shakitkanta Das will address a press conference at 4 p.m, the Dalal Street buzzed with speculation of imminent rate cut by the RBI, however the Central Bank hinted at doing so at the next MPC meeting on April 3, even as it rolled out more liquidity enhancing measures.

All Sensex components ended in the red. IndusInd Bank was the top loser, skidding 17.50 per cent, followed by Tata Steel (11.02 per cent), HDFC (10.94 per cent), Axis Bank (10.38 per cent) and ICICI Bank (9.96 per cent).

All sectoral indices closed with losses, with BSE metal, bankex, finance, realty, IT and energy indices dropping up to 9.30 per cent. Broader mid-cap and small-cap indices fell up to 5.94 per cent.

To a question why the rates were left unchanged at 5.15 per cent, Das said, “According to the prevailing law, the rate cut call has to be taken through the monetary policy committee, but I don’t rule out anything. Depending on the evolving situation, we will decide on the timing of our action.”

In two liquidity enhancing measures, Das announced another round of $ 2 billion dollar-rupee swap on March 23, and in another measure he said the RBI will continue to conduct the long-term repo operations (LTROs) of up to Rs 1 lakh crore as and when the market needs it.

The RBI today conducted the first dollar-swap for USD 2 billion under which the Central bank buys rupee from the market by selling the dollars. On the LTROs, it has already conducted four rounds worth Rs 1 lakh crore operations since February 14, after announcing it at the February 6 policy review.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/virus-hit-sensex-tanks-2-713-pts--rs-7-6l-cr-lost-2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/virus-hit-sensex-tanks-2-713-pts--rs-7-6l-cr-lost.html
240,17-3-20,Former CJI Ranjan Gogoi nominated to Rajya Sabha,"The Government on Monday night issued a notification announcing former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi’s nomination to the Rajya Sabha.

Ex-CJI Gogoi — who will remembered for the Ayodhya verdict that gave Hindus the 2.77 acre disputed land for construction of Ram Temple — will be the first former CJI to be nominated to the Upper House. Before him former CJI Ranganath Misra was also a Rajya Sabha member but he was elected on a Congress party ticket.

Gogoi also headed benches that pronounced several key judgments like the Rafale fighter jet deal and the entry of women in Sabarimala temple.

“In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-clause (a) of clause (1) of article 80 of the Constitution of India, read with clause (3) of that article, the President is pleased to nominate Shri Ranjan Gogoi to the Council of States to fill the vacancy caused due to the retirement of one of the nominated members,” the notification said.

The vacancy was created due to retirement of KTS Tulsi.

Gogoi (65) retired as CJI in November last year after a tenure of a little over 13 months.

His tenure as judge and as CJI was also marked by some controversies as he had faced allegations of sexual harassment, of which he was cleared.

He was among the four senior-most judges who held an unprecedented presser in January 2018 questioning the then CJI's way of functioning.

Later at a public function, Gogoi had remarked that ""independent judges and noisy journalists are a democracy's first line of defence"".

A bench headed by him gave clean chit to the Modi government twice -- first on the writ petition and then on the pleas seeking review of the December 14, 2018 verdict -- in the Rafale fighter jet deal with French firm Dassault Aviation.

The bench had warned Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for wrongly attributing certain remarks to the apex court in the Rafale case and asked him to be more careful in the future.

Besides, Gogoi headed a bench which in a landmark verdict held that the office of the CJI is a public authority under the Right to Information Act, but ""judicial independence has to be kept in mind"" while disclosing information in ""public interest"".

A five-judge Constitution bench headed by Gogoi struck down in entirety the rules formulated by the Centre on appointment and service conditions for members of various tribunals, and referred to a larger bench the issue of examining the validity of the passage of the Finance Act, 2017 as Money Bill.

He also led a bench which monitored the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

A lot of controversies plagued the NRC but Gogoi stood his ground and later came out in public defending the decision to hold the exercise to identify illegal immigrants.

As the CJI, he took tough decisions against erring judges and recommended their transfers and a woman high court judge was virtually forced to resign.

Meanwhile, as the day of hanging of the four death-row convicts nears, three of them on Monday moved the International Court of Justice seeking a stay on their “unlawful execution”, alleging the probe leading to their conviction was “flawed” and they have been treated as “guinea pigs”.

A Bench comprising Justices Arun Mishra and MR Shah heard submissions of lawyer ML Sharma, appearing for Mukesh, and rejected the plea by terming it as “not maintainable” in view of the fact that both the review and the curative pleas in the case have been dismissed.

The apex court had on July 9, 2018 dismissed the review plea of Mukesh against its judgment; later, his curative and mercy pleas were rejected by the top court and President Ram Nath Kovind respectively.

On March 5, a trial court issued fresh warrants with March 20, 5.30 am, as the date for the execution of the convicts — Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31).",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sc-rejects-nirbhaya-rapist---s-remedy-plea--3-convicts-move-icj.html
242,17-3-20,US lawmakers seek return of Tennessee pastor from India,"A group of four US lawmakers has requested Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla to ensure the return of Tennessee pastor Bryan Nerren who was arrested in India last year on charges of travelling with USD 40,000 of undeclared currency.

Senators James Lankford, Marsha Blackburn and Congressmen Scott DesJarlais and Jody Hice, in a letter to Shringla, said Nerren was arrested in West Bengal's Bagdogra in October, 2019 and charged with violating the Foreign Exchange Management Act for travelling with USD 40,000 of undeclared currency.

On October 11, he was released on bail. His passport was seized in order to ensure appearance at court hearings - all of which he has attended, the lawmakers said.

""We write to bring your attention to the case of Bryan Kevin Nerren Sr of Shelbyville, Tennessee. We are immediately concerned with the health of the Nerren family, including Mr Nereen's daughter with special needs, who has been hospitalised with pneumonia as Mr Nerren remains in India without a clear point of return,"" the Congressmen wrote in the letter.

""We request that India uphold their end of the offer, as Mr Nerren has upheld his, by finalising the compounding of the offence and allowing him to return to his family,"" they said.

""The US-India relationship is a vital and healthy one, as exhibited by President (Donald) Trump's recent visit to Delhi. We do not wish for bureaucratic posturing in this case – which can now be simply closed according to Indian law – to become an impediment in that relationship. Thank you for your attention to this matter,"" the letter said.

On December 31, 2019, Indian Customs issued a show cause order confiscating the USD 40,000 and imposing a penalty of Rs 3 lakh (roughly USD 4,000). As of January 2, 2020, Nerren had surrendered the entire amount and paid the fine, the letter said, adding that most recently, he accepted an offer to compound his offence.

He submitted an application for compounding, filed an affidavit with the court indicating submission of the application, and compiled USD 7,000 to be transferred to Customs upon Customs' finalization of the appropriate paperwork.

He has completed all of these required actions. ""However, Customs is now requiring the submission of a waiver of forfeiture for the money lost, a request that was not included in the original conditions – and to our knowledge is not required by Indian law,"" the letter said.

""Following nearly five months of court dates, provision of additional documents and requirements beyond the original conditions of Mr Nerren's arrest, Mr Nerren remains in Siliguri, India,"" they wrote.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-lawmakers-seek-return-of-tennessee-pastor-from-india-2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/us-lawmakers-seek-return-of-tennessee-pastor-from-india.html
243,17-3-20,"CAA does not violate fundamental rights, Centre tells SC","The Centre Tuesday told the Supreme Court that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019 does not violate any fundamental right.

The central government, in its 129-page affidavit in response to the pleas challenging the constitutional validity of CAA, termed the legislation legal and asserted that there was no question of it violating constitutional morality.

It also said CAA does not confer any arbitrary and unguided powers on the executive as the citizenship to the persecuted minorities of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh would be granted in a manner as specified under the law governing grant of citizenship.

The affidavit has been filed by B C Joshi, Director in the Ministry of Home Affairs.

The Supreme Court on December 18 last year had decided to examine the constitutional validity of the CAA but had refused to stay its operation.

The newly amended law seeks to grant citizenship to non-Muslim migrants belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, Jain and Parsi communities who came to the country from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan on or before December 31, 2014.

The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), one of the petitioners out of over 100 pleas which has challenged the CAA, has said in its plea that it violates the fundamental Right to Equality and intends to grant citizenship to a section of illegal immigrants by making an exclusion on the basis of religion.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/caa-does-not-violate-fundamental-rights--centre-tells-sc-2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/caa-does-not-violate-fundamental-rights--centre-tells-sc.html
244,17-3-20,Tourism important but safety comes first: Tourism Minister,"Conceding the effect of coronavirus on the Indian tourism industry, the Union Tourism Minister Prahlad Singh Patel claimed that the loss to industry stakeholders was evident but stressed that safety is of utmost importance.

""Travel agencies, hotels, and others related to tourism industry will have to face economic loss and it is evident that coronavirus will affect tourism in the near future too, but the government is standing by them,"" Patel told IANS in an exclusive interview.

He added that restricting tourists influx in the country amid coronavirus outbreak was a tough measure but a correct one.

""Safety is the priority, business comes second. So, I feel that the decision to put in restrictions on travellers is correct,"" Patel said.

He said the evacuation of Indian students from China, Italy, Iran, combined with the safety first attitude of Indian government will help the country in gaining goodwill in the world.

""We want to ensure safety even after the pandemic is over and before removing restrictions from tourismm. Despite a big challenge, I firmly believe that we will be one of the strongest nations who can guarantee security to the tourists,"" Patel said.

Agra, which has reported the maximum number of eight coronavirus patients in the past two weeks, is one of the worst-hit cities in Uttar Pradesh.

More than 50 per cent drop in tourism has been recorded in Agra in recent weeks.

According to reports, there was a drastic drop in the sale of tickets to the Taj Mahal on Sunday.

Data provided by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) shows that the number of foreign tourists fell down to a mere 1,274 on Sunday. In comparison, on any normal day, there are more than 20,000 to 25,000 visitors at the Taj Mahal.

Meanwhile on Monday, the authorities in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands suspended all tourism activities in the Union Territory from March 16 till March 26 in the wake of coronavirus scare.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tourism-important-but-safety-comes-first--tourism-minister-2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/tourism-important-but-safety-comes-first--tourism-minister.html
245,17-3-20,Nirbhaya convict's plea for quashing death penalty dismissed,"A court here on Tuesday dismissed an application moved by Mukesh Singh, one of the convicts facing the gallows in Nirbhaya rape and murder case, seeking quashing of the death penalty awarded to him.

Additional Sessions Judge Dharmendra Rana, after dismissing the plea, transferred the matter to Bar Council of India.

Mukesh and three other convicts -- Vinay, Akshay, and Pawan -- are scheduled to be executed on March 20 at 5.30 am for raping and murdering a 23-year-old physiotherapy student, dubbed later as Nirbhaya, on December 16, 2012.

The convict, through his counsel M.L. Sharma, filed an application claiming that the prosecution deliberately concealed certain documentary evidence to falsely implicate him and secure the death sentence.

Mukesh claimed that he was not in the national capital when the crime was committed and was arrested from Rajasthan and brought to Delhi on December 17, 2012, a day after the incident.

The application stated that the documents pertaining to him being picked up from Karoli in Rajasthan was hidden to implicate him as ""driver and rapist.""

It also contended that disability certificate of deceased Ram Singh, torture of Mukesh and a Rs 4 crore bribe paid to procure a death sentence, was also hidden from the court.

""State concealed following vital documents in the trial court and secured final order to execute death sentence. Trial is outcome of concealment of vital documents by fixing the petitioner in place of actual accused persons, which is liable to be quashed in the interest of justice,"" the application stated.

246,17-3-20,"Talks between police, Shaheen Bagh protesters fail","The fresh talks between the Delhi Police and the women protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at Shaheen Bagh on Tuesday failed as they ignored the appeal made by the police to vacate the main road and said that they will continue the protest.

Talks between the police and the women protesters were held at a neutral venue at the intersection located about 100 meters away from the protest site.

The local police station SHO and ACP Jagdish Yadav were present on behalf of the police while 20 women represented the protesters.

ACP Yadav said: ""You have been protesting here from last several months, during which we provided you full security. Now, we request you to vacate the main road and protest at some other place.""

The appeal of the police was unanimously opposed by the women representatives. ACP Yadav then asked the women to vacate the second part of the road so that vehicle movement can be started.

The police want that the front section of the Shaheen Bagh road on which the protest is going on should be opened but the women protesting here refused to do so.

Fatima, one of the women who came to talk with the police, said: ""If the second part of the road gets opened our security is compromised so we can't agree to it.""

The women after that started raising slogans.

The hearing over the Shaheen Bagh protest is scheduled for next week. Prior to this hearing, the police is trying to find a solution to this issue through a peaceful dialogue.

When the women who represented the protesters during the talks with the police informed the other protesters about the police appeal to vacate the second part of the road for the traffic, they refused unanimously. Most of the women at Shaheen Bagh said that the protest will end only after the government withdraws the CAA.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/talks-between-police--shaheen-bagh-protesters-fail-2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/talks-between-police--shaheen-bagh-protesters-fail.html
247,17-3-20,Centre to SC: NRC necessary exercise to identify citizens,"The Centre in a preliminary affidavit in the Supreme Court establishing the necessity of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) said the preparation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a necessary exercise for any sovereign country for identification of citizens from non-citizens.

Citing the importance of the NRC, the Centre in the affidavit said it may not be out of place to mention that as per the information available in open sources in many countries, there is a system of maintaining register of their citizens.

""In fact, national identification cards are issued based upon the exercise of identification of citizens in these countries. In Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan also there is a system of issuance of such cards"", said the affidavit. The Centre mentioned NRC while giving its response on the challenge to the Section 14A of the Act.

The 129-page affidavit said that as per the existing statutory regime, there are three classes of persons residing in India: citizens, illegal migrants and foreigners on valid visas. Therefore, the responsibility entrusted on the Centre, on a combined reading of the Foreigners Act, The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 and the 1955 Act to identify/detect illegal migrants and thereafter, follow the due process of law.

""The legal provisions regarding the National Register of Citizens i.e. Section 14A of the 1955 Act have been part of the said 1955 Act since December, 2004. It is submitted that said provisions consist merely of the procedure and the authority concerned for the preparation of a national register of citizens"", said the affidavit.

The Centre said the assertions of the petitioners, challenging the CAA and NRC, that the requirement for registration of citizenship has been delegated to the executive are erroneous as the National Register of Citizens does not create any embargo on any form of citizenship.

The affidavit said that the delegation has been only of the procedure to be adopted while conducting the said exercise. ""It is submitted that the provisions of the Section 14 A and the 2003 rules apply to all citizens of India without any discrimination and empower the Central government through the machinery of Registrar General of India to take further action in compliance of the legislative mandate"", said the Centre in the affidavit.

The Centre said the Multiparty Parliamentary Committee not only agreed with the need for compulsory registration of citizens of India and issuance of National Identity Cards to them, but left it to the executive to prescribe merely a procedure to implement the legislative mandate.

""It is submitted that after the recommendations of this Parliamentary Committee, Parliament passed The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in December, 2003 which was finally notified for commencement on 3rd December, 2004"", said the Centre.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/centre-to-sc--nrc-necessary-exercise-to-identify-citizens-2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/centre-to-sc--nrc-necessary-exercise-to-identify-citizens.html
248,17-3-20,Govt expands social distancing to curb corona,"Educational, social, cultural institutions closed as coronavirus cases rise to 114

From closure of abode of Gods like Siddhivinayak and Tuljabhavani temples and ASI-protected monuments and Central museums besides tourist hotspots Ajanta and Ellora Caves, sanctuaries and national parks to shutting down of malls, schools and colleges, both the States and the Centres have decided to expand the ambit of the social distancing in view of the threat from the rapidly spreading coronavirus (Covid-19).

The Union Health Ministry said four new coronavirus cases — one each from Odisha, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh and Kerala — have been reported, taking the total number of cases to 114. The ‘contact tracing activity’ of these positive cases has led to identification of more than 5,200 contacts, who are kept under surveillance, it added. These cases include 10 discharged, three cured and two reported deaths.

On his part, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said there has been a coordinated response to the coronavirus outbreak and asserted that “no stone is being left unturned” to ensure people are healthy. Modi also hailed the contribution of doctors, nurses and healthcare workers in fighting the virus and said the country will always cherish their contribution.

“The Group of Ministers has proposed several preventive steps such as social distancing to contain COVID-19 in the country and will be in force till March 31, 2020. The important measures include closure of all educational establishments (schools, universities, etc), gyms, museums, cultural and social centres, swimming pools and theatres. Students should be advised to stay at home while online education to be promoted,” Union Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal told reporters here on Monday after the Group of Ministers (GoM) meeting.

The GoM has also suggested people to avoid non-essential travel by buses, trains and aeroplanes to maximise social distancing in public transport besides ensuring regular and proper disinfection of surfaces.

The Government is encouraging private sector organisations/employers to allow their employees to work from home wherever feasible and hold interaction through video-conferencing.

Local authorities will have a dialogue with organisers of sporting events and competitions involving large gatherings and they may be advised to postpone such events, the Government has said.

The Government on Monday also prohibited entry of passengers from EU countries, Turkey and the UK from March 18 till March 31.

“No airline shall board a passenger from these nations to India with effect from 1200 GMT on March 18, 2020. The airline shall enforce this at the port of initial departure,” Agarwal said.

Both these instructions are temporary measures and shall be in force till March 31, 2020 and will be reviewed subsequently, he said. As precautionary measures, all ASI-protected monuments and Central museums across the country will be shut till March 31, Union Culture Minister Prahlad Patel said on Monday.

On their parts, the States are already taking various steps on social distancing. While Andaman and Nicobar banned travellers entry in the island from March 16 to March 26, rural Maharashtra announced closure of schools and colleges and world famous Ajanta and Ellora Caves as a precautionary measures. The Siddhivinayak Temple, one of the most visited shrines in Mumbai and Tuljabhavani Temple in Maharashtra will remain closed for devotees till further notice.

249,17-3-20,All gatherings of over 50 people banned in Delhi,"With coronavirus cases in India increasing fast, the Delhi Government has prohibited all the religious, cultural, social and political gatherings. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that no religious, cultural and political gathering with more than 50 people shall be allowed in the national Capital.

There is, however, no restriction on weddings but people are advised to postpone the dates, the CM said.

All auto-rickshaws and taxis will be disinfected for free to prevent the spread of the deadly disease, he said. Educating the masses about the scourge of deadly coronavirus, the AAP Government also announced that nightclubs, gyms and spas will remain closed till March 31.

Urging people to avoid large gatherings, Kejriwal also said that wedding programmes are excluded and has given instructions to all municipal corporation officials to set up mobile washbasins in public places on a large scale. Pertinently, seven cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Delhi so far.

Soon after his video-conferencing with all the stakeholders — three municipal corporations health officials — said his Government is taking all steps necessary to tackle the coronavirus crisis, and monitoring them at all times.

“Out of total seven corona cases to date, with the unfortunate demise of one of the patients, two patients have fully recovered and the remaining four are under treatment. The Delhi Government is taking all precautionary measures to quarantine those who have been affected. We have sufficient resources. More than 500 beds are ready to be installed,” said Kejriwal.

“We are also advising people who have come in contact with those infected to home quarantine themselves for a while. I want to appeal to all those people through the media that all those people who have been home quarantined should remain cautious in their approach of not contacting and meeting other people till everything is under control,” he added further.

Elaborating further about preparedness, Kejriwal said that each Sub Divisional Magistrate (SDM) will have to arrange for a specific number of mobile washbasins in their areas. Hand sanitisers will also be provided to all the staff and personnel working across all public places. “I want to appeal to the people to cooperate with the authorities. The Governments are doing whatever they can to contain the outbreak, but it is only with your cooperation that our efforts will be successful. Many countries have witnessed a major outbreak of the virus, which has fortunately not happened in our country. I will also request everyone to stop shaking hands with each other, ensure that you regularly wash your hands and sanitise them properly, and to not touch your face and eyes with hands.”

Interestingly Delhi is witnessing a sit-in protest in Shaheen Bagh, however, replying a query on this, CM Kejriwal said that the ban is applicable for everyone, be it protest or any gathering.

While majority of population travel in Metro and use autorickshaw for last mile connectivity, Delhi Government has said that all sort of public transportation will be disinfected for free to prevent force multiplier of deadly virus - Covid 19.

The Chief Minister said the Government has taken note of the grievances pertaining to hygiene from travellers from Spain and France put up in a quarantine facility in Dwarka. “People flying in from abroad mostly belong to the affluent class.

In some cases, the facilities may not be up to their expectations.

There are shortcomings also. So, we have made arrangements for them in certain hotels,” he said.

The Delhi Government has also made arrangements and increasing bed capacity and hospitalisation facilities. Lemon Tree, Red Fox, IBIS near airport will be used to quarantine the positive suspects after thermal screening at airport. The Delhi Government may initiate thermal screening in Delhi Metro as well, he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/all-gatherings-of-over-50-people-banned-in-delhi-2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/all-gatherings-of-over-50-people-banned-in-delhi.html
250,17-3-20,Have a good night,"A study finds that India is the fourth most sleep-deprived nation in the world. To keep several diseases and COVID-19 away, quality sleep is key, says ARCHANA JYOTI

A near-constant stream of news reports about Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is enough for anybody to feel anxious or distressed. Some might lose sleep or sleep less as well.

However, they should not. Health experts are of the opinion that it is not only important to follow basic precautions such as washing hands, maintaining good hygiene and social distancing, but one should also take proper sleep which will help further bolster defences against the deadly pathogens.

Incidentally, as one tries to make efforts to get good sleep what one should also simultaneously know about coronavirus — the disease that has reached pandemic proportions — is that one of the times we are most vulnerable to contracting it is during sleep.

Hence, in other words, while sleep is essential for our health and boosts natural, built-in defense system against harmful, disease-causing germs known as pathogens, it is also equally important to take steps to limit our exposure to the bug during sleep.

A study released on the World Sleep Day on March 13 this year found that people are not getting quality sleep as the collectively average hours of sleep have come down in most of the surveyed cities. The study was conducted in 10 cities across India including Bhubaneswar, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Kochi, Ahmedabad, Indore, Vishakhapatnam and Raipur.

In 2018, people slept 7.66 hours on weekends and 7.48 hours on weekdays which has come down to 6.85 hours on weekends and 6.76 hours on weekdays in 2019. It means, majority of the people are not able to sleep for the required 8 hours, as per the survey.

Looking at the gender-wise sleep duration, the findings are more worrying with the younger women (25-35 years) sleeping for 6.60 hours on weekends and 6.97 hours on weekdays in 2019 which was 7.70 hours and 7.43 hours respectively in the year 2018. Compared to them, the younger male slept for 6.73 hours on weekdays and 6.58 hours on weekends in 2019 as compared to 7.66 Hours on weekdays and 7.50 hours on weekdays in 2018, as per the survey “In Search of Better Sleep 2020” conducted by Centuary Mattresses and Wavemaker.

Uttam Malani, Executive Director of Centuary Mattresses, says that the data suggests that while people are waking up to the reality that sleep is fundamentally important, for most people, achieving quality sleep is still out of reach.

“Various factors are depriving the people of the quality and duration of their sleep. If we want to take sleep seriously and address the social and emotional aspects of poor sleep, we must begin to demonstrate that we can address these problems in both easy and meaningful ways,” says Malani.

Kamlesh Patel affectionately called as Daaji, the guide of Heartfulness, adds, “How well we sleep and how deeply we sleep determines our state of mind throughout the day. Disciplining our sleep cycle changes our life. Increasing number on sleep studies are all pointing to far reaching benefits of sleep on physical, mental, emotional and recently on spiritual wellbeing of a person.

“Adequate and appropriate sleep ensures alround development of an individual, and meditation is proving to be an enabler of sleep even for chronic conditions,” he said.

Patrick McNamara, an associate professor of Neurology at Boston University School of Medicine, says: “Getting enough sleep can help protect you against all kinds of common infections and viruses. Sleep strengthens your body’s capacity to fight off pathogens of all kinds. We need all the help we can get in fghting this coronavirus outbreak.”

However, Seattle-based Dr Bruce L Davidson, an expert in respiratory transmission of infections, cautions that as people are particularly vulnerable to getting the coronavirus while sleeping, it is important to follow certain do’s and don’ts to keep the COVID-19 at bay. “Around half of people are prone to aspiration — or breathing in foreign objects to the airways, which can allow the virus in.

“Coronavirus infects cells below the voice box, in the airways and deep in the lungs, unlike flu viruses which start with your nose and throat,” he wrote.

“Other than via tiny particles inhaled in air, coronavirus reaches those cells via fluid in the nose or throat that sneaks past your voice box (this is called aspiration) and slides down your windpipe, or trachea,” he said as per a report.

There are several steps that people can take to limit their exposure to the bug as they sleep. First, he advises to thoroughly wash your hands and face well with soap and warm water, including — on a finger — a quarter-inch into each nostril. “Then gently blow your nose.”

The doctor also suggested that people limit any sedatives, such as alcohol, before they sleep since it can increase aspiration. Also, people should make sure that any devices they use to sleep are clean.

“The key is to minimise the virus burden around and inside your face before you go to sleep. If you use a device at night for sleep apnea, make sure it remains away from where people could cough, sneeze and breathe on it, and clean it regularly,” he wrote.

Coronavirus, a respiratory illness that spreads through droplets launched when an infected person sneezes or coughs has infected over 152,000 people in at least 144 countries.

Foods to eat

Ginger and garlic: It is a powerful anti-viral and is a fantastic way to boost immune system

Star anise: This flower-shaped spice contains shikimic acid that is used as a base material for the production of Tamiflu, which is used for influenza virus.

Herbs like oregano, tulsi (Basil leaves), dried thyme, turmeric are are great for immunity.

Coconut oil: Lauric acid and caprylic acid present in it are essential for boosting immunity

Resveratrol: Foods like peanuts, pistachios, grapes, blueberries, cranberries, strawberries and even cocoa are helpful to fight fungal infection, ultraviolet radiation, stress and injury

251,17-3-20,Kids who do not sleep enough may face mental health issues,"Is your child getting enough sleep? If not, read this carefully. Researchers have found that children who get the least sleep have the greatest risk of developing mental health issues.

""If we make sure our children get enough sleep, it can help protect them from mental health problems,"" said study researcher Bror M Ranum, Norwegian University of Science and Technology's (NTNU) in the Norway.

A study of almost 800 children followed over several years shows that those who get the fewest hours of sleep are at greatest risk of developing psychiatric difficulties later, including ADHD, anxiety and depression.

""We're seeing an association between sleep duration and a risk of symptoms of emotional and behavioural disorders,"" Ranum added.

According to the findings, published in the journal JAMA Network Open, boys who sleep fewer hours have an increased risk of developing behavioural issues. Both girls and boys who get less sleep are at greater risk for future emotional problems. The measurements do not indicate anything about the quality of sleep.

Children's sleep was measured with motion sensors every night for a week. The researchers conducted clinical interviews to measure mental health difficulties. These procedures were repeated several times every two years.

The study is part of the Tidlig Trygg I Trondheim project (TtiT - Trondheim Early Secure Study). This is a long-term study that has examined nearly a thousand children when they were 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 years old.

The researchers also investigated whether psychological difficulties might cause children to sleep less. The data do not indicate this to be the case. Sleep duration influences the risk of later problems, not the opposite.

""Previous studies have also shown that sleep is related to mental health difficulties. But our study is one of the first to investigate this in children over several years, and to use an objective measurement of sleep,"" said senior author Silje Steinsbekk.

Because people tend to be quite poor at reporting how much sleep they get, scientists cannot completely rely on people's self-reported sleep duration data.

Self-reported sleep duration does not correlate with objective sleep duration measurements.

Laboratory studies measure sleep objectively, but this research study is measuring only the immediate effects and does not comment on whether sleep duration affects individuals' psychiatric health over time.

""Our study shows that the children who sleep fewer hours than others more often develop psychiatric symptoms, even two years later,"" Steinsbekk said.

The research group has also investigated how many people get too little sleep, and whether or not too little sleep tends to persist throughout childhood.

Very few six-year-olds (1.1 per cent) slept less than 7 hours, which is below the internationally recommended sleep guidelines for this age group.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Children with 3-4 years of age should have 10-13 hours of good quality sleep, which may include a nap, with regular sleep and wake-up times.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kids-who-do-not-sleep-enough-may-face-mental-health-issues-2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/kids-who-do-not-sleep-enough-may-face-mental-health-issues.html
252,17-3-20,3 of the boldest AI claims for the future,"AI is slowly infiltrating every industry - from healthcare to financial, however as an industry we still know relatively little about it. In this article we take a look at three of the boldest claims about the future of AI.

Sir Anthony Seldon, former headteacher and now vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham may seem like an unlikely choice for an article about artificial intelligence, however, in a recent interview with School’s Week he made the bold claim that he believed ‘AI will be replacing Ofsted Inspectors within a decade’.

Now, whilst education may not be the first industry that jumps to mind when thinking of how to utilise AI, it, in theory, makes a lot of sense. Schools are beginning to rely more and more on big data to help them adjust and AI helps them to do just that.

In letting computers take over, the emotional side of the equation is taken out of the picture, which allows for more accurate results. Furthermore, AI also adds an additional element of personalised learning. AI systems can be used to develop bespoke learning plans that are tailored to each child, contrasting to the more traditional standardised testing.

Beyond this, the use of AI in the classroom is also providing potential breakthroughs within the way we teach and understand language. In introducing a device like an Amazon Alexa or a Google Home it allows pupils to interact when they may have previously felt too self-conscious to do so in a formal teaching environment.

Tej Kohli, tech billionaire and international philanthropist similarly made waves when he claimed that he believed that ‘AI will be worth $150 trillion in 3-5 years’.

The claim came following an interview with Spears where he spoke about the benefits of investing in AI, and the overwhelming good that it can bring to the world. Kohli believes AI has the power to reduce poverty, and he is not alone in this statement.

AI allows for more reliable and accurate data about economic variables and it is this level of accuracy that has the power to reduce poverty.

In a recent experiment at Stanford University, Marshall Burke, an assistant professor in the Department of Earth Sciences collected both daytime and nighttime images from a variety of different African areas, to create and pinpoint ‘specific key performance indicators for a gap analysis’. He then continued to combine this information alongside the ‘geospatial data accumulated as input into an AI/ML system’ and from this information he was ‘able to predict regions of poverty within 81%-99% accuracy.’

One of the things that has been baffling scientists and doctors alike for some time is our understanding of the human brain, and by extension, our understanding of mental and behavioural well-being, however IsraelistartupTaliaz believes AI has the ability to help.

According to the World Health Organisation, depression is ‘the leading cause of disability worldwide and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease’ however Taliaz believes they have a solution. Insert PREDICTIX, an algorithm that when given multiple inputs, ‘can predict the efficacy (as well as any adverse effects) of current antidepressants with up to 80 per cent accuracy’, speeding up treatment times and saving hundreds of thousands of wasted pills. Beyond this, it also helps to significantly improve the quality of life for the aforementioned patients and completely changes our understanding of depression.

As our understanding of AI grows perhaps some of these bold claims will come into fruition, but for now, they do get the mind racing with the endless possibilities.",impact,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/3-of-the-boldest-ai-claims-for-the-future-2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/impact/3-of-the-boldest-ai-claims-for-the-future.html
253,17-3-20,A Bad Credit Score Shouldn’t Make You Fear Getting a Car Loan,"Your credit score reflects your current financial status. It also shows how responsible you were in handling your finances. It’s the reason why most banks and lending firms require you to confirm your credit score before approving your loan request. In most instances, a bad credit score ends in the rejection of the application.

Before you feel hopeless due to your current credit score, you need to understand that there's still a chance for you to obtain a loan despite your score. You can't be afraid to apply for a loan because of your credit score.

Some companies can still accept the application

Your credit score is one way to prove your financial capability, but it’s not the only way. There are other ways to show that you’re capable of paying the loan on time. If you can prove to the creditor that you’re responsible and trustworthy, you might get the loan you deserve.

There’s no harm in trying

Different companies require different requirements. If you wish to give it a shot with companies that aren't as strict as the others, it’s your call. You might be lucky enough to obtain a loan after trying with various creditors.

Loan rejection isn’t the end

You also fear the idea of applying for a loan because you might get rejected. Even if the possibility of rejection is high due to your credit score, it’s not the end. If you get rejected, you can determine what went wrong and try again. Even when you try your luck with the same creditor that rejected you, there’s a chance that you will finally make it. As long as you don’t repeat the same mistake, you could succeed on your next try.

You can improve your credit score

If you have a terrible credit score now, it doesn't mean it's the end. This figure could fluctuate over time. If you start to repay your loans, the number will go up. You can also improve it by fixing the issues you faced with your previous creditors. Don't hide from them in fear that you can't pay the loan. Running away from your responsibilities isn't going to help.

You can apply for high-risk loans

Some creditors specialize in high-risk borrowers. You're on this list if you have a terrible credit score. The interest rates are higher, and the charges for delayed payments are also high. The good thing is you have a chance to get the loan regardless of your credit score. You won’t get denied right away. It's a good thing if you're already desperate to obtain a loan. Besides, you understand the risks, and you're still willing to push for it.

You can even find no deposit car finance deals like the ones at www.carfinancegiant.co.uk. You don’t need to pay anything at first, but your monthly fees might be higher than usual. Again, if you want to own a car, these risks are worth it. As long as you promise yourself to pay the loan on time, everything will be fine.",impact,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-bad-credit-score-shouldn---t-make-you-fear-getting-a-car-loan-2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/impact/a-bad-credit-score-shouldn---t-make-you-fear-getting-a-car-loan.html
254,17-3-20,Coronavirus cases in Pakistan surges to 183,"Pakistan's coronavirus cases surged to 183 on Monday after dozens of new infection were reported in Sindh province.

Official said that Sindh had 150 positive cases, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 15, Balochistan 10, Gilgit-Baltistan 5, Islamabad 2 and Punjab 1.

Sindh government spokesperson Murtaza Wahab said that 119 patients were among the passengers who arrived in Sukkur from Taftan.

The “exponential increase is largely due to the recent inflow of people brought in from Taftan after a purported quarantine,"" said Wahab said.

The number of quarantined pilgrims in Taftan rose to 4,000 by March 11. Some of them were allowed to go their provinces after local Balochistan government said it could not handle the rush of pilgrims coming from Iran.

About around 300 people were taken to Sindh and quarantined at Sukkur to undergo tests before going to their homes.

Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah accused in a press conference that pilgrims were not properly isolated at Taftan and were kept together.

Meanwhile, government is taking steps to contain the pandemic as authorities in Punjab province converted all public sector universities' hostels into quarantine centres as an immediate arrangement.

Officials said that universities were informed in the province to clean all hostels and shift the belongings of students, if there were any, to store rooms after properly tagging them for identity.

The Prime Minister's Advisor on Health Dr Zafar Mirza said that all educational institutions have been closed and their staff stopped from attending the institutions.

The deadly virus, which originated in China's Wuhan city in December, has claimed over 7,000 lives and infected more than 170,000 people over 135 countries and territories.

China remains the hardest-hit with 80,860 infections and 3,213 deaths. After China, Italy and Iran are the two worst-affected countries.

Pakistan's high-powered National Security Committee on Friday took several decision to boost efforts to defeat the threat posed by the virus.

Among other things, it decided to close down the western border with Afghanistan and Iran.

The Norwegian actor, who played Tormund Giantsbane in HBO's epic fantasy series, took to Instagram on Monday to share his diagnosis.

Though in ""good health"", Hivju said, he and his family were in self-isolation.

""Greetings from Norway! Sorry to say that I, today, have tested positive for COVID19, Corona virus. My family and I are self-isolating at home for as long as it takes. We are in good health - I only have mild symptoms of a cold,"" he wrote.

The actor appealed to people to be ""extremely careful"".

""... Wash your hands, keep 1,5 meters distance from others, go in quarantine; just do everything you can to stop the virus from spreading. Together we can fight this virus and avert a crisis at our hospitals,"" he said.

Hivju, 41, also urged fans and followers to follow the regulations for ""staying safe and protecting not just yourselves, but our entire community, and especially those at risk like the elderly and people with pre-existing conditions"".

He joins actors Idris Elba, Tom Hanks and his wife, actor Rita Wilson and former Bond girl Olga Kurylenko, who tested positive for coronavirus. Universal Music chairman and CEO Lucian Grainge was hospitalised for treatment of the infection over the weekend.

256,17-3-20,"US, China accuse each other of coronavirus fear-mongering","The United States and China on Monday each demanded that the other stop smearing its reputation over the novel coronavirus as Donald Trump referred to the pathogen as the ""Chinese Virus.""

""The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus,"" the US president tweeted Monday night.

Trump's allies had previously referred to the pandemic as the ""Chinese coronavirus,"" but the tweet marks the first time the president said it himself.

Critics slammed the move, calling it racist and potentially inciting a backlash against the Asian-American community.

""Our Asian-American communities -- people YOU serve -- are already suffering. They don't need you fueling more bigotry,"" tweeted New York city mayor Bill de Blasio, whose state is one of the hardest-hit by the virus in the US.

The clash came on the day that the World Health Organization said more cases and deaths had been reported in the rest of the world than in China, where the new coronavirus virus was first detected late last year.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a phone call he initiated with top Chinese official Yang Jiechi, voiced anger that Beijing has used official channels ""to shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States,"" the State Department said.

Pompeo ""stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumors, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat,"" the department added.

The State Department on Friday summoned the Chinese ambassador, Cui Tiankai, to denounce Beijing's promotion of a conspiracy theory that had gained wide attention on social media.

Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, in tweets last week in both Mandarin and English, suggested that ""patient zero"" in the global pandemic may have come from the United States -- not the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan.

""It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation,"" tweeted Zhao, who is known for his provocative statements on social media.

Scientists suspect that the virus first came to humans at a meat market in Wuhan that butchered exotic animals.

Pompeo himself has sought to link China to the global pandemic, repeatedly referring to SARS-CoV-2 as the ""Wuhan virus"" despite advice from health professionals that such geographic labels can be stigmatizing.

Yang issued a ""stern warning to the United States that any scheme to smear China will be doomed to fail,"" the official Xinhua news agency said in its summary of the call with Pompeo.

The key Chinese foreign policy leader ""noted that some US politicians have frequently slandered China and its anti-epidemic efforts and stigmatized the country, which has enraged the Chinese people,"" Xinhua said.

""He urged the US side to immediately correct its wrongful behavior and stop making groundless accusations against China."" President Donald Trump is under fire over his handling of the pandemic, and his allies have sought to cast the coronavirus as a disease brought by foreigners.

Republican Senator Tom Cotton, a Trump ally, has spoken of the ""Chinese coronavirus"" and in a recent statement vowed, ""we will hold accountable those who inflicted it on the world."" While COVID-19 -- the disease caused by the virus -- has largely come under control in China, it has killed more than 7,000 people around the world and severely disrupted daily life in Western countries.

The pandemic comes at a time of wide-ranging tensions between the United States and China on issues from trade to human rights to Beijing's military buildup.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us--china-accuse-each-other-of-coronavirus-fear-mongering-2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/us--china-accuse-each-other-of-coronavirus-fear-mongering.html

258,17-3-20,Wear mask correctly,"Dr KK Agarwal is President CMAAO, HCFI at Former national President IMA New Delhi

The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases across India is now 110, as per the Health Ministry website. India also recorded its first death due to corona virus after a 76-year-old man passed away in Karnataka. He had tested positive for the virus.

Persons with lower respiratory tract infections are the source of infection of COVID-19. The virus spreads mainly through large droplets that are produced when an infected person sneezes or coughs. Hence, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended wearing a medical mask by a perosn with cough and fever as one of the prevention measures to limit spread of certain respiratory diseases, including 2019-nCoV, in affected areas in combination with other standard droplet precautions including regular handwashing and covering the nose and mouth while sneezing.

It is important to wear a mask correctly to protect oneself from the infection; knowing how to dispose of face masks properly is just as important or perhaps even more important as there is a risk of the infection spreading.

WHO advise

Before putting on a mask, clean hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.

Cover mouth and nose with mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.

Avoid touching the mask while using it.

Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it is damp and do not re-use single-use masks.

When removing the mask, remove it from behind (do not touch the front of mask).

Remove the mask from the face gently so as to not disturb liquid and solid contaminants on the mask. Put it in a plastic bag (use the type of plastic bag permitted) such as a grocery shopping bag or a zip lock bag and tie or seal it tightly.

Discard the bag straight away in a closed bin. Wash hands immediately with soap and water or clean hands with 60% alcohol-based hand rub for at least 20 seconds. Only then, put on a new mask.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/docyard---wear-mask-correctly-2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/docyard---wear-mask-correctly.html
259,17-3-20,Fight those imperfections,"A healthy and flawless skin is a dream of many. DR AJAY RANA tells you how aesthetic treatments can help achieve it

Aesthetic medicine is the medical process of modifying a body part of a person, either to enhance it or to decrease the risk of certain types of diseases including body fat, hair loss, skin patches and skin problems. It is a treatment that includes surgical practices from non-invasive treatments such as laser treatments to invasive procedures such as reconstructive surgeries. Nowadays many non-invasive aesthetic treatments are available through which one can enhance his beauty.

Some of the best aesthetic medicine treatments are as follows:

Chemical peels: Chemical peels are cosmetic treatments primarily performed on the face, typically used as an anti-ageing solution to rejuvenate the skin. These chemical peels are used to correct skin irregularities in texture, such as fine lines, and color, such as spots caused by sun damage. In this treatment, a chemical solution is applied on the skin, which makes it blister and after few minutes these chemical peel are taken off. After applying chemical peels, the new skin is usually smoother and less wrinkled than the old skin.

Laser skin resurfacing: It removes the outer layers of the skin that are damaged due to various conditions. This technique uses concentrated pulsating beams of light at irregular skin and remove skin layer by layer. Laser skin resurfacing treatment is also called lasabrasion, laser peel, or laser vaporisation.

Mesotherapy: The treatment uses brightening agents such as glutathione, tranesxemic acid, hydrating agents, vitamins and minerals and micropuncture techniques. In this treatment injections with very fine needles to deliver enzymes, hormones, and vitamins to skin to tighten is injected on the skin that need to be treated and rejuvenate it.

Oxygen facial: It’s a non-invasive, relaxing and painless skin care treatment. This treatment cleanses the damaged skin with oxygen and saline, exfoliates, boosts lymphatic drainage and provides extraction benefits. It’s considered a nonmedical procedure because nothing is injected into the body and no chemicals are used. Oxygen facial allow the pores to easily absorb hyaluronic acid and other powerhouse ingredients from serums.

Facial fillers: In this treatment injectable gels are used to smoothen wrinkles, iron out lines and folds and fill up scars and other depressions on the skin surface. It relax the muscle under a wrinkle, fill the line, crease, or area with one of several different substances. Wrinkle and facial fillers can also be used for plumping and lifting cheeks, chins, jawlines, and temples; filling out thin lips, and plumping sagging hands. They are safe and can help in forming the body’s natural moisturiser. On the other side permanent fillers are synthetic and last longer, but there is a rare possibility of infection or granuloma with them.

Microneedling: Microneedling is a process of skin resurfacing technology that uses the skin’s natural healing process to reduce skin imperfections, treat sun damage, and restore a smoother, clearer complexion. Microneedling does not remove any layers of skin with harmful chemicals or lasers and it is safe for all skin types.

Aesthetics treatments are some of the most effective ways of improving one’s appearance. These non- invasive treatments are used to give more natural and healthier look to the skin without causing any damage .

We face again horrors of the past…

Unless we gather ourselves acting timely and fast…

Corona the word, brings forth the crown…

Today when I utter, it invites a frown..

Or is it worse, I ponder , is it fear now?..

A new death dancer is indeed on its prowl…

No sneeze, no cough…

They’ve forgotten to laugh…

Towns are deserted...

Villages are skirted …

With maskmen galore, with gadgets advanced...

Hesitation and agony commanding a common man's stance...

It all was indeed a made in China tag...

Doesn’t give a free hand though to randomly bind and gag...

Bats or pigs.. pangolins or civets...

Or Is it the air, or water from the rivets?

How to contain this menace, is baffling to one and all...

The stocks meanwhile continue to fall..

WHO names it as COVID-19 ..

The crown as it were, is not losing its sheen...

While the nation of origin claims falling numbers...

Other parts of the world , continue to awaken from their slumber...

Simple measures to say the least …

Wash your hands before your feast..

Sneeze or cough you may but use your handkerchief

The 45-year-old man (name withheld), in an interaction with PTI over phone from his home in Mayur Vihar area of east Delhi, said, he had become ""more religious"" after his treatment, following which he was discharged last Saturday.

""I was living in a separate room, and it had an AC and all the good facilities, and windows to allow sunshine,"" he said. ""It wasn't like a 'kaal kothari' (dark chamber) as stereotyped in many movies.""

""And, doctors kept god care of me. I would appeal to all those who have symptoms to not stay at home, but visit doctors pronto,"" the businessman said.

He underscored that if people with suspected symptoms of COVID-19 stay at home, they would be harming their own family members.

The first coronavirus patient, who had arrived in Delhi from Italy on February 25, said he got fever at night the same day.

""On February 26 morning, I went to a local doctor and got some medicine,"" he said.

On February 28, on his 12-year-old son's birthday, the man said he had organised a small get-together at a luxury hotel in south Delhi.

""My wife, daughter (8) and my mother, along with few friends, were also present. All have tested negative for coronavirus, thankfully.

""My wife, two children, and mother along with the families of two of my friends, whose children are my son's classmates, were present,"" he said.

That night, he again got fever.

""I got a bit worried and went to RML Hospital after that tested positive there. Soon I was sent to Safdarjung Hospital isolation facility.

""I had access to my phone in the room, so I could connect to my family through video calling. I also read books and watched videos on Netflix, and so I wasn't feeling disconnected during the 14-day isolation at the hospital,"" he said.

Now, recuperating at his house where he had been asked by doctors to be home quarantined for 14 days, he said, ""Everyday, I and family, thank God, more now"".

""I used to listen to 'bhajans', perform 'paranayams' twice during the quarantine period at the hospital. I must say, I have become more religious than I was before,"" he said.

The doctors and nurses also kept me composed and at ""no point of time did I panic"".

The medical staff also maintained a high level of hygiene, cleaning rooms and all surfaces and changing linens twice a day. They performed ""excellent job"", he added.

He recalled that during the quarantine, he received a call from Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan to wish him on Holi.

""He (Vardhan) asked how I was feeling and whether I had any problems. It was totally unexpected as a Union minister of the country had called a common man to check on my well-being,"" he enthused.

The first COVID-19-positive patient in Delhi who has recovered from the infection was among the two patients who were discharged on Saturday.

So far, Delhi has seen seven positive cases, including a woman who died.

272,17-3-20,Coronavirus epicentre Wuhan reports one confirmed case; 13 new deaths in China,"The Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the novel coronavirus, reported just one confirmed case on Monday as the deadly COVID-19 gradually abated but 13 people died in the country taking the death toll so far to 3,226, Chinese health officials said on Tuesday.

Wuhan along with the entire Hubei province with over 50 million people was kept under total lockdown since January 23 banning all movement of transportation after the virus first emerged in December.

The Chinese city of Wuhan reported one new confirmed case of the COVID-19 and 12 deaths on Monday, the provincial health commission said on Tuesday. The latest report brought the total confirmed cases of the virus in the Hubei province to 67,799.

Among the 8,004 hospitalised patients, 2,243 were still in severe condition and another 539 in critical condition, it said.

As the virus began to abate in its worst affected areas, Wuhan and Hubei province, China on Monday announced plans for an orderly withdrawal of thousands of medical staff deployed there while a top medical expert said the coronavirus outbreak has ""almost seen its end"" in the country but a final judgement would be made after a month.

China's National Health Commission (NHC) said 21 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus infection and 13 deaths were reported on the Chinese mainland on Monday.

Of the deaths, 12 were in Hubei Province and one in Shaanxi Province, it said.

Meanwhile, 45 new suspected cases were reported, the commission said.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland have reached 80,881 by the end of Monday. This includes 3,226 people who died of the disease, 8,976 patients who were still being treated, 68,679 others discharged after recovery.

The commission said that 128 people were still suspected of being infected with the virus.

Meanwhile, 20 imported cases were reported on the mainland on Monday taking the total to 143. Beijing reported nine imported cases.

As of Monday, 157 confirmed cases, including four deaths, have been reported in Hong Kong, 11 confirmed cases in the Macao SAR, and 67 in Taiwan including one death.

The virus that first emerged in China's Wuhan city in the Hubei province in December last year has spread to 155 countries, infected 182,405 people and has claimed 7,154 lives, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus tracker.

A leading Chinese official group, headed by Premier Li Keqiang, suggested orderly withdrawal of the medical staff supporting virus-hit Hubei province for which Wuhan is the capital.

China deployed over 30,000 medical personnel, including staff from the military, and built 14 makeshift hospitals at the height of the coronavirus outbreak in January. The makeshift hospitals have been dismantled.

The leading group asked officials to ensure high-level treatment of severe COVID-19 patients in Wuhan while withdrawing the supporting medical teams, state-run China Daily reported.

Meanwhile, Cao Wei, Deputy Director and Associate Chief Physician of the Department of infectious diseases of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, said the deadly coronavirus which brought China to a grinding halt for about three months has ""almost seen its end"".

""Currently, after three months of the fight, the (virus) outbreak in China, which started in last December has almost seen its end,"" said Cao.

""We will still wait for another month to see and make the final judgement,"" Cao, who was in Wuhan directing mammoth medical operations to fight the disease, told an online media briefing.

She also said that no data has been found to indicate the relationship between the novel coronavirus and the weather.

""We all know WHO declared it as a pandemic a few days ago. It means the situation globally will not solely depend on China or any other single county,"" Cao told online media briefing from Wuhan adding that China would take a call on it in about a month.

Asked whether China apprehends a second wave of the virus, she said the relapse of the COVID-19 epidemic in China ""would not be a great concern under the current prevention and control measures.""

She said the number of newly reported cases of coronavirus in the country, including imported ones might stay at a relatively low level, but it would last for a certain period of time as the imported cases have become an important source of COVID-19.

Cao also said there is no evidence to show that the virus would abate with the onset of summer and the resultant rise in temperatures, ruling out the prevailing view that summer heat would subdue the virus. There is no data about COVID-19 relevance to the weather pattern.

""The impact of the weather on COVID-19 has not been confirmed yet,"" Cao said.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus-epicentre-wuhan-reports-one-confirmed-case--13-new-deaths-in-china-2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/coronavirus-epicentre-wuhan-reports-one-confirmed-case--13-new-deaths-in-china.html

275,17-3-20,SC to hear BJP plea today as MP defers floor test as ‘virus reprieve’,"Nath claims majority, rules out confidence motion even as Guv orders floor test today

The political drama surrounding the confidence test of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath on Monday reached the Supreme Court, which decided to hear on Tuesday the plea of the BJP to order floor test within 12 hours.

The BJP moved the SC after Speaker NP Prajapati ignored the direction of Governor Lalji Tandon to hold the floor test on Monday, and instead adjourned the House till March 26 in wake of the coronavirus epidemic.

Late on Monday, Nath met the Governor after the latter issued a fresh direction to the CM to hold floor test on Tuesday. The CM later claimed his Government enjoys majority, and ruled out holding a floor test in the Assembly as demanded by the BJP. Nath also dared the Opposition party to table a no-confidence motion against his 15-month-old Congress Government if they wanted to test its strength in the House.

Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Hemant Gupta will hear the BJP’s plea filed by former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. After parading the MLAs before the Governor, Chouhan told the media the State Government has lost majority and has no right to remain in power.

Earlier Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Govind Singh raised coronavirus threat to seek to defer the confidence motion. After finishing his customary address to the Assembly, Tandon left the House, asking the MLAs to “respect the House” and “follow the constitution”.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-to-hear-bjp-plea-today-as-mp-defers-floor-test-as----virus-reprieve----2020-03-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/sc-to-hear-bjp-plea-today-as-mp-defers-floor-test-as----virus-reprieve---.html

278,17-3-20,Sara Ali Khan's Varanasi temple visit creates controversy,"Bollywood actor Sara Ali Khan's much publicized visit to the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi, has drawn the ire of local pandits and saints.

The actor was in Mumbai for the shooting of 'Antrangi Re' when she visited the Kashi Vishwanath temple and participated in the 'Ganga aarti' on Sunday.

Her mother and actor Amrita Singh was with her.

The Kashi Vikas Samiti has now raised objections to the actor's visit on the grounds that Sara Ali Khan in a non-Hindu.

Chandra Shekhar Kapoor, the secretary of the Samiti, said, ""The actor's visit to the temple is against traditions and established norms. It also raises questions on the security of the temple when there is a sign board clearly stating that the entry of 'non-Hindus' is prohibited.""

He said that some priests had violated norms because they had probably got ""a handsome dakshina"" and free publicity.

Sara's visit was highly publicized because the actor herself uploaded a video on her social media account in which she gave her fans a tour of the 'Banaras ki gali' leading up to the temple and is seen showing the various shops along the lane.

The Kashi Vikas Samiti has now demanded a probe into the actor's visit and action against those responsible.

Local pandits and seers are also upset over Sara attending the 'Ganga aarti' and the Kashi Vishwanath temple.

""Though we appreciate her interest in the Hindu religion but the fact remains that she is a Muslim and should not have participated in the rituals. For her, all this could be 'interesting and exciting' but for us, it is a matter of religious piety,"" said Rakesh Mishra, a priest.

He further said that Sara would be known by the religion of her father, Saif Ali Khan, who is a Muslim.

Another priest Amarnath Bajpai, however, defended the actor and said that she was accompanied by her mother, Amrita Singh, who is a devout Hindu.

A local tour operator Siddhu Tiwari, meanwhile, said that it was the behavior of some 'close-minded people' who were raising objections on the issue.

""Any person, including Sara, can visit a temple if they believe in the deity. The 'Ganga aarti' is attended by thousands of foreigners who are non-Hindus too. People are only looking for publicity by making an issue out of this. In fact, we should be happy that Sara has given so much publicity to our temple and 'aarti',"" he said.

Sara Ali Khan has often been photographed visiting temples in Mumbai and then distributing alms to the poor.

281,17-3-20,Italy plans to re-nationalise Alitalia airlines: Govt,"The Italian government said it intends to re-nationalise the bankrupt former national carrier Alitalia under an emergency economic rescue plan for the coronavirus pandemic.

The plan's details were outlined in a government decree published late Monday.

Italian media reported that it could cost taxpayers up to 600 million euros (USD 670 million).

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's government on Monday agreed a 25-billion-euro rescue designed to shield families and businesses from the economic fallout of an outbreak that has killed more than 2,100 people in Italy.

One of the measures provides for the creation of ""a new company wholly controlled by the ministry of economy and finance, or controlled by a company with a majority public stake, including an indirect one"" to take over the airline.

Italy's AGI news agency said the government was setting up an 600-million-euro fund to deal with the damage the pandemic has caused to the aviation sector.

Some of the final details of the Italian economic rescue programme are do to be finalised next month.

Alitalia has floundered in the face of fierce competition from low-cost carriers such as EasyJet and Ryanair.

But analyst warn that it is also too small -- and has too many staff for the number of flights it operates -- to compete with its rivals.

It flew only 22 million passengers and saw its market share in Italy slip to 14 per cent in 2018.

Germany's Lufthansa and the Atlanta-based Delta Airlines each carried around 180 million passengers that year.

Alitalia's attempts to secure rescues from either the Italian state railway Ferrovie dello Stato or Lufthansa floundered in January.

282,17-3-20,Curfews as US shuts down to fight coronavirus,"The United States has began restricting citizens' movements in a major escalation of attempts to contain the deadly coronavirus pandemic, as President Donald Trump warned the crisis could last well into the summer.

New Jersey state and San Francisco announced curfews and Trump asked Americans on Monday to restrict gatherings to groups of fewer than 10 as the US dramatically ramped up efforts to stop the spread of the fast-moving outbreak.

Trump acknowledged for the first time that the US economy ""may be"" heading into a recession because of the pandemic that has killed more than 7,000 people worldwide as Wall Street stocks had their worst day since 1987, plunging almost 13 percent.

As America followed European nations in shutting down schools, public buildings, cinemas, restaurants and bars, Trump suggested the crisis would last several months at least in the United States.

""So it seems to me that if we do a really good job... People are talking about July, August, something like that,"" Trump told reporters at the White House.

""So it could be right in that period of time where it, I say, it washes through.""

His comments came after Canada announced it was closing its borders to most foreign travelers and New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said he was restricting movement across the state, which borders New York City.

""Effective tonight, all other non-essential retail, recreational, and entertainment businesses MUST CLOSE after 8:00 PM,"" said Murphy.

""All non-essential and non-emergency travel in New Jersey is strongly discouraged between the hours of 8:00 PM and 5:00 AM This will remain in effect for the foreseeable future. We want everyone to be home -- and not out,"" he added.

Later, San Francisco passed a ""remain-in-place"" order requiring millions of residents to stay at home unless absolutely essential.

Before the twin announcements, only the US territory of Puerto Rico had imposed a curfew, from 9pm to 5am -- along with the closure of malls, movie theatres, gyms and bars.

The White House denied reports that Trump was considering a nationwide lockdown but the president said he might ask the military to help build temporary hospitals.

He added that postponing elections over the coronavirus crisis was ""unnecessary,"" even as Ohio's governor called for the state's presidential primary vote scheduled for Tuesday to be delayed.

Normally bustling streets, transport networks and roads were eerily quiet across US cities Monday as employees worked from home and children contemplated weeks with no classes to attend.

New York -- the city that usually never sleeps -- began hunkering down for an extended period of inactivity with all nightclubs, theaters, cinemas and concert venues ordered to close from Tuesday.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said late Sunday that the Big Apple's normally hectic bars and restaurants would be restricted to take-out and delivery only.

He also bowed to pressure and announced the closure of New York's schools, which educate 1.1 million students, until April 20.

Los Angeles is also closing bars, restaurants and nightclubs for at least two weeks, while California's Governor Gavin Newsom asked people over the age of 65 to self-isolate.

The governor of Illinois, which includes the city of Chicago, announced that bars and restaurants would close until March 30.
