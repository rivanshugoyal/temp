0,07-1-20,Trump trumped?,"While US troops will remain on tenterhooks globally, Trump has provided ammunition to his Democratic opponents for a very interesting election campaign at home

2020 is an election year in the USA. President Donald Trump is trying for a second term. The American public will definitely review his performance before giving him a second chance. As far as foreign policy is concerned, Trump’s record has been a mixed bag. While many term it as a “term of controversies,” the cornerstone of the Trump Administration’s foreign policy has been “principled realism” or more popular “America First.” After all, what else is the purpose of any country’s foreign policy except to put its own interests first? Trump’s foreign policy vision smacked of sabre rattling rather than reconciliation. He was not only distrustful of US allies, scornful of international institutions and indifferent to the liberal international order that the US had sustained for nearly eight decades but also displayed inconsistency by blowing hot and cold on many occasions.

Trump is bound to tout his record on foreign policy as a resounding success. While he hasn’t built a wall and expensed it to Mexico, he has followed through on pledges to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement and the Paris climate accord, to renegotiate NAFTA and to aggressively press China on trade. He has delivered on many of his campaign promises, whether the rest of the US supports them or not. In doing so he has earned the title of “international bully,” annoying many allies and friendly nations, undermining international institutions, dishonouring treaties and accords and creating flashpoints. Conventional wisdom says that foreign policy does not win polls. But Trump seems to be faced with a challenge that may break this.

The majoritarian view in the US still favours engagement and shared leadership in global affairs, as well as US participation in alliances and pacts, while Trump continues to move in the opposite direction. As per a survey, 57 per cent Americans disapprove his foreign policy performance. The latest episode in the Middle East will definitely add to his woes and the democratic hopefuls will exploit these vulnerabilities during campaigning. This time, foreign policy might be a major theme for the election and just might tip the balance.

The tension in the Middle East has been building for quite some time and Trump did display restraint. Iran, no doubt, was testing Trump’s patience by repeated misadventures like the shooting down of a US surveillance drone, mining the Strait of Hormuz and an assault on Saudi oil facilities in response to sanctions. Trump all the while avoided retaliating militarily, preferring to tighten the noose with additional sanctions. The brain behind Iran’s defiance was the commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, Major General Qasem Soleimani.

Soleimani had been in the bad books of the US ever since he emerged as the mastermind of Iranian use of proxies to target US and Western assets and servicemen, promoting terrorism and conducting destabilising activities in countries hostile to Iran. He was credited with conducting proxy wars in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. He controlled much of Lebanon through the Hezbollah. He was also the mastermind behind the survival of the Assad regime in Syria. The Americans hated him for being responsible for the deaths of hundreds of soldiers in Iraq at the hands of Shia militias after US invasion of Iraq in 2003. Though, later he cooperated with the US in fighting the ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

But once Trump called off the nuclear treaty with Iran and imposed sanctions, he once again became a sworn enemy of the US. He crossed the red line by attacking an US military base in Iraq that resulted in the death of a US contractor and injured several servicemen. That Trump would not tolerate any loss to American lives was clear by the way he ordered air strikes against five targets in Iraq and Syria associated with Iran-backed Shia militia Kataib Hezbollah that was believed to be responsible for the attack on the US base near Kirkuk. Justifiably, the Pentagon termed these strikes as “defensive” since they were in retaliation to attacks on US servicemen and civilians in Iraq. But Trump surprised the world by using US military power to kill Soleimani through a rocket attack. Pentagon once again termed it as “defensive” since Trump was convinced that Soleimani was visiting Iraq to intensify attacks against US bases in Iraq. The US strike also killed a top Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al Muhandis, an adviser to Soleimani and a dozen of militia men, evoking a quick and angry response from both Iran and Iraq. While Ayatollah Khamenei of Iran, to whom Soleimani reported directly, vowed revenge, the Iraqi Prime Minister termed it as a violation of a deal for keeping US troops in his country.

Is it really a defensive act or a provocative one? Has Trump overreacted? The chances of an all-out war may not be very high but it would lead to escalation in the low-level conflict between the US and Iran with global consequences. Violent retaliations will be there. Considering that the Americans are thin on the ground and widely dispersed in foreign lands, a chain of reprisals is going to hit them unless the US is willing to escalate to a full blown war. This may prove costly as far as American casualties are concerned. Under such circumstances, would Trump be able to sustain his doctrine of military retaliation whenever an American life is lost, is a million dollar question. That, too, in an election year. Additional deployment of 3,000 troops in Kuwait to ward off the Iranian threat and failure to reduce the jackboot strength in Afghanistan may also prove costly for Trump. What is surprising is why Trump decided to strike now when he is also facing an impeachment? Trump was possibly irked by ransacking of the US Embassy 104 acre Green Zone compound in Baghdad. Yet, killing the Iranian General on Iraqi soil will remain a questionable strategic decision. Continuation of American troops in Iraq will come under pressure in view of the response of the Iraqi Prime Minister.

Apart from usual attack on US military commanders and soldiers or launching operations to destroy its bases and assets, Iran may also resort to cyber-attacks considering the over dependence of Americans on the internet. In a worst case scenario, Iran may try to enlist Chinese and Russian support and combined with their cyber forces launch a propaganda cum perception operation against Trump, which may mar his campaign. Americans should prepare for the unexpected. There has been fair amount of criticism from the Democratic opponents of the President.

The situation in the Middle East will be highly tense, with Israel and Saudi Arabia at the receiving end. Shia terror groups in Pakistan may also become active against US targets as well as troops in Afghanistan. Soaring oil prices and tumbling share markets will be the immediate global consequences. Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden has termed it “a highly escalatory move in a highly dangerous region.” The possibility of it turning into a Shia versus Sunni conflict may disturb peace in many countries in the region.

Former Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao has criticised Trump’s decision, “US military personnel are in Iraq supposedly on an anti-IS mission. Under the Trump administration, there appears to have been mission creep, in Iraq as well as Syria, in which somehow confronting Iran has become part of a new mission. That mission has never been justified.”

India cannot remain unaffected by the events in the Middle East since it remains one of the largest oil importers of the world. Soaring oil prices apart from hitting the pockets of the common man are also going to add to India’s economic woes when it is struggling to revive a sluggish economy. Tensions in the region may also affect the smooth oil supply. Strategically, it would have an adverse impact on India’s bid to develop Chabahar Port and develop an alternative rail, road axis to Afghanistan bypassing Pakistan and the open trade route to landlocked Central Asian Republics.

Majority across the globe term it as an “unnecessary provocation.” Surprisingly, a usually hyper Trump has chosen to remain quiet. He will be in a dilemma since he ran his campaign and continues to do so ahead of 2020 election- on the promise of an end to Middle East wars. Does he have that choice now?

While US troops will remain on tenterhooks, Trump has provided enough ammunition to his Democratic opponents for a very interesting election campaign at home. While the target will not be questioned, timing will definitely be the contentious issue.

1,07-1-20,GST data has brought cheer,"While supply side issues on the fiscal front are getting resolved, the ongoing social unrest is going to dampen economic prospects

The new year came with the release of Goods and Services Tax (GST) figures for December 2019 which showed a nine per cent increase compared to the previous year. This was the second consecutive month where GST collections crossed the `1 trillion mark. GST collections are an important indicator of consumption in the economy and a high indirect tax mop-up means that somehow the discretionary consumption must be back.

This is important, as throughout the year we’ve seen adequate slack in the economy which has dampened investment activity and further stressed balance sheets of companies, banks and other financial institutions. For the third quarter (Q3) of the Financial Year (FY), GST mop-up was only three per cent compared to the previous year. While this figure may not be great, during a slowdown even tax buoyancy gets hit and that’s perhaps why GST growth hasn’t kept pace.

However, with a nine per cent GST collection growth in December, one sees positive offshoots even as fresh vulnerabilities have emerged in the banking space. The underlying fact is that the Indian economy indeed bottomed out in September and this got extended till October, post which the economy seems to be in a recovery mode. This suggests that a V-shaped recovery won’t be possible and the pace of improvement is also slow but this restoration will come without much support from the monetary policy as prime real lending rates continue to be high.

While supply side issues on the economic front are getting resolved and the Government is undertaking steps to get things back on track, the recent protests are damaging India’s perception. We cannot disrupt temples of learning with the objective of subversion of democracy, even if through violence. The problem with such an attempt is that it has unintended consequences — and some of them are economic.

India, which is an attractive investment destination after the recent corporate tax cuts, is now being watched by international investors very closely. These protests are likely to adversely impact their investment decisions. This comes at a time when India is just recovering from the recent slowdown, which is not a good sign as it may hinder the pace of recovery.

The Chief Ministers of today would do well to take a page out of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s conduct when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat during the UPA regime. In 2011, when the economic slump started, Modi undertook a series of State-level policy interventions to attract investments in Gujarat. Consequently, Gujarat managed to be insulated from that economic slump and contributed to India’s economy while most other States seemed to be stuck with slower growth.

Another such State was Madhya Pradesh, which registered an impressive growth rate, primarily in the agricultural sector for many years. The question that often emerges is, if we have any such leaders at the State-level who can play a big role in economic recovery by ensuring a higher growth for their States?

We see the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister squash previous contracts and the Maharashtra Chief Minister review critical infrastructure projects. Both these actions have severe implications for enforcement of contracts, the credibility of Government contracts and long-term ability to attract investments. Moreover, they will not improve growth rates in the short term.

State Governments aren’t even doing the bare minimum to ensure they can maintain their growth rates, forget about accelerating them. The problem of growth is as much political as it is an economic one. The lack of incentives, especially at the State-level, perhaps shifts the focus to other issues.

Another factor is the lack of economic literacy which prevents issues related to growth from becoming a major part of electoral campaigns. An exception to this is the issue of inflation and jobs — both of which are election issues and intricately related to growth rates. Lack of scrutiny of States on these issues in public discourse is perhaps a reason why necessary State-level policy reforms don’t happen as often as they should.

The GST data is indeed suggesting that despite these agitations, the economy seems to be getting back on track. Perhaps, once the economy starts growing at the rate of seven to eight per cent, many of people’s anxieties would be taken care of. But it is important to recognise that this revival of growth rate would have occurred without monetary support and the necessary State-level reforms. It is time the States did some introspection on their role in the economy and nation-building as they are also answerable to the people who put them in charge of their destinies.

2,07-1-20,Night of broken glass,"Students are not enemies of the State and help create balance in a democracy. The muzzling of JNU is not acceptable

Nelson Mandela’s words certainly couldn’t have been more apt following the brutal attack on students and teachers at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) by a mob out to muzzle dissenting voices — “There can be no keener revelation of a society’s soul than the way in which it treats its children.” Here, we have made them traitors to the cause, an enemy of the State. Just for speaking out their mind. Yes, we have become soulless. Yes, democracy is a paper town. Yes, education is anti-thought and is meant to bloom only a certain kind of political ideology. Yes, we are eroding our own tradition of the gurukul as an enabling environment and free space for learning and wisdom. Where teachers were more than mentors, they were parental figures, like the JNU professors who tried to form a protective ring around their students but were beaten up nevertheless. In the Indic tradition, such centres of learning were deliberately located far away from the seat of power, where princes, too, were stripped off their glory, lest the trappings of privilege clouded their understanding of life as it was meant to be. It was a safe and equal space for everybody. As a parental generation, we have scarred our youth and are the actual killers of their free spirit. No words would be enough for the condemnation of the violence at JNU. But the message it sends out is frightening to say the least. Though both the Left and Right wings have fiercely debated their viewpoints over the years and hotly contested each other, never have they descended into chaos. Since when have ideological differences assumed battleship positions? Aren’t we hypocritical in teaching our young to question the status quo, encouraging them to think out of the box, be our moral counterpoint and then keep them under our thumbs? These are fundamental questions that we must ask ourselves than taking positions based on political convenience. Unmask the thugs, whoever they are.

Politically, this is nothing but a manifestation of State terror. How else can one explain the passive behaviour of the policemen, clearly tools of the State and executors of law and order? Even if the V-C didn’t clear their entry, could they have not stopped the mayhem to preserve the rule of law? Not only were they silent witnesses to the rampage, most accounts corroborate that they allowed the miscreants inside. Could anybody be blamed for not assuming that they were under orders? Of course, both the Left and Right students’ outfits were caught in a war of accusations and counter-accusations in social media videos and accounts as to who got in the marauders. But then, even going by circumstantial evidence, the Left controls the students’ union, is best placed to fight for students’ rights on its terms and would not need to shed blood of its chief. The Left ideology survives in dots in campuses and has virtually been eroded in the mainstream political space. Sponsoring a headline-making moment at JNU frankly would not be a drumroll for its return and doesn’t stand to logic. Yet the nature of crackdowns on students in top liberal institutions, particularly those that are renowned internationally — be it a JNU, IIT or Jamia — and intimidation of protesting students elsewhere do imply a grander design of Right-wing hegemony over a nation’s thought factories. And, therefore, lends much credence to the theory that this is very much manipulated and orchestrated rather than a clash of various students’ groups. This isn’t about a fee hike or the Citizen Amendment Act (CAA). It is about the democratic pact to agree to disagree and co-exist despite those differences. It isn’t about the politics of otherisation at all but of the right of the other to be heard. It isn’t about majoritarianism, which will never be under threat, but a fear and insecurity of losing it that looks at destruction by force rather than consolidation by winning faith. Finally, public university campuses need to be a free space for debate, discussion and learning for students coming in from all corners of the country, diverse backgrounds, religion and class. They will shape and take forward the democracy of the future. That is why the unprecedented attack on the JNU campus is unacceptable, simply because we are telling students what to do, not encouraging them to find their way. Whether this crackdown will indeed end up scaring a generation, tire them out with the futility of the goal or embolden them further remains to be seen. But it is important that protests be peaceful and sustained. JNU students will continue with democratic debate and dialogue while students in Mumbai are going to “occupy Gateway of India” non-stop. And for those shouting “Bharat Mata Ki Jai,” they shouldn’t have devalued something that stirs us emotionally by assaulting women in their hostel in the dark of the night.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/night-of-broken-glass-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/night-of-broken-glass.html
3,07-1-20,Iran is not playing a tit-for-tat game,"In just one careless stroke by the US, Iran has had two big diplomatic wins thanks to Soleimani’s assassination. The Iranians will probably just chug along as before, cultivating their allies in the Arab world and waiting for Trump to make his next mistake in their favour

If the Iranians played the game the same way that the American President Donald Trump does, then their revenge for the American assassination of Iran’s leading general, Qassem Soleimani, would be a simple tit-for-tat. Just kill United States (US) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the man who actually organised the hit and then boasted about it.

If Pompeo was too hard to get at, the Iranians could get even by murdering any one or two of a hundred other senior US officials. Probably two, because the US drone that hit Soleimani’s car coming out of Baghdad airport also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the leader of Kata’ib Hezbollah, the most powerful pro-Iranian militia in Iraq.

An eye for an eye, and so forth. Tit-for-tat is clearly the game Trump thought he was playing. That’s why he warned late on Saturday on Twitter that the US has identified 52 Iranian sites, some “at a very high level and important to Iran and the Iranian culture”, and warned they would be “hit very fast and hard” if Tehran retaliates for Soleimani’s murder.

But that’s not the game the Iranians are playing at all. It’s a much longer game than tit-for-tat, and their targets are political, not personal.

Tehran’s first response has been to announce that it will no longer respect any of the limits placed on its nuclear programmes by the 2015 nuclear treaty, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).

Donald Trump pulled the US out of that treaty in 2018 and Iran has given up hope that the other signatories to the pact, i.e. China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and Germany, would defy the US and go on trading with Iran.

It signed the deal in order to end the sanctions but all the sanctions are effectively still in place.

Tehran didn’t say that it is now going to start working on nuclear weapons but it will resume producing enriched nuclear fuels in quantities that would make that possible.

Iran knew that it was going to have to pull the plug on the JCPOA eventually but Trump’s assassination of Soleimani lets it do so with the open or unspoken sympathy of almost every other country in the world.

And there’s a second, less visible benefit for Iran from Soleimani’s murder. It greatly strengthens Iran’s political influence in Iraq, which has been deteriorating quite fast in recent months.

Ever since the US invasion in 2003, Iraq has been the scene of intense competition for influence between the US, which dominated the country militarily and Iran, whose State religion, the Shia version of Islam, is also the faith of the majority of Iraqis.

There are still about 5,000 American troops in Iraq but they are now vastly outnumbered by local pro-Iran Shia militias, who did the heavy lifting during the 2014-17 military campaign to crush Islamic State (IS) militants in northern Iraq. Lately, however, the pro-Iran faction has been losing ground.

When popular protests broke out in September against the huge corruption of Iraqi politicians and the impoverishment of the general population, the pro-Iran militias started killing the protesters. That was General Soleimani’s idea and a very serious mistake on his part: The street protests began to target Iranian influence as well.

But Soleimani’s murder has largely erased that resentment: He is now yet another Shia martyr to the cause. The Prime Minister of Iraq showed up at his huge funeral procession in Baghdad and an extraordinary session of the Iraqi Parliament passed a resolution demanding the expulsion of US troops from Iraq.

The Iraqi political elite may or may not carry through on that policy but there is genuine outrage that the US, technically an ally, would make an air strike just outside Baghdad airport without telling Iraq. All the worse when it kills an invited guest of the Iraqi Government who is the second most important person in Iraq’s other main ally, Iran. This is what contempt looks like and it rankles.

In just one careless stroke by the US, Iran has had two big diplomatic wins thanks to Soleimani’s assassination. The Iranians will certainly go on making deniable, pin-prick attacks on US assets and allies in the Gulf in retaliation for the US sanctions that are strangling the country’s economy but they may feel that they have already had their revenge for Soleimani.

Iran doesn’t want an all-out war with the US. The US could not win that war (unless it just nuked the whole country) but neither could Iran and it would suffer huge damage if there were a flat-out American bombing campaign using only conventional bombs and warheads.

Apocalyptic outcomes to this confrontation are possible, but they’re not very likely.

The Iranians will probably just chug along as before, staying within the letter of the law most of the time, cultivating their allies in the Arab world and waiting for Trump to make his next mistake in their favour. He’s reliable in that, if in nothing else.

4,07-1-20,Chilling to the bone,"A recent study shows how elevated levels of PM 2.5 emitted by cars lead to osteoporosis

Who would have thought that the car you drive would be your worst enemy? A recent study by Jama Network Open has found an intriguing link between long-term exposure to toxic particles emitted by vehicles and osteoporosis, a condition where one’s bones become weaker. What is worrying for most Delhiites is that this study was conducted in and around Hyderabad, which has a far lower vehicular density compared to the Capital. The offensive particles, mostly PM 2.5 and black carbon, lead to the degeneration of bone mass in the spine and hips. At the time of writing, the PM 2.5 level in Delhi was in the severe range of 154. At this rate, we may have an entire generation with bone problems and fitness challenges.

Though this may not be a first of its kind finding — already in 2017, a Lancet Planetary Health study had established the link between exposure to air pollution and osteoporosis-related loss of bone mineral density and risk of bone fractures — it does establish a potential health threat. With around 200 million people affected by osteoporosis worldwide, an estimated 50 million of them are Indians. With a rapidly ageing population, its prevalence will only increase. By this year, the country is estimated to record six lakh hip fractures. Numbers are expected to jump to a million by 2050. The news, though alarming, is unlikely to bring change right away simply because earlier studies on pollution threats to our health have not translated into corrective policies. Our battle against ambient air pollution is not new but even after years of planning and execution, it has got caught in politics of shifting blames rather than being implemented in mission mode. Indians anyway rank poorly in terms of maintaining their levels of Vitamin D and calcium, which are the most basic nutrients for bone health. These are required in our growing years when maximum mass formation happens. But what do you do when children are born with a deficiency? Another report had earlier pointed out how pregnant women are more likely to give birth to underweight children when they are exposed to air pollution, which is proven to affect neuro development in children and weaken them enough to develop chronic diseases and cardio-vascular conditions later on in life. Do we compromise the health of a generation or really rethink the way we use vehicles?",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/chilling-to-the-bone-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/chilling-to-the-bone.html
5,07-1-20,Two AAP leaders protesting against JNU violence held,"Two leaders of Aam Aadmi Party’s UP unit were arrested for protesting against Jawaharlal Nehru university (JNU) violence from GPO in Hazratganj on Monday.

After the arrest of Vanshraj Dubey (AAP students’ wing state chief) and Tushar Srivastava (AAP students wing state secretary), scores of leaders and workers of the party thronged into the Hazratganj police station and demanded their release.

Later, AAP state spokesman Mahendra Singh said that Chief Minister Adityanath Yogi was gagging all voices of dissent.

He said that the party leaders and workers were protesting in a peaceful way at GPO but the police and district administration stopped them, citing prohibitory orders in the area.

“Our leaders (Dubey and Srivastava) opposed this and burnt the effigy of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and they were arrested by the police,” he said.

Singh said that the arrest of AAP leaders was unconstitutional as everyone had the right to express their opinion through protest or other means in a peaceful way.

“The UP government got our leaders arrested in a wrong way and we will intensify the agitation,” he said.

Earlier, AAP leader Engineer Kazi Imran Latif said that Bharatiya Janata Party workers assisted by the police were attacking those protesting peacefully to paint those protesting against Citizenship (Amendment) Act as villains.

Meanwhile, AAP leader Neelam Yadav said that the BJP had failed on all fronts and was taking divisive measures to divert public attention so that no one questioned their failures.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/two-aap-leaders--protesting-against--jnu-violence-held.html
6,07-1-20,BJP engineered JNU violence: Akhilesh,"Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of engineering violence on the Jawaharlal Nehru University campus, alleging that it was a “state-sponsored pre-planned conspiracy” and the police role in the incident was suspicious.

“Masked men attacking teachers and students in JNU indicates the low to which the government will stoop in order to rule by fear. The BJP is using violence and hate to polarise society and stifle dissent. The ABVP (Akhil Bharatiya Vidhyarthi Parishad) activists are acting like storm troopers of the BJP,” Akhilesh said at a press conference in Lucknow on Monday.

“The entire country and the world saw how masked attackers entered the JNU campus in Delhi and wreaked havoc in a planned manner. Fair probe is needed to know the prime conspirator behind the violence,” the SP chief said, indicating the BJP’s role behind this incident.

Akhilesh said the role of Delhi Police personnel was also under question as it appeared that they were waiting for instructions from the top while the goons of the ABVP unleashed a reign of terror in the girls’ hostels of the JNU.

“Police were in cahoots with criminals who beat up the students,” he said.

The SP chief said that the BJP conspired to attack the students of other ideology to force its communal agenda. “The BJP is trying to close down JNU where poor students are charged minimum fees and given facilities,” he alleged.

Akhilesh further said that the sangh parivar students’ wing, ABVP, had organised similar violence against students of the Banaras Hindu University who were participating in a demonstration organised by Samajwadi Chhatra Sabha in Varanasi.

The SP chief also showed a video of JNU violence and the incident in Varanasi, where the police supported ABVP activists in a college to disturb students’ union election process.

Reiterating his party’s stand on Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens, Akhilesh said, “Everyone knows who will benefit from such violence and now the BJP is saying things to cover up illegal acts.”

“Riots after anti-CAA protests were triggered in UP to save the chair of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and divert public attention from real issues,” he said.

The SP chief also claimed that over 1,000 children had died at Baba Raghav Das Medical College hospital in Gorakhpur between January and October, 2019, but the officials were covering up the toll due to pressure from the top.

“We demand a probe by a sitting judge of the High Court into the deaths of children besides investigation by an expert team of doctors,” the SP chief said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-engineered-jnu--violence--akhilesh.html
7,07-1-20,Spiralling into incoherence,"Pakistan’s Islamic revolution is eating its own children. It needs to be reversed by an Ataturk-type of powerful leader but the Army has been thoroughly radicalized

The paroxysms of religious intolerance increasingly engulfing Pakistan and sections of its civil society, not to mention the frenzied anti-India exhortations of its favourite militant outfits, are inexorably pushing the nation towards political incoherence and religious apoplexy, from which return to sanity seems unlikely.

Two recent events best exemplify this trend. One is the attack on Nankana Sahib Gurdwara (January 3) led by the brother of Mohammad Hassan, the boy who allegedly abducted Jagjit Kaur, daughter of a senior gurdwara official, from her home in August 2019 and forcibly converted and married her. Reports suggest that ahead of the court hearing on January 9, police entered the Hassan family home and arrested some members. Enraged, Hassan’s brother collected a crowd, surrounded the gurdwara, pelted stones on pilgrims and threatened to convert all shrines into mosques. As authorities moved to control the situation, he issued an apology on video.

In India, the incident embarrassed political parties opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and forced them to condemn it. The ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) protested near the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi, which was placed under tight security.

The second and more serious incident concerns Pakistan’s treatment of its own citizens. Junaid Hafeez, a teacher in the literature department of Bahauddin Zakariya University, has been languishing in solitary confinement since March 2013, after an Islamist group claimed he had made blasphemous remarks during a lecture.

A gold medallist, Junaid was studying medicine at Lahore’s prestigious King Edward Medical College when the poet in him surfaced; he moved to Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, to study English literature. In 2009, he went to study American literature at the Jackson State University, the US, on a Fulbright scholarship and returned to teach at his alma mater. Here, in the university’s growing Islamic environment, he pushed for secular debate around different topics. Though eminently qualified for a permanent faculty position, the Islamist student group on the campus, the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, wanted the post to Islamise the department. Suddenly, blasphemy charges prevented him from getting the job.

One accusation was that Junaid shared blasphemous content on a Facebook account, which has never been linked to him. Nevertheless, Junaid, then just 27-years-old, was jailed and his career ruined. When lawyer Rashed Rahman was assassinated (2014), advocate Asad Jamal courageously took the brief, despite several death threats. On December 21, 2019, Junaid Hafeez was sentenced to death for “outraging religious sentiments” (under Section 295-C of the Pakistan Penal Code that was introduced in 1986 by Zia ul-Haq). His parents have appealed to Chief Justice Asif Saeed Khosa, pointing out many problems — from refusal to hear the case, constant transfer of judges and delay tactics by the prosecution — to deny justice to the young teacher. Many journalists and writers have supported them.

Within Pakistan, critics question the very need for this law, pointing out that it inhibits reforms in Islam and sanctions death for words, cartoons and other forms of free thought. They point out that critique of a religion does not mean violence against that faith or deny the rights of its adherents. Instead, the blasphemy laws undermine basic human rights.

Asiya Bibi, a poor Christian woman, received the death penalty in 2010 for alleged blasphemy, and Punjab Governor Salman Taseer was assassinated for supporting her and trying to take up cudgels against the well-known abuse of this law. Taseer said the Pakistan of Mohammad Ali Jinnah did not have such a law and such a cruel punishment. Claiming that Islam provided for the protection of minorities, he promised to take her appeal to the President, for pardon. As the case became an international cause célèbre, the Supreme Court of Pakistan acquitted her in October 2018, citing insufficient evidence. However, as frenzied mobs came on the streets chanting that they would not let her leave Pakistan, it was only in May 2019 that she was discreetly flown to Canada, where her family had already been given asylum.

It is an open secret that Pakistan’s blasphemy law is a weapon to harass individuals or groups for personal or petty agenda or to persecute religious minorities for vicarious majoritarian satisfaction. Invariably, the accused are unable to defend themselves and have to suffer painful imprisonment before receiving capital punishment, though the Supreme Court has often overruled judgments of the lower courts for having poor evidentiary value. At times, however, the apex court has upheld the sentence, leaving the luckless accused with no recourse but to beg for pardon from the President. Along the way, intrepid lawyers have lost their lives, fighting for justice, dignity and human rights.

Vigilantism, as seen at Nankana Sahib, has become the new confession in Pakistan. Rabble-rousers reminiscent of the Dominican monk, Girolamo Savonarola, but without his piety and learning, exhort intolerance of secular dissenters and minorities as a national creed. Mini-tyrants populate every village and city street, sniffing out potential victims. Former President Zia- ul-Haq’s tweaking of the British-made blasphemy law (that India junked because Hindu dharma has no canon and, therefore, no law, and Pakistan retained because it was a religion of the Book) has rained hell on its poor victims.

As of now, there is no one who can put the genie back in the bottle. Many lament that Jinnah’s plea for a secular nation, made on August 11, 1947, before Pakistan was officially born, was not honoured by the elite of the new country. Some say the speech was optics at the behest of Lord Ismay to stem the communal frenzy and bloodbath. Others say that the communal passions unleashed by Jinnah to achieve Pakistan had assumed a momentum of their own and could not be controlled.

Secular thinkers in Pakistan assert that there is no blasphemy law in the Quran or in any Hadith or in the writings of the dominant Hanafi school. Blasphemy is a man-made device to control dissidence or torment innocents, who may have earned one’s ire for some petty reason or other. In Asiya Bibi’s case, it was drinking water from a pot reserved for Muslims.

Pakistan’s Islamic revolution, like all revolutions, is eating its own children. It needs to be reversed by an Ataturk-type of powerful leader but the Army has been thoroughly radicalised. Islam has become Pakistan’s cul-de-sac; the way in is the only way out.

8,07-1-20,High alert in UP after JNU violence,"After a night of unprecedented violence on the Jawaharlal Nehru University campus in the national capital, Uttar Pradesh was put on a high alert.

Protests have already been witnessed across the state over the killing of top Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad and the attack on Nankana Saheb Gurdwara in Pakistan. Besides, resentment over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act is yet to die down completely.

Top UP Police brass directed the district police chiefs to be alert and closely monitor activities on campuses of educational institutions across the state.

Most universities and educational institutions, barring Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) which has been closed of indefinite period, were scheduled to open on Monday.

The AMU has particularly been in the eye of storm as it witnessed protests against police action on students of Jamia Millia Islamia university in Delhi last month.

Student-related trouble was also continuing in Allahabad University where the Vice-Chancellor, Prof Ratan Lal Hangloo, was forced to resign four days ago. The proctor and public relations officer of the university also resigned.

A top police official said on Monday, “It has become a very dangerous cauldron of community politics. In almost every district we are facing discontent over multiple issues. The resentment over the CAA is continuing. Shia Muslims are restive over the killing of the Iranian military commander and Sikhs are piqued at the attack on Nankana Saheb Gurudwara in Pakistan. Students are also upset over recent action against anti-CAA protesters. The situation is, undoubtedly, volatile at present.”

Meanwhile, Director General of Police OP Singh said, “We are stepping up vigilance and have asked all district police chiefs to remain on high alert in view of the prevailing situation.”

On Sunday night, several masked individuals, male and female, thrashed students, including girls, and teachers on the JNU campus with wooden and metal rods, injuring many.

While the number of the injured in the various clashes which occurred through the day was not yet known, at least 20 students were admitted to the AIIMS with severe injuries, including JNU Students Union chief Aishe Ghosh, who was reportedly hit on the head with an iron rod.

A report from Aligarh said that AMU students took out a peaceful candlelight march on Sunday night to protest the JNU violence and demanded that the masked miscreants who vandalised property and attacked students be arrested. The march was held inside the AMU premises and ended at Bab-e-Syed gate.

The AMU Teachers’ Association (AMUTA), too, released a statement urging Chief Justice of India Sharad Arvind Bobde to take suo motu cognisance of the “unprecedented situation” arising from Sunday’s assault on JNU students and teachers.

Aligarh’s Senior Superintendent of Police Akash Kulhari said that police have been deployed at sensitive points all around the AMU campus as a precautionary measure.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/high-alert-in-up--after-jnu-violence.html

The Mahasangha alleged that the BSE conducted the test in a wrong manner and published faulty results, harassing lakhs of teachers and putting them in difficulties.

While the BSE is not able to conduct the test in regular manner, the latest OTET was conducted on January 16, 2019 after a gap of two years. But, the test was cancelled all of a sudden citing question paper leak. Later it was conducted from August 5 to 18 online.

11,07-1-20,‘Little done to modernise police response mechanism’,"Cool, calm, composed with suave manners, Prakash Mishra is widely perceived as a granite rock material amid the higher echelons of the country’s police administration. After obtaining a gold medal from the Utkal University for securing top rank among the successful candidates in Applied Economics, he pursued Law in the same university and came out with flying colours securing the top position in LLB examinations as well. He opened his innings to the IPS cadre in 1977. Climbing the hierarchical ladder, he became Director General of Police in Odisha and subsequently held important positions in the Government of India. He handled many sensitive cases in the CBI including the cases of Jammu and Kashmir. He served as Special DG of National Investigating Agency; Director General of NDRF; Special Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs; and Director General, Central Reserve Police, India's largest paramilitary organisation. After his superannuation, he was appointed as Director General, Fire Services & Civil Defence in Government of India. Finally, he was appointed as Advisor to Governor, Uttarakhand when the State was under President's Rule. Currently, he is a front-ranking Bharatiya Janata Party leader. He was the BJP candidate for the Cuttack Lok Sabha constituency in the 2019 elections. He is widely known for his uprightness and unimpeachable integrity. His monumental contribution rests in his pioneering works for curbing Maoist activities in Odisha. In an interview to The Pioneer, Mishra spoke to Sugyan Choudhury from his ancestral residence at BJB Nagar, Bhubaneswar.

What is your considered opinion regarding modernisation of police force in Odisha?

Modernisation is an ongoing process. Odisha Police has rather done well in modernising its capacity to counter Leftwing extremist-related problems. However, if you talk of civil police that affects the general population, it has a long way to go. Very little has been done to modernise the police response mechanism. The force has not only to increase its strength in police stations but also increase its capacity to be more mobile. Availability and use of scientific aids are at an abysmally-low level. Nothing has been done to develop backroom expertise in dealing with financial crime, cyber crime, surveillance and in many other fields.

What is your rating of the Odisha Police in comparison to and in contrast with other States’ police departments?

As I said earlier, in facing the challenge of Leftwing extremism, Odisha Police has done remarkably well. However, in general policing, many States have gone ahead. ‘Dial 100’ of UP, which has been adopted by States like Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and a few more, has given new dimensions to police response. Forensic capabilities of many States are far more advanced. Many States have increased manpower at the police station level whereas the police stations in Odisha have very little manpower.

In past, a former DGP described Bhubaneswar as the crime capital of India. What’s your response to this observation?

I do not know who gave this statement and in what context. However, Bhubaneswar certainly has many policing issues. One is lack of manpower. Being the State capital and with concentration of VIPs, with mega events, Assembly sessions, the priority of the police is more on these than on crime prevention and detection. But to describe Bhubaneswar as the crime capital of India is a bit harsh and statistically wrong.

It is alleged by general public that FIRs are not registered in most cases by police. What could be the reason and the remedial measures for this?

This is a problem all over the country. Overdependence on statistics to showcase our achievements in crime control could be one of the major contributing factors for this. It needs a political will and commitment from senior officers to put an end to this. We could also enforce a strong community policing system which can deal with this issue.

There is a widespread feeling among intellectuals of our State that you have been prevented from the coveted position of CBI Director. How far is it true?

Well, if you look at the events which unfolded close to the selection of the Director, CBI in 2014, it can only be concluded that they were done with a purpose. First, it was some nonspecific (State) Vigilance enquiry to prevent me from going to Delhi. Having failed in that, they hurriedly registered a concocted case. All this proves that there was desperation to ensure that I did not land up in that position.

What are your suggestions for ushering in an era of camaraderie among Press, police and general public?

All problems arise when there is a perception that police is partisan. Wherever police works independently and takes its decisions based on facts, it gets the support of the people and the Press. Sadly, police have deviated a lot from the past. They have become so partisan that they have to face resentment from people and also Press. My only advice to them is to be fair and transparent in their actions. Other things will follow.

Could you please narrate a memorable experience of your career in the police administration?

There have been so many interesting incidents during my long career. However, one thing which really stood out is the turnaround we achieved in our fight against Leftwing extremism. The young SPs of the affected districts started leading from the front and achieved spectacular results. In one of the meetings held at Delhi which I was attending as DGP, Odisha, the Union Home Minister announced that Odisha is the best-performing State and commended me. Earlier, the model State was always Andhra Pradesh. In this meeting, all States were asked to emulate the Andhra-Odisha model.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---little-done-to-modernise-police-response-mechanism---.html
12,07-1-20,BJP holds pro-CAA rally in Cuttack,"Members of all communities, including Muslims, joined a rally here on Monday supporting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The rally was organised by the BJP to make people aware about the new law aimed at giving citizenship to the prosecuted minorities from the Islamic countries of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

Joining the rally, Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan accused the opposition Congress and Left parties of misleading a section of Muslim people. “Indian Muslims are not going to be affected by the CAA and no one is going to deport them from this country,” he said.

A Muslim in the rally pointed out that the new law is only to give citizenship to those minorities who have left the neighbouring Muslim countries and are staying in India for decades.

Many BJP leaders, including former DGP Prakash Mishra, Sameer Dey, Dillip Mallick and Nayan Mohanty participated in the rally, which culminated at the Kali Mandir at Khannagar.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-holds-pro-caa-rally-in-cuttack.html

15,07-1-20,Odishi veteran Minati Mishra passes away,"Eminent Odishi dancer and Padma Shri awardee Minati Mishra passed away in Switzerland on Monday, family sources said. She was 91.

Chief Minister Naveen Patnik took to Tweeter and expressed his deep condolence for the bereaved family members. He said Minati’s lifetime devotion and contribution to the classical dance form is unforgettable.

17,07-1-20,Search on for next UP DGP,"With present Director General of Police OP Singh set to retire by January-end, a search for a suitable candidate to succeed him has been started by the government.

It is now to be seen whether the government opts for an officer top on seniority list or selects an officer of their choice, ignoring seniority.

OP Singh, an IPS officer of 1983 batch, is set to complete his two-year tenure on January 23, days before his retirement on January 31 and is likely to be appointed as the new Chief Information Commissioner in February.

IPS officers from 1984 to 1988 batches are in the race for the top post of UP Police.

Director General of Bureau of Police Research and Development, AP Maheshwari, a 1984 batch IPS officer who will retire in February 2021, and his batchmate S Javeed Ahmed who retires in March 2020, are the two most senior officers but their chances to be posted to the DGP post are dim.

Maheshwari is on Central deputation while Ahmed has already been DGP during the Samajwadi Party regime.

DG Vigilance and 1985 batch officer Dr Hitesh Chandra Awasthi will retire in June 2021 while his batchmate and DG, RPF, Arun Kumar are the next contenders. Both have served in the CBI for a long period.

Officers of 1986 batch, Jawaharlal Tripathi and Mahendra Modi would also retire this year while their batchmate Javed Akhtar and Naseer Kamal are on Central deputation and hence out of the race for the top UPP post.

Sujanveer Singh, also of 1986 batch, is presently posted as DG Training and is due to retire in September 2021 but he is not in the race.

The two other contenders of the top post are 1988 batch IPS officers Anand Kumar, posted as DG (Jails) and also holding additional charge of DG (Home Guards) and DG, Police Recruitment and Promotional Board, RK Vishwakarma.

Both these officers have been ADG (Law and Order) for considerable time but Kumar has an edge as he is known to be a trusted officer of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.

Another officer who is also in the race is 1987 batch IPS officer Rajendra Pal Singh, presently posted as DG, Economic Offence Wing, and is holding charge of DG, Special Investigation Team. Singh has a long tenure and will retire in February, 2023.

It may be mentioned that OP Singh along with DG, Intelligence, Bhawesh Kumar Singh and DG, Special Enquiry, Mahendra Modi will retire from service this month while DG, Human Rights, DL Ratnam will retire next month. Similarly, DG, CB CID, Virendra Kumar, and S Javeed Ahmed will retire in March this year.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/search-on-for--next-up-dgp.html
18,07-1-20,Anti-CAA protests BSP demands judicial probe into violence,"A two-member delegation of Bahujan Samaj Party called on Governor Anandiben Patel on Monday and demanded a judicial probe into the violence during anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests, compensation to families of those killed in the protests and release of innocent from the jails.

The BSP delegation comprising party general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra and Munkad Ali, reached Raj Bhawan in the morning and had a 30-minute meeting with the Governor.

Later, speaking to media persons outside Raj Bhawan, Mishra said that they submitted a memorandum to the Governor and put forward their demands

The BSP memorandum also demanded that along with the release of innocents jailed for the violence during anti-CAA protests, the government should also order withdrawal of cases against them.

“Those who were behind the violence must be punished but why should innocents be put behind bars,” Mishra said.

The BSP leader suggested that the families of those killed in the anti-CAA protests be given ex gratia payment of Rs 25-50 lakh as compensation. He said the Governor assured them to take up the matter with the UP government.

On the occasion, Mishra also condemned the violence in JNU on Sunday and demanded stern action against the guilty.

“The BSP never supports any type of violence and the police should identify the people behind the JNU violence,” he said.

Earlier on Sunday, BSP chief Mayawati had accused Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and his government of putting anti-CAA protesters behind the bars without thorough investigation and demanded financial assistance to those killed in protests.

“In UP, especially in Bijnor, Sambhal, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Firozabad and other districts, innocents have been sent to jail for protesting against the CAA/NRC without a probe. The issue was also raised by the media and is condemnable,” the BSP chief said in a tweet.

Meanwhile, both Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress demanded a judicial probe into the JNU violence, a day after masked assailants attacked students and professors on the university campus in Delhi.

‘’The attack on students and teachers of JNU is deplorable. The Centre should take the matter seriously and order a judicial probe into the incident,” BSP chief Mayawati posted on twitter.

Staging a protest against the JNU incident at the GPO Park, Congress city chief Mukesh Chauhan condemned the BJP government for failing to maintain peace in educational institutions.

He charged that the BJP governments, both at the Centre and in UP, were using violence and hatred to polarise society and stifle dissent.

He claimed that various wings of BJP, including Akhil Bharatiya Vidhyarthi Parishad (ABVP), were acting like storm troopers of the BJP.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/anti-caa-protests--bsp-demands-judicial--probe-into-violence.html
19,07-1-20,"JNU violence unfortunate, says Irani","Union minister and Lok Sabha member from Amethi, Smriti Irani, said on Monday that it was unfortunate that violence erupted on Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus in Delhi, adding that a centre of learning should not be made a battle ground of politics.

“Politics should not be done in JNU as it affects the students directly. I am sure that if politics ends in JNU, it would benefit the students there,” Irani said during her day-long visit to her parliamentary constituency, Amethi.

The Bharatiya Janata Party leader said that what happened on the JNU campus was unfortunate. “There are people, backed by opposition parties, who try to create disturbance. Such elements will be identified and punished,” she said.

“I am a firm believer that educational institutions should not be made ‘rajniti ka akhada’ (political battlefield) and students should not be used as political pawns. This affects the studies and also tarnishes the image of the educational institution,” Irani said.

At least 28 people were injured when masked men, armed with sticks and rods, attacked students and faculty members on the JNU campus on Sunday night. The anger against the attack soon spread to universities in Uttar Pradesh, forcing the state administration to issue a high alert.

When asked about the numerous death of infants within a month at a state-run hospital in Kota, Irani said that there could be some lapses on the part of the Rajasthan government.

“The state government and the medical officers in Rajasthan are not sincere towards their duties and hence such incidents are happening. Now Congress leaders of Rajasthan too are admitting that there were some lapses on their part due to which such large number of children died,” the BJP MP said, referring to the statement of Rajasthan’s Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot.

27,07-1-20,Anganwadi workers threaten self-immolation,"The protest of Anganwadi workers is still going on strong in Dehradun more than a month after it was started. However, with the authorities not taking cognisance of their demands, they are planning to go on a fast unto death soon and even resort to self immolation.

On Monday, a large number of Anganwadi workers were present at the protest site adjoining the Parade Ground rooting for their demands that include a rise in salary, provident fund, pension after retirement, travel allowance and health insurance. While talking to The Pioneer, State president of Anganwadi workers union, Rekha Negi said, “Anganwadi workers have been there for about 35 years. The work has increased significantly, and the department has expanded too but all these years, there has been no improvement in the working conditions of Anganwadi workers. We work hard in schools, hospitals and villages, even in the remote areas but still, we are not acknowledged and treated well by the Government.”

Regarding their future plan of action she said, “If the Government continues to ignore our demands, we will undertake a fast unto death. Many of us are also ready to commit self immolation because we have nowhere else to go. We have no other choice except resorting to such measures.” “We will not budge from our demands. Our demands are genuine and fair.

We are not asking thousands or lakhs of rupees per month from the government, we just want a hike in our allowance that every woman working in this field day and night deserves,” said an Anganwadi worker Deepa Chauhan.

Another Anganwadi worker Kavita Gusain alleged, “The police and some political figures are trying to intimidate us. They are also telling us that we might lose our jobs too, but that does not bother us. Today we are fighting not just for our rights but also for the young women who will join this field in the future.” In the meantime, many Anganwadi workers think that the Government is not responding to them not because their demands are unfair but due to the fact that the protesters are just women.

According to one of the protesters Swati Negi, “We have spent three nights doing protest leaving our kids and families alone. We are not abusing or harassing anyone, or damaging any public properties. All we are doing is protesting for our rights peacefully. It is all because we are responsible citizens and not because we are weak or inferior to anyone.""",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/anganwadi-workers-threaten-self-immolation.html

37,07-1-20,"Student politics losing direction, affects college life, opine youth","Following the recent violence that occurred in Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, many college students in Dehradun feel that student politics has lost direction. Talking to The Pioneer, they shared their views on student politics and how it affects their college life.

“It is my last year in college but I am yet to see a significant change because of student union leaders. I have seen classes getting cancelled at the last moment due to rallies, or fights but never saw anything good coming out of it,” said Preeti Pokhriyal, an under-graduate student.

According to Neha Tiwari, a science student from DAV PG College, “I never realise the existence of student politics when it comes to bring positive changes in students’ lives. We come to know about student politics mostly when there is some political dispute between rivals on the campus or outside, which in turn results in our classes being cancelled.

I don’t remember any student union which has done something positive or even worthy enough to mention or discuss.” Abhishek Chandra, a second year B Com student said, “Whatever happened in JNU is appalling but the rallies or protest against it is just political and not due to any concern for students or teachers who were injured.

It’s all about who can make more noise and show off their existence to the people around them.” In addition to the students, their parents too are not too happy with student politics.

Harsh Chauhan said, “I drop my daughter to college every morning around 9 AM from Vikasnagar. There’s been hardly a month when there was no day off due to student politics. Sometimes such things go on for weeks and we don’t understand whether we should send our children to college or not. It’s a waste of time, energy and education. I don’t understand what good is served by such nonsense politics.” Most of the students think that student politics have lost its direction and is not really necessary.

However, some of them have different views about student politics. According to the youth, independent student leaders who do not owe allegiance to any political party do tend to work efficiently.

Since they do not have the pressure to gain political relevance, they are likely to perform better than others without making any fuss, opined the youth.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/student-politics-losing-direction--affects-college-life--opine-youth.html

45,07-1-20,Sad that Tagore legacy at Puri to be razed to ground,"The decision of the Puri Municipality to demolish the ancestral house of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore on Chakratirtha Road at Puri has evoked sharp reactions. The ‘Patherpuri House’, which was built by the Nobel Laureate, is an iconic building, more than 100 years old, and an invaluable heritage structure. The place was home to the famous poet who used to love Puri and where he had composed some of his famous literary works, including his magnum opus ‘Gitanjali’. A bust of the bard is installed at the far end of the building. A large number of documents and articles penned by Tagore are still preserved at the building. Some of these documents have been lost due to decay and lack of proper maintenance, but a few invaluable artifacts still remain.

A portion of the building was being used as a hostel for students of an adjoining college. However, the asbestos roof of the building was blown away during Cyclone ‘Fani’ a few months ago, and since then it has taken the look of an abandoned structure. Puri Sub-Collector Bharat Charan Sahu has said the building is in ruins and there is no other option but to demolish it. It is not known if the district administration has given a thought to restore the building keeping its heritage value in mind. Most likely, the State Public Works Department has declared the building unsafe as is their wont without examining the possibility of proper conservation and restoration.

According to Amiya Bhusan Tripathy, former DGP of Odisha, who is the present convener of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage’s (INTACH) Odisha unit, certifying a building unsafe is a routine thing for the PWD. The department lacks qualified persons who can do proper restoration and conservation works. He has written to the administration to stop the plans for razing down the building and, instead, take measures for its proper restoration and conservation. He has given an assurance that the INTACH could take up the project and ensure that the structure gets a new lease of life.

Anil Dhir, heritage expert and historian, says the Odisha PWD had declared many buildings unsafe; and through the efforts of the INTACH, they were repaired with proper conservation techniques and stand proudly today. The Kanika Library and Assembly Hall at the iconic Ravenshaw University, the Cuttack Circuit House, and the old Board of Revenue building too were at some time declared as unsafe, but they were all restored. In fact, in Cuttack, the very same PWD which had declared the structures unsafe did the restoration under proper guidance.

The Jobra Workshop was worked upon by the INTACH and a grand Maritime Museum stands in place today. In Puri too, the house of Janaki Nath Bose, father of Netaji Subhash Bose was given to the INTACH in 2015 and the building stands in one piece after proper conservation. In Sambalpur, the house of Assamese poet laureate Laxminath Bezbaruah, which was marked for demolition, is currently in the process of conservation by the INTACH. The Rani Bhakri and the Old Town Hall of Sambalpur which were in ruins are also in the final stages of restoration.

Vice-Principal of the Puri SCS Junior College Sankarshan Dash said they had been intimated by the civic body regarding demolition of the Tagore house. “Since the building is synonymous with the legendary poet, we have requested the PWD through a letter to construct a building which can be made into a ‘Tagore Museum’ to preserve the documents and artifacts. Priyadarshan Pattanayak, convener of Shree Jagannath Sena, said the administration should never sacrifice this heritage building.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad-that-tagore-legacy-at-puri-to-be-razed-to-ground.html

48,07-1-20,State to improve 36 dams with WB support,"Odisha is all set to undertake a massive improvement of 36 dam projects at a cost of nearly Rs 1,000 crore with World Bank support.

Under the New Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP) Phases II and III, Odisha will be implementing this huge dam improvement project, thanks to the support of the Union Government.

While the Department of Water Resources (DoWR) has taken up various milestones in this regard, more is needed to be done as per stipulations of the World Bank.

Odisha implemented DRIP Phase I and rehabilitated 26 dams out of which 6 major, 14 medium and 6 are minor dams.

The major dams included Balimela, Hirakud, Rengali, ,Salandi, Upper Kolab and Satiguda. Now, under the DRIP Phase II and III, the Union Government has proposed to rehabilitate and improve at least 700 dams at a cost of Rs 10,221 crore, said sources.

With Upendra Prasad Singh at the helm of Ministry of Water Resources, as Secretary MoWR, Odisha is getting a lion’s share from DRIP, said sources.

While Odisha, which has 163 large dams is taking up all sorts of preparatory arrangements, the Union Government has advised Odisha to take up the required criteria needed for clearance of the projects.

Singh is in constant touch with the senior officials of the Odisha Government in Department of Water Resources (DoWR).

A Loan Negotiation Meeting is likely to be held in February and all the other States are getting ready for the meeting. So Odisha, which is likely to take up DRIP Phase II at a cost of Rs 495 crore is needed to invite tenders and complete the technical and financial evaluation of the civil works before the loan negotiation meeting.

A World Bank team has already visited the State. While expressing satisfaction with the progress, it also advised to fulfil some of the criteria in this regard. With Odisha having experience to handle DRIP projects, both Union Government and World Bank are more interested to support the State by way of more funding.

The Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance will convene the Loan Negotiation Meet in February 2020, where Odisha Team is expected to take part in the deliberations.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-to-improve-36-dams-with-wb-support.html

The NINL, a 1.1 million ton integrated steel plant, is a joint venture of the MMTC Ltd and the Odisha Government through the IPICOL and the OMC Ltd. While the MMTC has a stake of 49.9%, the OMC and the IPICOL together own 26% stake and other Central PSUs like NMDC has 13.2% share and the BHEL Ltd and MECON have 10.9% stake.

Recently, the MMTC has decided to divest its share in NINL and indicated to SEBI to this effect. Further, the MMTC has stopped infusion of working capital in NINL, resulting in blow down of the blast furnace since June 2019.

Since June, employees have been highlighting the issue at various platforms, but in vain. Though the Union Government, NMDC and the State Government decided in September 2019 for infusion of RS 800 crores for running of NINL, nothing tangible has been seen yet. The NINL financial crisis has resulted in non-payment of salary and wages to employees and lay-off of contractual workmen. Earlier, the SAIL and the MMTC had proposed to get merger of NINL at different points of times. But the MMTC stalled the proposals by giving one or other pleas.

Mancha leaders Ranjan Nayak, Mahiram Purty and Bijay Mohaprana demanded immediate infusion of working capital in the NINL for commencing production and payment of wages and salary to employees and workmen.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/working-capital-infusion-in-ninl-demanded.html
50,07-1-20,"Roads rough, industries shut, projects not taking off","Year 2019 remained painful for the people of Sundargarh district. Haphazard and unsystematic construction work of sewerage system, human trafficking, torture on migrant labourers, unemployment and worst roads took away smiles from the faces of public.

Construction work of sewerage system had been going on at different places of Rourkela, but the unprofessional way contractor L & T had been doing it had put the residents and common people in utter difficulties. The officials of the L&T and Sewerage Board at Rourkela hardly bothered to address the woes.

There was very slow progress in work for Rourkela Smart City project during the year 2019. Out of Rs 376 crore sanctioned for the work for the Smart City, only Rs 22.23 crore was reportedly spent by the RSCL for the work.

Human trafficking had been a cause of concern for the tribals- dominated Sundargarh district. Many innocent girls, women and men were lured and trafficked to outside the State where they were engaged as domestic helps or as daily wagers. They were tortured at workplaces and were also not paid for work. Even a poor orphan youth of Balishankara block, who had gone to work as a bonded labour at Mangalore in Karnataka, died during November 2019, after drowning in sea there. The body of the poor youth could not be brought to his native place in Sundargarh and was cremated there.

Unemployment remained a major issue for people of the district. The industrial scenario went through the worst phase. A number of industries were closed and employees of the sick industries were running from pillar to post to get their dues. Employees of Adhunik Metaliks Ltd, a closed unit, staged protest a number of times to get justice but their plight had not been addressed and similarly employees of RIT, Kalunga had also staged protest for getting their salary. Employees of other sick industries went through similar fate. These employees and their family members were struggling for their survival.

Similarly, human-elephant conflict continued during the year 2019 in the district. The cultivated paddy fields and vegetables were destroyed by jumbos.

The much-awaited air connection through Rourkela city under the Udan scheme although was expected to start during the year 2019 but is yet to see the light of day.

In Bonei sub division, road conditions of different places were still very bad and people had to suffer a lot due to this worst road condition. The road condition of Rajamunda to Koira Rengalbeda, Rourkela Jorbandh to Bhimgarh ghati (Bonei end) and Tensa to Koira were absolutely horrible and the condition of these roads did not improve during 2019.

The construction work of the much-awaited second bridge over the Brahmani river at Rourkela commenced and the authorities were hopeful that the six-lane bridge and the four-lane road would be completed by March 2021.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/roads-rough--industries-shut--projects-not-taking-off.html

55,07-1-20,SAD forms committee to finalise seat sharing,"Gearing up for the high-octane Delhi assembly elections, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Monday constituted a three-member committee to take care of various aspects for the February 8 polls.

The announcement to set up the panel came hours after the Election Commission of India announced the poll dates.

SAD president Sukhbir Badal formed the three members high level committee, comprising of MPs Balwinder Singh Bhundur, Prof Prem Singh Chandumajra and Naresh Gujral, to hold talks with its alliance partner BJP for seat sharing and campaign coordination for the forthcoming assembly elections in Delhi.

“The committee would hold discussions with the Delhi BJP unit as well as the party’s central leadership as per need to ensure smooth coordination between the alliance partners during the ensuing Delhi elections,” said Sukhbir.

Notably, SAD has been contesting on four seats for 70-member Delhi assembly in alliance with the saffron party, which fields its candidates on remaining 66 seats.

During the previous elections in February 2015, the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) broom swept the Delhi assembly elections dashing to the ground Akali Dal’s hopes of emerging as a national political party with the electorate giving their verdict against four of its candidates it fielded.

Out of SAD’s four candidates, only one of them was contesting on party’s symbol — the weighing scale.

But, the party witnessed an increase in the vote share of its candidates on the four seats it contested, as compared to the previous elections.

The party fields its candidates on Rajouri Garden constituency, Kalkaji, Shahdara, and Harinagar — the prominent Sikh dominated areas of the national capital.

During 2013 polls, SAD managed to grab three seats out of four it contested. It had won Rajaouri Garden on its own symbol, and Kalkaji and Shahdara on BJP’s symbol.

During 2008 elections, SAD also failed to win even a single seat out of the four it contested in alliance with the BJP.

Even as the two parties are yet to decide on seat sharing, sources informed The Pioneer that SAD is planning its strategy according to the four seats on which it contested during previous polls as it is hopeful to get the same set of seats.

At the same time, the party has almost made up its mind to field the same candidates, at least on two seats.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad-forms-committee-to-finalise-seat-sharing.html

Homkar’s press release said Ravinder Ganjhu had a huge team then and was watching every movement and passing on tips to his men on a like talkie set.

Ravinder Ganjhu had 5 deadly armed men with him which launched the fatal assault on the PCR van while too many of them were in a spread out position to stall any rush of police then to the place of occurrence.

Ravinder Ganjhu had even celebrated this ambush by giving these 7 a sum of rupees 5,000 each and then retreated towards Beer Jangha Jungle.

On January 5 the Maoists had a plan to extract levy from a contractor which on a tip off Latehar police not only frustrated but netted 7 of Ravinder Ganjhu’s men who had confessed to their involvement in the ambush and these recoveries were made on the leads given by them too.

69,07-1-20,"Chandigarh Mayoral polls on Dec 10, BJP eyes comfortable win","With the Bharatiya Janata Party enjoying majority in the Municipal Corporation General House, its nominee for mayoral post, councillor Raj Bala Malik is set to become the next Mayor of Chandigarh.

Malik’s name was announced on Monday, the last day of nomination for the January 10 mayoral elections in the city.

She had switched allegiance to the BJP in the year 2014. This will be Malik’s second stint as mayor. Earlier, she had become mayor in 2012 as the Congress candidate.

The Congress, which does not have much at stake in this election, has fielded councilor Gurbax Rawat as party’s nominee for mayoral post.

The new mayor will replace incumbent BJP’s Rajesh Kalia, who was elected on January 18 last year.

This year, the mayoral chair is reserved for a woman. The Chandigarh mayor holds a one-year term and is chosen every year from among the elected representatives of the General House. A candidate needs at least 14 votes to become a mayor since the current House has strength of 26 members.

Of these, the BJP has a majority with 20 councillors. The Congress has five councillors and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), which is in alliance with the BJP, has one.

Besides, one vote is that of the Member of Parliament, the ex-officio member of the House.

Apart from mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor will also be elected on the same day.

The BJP has announced the name of councilor Ravi Kant Sharma for senior deputy mayor’s post and Jagtar Singh Jagga for the post of deputy mayor while the Congress has nominated councilor Sheela Devi for the post of senior deputy mayor and Ravinder Gujral for the deputy mayor’s post.

Notably, the BJP, which enjoys two-third majority in the MC house, is worried about cross-voting which had affected it in the last mayoral polls.

In 2019 polls, all four Congress councilors had ended up supporting BJP rebel Satish Kainth, who had later joined the Congress before Lok Sabha elections. Councillor Satish Kainth had filed papers against the party’s official choice, Rajesh Kalia, and gave him a tough fight, losing by just three votes

73,07-1-20,Ganjam realtors protest DM’s registration circular,"The Brahmapur Builders’ Association, the Deed Writers’ Association and the Legal Cell jointly organised a Press meet to discuss some of the emerging problems the real estate sector was facing in Ganjam district.

The members expressed serious concern on the recent circular issued by the Ganjam district Collector instructing all the Sub-Registers of the district not to accept the documents presented before them for registration of immovable properties in the district unless the transferor produce the RoR (Patta duly mutated showing record of rights) in his favour even after the transferor produced the linked documents to the effect that the title flows to him from the tenant of RoR.

The members of the real estate firm now have alleged that consequent upon the said circular, the Sub-Registers of the district were not accepting the document presented before them for registration of immovable property without the presence of RoR, causing inconvenience and loss to the public.

It may be recalled here that, the district administration had convened a meeting on October 14, 2019 on implementation of ORERA Act and Rules on registration of immovable properties in the district in which the builders, realtors and deed writers and some registering officers of the district were present, sources said.

If a RoR is not issued to the public within a week time or so, then what is the use of the software worth crores of rupees, they questioned.

If the Government ensures to issue of RoR within a week time, the real estate firms have no objection to strictly adhere to the provisions of ORERA, the builders claimed.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ganjam-realtors-protest-dm---s-registration-circular.html

He visited Jugsalai and also went to Refugee Colony, East Bengal Colony and Sindhi Colony in Sakchi. He interacted with members of various communities and informed them about the CAA and its importance for the country.

Addressing the people, Munda said the CAA was in the larger national interest. He said it was not designed to oust anyone from the country, rather it was enacted with the view to give shelter to minorities including Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis, Jainis and Buddhists being persecuted in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. He said those opposing CAA were provoking public anger with vested interests and ulterior motives. The anti-CAA lobby is trying to gain political advantage by misleading people and creating an environment of terror, he said.

Munda said there is need for people to be aware of their duties and the provisions of CAA. He said greater public awareness on CAA would counter the petty politics of opposition parties. No one should be perturbed by CAA, he said.

With ongoing protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) across the nation, the district administration has also had made elaborate security arrangements.

Meanwhile, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) organised a pro-CAA public meeting at Mahabodhi Society ground in Sakchi. The chief speaker of the occasion was Jagannath Shahi, national vice-president of VHP.

He said the CAA was being opposed by only those people who were ignorant of the country’s ancient civilization and culture. He said there is a section of people who do not want more Hindus to enter India.

Shahi said the Union Home Minister Amit Shah had openly challenged the opponents of CAA to point out at least one provision in the Act which is against the interest of Indians. In the last 800 years, no ruler could do this, he said.

District BJP president Dinesh Kumar said Congress, JMM and other opposition parties were spreading rumours about CAA.

Slamming the Government for its ‘no-pay-no-work’ formula, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has expressed solidarity with the employees saying that the Government should first apply the same formula upon itself.

“Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh is trying to suppress the dissenting voices against the dispensation’s tyranny and highhandedness instead of delivering on its poll promises…The anti-people stance of the government is untenable besides being undemocratic,” said the AAP’s state core committee chairman and MLA Principal Budh Ram, Deputy Leader Opposition in Vidhan Sabha Sarabjit Kaur Manuke and political review committee chairman Harchand Singh Bursat, in a joint statement.

The party demanded that the Government should immediately withdraw the “anti-employee” order sooner than later. Principal Budh Ram questioned the Chief Minister as to how many of the poll promises listed in the 129-page party manifesto were fulfilled. “The government should come up with its three-year report card on this,” he said.

Manuke said that Capt Amarinder government was not only anti-employee but also anti-farm laborers, the unemployed, traders and the businessmen, the poor and dalit, who were resorting to protest on the roads, due to its stubborn stance.

Bursat added that like the previous Badal Government, the Capt Amarinder Government too was promoting private sector by pushing the public sector in the State in disarray.

78,07-1-20,"Govt pioneers workplace policy for TB, comorbidities","A policy framework will help guide workplace strategies and interventions for tuberculosis (TB) care and prevention, especially in those places which do not currently have mechanisms in place to detect, treat and empower people with TB”, said Rajeev Arun Ekka, Principal Secretary, Dept of Labour at a dissemination meeting held here on Monday.

The meeting was organised by REACH, in association with the State TB Cell, Jharkhand, and supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The policy framework covers people working under all forms of employment and all workplaces covering formal and informal sectors.

Dr Nitin Madan Kulkarni, Principal Secretary, Department of Health, said, ""TB is not just a disease that affects the body, it is a social disease, and can have far reaching implications, including impact on family as well as on work.""

Speaking about need to end social stigma which people affected by TB suffer, Shailesh Kumar Chaurasia Mission Director, National Health Mission said, “The right to a dignified workplace is the right of every worker, and we need to ensure their health problems are prioritised.” Also speaking on the occasion, Dr. Rakesh Dayal, State TB Officer spoke about the policy’s coverage of TB as well as other diseases that co-occur, i.e., comorbidities.

“Treating people with TB is not enough; we need to also address comorbidities such as diabetes and HIV. And this policy, one of the first in the country looking at both TB as well as comorbidities in the workplace, is a step towards that direction,” he said.

The occasion saw the release of the State Impact Report of the TB Call to Action project, implemented in Jharkhand since September 2016 by REACH. The report summarises the key results and achievements of the project, including the following – over 50 TB survivors from 23 districts of the state trained as TB Champions; over 2100 people with TB provided support services by TB Champions; and more than 30,000 people in the community sensitised by Champions. The report also highlights a survivor-led registered network ‘TB Elimination Jharkhand’ (TEJ) which has more than 400 TB Survivors as members.

A compilation of stories of courage and perseverance of TB survivors and Champions from Jharkhand was also released on the occasion. The stories trace the transformational journey of TB survivors, who have now become TB Champions and are supporting others affected by TB.

Nirmal Kerketta, TB survivor and Champion from Gumla district, and member of TEJ, described how his life had been impacted by TB, and shared his experience of working with people affected by TB in the community in his district. “I wanted to make sure people with TB do not the face same difficulties I did. That is why I travelled on my cycle to make people aware on TB as the first step towards ending the stigma, and in order to connect them to care.”

Thanking various partners and stakeholders in State, Smrity Kumar, Project Director, REACH said, “We are grateful to have worked in partnership with State TB Cell and Health and Labour Department to catalyse a multi-sectoral, community-led and collaborative response to TB in Jharkhand.

We have achieved several milestones during the project period and hope that it leads to a community that is free of TB-related stigma and discrimination, along with a sharp focus on comorbidities.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-pioneers-workplace-policy-for-tb--comorbidities.html

80,07-1-20,Capt flays Akalis for politicising attacks on Sikhs in Pak to target Cong,"Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday lambasted the Akalis for their shameless politicization of the recent attacks on the Sikhs and their religious institutions in Pakistan, and their attempt to link the condition of minorities in Pakistan with the “unconstitutional” Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The Chief Minister came down heavily on the Akalis, particularly the Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal’s “abominable bid to use the killing of a Sikh youth and the attack on Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Pakistan to carry out her political battle against the Congress”.

He was referring to Harsimrat’s tweets in which she had sought to promote the CAA in the context of the persecution of minorities in Pakistan, and has attacked the Chief Minister and the Congress leadership over their criticism of CAA.

“This is the height of ignorance and stupidity,” said the Chief Minister, reacting to Harsimrat’s tweets.

“The CAA, coupled with National Register for Citizens (NCR) is the kind of tool with which minorities in India will be persecuted even more than those in Pakistan are,” he said, adding that it was apparent that the Union Minister had no clue about the implications of CAA or the damage it will cause to India’s secular character, particularly in conjunction NRC.

Capt Amarinder said that the brazen attacks on minorities, including Sikhs, in Pakistan were so appalling as to be indefensible. “As if these attacks are not shocking enough, Harsimrat and the rest of the Akali leadership has stooped to a shocking low by using them to defend the CAA and target the Congress party,” he added.

Also lashing out at SAD’s double- on the issue of CAA/NRC, Capt Amarinder pointed that just days back, Akali chief Sukhbir Badal had asked for minorities to be included in the purview of the CAA.

“Don’t they have any clear stand on the issue?” he asked, adding that these kinds of conflicting statements exposed the double standards of the Akalis on this grave issue of national importance.Making it clear that neither he nor the Congress were against granting citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs etc being persecuted in other countries, the Chief Minister reiterated his stand against isolation of Muslims and other religions from the CAA cover. “There should be no discrimination on religious grounds,” he said, adding that nor just Sikhs but other minorities facing persecution elsewhere should be welcome to come and settle in India.“SAD is clearly playing to the gallery, and hoping to leverage the Pakistani Sikhs issue, to promote their political interests, as is evident from their representation to the External Affairs Minister today,” said Capt Amarinder.

Considering that SAD is part of the NDA government at the Centre, it would be more apt for them to put pressure on their alliance partner, the BJP, to be more proactive in handling the situation arising out of the anti-Sikh attacks in Pakistan, the Chief Minister stressed.“Further, it would be more in order for the SAD and its alliance partners at the Centre to take steps to ensure the safety and security of the minorities within India,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/capt-flays-akalis-for-politicising-attacks-on-sikhs-in-pak-to-target-cong.html
81,07-1-20,SAD delegation meets External Affairs Minister on Nankana Sahib incident,"Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Monday urged the Union External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar to seek a categorical assurance from Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan that assets and lives of minorities would be protected in the neighbouring country.

Pak PM should also assure that all those responsible for the hate attack on the Sikhs as well as stoning of Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Nankana Sahib would be arrested and awarded exemplary punishment, the party demanded.

The demands were made by the party delegation, led by SAD president Sukhbir Badal, which called on the Union External Affairs Minister.

Sukhbir also urged Dr Jaishankar to raise the issue of atrocities being committed by Pakistan against minorities in the United Nations.

“From a total of 40,000 in 2002 Census, the Sikh population had come down to around 5,000…This itself is proof of forced conversions,” he said.

Sukhbir said that the delegation members, who included MPs Balwinder Singh Bhundur, Prof Prem Singh Chandumajra and Naresh Gujral, Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Managemnet Committee (DSGMC) president Manjinder Singh Sirsa, Takth Patna Sahib Committee president Avtar Singh Hit and Harmeet Singh Kalka, also briefed the External Affairs Minister that the situation was so bad in Pakistan that even those looking after gurdwaras were not safe.

Urging for urgent intervention on this issue at the highest level, Sukhbir said “if anybody can attack and stone Gurdwara Janam Asthan, no minority is safe in Pak”.

SAD delegation also pointed out that the Pakistan Government should be asked to take prompt and exemplary action in case any minority community is targeted in any manner. “If the Government had acted decisively in the case of attack on Sikh community members at Gurdwara Janam Asthan and stoning of the Gurdwara, it would not have set off the chain reaction which led to the killing a Sikh youth in Peshawar,” he added.

The delegation members also conveyed to Dr Jaishankar that the recent events in Pakistan had hurt the sentiments of the Sikh community worldwide.

They said that the Sikhs living in Pakistan had already stated that they were feeling insecure.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad-delegation-meets-external-affairs-minister-on-nankana-sahib-incident.html

83,07-1-20,‘Extend Lokmanya Tilak Exp till Rayagada’,"Koraput Congress MP Saptagiri Ulaka has written to Railways Minister Piyush Goyal urging him to extend the Lokmanya Tilak Express train till Rayagada.

Citing reasons, Ulaka mentioned that the train after reaching Visakhapatnam from Mumbai at 11.10 am remains idle for around 12 hours before moving back to Mumbai at 11.30 pm.

“The distance between Rayagada and Visakhapatnam is around 185 km and the Lokamanya Tilak can cover it in three hours. If the train will leave Visakhapatnam at 11.15 am, it will reach Rayagada at 2.15 pm. If this train leaves Rayagada at 8.30 pm after a six-hour rest, it can reach Visakhapatnam before the schedule time,” the MP argued.

He further noted that the extension would be very helpful as there is no direct train from Rayagada/Kalahandi/Koraput to Hyderabad or Mumbai. He also added that the Rayagada railway station can accommodate the services of one more train as Rayagada has been declared as a railway division.

“If properly managed, the Lokamanya Tilak express can also connect the passengers from Junagarh Express (18438) which reaches Rayagada at 7.55 pm and Jagdalpur-Rourkela Express (18107) coming from Koraput and reaching Rayagada at 9 pm,” wrote Ulaka.

Besides, the extension is also required as an industrial belt exists and a few projects in the office on the route.

“There are a number of industries like Nalco at Damanjodi, HAL at Sunabeda, UAIL at Tikiri, JK Papers at Rayagada and Vedanta at Lanjigarh. Proposed projects of the Birla Group and the L&T are also in the pipeline. Direct railway connectivity is required with these major cities. Extension of this train can be commercially viable without additional expenses,” Ulaka argued further.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---extend-lokmanya-tilak-exp-till-rayagada---.html

98,07-1-20,HC directs UPCL to clarify status today,"An affidavit was submitted in the high court on behalf of the Uttarakhand Power Corporation Limited (UPCL) managing director in a public interest litigation challenging cheap electricity to departmental officials and hike in power tariffs for the common citizens.

It was stated in the affidavit that following the court orders, meters had been installed by some of the employees. Objecting to this, the petitioner’s counsel said that as electricity meters had been installed in the homes of only some employees, the MD had not followed the court orders as the employees had been paid their salary for the month of November.

Considering this, the division bench of chief justice Ramesh Ranganathan and justice Alok Kumar Verma has directed the UPCL to clear the status on Tuesday. During the last date of hearing on the PIL, the power corporation MD had told the court that meters would be installed in the homes of all employees within a month. Acknowledging anomalies in the departmental works, it had also been stated that these would be inquired into within a month. According to the case details, Dehradun based RTI Club had filed a PIL in the high court stating that the government is charging Rs 400 to Rs 500 per month for electricity from electricity department officers and Rs 100 per month from other departmental employees whereas the total amount payable for the power consumed is considerably higher. This results in the burden falling on the general public. The petitioner had stated that electricity meters are not even installed in the homes of various officials and where installed, they are not functioning properly. The petitioner had stated that the corporation’s general manager’s power bill for 25 months was Rs 4.20 lakh but the meter reading was not noted from 2005 to 2016.

In addition to the serving employees of the corporation, even the retired employees and their dependents are being provided electricity almost free which directly increases the financial burden transferred to the general public, the petitioner had contended.

It was also stated in the PIL that the corporation had long ago collected the rent for the domestic electricity meters. Despite this, the rent is still added to the monthly bill which is wrong as the customer has also paid the full amount of rent.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hc-directs-upcl-to-clarify-status-today.html

112,07-1-20,Jharkhand likely to witness rainfall from Jan 8,"The little respite that the residents of Jharkhand received from the gloomy rainy weather seems to be short lived. It is again being predicted that the State is likely to receive rainfall from January 8 onwards for a few days.

According to the Meteorological Centre, Ranchi there are chances of showers on January 8 and January 9.

“This time again the rainfall will be because of an induced western disturbance. The western disturbance is a permanent system and is present throughout the year and its frequency generally increases in the winter months. It is normally active at 30 degrees or above latitude but in the winter season it affects 30 degree and below latitudes as well. When this system is active, there are induced circulations which cause clouds and rain,” said Deputy Director, MET Centre Ranchi, Abhishek Anand.

During this system, dry and wet winds have an interaction forming clouds and rainfall. When this system is approaching, the minimum temperature increases while when it ends, the minimum temperature falls.

“Because of this system, on January 7 during the day it will be sunny while clouds will start forming in the evening in the northern parts of Jharkhand. On January 8 and January 9, there will be scattered rainfall across the State,” added the official.

Northern and central parts of Jharkhand are likely to receive rainfall on January 8. Parts of central and south Jharkhand will witness showers on January 9. The weather will be clear on January 10 and January 11 while tentatively another system of western disturbances is expected to be active from January 12.

Shallow to moderate fog will also be witnessed in many places across the State from January 10. There will also be a decrease in the minimum temperature increasing the chill across the State.

“The system of western disturbances which has recently occurred is not normal for this part of the country. Even though its frequency is more in winters, it is normal for North West parts of India but not so frequent for Jharkhand,” added Anand.

Because of this system the coldest day recorded was in Ranchi on December 28 with the minimum temperature dropping to 4.8 degree Celsius while the city was also declared as a severe cold day on January 1 with the minimum temperature dropping to 6 degree Celsius in the Kanke area.

The severe cold along with rains occurring in the month of January is also having an adverse effect in the agriculture sector across the State. The weather is having a dual affect on the crops. One is due to the prolonged chilling temperature in rural areas where the minimum temperature was around 5 degree Celsius and on some days even 4 degree Celsius.

“When temperature remains at or around 4 degree Celsius, there is a frost effect. In this the water inside the plant freezes which causes raptures to the plant. Many tender crops like wheat, mustard, chana and vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower and peas are being affected and the crops are getting damaged,” said A Wadood, an agro- meteorological scientist at Birsa Agriculture University (BAU), Ranchi.

Another major damage is being caused to potatoes which have just emerged and are being affected by the Jhulsa disease.

This is also the time of sowing many rabi crops as well as vegetables. The growth of the plants has been stunted and plants have wrinkled due to very low temperatures.

“As far as the rainfall is concerned, the rains have added moisture to the soil. This moisture will be beneficial for the crops in the rabi season when there is lack of irrigation facilities,” added Wadood.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jharkhand-likely-to-witness-rainfall-from-jan-8.html

120,07-1-20,Do and die battle for BJP,"Wresting power in Delhi from the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is no less than a 'do or die' battle for the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP). In its quest to get into the players' building, the BJP is leaving no stone unturned and the party has planned a strategy with tactics, multiple meetings of party workers with the top brass and surveying each Vidhan Sabha constituency to get public views and submitting it to parliamentarians are few steps which showed the party is working aggressively to achieve its victory.

Talking to The Pioneer, senior BJP leader said that our focus is very clear because we know the target. ""Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) itself has given hint. They always say we are elected Government with majority, so we know the target, means chances are very likely that AAP will repeat its maximum candidates, on contrary, AAP wants from us to exhibit Chief Ministerial candidate.., but we believe in one thing strategy without tactics is the slowest route to the victory, three names from each constituency have been given to Central leadership for MLA seat, Election Commission announced the dates of election - Feb 8th, the MLA list is expected to release after 15th -16th, (Makar Sakranti)"" said a BJP leader

When asked about the release of MLA list as Election Commission (EC) has announced Delhi poll date which is February 8th, the BJP leader said, ""Party is working on this and meetings are going on,"" ""MLA's name for 70 Assembly seats will be announced on 15th or 16th.""

On one side AAP is vouching for its next tenure claiming better health and education for Delhi, however, BJP has prepared an insight on Citizen Amendment Act (CAA) and other National issues and gearing up AAP on public health issue - Air and Water pollution.

Top sources in Central command told that BJP has prepared small group of its workers which will visit Universities. ""College students are young and it is required to make them understand what CAA is ? These students will become the part of administration and other pivotal services in near future,"" said a leader.

""Our leaders will go Universities, homes and other areas convey people about the act ,"" Our major focus in Delhi is - regularisation of unathorised colonies,"" said BJP leader. ""After the intervention of Central Government, Delhi people will soon have registry of their home.. after registration process, the price of their property will shoot up,"" said a BJP worker adding that ""What is the first requirement of aam (common man), a roof first, then other amenities, and BJP is dedicated with Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojna,"" ""Our target is clear and we will achieve with big victory.

Meanwhile, in the letter written to the chief secretary, the IAS officer has pleaded innocence in the entire matter.

The senior officer in the viral letter has that after the said 'forged' video had went viral six months ago, he kept a low profile after informing the department of Home and principal secretary of his department.

But, the officer said, the latest claim in the chargesheet has not only threatened his personal safety but is giving tough time to him and his family mentally. Citing all these reasons, the senior officer has requested chief secretary for an appointment so that he could brief him about the exact situation. Besides Meena, the CID chargesheet had mentioned involvement of another IAS officer in the honey trap scandal but his name wasn't specified in the document as the accused told the police that they could not remember the name of that officer.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sr-ias-officer-seeks-appointment-from-chief-secy-to-plead-his-innocence.html

The stations will no longer be a part of this section as the (ASI) has not given clearance for the four stations saying the route are falling on the archaeological sites.

The four station are part of the Phase IV corridor (Tughalakabad to Aerocity), which first contract has been recently awarded for the construction of Metro viaduct from Sangam Vihar to Saket - G including four elevated Metro stations - Sangam Vihar, Khanpur-Devoli, Ambedkar Nagar and Saket-G.

While the DMRC official say that such things happen while carrying out a project. ""Even to construct a small road, you need permission from the concerned officials. Also, the four stations were part of the corridor and Delhi Metro wanted to construct it but at the same time route and alignment is falling near the archaeological sites where the ASI's clearance is mandatory. The ASI denied permissions for the following stations."" Officials also added that the Delhi metro is working on these stations and will find alternate route to locate these stations.

Responding to a query, an official of ASI, said, ""The permission was rejected on the ground that the proposed route was passing through the protected and prohibited area ofASI monuments I.e.

130,07-1-20,Mamata slams ‘fascist surgical strike’ on JNU,"Terming the Sunday’s attack on Jawaharlal Nehru University campus a “fascist surgical strike,” Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday called upon the Opposition parties to unite against the “fascist rule being perpetrated by the BJP-led Government.”

Even as academic campuses all over Bengal erupted in protest against the Sunday’s “barbaric attack” on students of JNU the Chief Minister said an “

emergency-like situation” was prevailing in India which had to be countered immediately to retrieve and save the Indian democracy.

“I started my political career as a student worker but have never seen a situation like this where the academic campus of the entire country is being attacked just to gag the protesting voices,” the Chief Minister said adding “if anyone raises his voice he will be termed as anti-national … this was not how politicians worked in the past.”

Lambasting the BJP Government for allowing the violence to be perpetrated by the members of its students’ arm Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad in JNU campus Banerjee said “I was watching how one side they sent their ABVP goons inside the campus to brutally attack the students and on the other they kept the police administration inactive… similar things happened at Jamia Millia Islamia, Lucknow, Muradabad. They are doing whatever they like… this (JNU attack) is nothing but a fascist surgical strike absolutely.”

India had been shamed and its democracy tormented as never before, Banerjee said “It is shameful to speak about how democracy is being attacked by a planted game. If anyone speaks anything in protest they call them anti-national, a Pakistani… What is happening? Pakistan is not a democratic country. The difference between India and Pakistan is that we are secular country and they are fundamentalist country. So why always compare with Pakistan? Does it mean that you want to pull India to the level of that country?”

Banerjee’s angry remarks came at a time when parts of Bengal including educational campuses in Kolkata erupted in revolt against the JNU incident with thousands of students taking out rallies from Presidency College, Jadavpur University and other places.

A massive procession of the civil society members was taken out from North Kolkata past the BJP State party office to the Governor’s House.

In the evening the police had a tough time to keep JU students and the followers of the ABVP separated from each other. “An apparent BJP supporter was roughed up by the alleged JU students for calling the, Pakistanis even as they were taking out a procession condemning the Sunday’sincident.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mamata-slams----fascist-surgical-strike----on-jnu.html
131,07-1-20,Communists deserve such bashing: Bengal BJP chief,"In what the Opposition Left parties promptly called an “admission” on the part of the BJP of its involvement in the Sunday’s attack on JNU campus, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh on Monday justified the JNU incident saying such action was long overdue and that the Left had been paid back by their own coin.

When asked to comment on the Sunday’s incident that left about 30 students and teaching staff injured, Ghosh justified the action saying, “the communists deserved this. They are getting their due.”

He said “why campuses in Bengal, Kerala and Tripura are violent? This is because the Left had perpetrated this culture in these regions. Today they are getting paid back. They are getting what they deserved. There is nothing wrong in it.”

When asked to comment on whether the level of politics should stoop to such levels the State BJP chief said “they had perpetrated silent terror earlier, now they are getting it back. Good that the score is being settled,” adding however “the BJP does not believe in violence.”

Reacting strongly to Ghosh’s comments former CPI(M) MP Samik Lahiri said “when such comments come out of the mouth of none other than the chief of the State wing of a party then one has to believe that the attack was pre-planned.

He has made this honest confession. So why the BJP is refuting the charges on national media.”

The comments made by Ghosh was nothing but the culture they are groomed in, the senior CPI(M) leader said wondering the RSS was culturally any different from the ISIS. “They do it in Pakistan, here these people do it in India. There is no difference between them. Fascist fanaticism has no geographical barriers.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/communists-deserve-such-bashing--bengal-bjp-chief.html
132,07-1-20,Uddhav likens attack to 26,"Likening Sunday’s violence at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) to the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray says that the masked men behind the violence were “cowards” and they needed to be identified and punished sternly.

“From we saw on television of what happened at JNU, I can say that the masked men who indulged in violence were cowards. If they were brave enough, they would not have indulged such kind of violence.

When they did whatever they did, why they wear masks?... Whatever I saw on television reminded me of 26/11 attacks in Mumbai,” Uddhav said.

Talking to media persons here, Uddhav said: “This kind of cowards will not get support from any quarter in the country.... I will not tolerate this kind of attack in Maharashtra.... All those masked men behind yesterday’s violence at JNU need to be identified and dealt with sternly”.

When his attention to the protests being witnessed in the national capital in the aftermath of the violence at JNU, Uddhav said: “The protests will definitely take place. Because, whatever happened at JNU should not have happened in the country.

All those responsible for the incident —be it even police — should be identified and punished”.

Asked about the protests being witnessed in Mumbai and other parts of the State, the Chief Minister said: “There is nothing to worry about the protests happening in Mumbai and other places in the state. We are here to take care of them. I would like to assure the students in the state that I will not only not allow JNU-like incidents in Maharashtra, but I will also not tolerate such incidents here”.

“If there is need to increase security on the university campuses in the State, we will definitely do it. But, we will not let anyone harm our students in the state. If someone tries to harm, we will deal with them sternly,” the Chief Minister said.

‘At the same time, we all need to come together, take cognisance and address the unrest that is being witnessed among the students across the country, by taking the students concerned into confidence... The incident has happened in Delhi..

The anger within the student community in the state is coming out. I would like to the students that I share their anger and assure them that there is no need for them to fear,” Uddhav said.

Maintaining that he did not want to politicise the incident at JNU, Uddhav said: “I do not want to politicise the incident. At this stage, I do not want to take sides on the incident. But, I am all for baring the masks of the people behind the JNU. They deserve to the unmasked. The real faces of those behind the incident should come before the country.. Whoever were behind the incident should be punished”.

Uddhav agreed with a questioner that the police appeared to be biased in handling the JNU incident. “If the police have not performed their duty, the needle of suspicion also turns towards them,” he said.

Asked if Union Home Minister Amit Shah should be held responsible for the incident, Uddhav said: “Like I said earlier I do not want to politicise the incident. What I want immediately is that all those behind the incident should be brought to book and punished severely. What we need now is an impartial inquiry into the incident....If no action is taken, then questions will arise if it was a sponsored attack and there is politics in the whole thing”.

Asked if he concurred with the demand made by the teachers’ association of JNU that the vice chancellor should be sacked, Uddhav said: “Don’t worry, things will come out (on whether there was dereliction of duty on his part). Things can not be hidden for long... Ultimately, it is for the Government there to initiate action”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/uddhav-likens-attack-to-26-11-mumbai-attacks.html

In a statement, the AMU Students Coordination Committee (AMUSCC) demanded JNU VC’s resignation, asking him to take “moral responsibility” for the violence in the varsity.

The AMUSCC has been spearheading an agitation against the amended citizenship law.

The 'CycleWalk', to be built in the city over the next four years, will give an impetus to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of 'Fit India', he said.

""It will reduce air pollution of Delhi by at least 20 per cent and green commuting will now be possible in the city,"" Shah said, addressing the gathering.

The move will usher in an era where green transportation like cycles will become fashionable and will be widely used, he said.

Around 11 lakh people in the city commute on bicycles at present, and efforts should be made to increase this number to 50 lakh, which would make a major difference in Delhi's traffic and pollution levels, the home minister said.

He suggested that the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) establish cycle clubs and encourage the use of cycles by all citizens, especially college-going students.

Union Urban Development Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the corridor will loop around the city like a ring and connect with metro stations, bus stands, high density residential areas, business districts and industrial, recreational and educational districts.

""The CycleWalk will also connect all master plan greens and make Delhi a city of connected forests and lakes with the objective to promote a healthy lifestyle and provide last mile connectivity. This will become a safer and greener alternative that would reduce vehicular traffic in the city,"" he tweeted.

143,07-1-20,CAA: DMK boycotts Guv's address,"Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly’s session in 2020 began on a stormy note on Monday with the DMK, the principal Opposition party and its allies staging a walk out in protest against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act passed by both Houses of Parliament.

The opening sequences of the session had all the ingredients of a drama as the proceedings which commenced in a sober mood turned volatile as Governor Bawarilal Purohit started his customary address to the members of the House. MK Stalin, leader of the Opposition who had given notice for a private resolution condemning the CAA was on his feet

shouting slogans and demanding a thorough discussion in the House about the “discriminatory Act”. An unperturbed Purohit asked Stalin and his colleagues to be calm and listen to the speech. “You are a best orator. Use your skills for debate. Let this House be used for debate,” said the Governor who reverted to his prepared speech.

Stalin along with the constituents of the DMK — led front shouted slogans and walked out of the House.

Interestingly, TTV Dhinakaran, the lone member of the AMMK and Tamimum Ansari , an ally of the ruling AIADMK too joined the DMK in the walk out which also gave indication of a future possible alliance between the DMK and the AMMK.

The Governor steered clear of any controversies throughout his speech and was silent about the CAA. The close he came to referring the CAA was about the move by the AIADMK Government to help Sri Lankan Tamils who have taken refuge in the State . “The Government of Tamil Nadu will urge the Government of India to provide dual citizenship to Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in Tamil Nadu. Government of Tamil Nadu will ensure that the interests of all citizens regardless of religion or creed are protected,” said the Governor.

While patting the Edappadi Palaniswami Government for its efforts in making the State a developed one and the lead State sought after by investors, the Governor declared that Tamil Nadu has become the numero uno State in India as envisaged by former Chief Minister late J Jayalalithaa. Purohit paid glowing tributes to Amma at least half a dozen times in his hour long speech and this drew thumping of desks by the AIADMK legislators. The Governor was critical of the 14th Finance Commission recommendations that led Tamil Nadu, a best performing State in the county losing heavily despite its commendable achievements. “There has been a diminution in the overall flow of Central funds to Tamil Nadu. Contrary to the impression that

the Fourteenth Finance Commission’s recommendations increased the gross flow of resources from the Centre to the States, in reality there has been a reduction in the gross transfers from the Centre to States. Moreover, Tamil Nadu has faced a more severe adverse impact due to the horizontal distribution formula of the Fourteenth Finance Commission,” said Purohit.

“The BSP has opposed this law which grants citizenship on the basis of religion, making it divisive and unconstitutional... And had also voted against it in Parliament,” the memorandum signed by Mayawati said.

146,07-1-20,Mallya can’t use pendency of plea to stall insolvency proceedings against him: SC,"The Supreme Court on Monday said fugitive economic offender Vijay Mallya cannot use pendency of his plea in the apex court to stall insolvency proceedings initiated against him by lenders in other countries.

A Bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde passed the order after the Centre told the court that Mallya used pendency of his plea to stall the UK court from delivering verdict in insolvency proceedings.

Pendency of the case is not a ground for holding any case anywhere in the world, the apex court said.

“In view of the letter circulated by Advocate-on-Record for the petitioner, list these matters on January 10, 2020...Subject to the condition that the pendency of these special leave petitions shall not be used as a cause for seeking adjournment in any matter before any Tribunal, Court or Authority anywhere,” said the Bench, also comprising Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, informed the court that proceedings in the UK in an insolvency case filed by SBI against Mallya, have been concluded and the order reserved. Mallya’s lawyers have asked the UK court not to pass any order contending that settlement proposal is pending in the apex court here, Mehta said and asked the court to clarify the position. Mallya, currently in the UK, has been charged by the Enforcement Directorate of defaulting on bank loans amounting to Rs 9,000 crore. He is facing extradition trial in the UK.

Mehta told the court that Mallya has been assuring the consortium of banks since 2013 that he will repay the money and not a single rupee has come from him till date.

Mallya had earlier moved the apex court challenging the confiscation of properties belonging to the companies owned by him and his family members. He said in the plea that no property other than that of Kingfisher Airlines, facing cases of alleged irregularities, should be attached.

On July 11, last year the Bombay High Court had refused to grant stay on proceedings before a special court on confiscation of Mallya’s properties.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mallya-can---t-use-pendency-of-plea-to-stall-insolvency-proceedings-against-him--sc.html

148,07-1-20,Nine-judge SC Bench to hear issue of allowing entry of women into Sabarimala,"The Supreme Court on Monday set up a nine-judge Bench to hear cases related to entry of women of menstruating age into Sabarimala shrine which had earlier created a political divide in the state of Kerala and triggered a heated debate whether a time-honoured temple-tradition be replaced by modern law, giving equality to all on the question of entry to the famed temple.

The nine-judge Constitution Bench of the apex court will hear from January 13 the issue of allowing women and girls of all ages to enter Kerala’s Sabarimala temple along with other contentious issues of alleged discrimination against Muslim and Parsi women in mosque, dargarh and Parsi holy fire place of an “Agyari” respectively.

The top court issued a notice informing listing of petition filed by Indian Young Lawyers Association seeking review of its historic 2018 judgement allowing women and girls of all ages to enter Sabarimala temple.

“Take notice that the following matters will be listed for hearing before a Nine Judges Constitution Bench commencing from Monday the January 13, 2020,” the notice said.

On November 14, last year, a five-judge Constitution Bench in a 3:2 majority verdict had referred to a larger seven-judge Bench, the pleas seeking review of its historic 2018 judgement allowing women and girls of all ages to enter Sabarimala temple.

It had however said that the debate about the constitutional validity of religious practices like bar on entry of women and girls into a place of worship was not limited to the Sabarimala case.

The top court said such restrictions are there with regard to entry of Muslim women into mosques and ‘dargah’ and Parsi women, married to non-Parsi men, being barred from the holy fire place of an Agyari.

It said it was time for the apex court to evolve a judicial policy to do “substantial and complete justice”.

While saying last year that it will endeavour to constitute the larger Bench at the earliest to hear the matter, the top court had declined to pass any order on the pleas by two women activists seeking a direction to the Kerala Government to ensure safe entry of women in the Ayyappa temple under police protection.

The Left parties and the BJP in Kerala had earlier taken legal and traditional view on the entry of menstruating women into the temple and tried to arouse public opinion around their respective stands. With the apex court’s larger Bench set to hear the issue of equality of opportunity for entry of women in all religious places, the contentious issue of Sabarimala is expected to be settled along with other controversies relating to Muslim and Parsi communities.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nine-judge-sc-bench-to-hear-issue-of-allowing-entry-of-women-into-sabarimala.html

150,07-1-20,Delhi 3rd in country to develop action plan to tackle AMR menace,"Delhi has become the third State in the country, after Kerala and Madhya Pradesh, to develop an action plan to tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR) menace. A global public threat, AMR primarily caused by indiscriminate usage of antibiotics could kill nearly 10 million people by 2050 up from current 70,000 people.

As per the WHO, AMR is the “resistance of a microorganism to an antimicrobial drug that was originally effective for the treatment of infections caused by it”.

To take the AMR head on, the Delhi Government on January 3, 2020 launched the State Action Plan to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance (SAPCAR), focusing on a ‘One Health’ approach through six key strategic priority areas and multi-sectoral involvement.

The State plans follows National Action Plan (NAP) on antibiotic resistance framed by the Union health Ministry in 2017, on the lines of the WHO’s global action plan.

Speaking at an event here during the launch of the SAPCAR , Dr Sujeet Singh, Director of National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) said that the move will help combat the AMR threat while Dr Sunil Gupta, MS Safdarjung Hospital emphasised the need for strengthening and expanding the regulatory mechanisms for production, sale and use of antibiotics.

Echoing similar views, Dr Ravindra Aggarwal, additional MS Lok Nayak Hospital and Chief coordinator AMR, outlined the evolution and development of SAPCAR and the way forward. Six Strategic priorities along with key focus areas have been identified for overall coordination and surveillance, research, infection prevention and control, antimicrobial stewardship for AMR containment. SAP-CARD in addition, has included monitoring and evaluation indicators to check the implementation of SAP-CARD and reduction in AMR.

Dr Sangeeta Sharma, nodal officer AMR and President DSPRUD, shared the “Antibiotic Awareness Campaign in School Children” organized in collaboration with the Delhi Government’s School Health Programme to make Delhi’s youth aware about AMR.

Later, she said that Delhi, being the transit point for various agricultural and animal husbandry products besides pharmaceuticals face different kind of AMR threat. Moreover, major reason for emergence of antibiotic resistance is inappropriate use of antibiotics by healthcare practitioners with over the counter sale of antibiotics and poor regulatory mechanisms. Also, antibiotics are also being misused in agriculture leading to supply of antibiotic-laden foods. The poor handling of sewage waste in treatment plant, domestic waste, disposal of pharmaceutical products are other major issues that need concerted and collaborative efforts across various departments.

Though AMR in India came into limelight way back in 2010 with the discovery of superbugs harbouring New Delhi metallo-lactamase (NDM-1) gene, igniting much needed discussion and action on AMR at the global and national level, so far only three States, (Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi ) in India have come forward with the AMR containment plan. The WHO warns that the economic losses could be devastating, estimated to be about $100 trillion in total by 2050. AMR could push 2.4 crore people into extreme poverty by 2030, it said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/delhi-3rd-in-country-to-develop-action-plan-to-tackle-amr-menace.html
151,07-1-20,Violence on JNU campus reminded it of Nazi rule: Cong,"Party accuses Govt of unleashing ‘State-sponsored terrorism’ on campuses across India

The Congress on Monday accused the Government of unleashing “state-sponsored terrorism” on campuses across the country and said the violence in the Jawaharlal Nehru (JNU) campus reminded it of the Nazi rule. Party chief Sonia Gandhi appointed a four-member fact-finding committee to carry out a detailed inquiry into the violence at JNU.

Demanding a judicial probe into the violence that erupted in the JNU campus, the party said the enquiry should look into the role of the government, the JNU administration and the Delhi police.

Questioning the role of the Delhi Police in the entire episode, former Home Minister P Chidambaram demanded that Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik be held accountable for the attacks on students saying the perpetrators must be identified and arrested. The buck starts with the Commissioner of Police and stops with Home Minister Amit Shah,” Chidambaram said.

Chidambaram said the JNU violence was an example of the country’s “descent into fascism” and the incident was the most clinching evidence of India rapidly descending into anarchy. He said he was “absolutely sure” that there were intelligence inputs on Sunday’s attacks and pointed towards the failure of the Delhi Police in preventing the violence on JNU campus.

“This incident is perhaps the most clinching evidence that we are rapidly descending into anarchy. It has taken place in the national Capital in India’s foremost University under the watch of the Central Government, the Home Minister, the L-G and the Commissioner of Police. This is the gravest act of impunity that we have seen in recent times. Nothing can be more shocking and shameful,” Chidambaram said.

Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met injured JNU students at AIIMS and alleged that it was “deeply sickening” about the Government that allowed violence inflicted on students. AICC chief spokesman Randeep Surjewala said the ABVP goons went from hostel to hostel and entered girls hostel, Sabarmati hostel, Periyar hostel and Kaveri Hostel. They entered half a dozen hostels and they beat up each and every student on their way, calling them “anti-nationals and urban naxals”.

“What is the enmity that you have with students and the youth of India Modi ji and Amit Shah ji, that’s the question the INC and the people of India ask. Why are you torturing, suffocating, subjugating the youth of India under your autocratic rule. The more you suppress voice of the youth, more emboldened it will become,” Surjewala told reporters.

“The manner in which youth is being attacked and their voices stifled, reminds us of the Nazi Germany of 1933 which seems to have come back under the rule of Modi and Amit Shah after 90 years,” he said. The Congress president has appointed a fact-finding committee on the JNU incident. The members of the fact-finding committee are Sushmita Dev, the Mahila Congress chief, Hibi Eden, an MP and former NSUI president, Syed Naseer Hussain, an MP and former president of JNU NSUI and Amrita Dhawan, a former NSUI president and ex-DUSU president.

They have been asked to conduct a detailed inquiry into the incident of violence in JNU campus and (will) submit the report to the party chief within a week, a statement from AICC general secretary KC Venugopal said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/violence-on-jnu-campus-reminded-it-of-nazi-rule--cong.html

Speaking to reporters here, he said he wanted to complete the exercise before his Davos visit. He said he was not keen on leaving for Davos, but was told that some Chief Ministers would have to g and so would attend it as it is a very important event.

“I will make all efforts to expand the cabinet before that,” he said. With Yediyurappa making it clear that 11 of the disqualified JDS-Congress MLAs who got re-elected in the December 5 bypolls on BJP tickets will be made Ministers, lobbying has been on within the party for the remaining ministerial berths.

He also has to give adequate representation to various castes and regions in hiscabinet and also deal with allocation of key portfolios.

The Chief Minister, who has indicated that the Ministry expansion may take place any time after Sankranti, is likely to travel to Davos on January 20, according to sources.

153,07-1-20,Meeting takes stock of situation,"JNU Vice-Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar who has not been seen anywhere since the brutal attack by mask men at the university campus on Sunday evening, is not available even for the Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry!

The man who should have been there to pacify the violence, skipped a high-level meeting convened by HRD Secretary Amit Khare to take stock of the situation at JNU in the aftermath of massive violence. The HRD Ministry on Monday had summoned the entire JNU administration to review the steps taken to control the situation.

Sources in the Ministry said for almost few minutes, the JNU officials kept conveying that the V-C was on his way and will reach shortly for the meeting which lasted for almost two hours in the afternoon.

During the meeting, the JNU administration apprised the HRD Ministry of what led to the Sunday’s violence at the campus. A source present in the meeting said a JNU administrative official complained about the “lackadaisical” approach of the V-C who was already informed about the situation prevailing and was briefed that situation might “worsen” in the campus as “restlessness” was observed within the student community.

The official was however interrupted by another JNU official saying that Kumar was very much peeved about the second such incident in the campus and has sought time from “two cabinet” ministers to brief them about the prevailing condition in the campus in last couple of months.

With the Home Minister Amit Shah himself asking for immediate reports into the incident from Delhi L-G as well as Delhi Police, HRD Ministry too is preparing a detailed report based on the two page facts provided by JNU administration.

“HRD Secretary Amit Khare held a meeting with a team of JNU authorities, including Pro-VC Chintamani Mahapatra, Registrar Promod Kumar, Rector Rana Pratap Singh and Proctor Dhananjay Singh. The secretary held a detailed discussion with them and was also briefed about the current situation in JNU,” a senior HRD Ministry official said. There was heavy deployment of police on Monday outside the Shashtri Bhawan which houses the HRD Ministry. Though the V-C remained confined, he took to social media to express his displeasure over the incident.

Sources also said the incumbent HRD Secretary is also treading in the matter cautiously as his predecessor R Subramanyam was axed from HRD last month after the JNU fee related agitation. Subramanyan during a top level meeting of HRD Ministry to resolve the fee agitation had advocated for the JNU Students’ concern and in the meeting it was pointed that he himself is a JNU alumni.

The Ministry had on Sunday sought an immediate report from JNU Registrar Pramod Kumar after the violence broke out and students and teachers were attacked. JNU registrar, proctor and other admin officials were briefed the ministry officials on the sequence of events that unfoded on the campus and the measures taken to restore normalcy.

HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal asserted educational institutions cannot be allowed to become “political adda”, and vowed “strong action” against the perpetrators of violence at JNU. “I have said this earlier also that these autonomous institutions cannot be allowed to become political ‘adda’ (dens). Strong action will be initiated against people involved in such an attack,” Pokhriyal said on the sidelines of an event in Bhubaneshwar. The HRD Minister urged JNU students to maintain the dignity of the university and peace on campus.

Violence broke out in the campus as a group of masked people armed with sticks attacked students and teachers and damaged property on the campus, prompting the administration to call in the police. Many sustained injuries and were admitted to AIIMS Trauma Centre here. They were discharged on Monday.

The External Affairs Ministry statement said Pakistan’s Chargé d’affaires was summoned to lodge strong protest at the recent acts of vandalism and desecration of the holy Gurdwara and the targeted killing of minority Sikh community member in Peshawar, Pakistan.

India also shared strong concerns raised by members of civil society, parliamentarians and others at the continued persecution of religious and ethnic minorities in Pakistan, including the recent despicable and heinous acts. Pakistan was called upon to ensure safety, security, and welfare of the members of the minority communities in Pakistan, including their places of worship, and take immediate measures to expeditiously bring the perpetrators of such despicable and heinous acts to justice.

A Sikh minority community member Ravinder Singh was on Sunday murdered in Peshawar by an “unidentified” gunman, leading to a strong protest from India which condemned the “targeted killing” of the young Sikh man.

The Ministry of External Affairs on Sunday had said Pakistan should stop “prevaricating” and take immediate action to apprehend and give exemplary punishment to the perpetrators of the crime.

The incident involving killing of 25-year-old Sikh minority community member came two days after a mob attacked, desecrated and vandalized the most revered gurdwara at Nankana Sahib. The victim Ravinder Singh was the brother of Public News anchor Harmeet Singh. He was shot dead in Peshawar by an unidentified man, according to media reports.

Ravinder Singh was a resident of Shangla district at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and was in Peshawar for shopping ahead of his planned wedding. His Peshawar visit came soon after he returned home from his Malaysia visit. After killing him, the murderer made a phone call to Ravinder Singh’s family, a media report said quoting the Peshawar police.

Union Home Minister and party chief Amit Shah is scheduled to address people in Vaishali district on January 16, two days after Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath holds a public meeting in Gaya, state BJP vice- president Devesh Kumar told PTI.

A massive door-to-door campaign is currently underway in the State, after its launch on Sunday with rallies addressed in Patna by Union minister of state for Home Nityanand Rai and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi.

Notably, Bihar witnessed massive anti-CAA protests in the recent past, including statewide bandhs called on different days by Left parties and the RJD and its allies.

A demonstration staged by a motley group of student outfits in December had caught the police off guard as the agitators went on the rampage, setting on fire a police outpost and many vehicles at Kargil Chowk, a stone's throw from the district police chief's office and the collectorate.

Meanwhile, the State BJP mocked Pavan K Varma, the disgruntled national general secretary of the JD(U), for his open letter in protest against “unilateral announcement” on National Population Register (NPR) exercise by the deputy CM.

The erstwhile Congress government had showed these fake figures in government schools to embezzle public money sanctioned for text books, midday meals and uniforms of the non-existent students, it said.

Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who reviewed the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, was told that more than 3,12,000 were identified as ‘ghost children’, it said.

160,07-1-20,Tata-Mistry case: NCLAT dismisses RoC plea,"n The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal on Monday dismissed the Registrar of Companies’ petition seeking modification of the judgement in the Tata-Mistry case and said its ruling had not cast any aspersions on the RoC.

“There is no ground to amend judgement dated December 18, 2019,” a two-member NCLAT bench said.

On December 18, the tribunal ruled reinstating Cyrus Mistry as the Executive Chairman of Tata Group and also termed conversion of Tata Sons from a public company to a private one by the RoC as “illegal”.

Tata Sons, Chairman Emeritus Ratan Tata and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) have separately moved the Supreme Court against the NCLAT order.

In its plea, RoC — under the corporate affairs ministry — had sought to be impleaded as a party in the two petitions and deletion of words “illegal” and “with the help of the RoC” used by the NCLAT in its 172-page judgement.

In its plea, RoC, which functions under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, had sought to be impleaded as a party in the two petitions and deletion of words “illegal” and “with the help of the RoC” used by the NCLAT in its 172-page-long judgement.

The tribunal had termed the appointment of N Chandrasekaran, as ‘illegal’ following the October 2016 sacking of Mistry as Tata Sons’ executive chairman. It had also directed the RoC to reverse Tata Sons’ status from a ‘private company’ to a ‘public company’.

In its urgent application, which was mentioned on December 23, just five days after the NCLAT’s December 18, judgement, RoC Mumbai had asked the appellate tribunal “to carry out requisite amendments” in Para 186 and 187 (iv) of its judgement “to correctly reflect the conduct of the RoC, Mumbai as not being illegal and being as per the provisions of the Companies Act”.

Besides, it had also urged “to delete the aspersions made regarding any hurried help accorded by the RoC Mumbai to Tata Sons, except what was statutorily required” in para 181 of the order.

In the order, the appellate tribunal had quashed the conversion of Tata Sons - the principal holding company and promoter of Tata firms - into a private company from a public firm and had termed it as “illegal”. The tribunal had said that the action taken by the RoC to allow the firm to become a private company was against the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and ‘prejudicial’ and ‘oppressive’ to the minority member (Mistry Camp).

“The Company (Tata Sons) shall be recorded as ‘Public Company’. The RoC will make corrections in its record showing the Company as ‘Public Company’,” the NCLAT had said.

Contesting the observations, RoC Mumbai asked the NCLAT to “delete the aspersion made regarding any hurried help accorded by RoC Mumbai to Tata Sons except what was statutorily required by RoC Mumbai”.

The RoC also said it has acted in “bonafide manner” in converting the status of Tata Sons as “there was no stay granted by this appellate tribunal on the operation of the judgement dated July 9, 2018 of Mumbai, NCLT at the time when this intimation was filed by Tata Sons Ltd”.

In its petition, the RoC had asked “to carry out the requisite amendment in paragraphs ... of the judgement dated December 18, 2019 to correctly reflect the conduct of RoC Mumbai as not being illegal and being as per the provisions of the Companies Act along with the rules”.

Months after Mistry was sacked, Tata Sons had received its shareholders’ nod in September 2017, to convert itself into a private limited company from a public limited company, thereby absolving it of the need to take shareholder consent in taking crucial decisions, which could be passed with just the board’s approval.

Tata Sons Ltd was initially a ‘Private Company’ but after insertion of Section 43A (1A) in the Companies Act, 1956 on the basis of average annual turnover, it assumed the character of a deemed ‘Public Company’ with effect from February 1, 1975, the order said.

Meanwhile, Cyrus Mistry on Sunday ruled out pursuing chairmanship of Tata Sons or any other executive positions at group entities but asserted that he is interested in a board seat at the holding company.

Ruling out taking up any position at the group or any group entities, Mistry in a late Sunday evening public statement said that he is “walking the talk” to uphold corporate governance, and this is not a quest for position or power and he “will not be pursuing the executive chairmanship of Tata Sons, or directorship of TCS, Tata Teleservices or Tata Industries”.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/tata-mistry-case--nclat-dismisses-roc-plea.html
161,07-1-20,Sensex nosedives 788 pts on US-Iran standoff,"The BSE benchmark Sensex crashed by nearly 788 points and the NSE Nifty tumbled around 234 points on Monday as heightened tensions in the Middle East kept investors on edge.

The 30-share BSE index ended at 40,676.63, dropping of 787.98 points, or 1.90 per cent. Similarly, the broader Nifty closed at 11,993.05, falling by 233.60 points, or 1.91 per cent.

On the Sensex chart, Bajaj Finance was the top loser, dropping 4.63 per cent, followed by SBI, IndusInd Bank, Maruti, HDFC, Hero MotoCorp, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries.

Bucking the broader trend, only Titan and PowerGrid ended with gains.

Domestic market witnessed intense selloff in line with global stocks after US President Donald Trump warned Iran of major retaliation if Tehran carries out any attack against America to avenge the killing of top military commander Qasem Soleimani and hinted at striking its cultural sites.

His statement came hours after Iran announced it will no longer abide by the limits contained in the 2015 landmark nuclear deal.

He also threatened to impose “very big sanctions” on Iraq if it follows through on a parliament vote calling for the expulsion of US troops based in the country.

“Indian market is reacting more negatively than other emerging markets due to crude oil impact. Since our dependence on crude imports as a percentage of consumption is the highest, the impact on economy and markets is also higher,” said Rusmik Oza, Sr. VP (Head of Fundamental Research-PCG), Kotak Securities. “Along with crude, the negative impact of currency is also weighing on Indian markets,” Oza added.

Brent crude oil futures surged nearly 2 per cent to USD 69.81. The rupee depreciated 24 paise against the US dollar to 72.04 (intra-day).

Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul ended lower. European markets were also trading in negative terrain in early sessions.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/sensex-nosedives-788-pts-on-us-iran-standoff.html
162,07-1-20,"Petrol, diesel prices up","(): Petrol prices on Monday were hiked by 15 paisa a litre and diesel rates were increased by 17 paisa as global oil prices hit USD 70 mark in the wake of escalating US-Iran tensions fanning fresh fears of conflict in the crude-rich Middle East.

The retail pump prices of petrol in Delhi rose to Rs 75.69 per litre — the highest since November 2018, while those of diesel climbed to Rs 68.68, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.

This is the fifth straight day of increase in retail pump prices.

Oil prices surged, gold hit a more than six-year high and equities tumbled Monday amid escalating US-Iran tensions after the US assassination of commander Qasem Soleimani.

US President Donald Trump on Sunday warned of a “major retaliation” against Tehran after it threatened revenge for the killing.

Brent futures rose as much as 3.1 per cent, or USD 2.14, to USD 70.74 per barrel while West Texas Intermediate advanced 1.7 per cent to USD 64.10 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Crude was at this high level on September 2019, when Saudi production facilities were attacked, knocking out about 5 per cent of global output.

The deepening crisis continued to spill over to other markets — stock indices from Japan to Hong Kong fell. In India, Sensex plummeted 787.98 points to end at 40,676.63 while Nifty tanked 233.60 points to close at 11,993.05. Also, gold surged to the highest in more than six years.

India is 84 per cent dependant on imports to meet its oil needs and any spike in global prices has a direct bearing on its economy. Not just imports but even domestic crude oil — which forms the raw material for making petrol, diesel and other petroleum products — is priced according to international benchmarks.

The Middle East accounts for more than two-thirds of the country’s oil imports, with Iraq and Saudi Arabia being the top suppliers.

Even though the import basket has been sought to be diversified with oil being contracted from nations such as the US, pricing in all the regions is governed by international benchmarks and rates went up everywhere following Friday’s strikes.

Officials said there is no immediate threat of any supply disruption to India and the only impact would be felt in prices.

Goldman Sachs said an actual disruption to global supplies is needed to keep prices are current levels.

For an economy that is struggling to recover from a six-year low growth rate of 4.5 per cent, a spike in oil prices poses a significant risk as it will not just stoke inflation but also lead to higher outgo on government subsidies on cooking fuel.

“Nowhere in the world has seen any supply being stopped because of US strikes. Oil continues to flow as normal,” an official said.

Monday’s price increase is the fourth straight day of retail prices going up. Since ?January 2, petrol price has increased by 53 paise per litre while diesel rates have gone up 72 paise.

Prices were unchanged over the new year. Rates of petrol have been on the upswing since December 26 and that of diesel since November 29, 2019. Diesel prices have increased by Rs 2.95 per litre over this period while petrol has become costlier by 1.06 paise.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/petrol--diesel-prices-up.html
163,07-1-20,ACs to now have default temp set at 24 degress: BEE,"n The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) on Monday said all room air conditioners should have a default temperature of 24 degrees Celsius.

This means that when the room air conditioner is switched on, it will start at 24 degree Celsius.

The central government in consultation with BEE had notified new energy performance standards for room air conditioners (RACs) on October 30, 2019, according to a statement by the power ministry.

According to the notification, all brands and types of star-labelled RACs, which are rated from one star to five stars based on their energy efficiencies and manufactured, commercially purchased or sold in India, shall ensure default setting of temperature in the room air conditioners at 24 degrees Celsius, with effect from January 1, 2020.

The new norms provide that the Indian Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (ISEER) as per the new standards will range from 3.30 to 5 for split and 2.70 to 3.50 for window air conditioners.

However, these performance standards, except default temperature of 24 degrees Celsius, will be applicable from January 1, 2021, onwards.

The BEE launched a voluntary star-labelling programme for fixed-speed RACs in 2006 and this programme became mandatory on January 12, 2009.

Thereafter, in 2015, a voluntary star-labelling programme for inverter RACs was also started, which was further made mandatory with effect from January 1, 2018.

The BEE star-labelling programme for RACs now covers both fixed and inverter RAC up to a cooling capacity of 10,465 watts (2.97 tonne of refrigeration).

Continual enhancement in performance levels has resulted in substantial energy-efficiency improvement of about 43 per cent in the minimum energy performance standards for split units, which are the most-popular RACs sold in the market.

The ISEER is the energy performance index used for RACs and its assessment is based on the bin hours defined in ISO 16358.

The star-labelling programme for RACs has led to saving of an estimated 4.6 billion units of energy in 2017-18 and a cumulative energy saving of 46 billion units translating to a reduction of 38 million tonnes of carbon emission.

The BEE is a statutory body under the Ministry of Power, Government of India. It develops policies and strategies with the objective of reducing the energy intensity of the Indian economy.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/acs-to-now-have-default-temp-set-at-24-degress--bee.html

166,07-1-20,Kejriwal didn’t go to JNU due to BJP: Singh,"After Delhi Chief Minister faced flak from some quarters for not visiting the spot after masked men armed with sticks attacked students and teachers and damaged property on the JNU campus on Sunday, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Sanjay Singh said that had the party chief gone to the university, the BJP would have vitiated the atmosphere there and blamed it on him.

Singh said that a response must be sought from Union Home Minister Amit Shah in the matter under whom the Delhi Police functions. “The AAP is very concerned on the ongoing situation. The centre should step in to maintain law and order in Delhi,” he said.

Responding to the criticism, Singh said that had Kejriwal gone to the spot, the BJP would have vitiated the atmosphere there and blamed it on him. Singh had visited AIIMS late Sunday night, and interacted with the injured students getting treatment there.

“The law and order situation is in shambles in the national Capital. Why is Amit Shah sleeping? What has happened is very unfortunate. It has shocked the whole country and it is a very worrying issue for us,” he said. However, he refuted report that it is a political issue, saying deteriorating law and order situation is the issue. “We have come here to express our solidarity with the students,” he said.

His reaction came after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal drew criticism for not visiting JNU campus after Sunday’s violence.

Reacting to the violence, Kejriwal on Sunday tweeted, “I am so shocked to know about the violence at JNU. Students attacked brutally. Police should immediately stop violence and restore peace.

167,07-1-20,"Modi following two-nation theory, has emerged as Hindu Jinnah: Tarun Gogoi","Calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi India’s “Hindu Jinnah”, former Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi on Monday accused him of following the “two-nation theory” of the Pakistan founder to divide the nation on the basis of religion.

The Congress veteran leader also decried Sunday night attack on JNU students, saying it was reflective of the BJP’s “policy of repression that would bring further misfortune” for the country.

The massive protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed pan-India NRC have made it clear that Indians do not want the kind of Hindutva the BJP and the RSS seek to bring into the country, he said.

“The Prime Minister alleges that we (the Congress) are talking the language of Pakistan, but it is he who has reduced himself to the level of the neighbouring country. He is following (Muhammad Ali) Jinnah’s two-nation theory (to divide the country) on the basis of religion and has emerged as India’s Hindu Jinnah,” Gogoi said, launching a stinging attack on Modi.

“We are Hindus but we don’t want our country to become a Hindu Rashtra. The majority of people who are protesting, and even those who have been killed, are Hindus. They do not want the Hindutva the BJP and RSS are propagating,” he told a press conference.

He said violence of the kind that was seen at JNU on Sunday night posed a threat to the country’s unity and integrity.

The 3-time former Chief Minister of Assam said the anti-CAA protests began in the State and gathered steam there, but it spread across the country because of the BJP’s “policy of repression”.

Calling the Modi Government “arrogant”, the Congress leader claimed it would go to any extent to enforce the new citizenship law.

Referring to the killing of five protesters in police action during the anti-CAA stir in Assam, Gogoi said the BJP Governments at the Centre and in the State were still blaming the Congress and the Left for the violence.

“Are we so powerful that we can instigate AASU, AJYCP, KMSS and all other regional organisations to come out on the streets to protest? There is no conspiracy. The BJP has no political knowledge and is not interested in listening to the voice of the people,” Gogoi said.

The BJP, he asserted, will not be able to win even 25 of Assam’s 126 seats if assembly elections were to be held immediately. Such was the enormity of public anger, he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/modi-following-two-nation-theory--has-emerged-as-hindu-jinnah--tarun-gogoi.html

You (Assam government) have to explain this. Whatever you want (to say),” a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde observed after senior advocate Kapil Sibal drew the attention to the alleged statement made by the state NRC coordinator.

The bench was hearing the petition filed by an NGO which also sought removal of state NRC coordinator Hitesh Dev Sarma. The NGO claimed that the new state coordinator’s comments were against Bengali Muslims and Rohingyas.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Assam Government, said the NRC exercise in the state has been completed and there is no role left for the state coordinator.

Several other petitions have been filed relating to the NRC in Assam and the bench issued notices to the Centre and the state government and sought response within four weeks.

A petition was also heard in which it was stated that around 60 children have been excluded from the NRC but their parents have been granted citizenship through NRC. Attorney General K K Venugopal and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre and the Assam government, said such children will not be separated from their parents.

175,07-1-20,Pak arrests main accused,"The main accused in the recent vandalism at the Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Pakistan’s Punjab province was arrested and charged with a non-bailable section of the stringent anti-terrorism act and blasphemy, a senior police officer said on Monday.

Gurdwara Nankana Sahib, also known as Gurdwara Janam Asthan, is a site near Lahore where the first Guru of Sikhs, Guru Nanak, was born.

The suspect, identified as Imran Chisti, is the elder brother of Mohammad Hassan who married a teenage Sikh girl in September last after allegedly abducting and converting her to Islam, triggering a controversy.

Chisti, a Government employee working in the Fisheries Department, was arrested on Sunday for his role in the violent incident at the Gurudwara, Nankana police station Inspector Muhammad Jamil told PTI on Monday.

“We have arrested Imran Chishti, a Government employee, under terrorism and blasphemy charges. He has been booked under sections 295A, 290, 291, 341,506, 148 and 149 of Pakistan Penal Code and 7-ATA (anti-terrorism act),” the officer said.

According to the FIR, Chishti incited a mob on Friday in the name of religion and threatened to destroy a worship place of a minority community (Gurdwara Janam Asthan) to build a shrine there.

“The suspect incited the sentiments of Muslims in order to have settled his family issue and created a law and order situation in the Nankana city,” it said.

A large number of people, led by Chishti on Friday, held a day-long sit-in outside Gurdwara Janam Asthan against the alleged police harassment and arrest of their family members over the abduction and conversion issue. He also vowed to build a Muslim shrine in the place of the Gurdwara.

Chishti claimed that his brother Hassan was beaten up by police for “lawfully and consensually” marrying the daughter of the Gurdwara’s granthi.

Police officer Jamil said that Chishti had deliberately misled Muslims in the area against the Sikhs. He also said police patrolling has been increased around all the holy places of the Sikhs in Nankana Sahib.

When asked Hassan and any other member of his family are detained too, Jamil said: “We have only arrested Chishti as he is the main suspect misleading the people in the name of religion.”

Interestingly, earlier neither police nor Evacuee Trust Property Board which looks after the minority places in Pakistan admitted that Gurwara Janam Asthan came under attack/threat by the local Muslims.

The arrest of Chishti came after Prime Minister Imran Khan Sunday broke his silence on the incident and said it goes against his “vision” and the Government will show “zero tolerance” against those involved in it.

India has strongly condemned the incident of vandalism at the revered.

Gurdwara and called upon the Pakistan Government to take immediate steps to ensure the safety and security of the Sikh community there.

Pakistan’s Foreign Office on Friday rejected the media reports that the Gurdwara Nankana Sahib was desecrated in a mob attack, saying the birthplace of founder of Sikhism remains “untouched and undamaged” and the “claims of destruction” of one of the holiest Sikh shrines are “false”.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/pak-arrests-main-accused.html
176,07-1-20,Trump rules out US troop withdrawal from Iraq,"President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to impose “very big” sanctions on Iraq after its Parliament called on the US military to leave the country for assassinating top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in a drone attack in Baghdad.

The Iraqi Parliament on Sunday voted to expel the US troops from its territory which have been there to help the Iraq dispensation fight the Islamic State terror group.

Some 5,000 US soldiers are in Iraq as part of the international coalition against the IS terror group.

Iraq’s move comes in response to the killing of Maj Gen Soleimani, 62, the head of Iran’s elite al-Quds force and architect of its regional security apparatus, in a US drone attack on a convoy that was leaving the Baghdad International Airport early on Friday. The strike also killed the deputy chief of Iraq’s powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.

Soleimani’s killing was the most dramatic escalation yet in spiralling tensions between Iran and the US, already hit by serious differences over Tehran’s ambitious nuclear programme.

“We’re not leaving (Iraq) unless they pay us back for it,” Trump said while responding to a question on the resolution passed by the Iraqi Parliament.

He was speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One while travelling from Mar-a-Lago in Florida to Andrews Joint Base in Maryland as he returned to the White House from his Christmas and New Year vacation.

“We have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that’s there. It cost billions of dollars to build. Long before my time We’re not leaving unless they pay us back for it,” he said.

However, Trump did not name the airbase.

“If they do ask us to leave, if we don’t do it in a very friendly basis. We will charge them sanctions like they’ve never seen before ever. It’ll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame,” Trump said issuing a strong warning to Iraq.

Trump also threatened to put “very big” sanctions on Iraq if there is any opposition from the Gulf country.

“If there’s any hostility, that they do anything we think is inappropriate, we are going to put sanctions on Iraq, very big sanctions on Iraq,” he said.

Trump said that the US has spent a lot of money in Iraq.

“I told you, Iraq, was the worst decision, going into the Middle East was the worst decision ever made in the history of our country, and I’ve said that publicly so I guess I can say that right now going into the Middle East was the worst decision ever made in the history of our country, but we are there and they went into Iraq,” he said.

“Iraq, by the way, they didn’t knock down the World Trade Center. That’s been very nicely proven. But we went in and we’re there and we’re pulling out, pulling out of a lot of different areas. With Syria, I pulled out because I’m not going to guard his border. Why should I be guarding the border?” he asked.

“They’ve got troops, let them guard, that border’s been under siege, for thousands of years they’ve been fighting on that border. We call it the safe zone, it’s really the opposite of the safe zone, many many people have been killed and by the way many people from Turkey have been killed, it’s a double,” Trump said.

As the tensions escalated between Iran and the US following the killing of Soleimani, Tehran on Sunday announced its fifth step back from the 2015 landmark nuclear deal, saying it would not observe the nuclear deal’s restrictions on fuel enrichment, on the size of its enriched uranium stockpile and on its research and development activities.

In a statement, Tehran, however, said it would continue cooperating “as before” with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors the implementation of the nuclear deal.

President Trump abandoned the Iranian nuclear deal in 2018, saying he wanted to force Iran to negotiate a new deal that would place indefinite curbs on its nuclear programme and also halt its development of ballistic missiles.

On Saturday night, Trump warned that the US will target 52 sites in Iran some of which are “at a very high level and important to Iran and the Iranian culture” if the Islamic republic attacks American personnel or assets.

Responding to Trump’s remarks, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said targeting cultural sites was a ‘war crime’.

Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Khamenei has vowed a revenge against the killing of his general, saying “severe revenge awaits the criminals” behind the attack.

Soleimani was widely seen as the second most powerful figure in Iran behind the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. His Quds Force, an elite unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, reported directly to the Ayatollah Khamenei and he was hailed as a heroic national figure.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump-rules-out-us-troop-withdrawal-from-iraq.html
177,07-1-20,Iran nuclear deal hangs by thin thread,"The Iran nuclear deal was already in tatters before the country announced the latest rollback of its commitments under the 2015 accord following the US assassination of a top general.

But Iran has not said it wants to quit the agreement, leaving some room for the deal’s remaining parties - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - to try to save it, according to analysts.

Iran had been expected to announce a new step back from its commitments under the deal following a series of measures since May last year in response to the US pulling out of the accord in 2018 and reinstating sanctions.

The latest decision -- to forego the limit on the number of centrifuges used in uranium enrichment -- was in line with Iran’s previous announcements, according to a diplomat.

“There is nothing enormously new,” the diplomat who is familiar with the matter told AFP, adding it was a “relief” the Islamic republic did not go even further.

Iran is “politically very careful. They are not saying we are leaving the deal,” said Robert Kelley, a former inspections chief at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which monitors the deal’s implementation.

Friday’s US killing of a top Iranian commander, Qasem Soleimani, in Baghdad in a drone strike has added to geopolitical tensions, while the 2015 accord -- known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action -- had already been shaky.

The JCPOA offered Iran sanctions relief in exchange for scaling back its nuclear programme, but remaining parties to the deal have so far been unable to find an efficient way to skirt reimposed US sanctions.

“Iran’s decision to put aside the cap on the number of centrifuges as its fifth step away from its JCPOA commitments is less harsh than the initially feared resumption of 20 per cent enrichment,” Ali Vaez of International Crisis Group tweeted.

The accord capped Iran’s uranium enrichment at 3.67 per cent, sufficient for power generation but far below the more than 90 per cent level required for a nuclear weapon.

Iran has already broken that limit with enrichment reaching 4.5 per cent by November - still below the 20 per cent level it had previously operated. It has always denied any military dimension to its nuclear programme.On Sunday, Tehran also stressed it would continue to work with the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, which sends inspectors to Iran to monitor its activities.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/iran-nuclear-deal-hangs-by-thin-thread.html
178,07-1-20,NATO to review Iraq mission after Iran general slain,"NATO’s ruling committee will meet Monday to discuss the future of the alliance’s training mission in Iraq as Middle East tensions mount after US forces killed a top Iranian general.

Ambassadors from the 29 allies will gather at their Brussels headquarters at 3.00 pm (local time) with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg expected to brief journalists afterwards.

US officials are due to give an update on the situation after Washington killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Middle East operations as commander of the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force, in a US drone strike at Baghdad airport.

“The North Atlantic Council will address the situation in the region,” a NATO official said.

“The secretary general decided to convene the meeting of NATO ambassadors following consultations with allies.” Stoltenberg had spoken by telephone with US Secretary of Defence Mark Esper since Friday’s strike, but the killing of Soleimani surprised many of Washington’s allies and triggered calls for de-escalation.

The situation has also deteriorated in Iraq, where lawmakers have called for the 5,200 US soldiers deployed there to leave.

NATO maintains a 500-strong training mission in Iraq, preparing local forces to take on Islamic State group extremists, but this would be in doubt if coalition forces pull out.

“The big issue is the future of the NATO mission in Iraq after the demand of the Iraqi parliament yesterday to remove US-led coalition and foreign forces. We have to see what we will do now,” a NATO diplomat told AFP.

On Saturday, a NATO spokesman said the mission, which involves several hundred allied personnel, was continuing “but training activities are currently suspended”.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/nato-to-review-iraq-mission-after-iran-general-slain.html
179,07-1-20,Top EU diplomat ‘deeply regrets’ Iran nuke deal decision,"The EU’s diplomatic chief on Monday voiced regret at Tehran’s latest step away from the beleaguered 2015 Iran nuclear deal as the Islamic republic seethes over US killing of a top commander.

Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, tweeted that the accord, which has been teetering on the brink of collapse since US President Donald Trump pulled out, was “now more important than ever”.

European-led efforts to keep Iran in the deal - which curbed its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief -- have borne little fruit since the US withdrew in May 2018 and reimposed punishing sanctions.

In line with the usual EU policy, Borrell said the bloc would wait for further details of Iranian breaches from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) before deciding how to respond.

“Deeply regret Iran’s latest announcement on #JCPOA. As ever we will rely on @iaeaorg verification,” Borrell tweeted, using an abbreviation for the deal’s formal name.

“Full implementation of #NuclearDeal by all is now more important than ever, for regional stability & global security.

I will continue working with all participants on way forward.”

On Sunday Iran said it would forego the “limit on the number of centrifuges” it had pledged to honour in the 2015 agreement, casting doubt on an EU push for talks to salvage the deal.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/top-eu-diplomat----deeply-regrets----iran-nuke-deal-decision.html

“I don’t think you can convince Iraq with threats, but with arguments,” Maas told Deutschlandfunk radio, warning that years-long efforts to rebuild Iraq “could all be lost” if the situation escalates.

Trump earlier vowed to hit Iraq with sanctions “like they’ve never seen before” if US troops are forced to leave the country.

The threat came after Iraqi lawmakers voted on Sunday to request Govt end an agreement with a US-led international coalition to fight the hardline Islamist group IS in the region.

190,07-1-20,Star-struck minnows pay big penalty,"Paris Saint-Germain rested superstars Neymar and Kylian Mbappe before defeating sixth-tier Linas-Montlhery 6-0 in the French Cup on Sunday as the amateur side, and self-confessed fans of their monied rivals, were left to rue a missed penalty when trailing just 1-0.

The part-timers, whose budget is 2,000-times smaller than the Qatari-backed Parisian giants, fell behind to a goal on the half-hour by teenager Adil Aouchiche.

However, they were then awarded a penalty after Colin Dagba brought down Issa Cisse.

Up stepped Idrissa Kanoute but his tame spot kick was well-saved by Sergio Rico in the PSG goal.

Less than a minute later, Uruguayan star Edinson Cavani, named captain for the night, tucked away PSG’s second and the game was up.

Cavani, starting for the first time in two months, added his second just on the hour mark before Pablo Sarabia (63rd and 70th minutes) and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting (87th) completed the rout.

“We played seriously and with humility,” said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel.

“We deserved to win, it was a good match for the team and the club and a good start to 2020.”

Tuchel was full of praise for Cavani who has been linked with a winter transfer move.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/star-struck-minnows-pay-big-penalty.html
191,07-1-20,Cristiano scores first Serie A hat-trick,"Cristiano Ronaldo scored his first Serie A hat-trick to lift Juventus top of Serie A with a 4-0 win over Cagliari on Monday as Zlatan Ibrahimovic made his debut for AC Milan in a goalless draw against Sampdoria.

Portugal forward Ronaldo struck for the fifth consecutive league game to move the champions back above Inter Milan in their first match since the Italian SuperCup defeat to Lazio in Saudi Arabia last month.

Maurizio Sarri’s side had been pegged back in the first half by the sixth-placed Sardinians who have been pushing for a spot in the Champions League places this season but fell to their third consecutive defeat.

The second-half was all one-way traffic with 34-year-old Ronaldo breaking the deadlock just after the interval.

He added a second from the penalty spot on 67 minutes with Argentina’s Gonzalo Higuain coming off the bench to strike a third on 81 minutes, before Ronaldo completed his hat-trick a minute later.

Juve are three points ahead of Inter in the table with Antonio Conte’s side travelling to Napoli, looking to keep pace with the eight-time reigning champions.

Atalanta closed to within a point of fourth-placed Roma, who lost 2-0 to Torino on Sunday, with a 5-0 rout of Parma, having also beaten AC Milan by the same scoreline before the winter break.

The side from Bergamo were already three goals up before the break thanks to Alejandro Gomez, Remo Freuler and Robin Gosens, with Josip Ilicic adding a double in a nine minute second-half spell.

Ibrahimovic returns

At the San Siro, Swedish star Ibrahimovic made his debut for Milan coming off the bench after 55 minutes against Sampdoria.

The 38-year-old came on for Poland striker Krzysztof Piatek to deafening applause from the 58,000 crowd in his first appearance after rejoining the club last week.

But there was little else to cheer for the hosts who extended their winless run to three games and remain 12th in the table.

New Fiorentina coach Giuseppe Iachini had to settle for a 1-1 draw against Bologna in his first game after taking over from Vincenzo Montella.

The Tuscany side had lead for most of the game after Marco Benassi volleyed in on 27 minutes but Riccardo Orsolini grabbed a point for Bologna deep into injury time.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/cristiano-scores-first-serie-a-hat-trick.html
192,07-1-20,Shikhar wants to be more impactful,"Plagued by injuries in 2019, opener Shikhar Dhawan is aiming for a fresh start in the new year and wants to become a “more impactful” batsman in his quest to help India lift the ICC T20 World Cup in Australia.

“Last year I had lots of injuries but that’s part and parcel of our work. It’s a new year and I am looking forward for a new start and it’s gonna go a long way,” Dhawan told bcci.Tv.

“This year looking I am forward to score lots of runs for the team and for myself and be a more impactful player, win matches for my team and win the World Cup,” he said, elaborating on his goal for 2020.

Dhawan, who is back in the Indian team for the three-match T20 series against Sri Lanka, believes the ongoing rubber is a great opportunity for him to be back among runs.

“I am really looking forward to this series. It’s a good opportunity for me to come and express myself and score big runs,” he said.

193,07-1-20,Klopp hails Minamino’s debut,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp described Takumi Minamino as “super and outstanding” after the Japanese international made his debut in the 1-0 FA Cup win over Everton on Sunday.

The 24-year-old Minamino, who signed for £7.25 million ($9.4 million) from Salzburg in Austria, was part of a much-changed Reds line-up at Anfield.

The 22-time international almost enjoyed a goal-scoring debut when he glanced a header wide of the mark before he was eventually replaced by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain after 70 minutes.

“Super, outstanding. Exactly the player we wanted, exactly the player we wished for,” said Klopp of his new forward.

“Your first game in a team you don’t know, if it’s a settled team it’s already difficult — this team we threw more or less on the pitch with two sessions together.

“And then showing this kind of game understanding, football skills are exceptional, attitude is outstanding, led the chasing pack so often in different situations, which I loved.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/klopp-hails-minamino---s-debut.html
194,07-1-20,SA start well in record chase,"Ben Stokes launched an astonishing assault which enabled England to give themselves plenty of time to push for victory, but the tourists had to work hard to take two South African wickets before the close on the fourth day of the second Test at Newlands on Monday.

Set to make a world record 438 to win, South Africa were 126 for two at the close. They used up 56 overs on Monday but will need to bat out another 90 today to prevent England from levelling the four-match series.

Opening batsman Pieter Malan, making his Test debut, scored 63 not out and shared half-century partnerships with Dean Elgar (34) and Zubayr Hamza, who was caught behind off James Anderson in the penultimate over of the day for 18.

Stokes slammed 72 off 47 balls to overshadow a maiden Test century by Dominic Sibley, who continued his sedate progress as he took his overnight score of 85 to 133 not out. He reached his hundred off 269 balls and faced 311 deliveries in his innings.

England’s batting on Monday was in dramatic contrast to their effort on Sunday when they ground their way to 218 for four off 79 overs. Sparked by Stokes they added another 157 runs off only 32 overs before declaring five overs after lunch on 391 for eight.

While Sibley continued to play the anchor role, Stokes went on the attack against every bowler he faced. He survived a chance on 38 when an attempted pull against Kagiso Rabada could not be held by a diving Quinton de Kock after the wicketkeeper ran about 35 metres in trying to take the catch.

Stokes was caught at long-on off left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj after an innings which included three sixes and seven fours and had a large English contingent in the crowd roaring their approval.

Ollie Pope fell quickly but Jos Buttler continued the attack, hitting 23 off 18 balls as the lead went beyond 400.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sa-start-well-in-record-chase.html
195,07-1-20,‘Ole plans taking shape at United’,"Pep Guardiola says Manchester United are starting to play the way Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants them to as he prepares for a blockbuster League Cup semi-final between the two sides.

City head to Old Trafford for the first leg of the last-four encounter today, having won the competition for the past two seasons.

Guardiola’s side are third in the Premier League, 13 points ahead of fifth-placed United, but lost 2-1 to their rivals last month as Solskjaer’s men produced an exhilarating display of counter-attacking football at the Etihad Stadium.

Asked what he had learned from that defeat, the Spaniard added: “How fast they are. How they run on the counter-attack. How solid, how aggressive.

“We conceded a few counter-attacks and in just two or three seconds they were in the box.”

Speaking about Solskjaer, he said: “I think he is starting to see his team like he wants. The last (league) game against Arsenal they lost, but you see clearly what he wants.

“It was not easy to handle a team at a big, big club, always demanding to be champions in all competitions, but I think every manager needs time.

“I have the feeling United have started to play the way he wants.”

With the Premier League title apparently heading to Anfield, Pep is forced to focus on the cup competitions after winning a domestic treble last year.

“A third semi-final in a row. It is not the best competition in the world but it is nice to be here again and against our city opponents,” said City boss.

196,07-1-20,‘Down with USA’: crowds in Iran mourn general killed by America,"A sea of black-clad Iranians on Monday mourned the top commander killed in last week’s US drone strike that inflamed tensions across the Middle East as NATO ambassadors met to discuss the spiralling crisis.

Iranians clutching anti-American signs and portraits of their hero Qasem Soleimani massed as supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei presided over the emotional service for the slain head of the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force.

The targeted killing of 62-year-old Soleimani ordered by US President Trump saw the Islamic republic vow “severe revenge” before Tehran also took a further step back from the already tattered 2015 nuclear accord with world powers.

In an escalating war of words that has heightened international concern and rattled financial markets, Trump threatened yet more “major retaliation” if Tehran hits back, including strikes on Iranian cultural sites.

197,07-1-20,"Sweat, blood and tears","At the 77th Golden Globes, winners seized their moment to speak their minds about current events, including the wildfires in Australia, rising tensions with Iran, women’s rights and the importance of LGBT trailblazers

The 77th Golden Globes were meant to be a coronation for Netflix. Instead, a pair of big-screen epics took top honours, as Sam Mendes’ technically dazzling World War I tale 1917 won best picture, drama, and Quentin Tarantino’s radiant Los Angeles fable Once Upon a Time in Hollywood won best film, comedy or musical. The wins for 1917 were a surprise, besting such favorites as Noah Baumbach’s Marriage Story, the leading nominee with six nods, and Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman. Both are acclaimed Netflix releases but collectively took home just one award, for Laura Dern’s supporting performance as a divorce attorney in Marriage Story. The Irishman was shut out. 1917 also won best director for Mendes. The film was made in sinuous long takes, giving the impression that the film unfolds in one lengthy shot. “I hope this means that people will turn up and see this on the big screen, the way it was intended,” said Mendes, whose film expands nationwide on Friday.

Though set around the 1969 Manson murders Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was classified a comedy and had an easier path to victory than the more competitive drama category. Brad Pitt won for best supporting actor, his first acting Globe since winning in 1996 for 12 Monkeys, padding his front-runner status for the Oscars. Tarantino also won best screenplay. “I wanted to bring my mom but I couldn’t because any woman I stand next to they say I am dating so it’d just be awkward,” Pitt said.

Ricky Gervais, hosting the NBC-telecast ceremony for the fifth time, began the evening with an expletive-laden plea against hypocrisy, telling winners to stick to thanking their agent and their god. Gervais opened the show by stating that Netflix had taken over Hollywood, given its commanding 34 nominations coming into the Globes. As it turned out, he was wrong. Netflix won only two awards: Dern’s win plus one for Olivia Colman’s performance in The Crown.

Michelle Williams was an exception, where the talk mostly avoided politics despite fears of war amid increasing tensions with Iran. The actress used her acceptance speech to speak out about the coming US election, the status of women and abortion rights. “I’m grateful for the acknowledgement of the choices I’ve made and also grateful to have lived at a moment in our society where choice exists, because as women and as girls things can happen to our bodies that are not our choice,” Williams said as she accepted the Golden Globe for best actress in a limited television series for her role on FX’s Fosse/Verdon. “I wouldn’t have been able to do this without employing a woman’s right to choose. To choose when to have my children and with whom,” Williams said. “When I felt supported and able to balance our lives, knowing as all mothers know that the scales must and will tilt towards our children.”

Best actor has been this year’s most competitive category, with nominees including Adam Driver (Marriage Story) and Antonio Banderas (Pain and Glory). But Joaquin Phoenix won for his loose-limbed performance in the divisive but hugely popular Joker. Phoenix gave a rambling speech that began with crediting the HFPA with the vegan meal served at the ceremony.

Tom Hanks, also a nominee for his supporting turn as Fred Rogers in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, received the Cecil B DeMille lifetime achievement award. The Carol Burnett Award, a similar honourary award given for television accomplishment, went to Ellen DeGeneres. She was movingly introduced by Kate McKinnon who said DeGeneres’ example guided her in her own coming out. “The only thing that made it less scary was seeing Ellen on TV,” said McKinnon. Hanks’ speech had its own emotional moment when he caught sight of his wife and four children at a table near the stage and choked up. “A man is blessed with the family’s sitting down front like that,” Hanks said.

Fleabag, Succession, Chernobyl win top Globes

Real-life stories ruled the Golden Globe TV honours, as Olivia Colman’s portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II, Michelle Williams’ turn as Broadway star Gwen Verdon and the nuclear disaster drama Chernobyl won top honours.

Fleabag, which dominated last fall’s Emmy Awards, was honoured as best comedy series and its star-creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge claimed the best actress award. She credited her co-star, Andrew Scott aka the show’s “Hot Priest,” for their much-lauded chemistry. Former President Barack Obama also got a shout out from Waller-Bridge for putting Fleabag on his 2019 best-of list. “As some of you may know, he’s always been on mine,” she said, playfully, referring curious viewers to season one of her series.

The broadcast networks, including Globes host NBC, didn’t have a chance: All of them were shut out of the nominations in an unprecedented sign of the small-screen’s shift to cable and streaming in attention and prestige. The growth in streaming platforms, including Apple and Disney Plus, is a dominant media story. But while streamers performed well at the Globes with Netflix’s The Crown and Amazon’s Fleabag they didn’t shut out cable contenders including FX’s Fosse/Verdon and HBO’s Succession.

Succession, about a media empire beset by family infighting, won the best drama series award. Brian Cox, who stars as the patriarch, was honoured as best actor. “I want to apologise to my fellow nominees for winning this. I’m sorry. I never thought this would ever happen to me,” the veteran actor said.

Well-wishes send to Australia from the stage

Australian communities battling wildfires were given several messages of support at the Golden Globes, with Ellen DeGeneres, Patricia Arquette and Australian-born Cate Blanchett among those sending best wishes. Russell Crowe couldn’t be there because he was helping fight the flames. The wildfires have so far scorched an area twice the size of the US state of Maryland. They have killed at least two dozen people and destroyed about 2,000 homes. Crowe’s statement read, “Make no mistake, the tragedy unfolding in Australia is climate change-based. We need to act based on science, move our global workforce to renewable energy and respect our planet for the unique and amazing place it is. That way, we all have a future.”

DeGeneres took time at the top of her speech accepting the Carol Burnett Award to honour those fighting the fires. Patricia Arquette mourned “the continent of Australia on fire.” Phoebe Waller-Bridge said she would auction off her Globe outfit and have the proceeds go to firefighter relief.

Blanchett said she wanted to give a special call-out to the volunteer firefighters fighting the blazes. “When one country faces a climate disaster, we all face a climate disaster,” she said. Pierce Brosnan said everyone was behind Australia: “Stay strong. We’re with you. God bless.”

Joaquin Phoenix said he appreciated the well-wishes but said, “We have to do more than that.” He said voting for change is fine, but sometimes people have to take matters into their own hands. He criticised those in the room for flying private planes to Palm Springs for the awards. “I’ll try to better and I hope you will, too.” he said.

The starry comments came despite an admonishment by host Ricky Gervais to the crowd to not talk about politics. “You’re in no position to lecture the public about anything,” Gervais declared at the top of the show. “You know nothing about the real world.”

Plenty of pink, puffy sleeves and shimmer

There were plenty of pink, puffy sleeves and a touch of neon on the Golden Globes red carpet as the stars shimmered and shined on one of the award season’s biggest nights for fashion.

Pink had a moment in soft hues for Kirsten Dunst (Rodarte) and Dakota Fanning. Isla Fisher and Tiffany Haddish went for bold hot pink, while Margot Robbie showed off a burst of encrusted colour in a strapless top with a white column skirt below by Chanel, her hair loose and beach wavy. Priyanka Chopra Jonas and her husband Nick Jonas made a stylish appearance at the red carpet. Dressed in a pink off-shoulder ensemble, Priyanka looked no less than any diva and it was her diamond neckpiece which grabbed the maximum attention. On the other hand, Nick look dapper in a black suit.

And then there was Jennifer Lopez, in Valentino Couture with a huge gold and emerald green bow at the bodice, her hair piled high in high braided bun and her jewels — all 145 carats of Colombian emeralds and 58 diamonds — courtesy of Harry Winston. The Lopez look included a voluminous white gown under that statement bow. While she toted plenty of fabric, Gwyneth Paltrow was travelling light in a bronze, two-piece Fendi look of sheers over sheers. Skin was exposed with a statement necklace thrown into the mix.

Reese Witherspoon (white Roland Mouret), Jennifer Anniston (black Dior) and Nicole Kidman were among the stars who went classic Hollywood. Charlize Theron took a risk that paid off with a draped sash on one shoulder in neon green and a black bustier underneath.

Chokers were abundant, from Theron to Cynthia Erivo, the latter wearing a huge blue stone at the center of her short necklace.

Jodie Comer, from Killing Eve, sported another fashion trend of the evening — puffy sleeves — in emerald green. Kidman represented for the reds in a strapless look with subtle draping and a short train. So did Scarlett Johansson in a longer train and bustle bow custom look in crimson from Vera Wang and Olivia Colman in custom raspberry from the Emilia Wickstead Collection (big sleeves, check).

Gugu Mbatha-Raw stunned in metallic golden yellow sequin dress from Gucci, her hair cropped, while Zoe Kravitz went for dots — smaller ones on top and large ones on the bottom of her dress, courtesy of Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello. Kravitz wasn’t the only star to reach for a pattern. Taylor Swift showed up in a power print from Etro. It was a custom look in navy silk jacquard with a floral design of huge blooms. Cate Blanchett went architectural in a Mary Katrantzou gown. Michelle Williams was dressed in Louis Vuitton, a custom look in soft orange with one dropped shoulder.

And the men? Andrew Scott, the “hot priest” from Fleabag, left his cream tuxedo jacket unbuttoned for interviews and wore a huge smile on his face during his first trip to the Globes, a dark curl falling over his forehead.

Billy Porter, the Pose nominee and fashion trailblazer, failed to disappoint in an epic long train in cream. It was adorned with white feathers and attached to a tuxedo jacket in the same hue. It’s a custom look by Alex Vinash and — bonus — the train zips off. “It is a dinner and I do have to sit down,” he smiled. Porter’s gear took three months to create, well before nominations were announced. “It’s really odd to have to work on clothes before you’re even nominated,” he said.

The gender-bending star and singer carried a mirrored bag by Emm Kuo, with a diamond dragon fly on one lapel by Tiffany & Co.

Fred Leighton had a big night, providing jewels for Meryl Streep, Aniston, Kidman, Dunst and Rooney Mara, to name a few. So did Harry Winston, who also adorned Helen Mirren ($4 million worth), and Joey King, along with a slew of others. King wore one of the evening’s most interesting looks: An optical swirl of black and white stripes. It was a short dress with a ruffly cape effect and a delicate high collar that continued the lines. The designer was Iris van Herpen Haute Couture.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sweat--blood-and-tears-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/sweat--blood-and-tears.html

Ranveer took to Instagram, where he shared a string of photographs of himself along with “legend” Kapil from the sets of 83.

“Happy Birthday, Legend! Thank you for showing us the way. You made us proud. Now it's our turn. @83thefilm,” Ranveer captioned the images.

In his cricketing journey, Kapil is among the first players in the history of the game to have taken more than 400 wickets and scored over 5,000 runs in Tests.

—Supriya Pilgaonkar

Actor Amy Jackson has urged everyone to donate for Australia which is currently experiencing widespread devastation owing to bushfires in the onset of summer. She has also requested everyone to focus on a vegetarian diet or at least consume less meat.

Amy took to Instagram and wrote, “Australia, we are with you Au. Dozens of people have lost their lives, thousands left without homes and over half a billion animals have died. It's so bad that there are fears of entire species of animals and plants being wiped out. This is a climate emergency and if this doesn't ring alarm bells I don't know what will.”

I’m semi-retired: Gwyneth

Oscar-winning star Gwyneth Paltrow says she is semi-retired from acting.

At the red carpet at the 77th Golden Globe Awards, Paltrow confessed that her lifestyle company, Goop, is now her top priority.

“I'm sort of semi-retired a bit from acting because I have a company to look at,” she said.

The actor, who stunned in a sheer rustic gown, also admitted that she had no intention of diving into another serious acting role like The Politician.

“But I'm married to the writer (Brad Falchuk), and he asked me to do the show. He said he was writing it for me,” she said.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trend-blazer-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/trend-blazer-trend-blazer-2020-01-07.html
199,07-1-20,Beware of the digital spy,"Installing voice-controlled devices at home means balancing privacy risks with the conveniences they offer. Here’s how to minimise their eavesdropping potential

Did someone invite a spy into your home over the holidays? Maybe, especially if a friend or family member gifted you a voice-controlled speaker or some other smart device.

It’s easy to forget but everything from internet-connected speakers with voice assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa to television sets with built-in Netflix can be always listening — and sometimes watching, too. As with almost all new technology, installing such devices means balancing privacy risks with the conveniences they offer.

A research firm estimates worldwide shipments of 815 million smart speakers, security cameras and other devices in 2019, up by 23 per cent from 2018. Many of the sales are for gifts.

You could sidestep the risks altogether by returning the devices right away. But if you decide to keep them — and the artificial intelligence behind them — there are a few things you can do to minimise their eavesdropping potential.

The speakers listen... and watch

Smart speakers such as Amazon’s Echo and Google Home let you check weather and appointments with simple voice commands. Fancier versions come with cameras and screens.

Many of these devices listen constantly for commands and connect to corporate servers to carry them out. Typically, they will ignore private chatter and transmit sound recordings only when you trigger the device such as by pressing a button or speaking a command phrase like “OK Google.” Some gadgets also have a mute button to disable the microphones completely.

But there’s no easy way for consumers to verify those safeguards. In one case, the Alexa assistant in an Echo device misheard background conversation as a command to send the chatter to an acquittance — and so it did.

One more catch: Voice commands sent over the internet are typically stored indefinitely and may include conversations in the background. They can be sought in lawsuits and investigations.

Reputable companies let you review and delete your voice history. Amazon now lets you request automatic deletions after three or 18 months but you need to set that up, and there’s no option to keep Amazon from saving your command history at all.

Until recently, tech companies allowed employees and contractors to review the voice interactions for quality control — and some of those details leaked. Following a backlash, many companies are at least making it clearer and easier to opt out of human review.

As for those screen models, many also have cameras for video chats. When you’re not using the device, consider turning it around to face the wall, especially in the bedroom and other private settings. Or stick a bandage or some tape over the camera. It shouldn’t be recording but why tempt fate?

Security with security video

Online security cameras let you check in on your pets or kids when you’re not home. Amazon’s Ring doorbell lets you check who’s at the door without getting up. Here’s the rub: If you can view video on an app, it’s possible that a skilled hacker can, too.

When you use the same password at multiple services, a hacker stealing your password from one place can try it on the camera service, too. So never reuse a password. When available, enable two-factor authentication, which requires you to enter a temporary code sent as a text to ensure it’s you.

Are smart locks really smart?

Smart locks let you unlock doors with an app so you can let guests in even when you’re not home. Burglars might try to hack the system, though it’s often easier for them to just break a window. As a precaution, disable any capabilities to unlock doors through a smart speaker voice command.

Though digital keys can be convenient for letting in guests and contractors, they can also leave a digital trail.

About those TVs

Many smart TVs and TV streaming devices come with mics for voice-activated playback controls and video search. That means having audio snippets transmitted over the internet. There’s a simple fix: Just don’t connect the TV to your Wi-Fi in the first place.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/beware-of-the-digital-spy-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/beware-of-the-digital-spy.html
200,07-1-20,In retrospect,"India’s economic woes cast a shadow of gloom over the art market last year, says Uma Nair

Over a decade ago, a national daily had given a headline to an article, “India’s art market blooming.” Cut to the beginning of 2020, the boom hasn’t lasted as the market has been deflating following the economic crises in the country.

Saffronart, Sotheby’s and Astaguru sales whimper

The three sales organised by Sotheby’s, Saffronart and AstaGuru produced unexpectedly poor results in 2019 as they failed to meet targets. Sotheby’s and Astaguru both had to deal with front cover works that bombed. It had nothing to do with the quality of the works because these were by India’s Progressives. While the Gaitonde at Sotheby’s was not such a classy affair, the Tyeb at Astaguru was a top of the line Rickshaw Puller that failed to meet the aspired price.

Bidding on the top lot, at Sotheby’s was a 60”x40” in abstract oil on canvas by VS Gaitonde, which stopped at a mere Rs 14 crore, well below the estimate of around Rs 21 crore. This, however, did not seem surprising because it paled in comparison to the successful Rs 26.9 crore sale, including buyer’s premium of a Gaitonde in the Saffronart Delhi auction in September.

Saffronart, too, the current market leader in South Asian modern and contemporary art, had its woes in their auction that closed on December 10, last year, with four of the top six lots failing to meet their reserve prices.

Leading the sale were two oil on canvas paintings by SH Raza, created a decade ago and depicting the evolution of the artist’s oeuvre. Paysage (1960) was sold for Rs 3.23 crore, exceeding its upper estimate. Auctioned for the very first time, the work is a fine example of the beginning of Raza’s unrestrained style that recalled both his French surroundings and Indian roots. Another painting by the artist, titled La Terre 3 (1970) sold for Rs 2.02 crore.

Saffronart’s auction total was Rs 12.66 crore with 72 per cent of the lot sold. In the art mart, clearly, traditional ways of buying and selling have fragmented considerably with options ranging from Instagram to boutique, high-end art advisers and direct artist links. While there are a lot of choices — art fairs, online auctions, exhibitions — buyers are getting pickier. The gap between good and great works keeps growing and collectors must ask if they would get the same or higher price for the works that they had bought earlier.

Christie’s: A lasting engagement

January 2020 opens on a promising note as Christie’s who have announced a single-owner auction, A Lasting Engagement: The Jane and Kito de Boer Collection, offering more than 150 works of Indian art from the prestigious collection of Jane and Kito de Boer. This is the largest and most important single-owner sale of South Asian modern and contemporary art that Christie’s has had in the last few years. A live auction, to be held on March 18, will be accompanied by an online sale, offering additional works from the collection between March 13-20.

A strong selection of highlights will be on view at Christie’s India representative office during Mumbai Gallery Weekend from January 9 to 12, and then will be exhibited at a preview at the Oberoi Hotel in New Delhi on January 31 and February 1, coinciding with the India Art Fair.

Speaking about their collection, Jane and Kito de Boer noted, “We purchased our first paintings on impulse. These were an emotional response, reflecting our excitement at the vibrancy and energy of India’s culture. Since then, collecting India’s art has become an obsession. It has come to shape our lives. Today our collection has over 1,000 works of Indian art. Far too many to display. The moment you run out of wall space and yet continue to acquire is the time to admit that obsession has turned to addiction.”

The collection, which started as a way for the duo to understand and engage with India, where they were based in the 1990s, represents one of the largest holdings of modern Indian art today in any private collection, comprising paintings, works on paper, photography and sculpture made in the country over the past 120 years. It has the strong representation of works from the Bengal School.

The first work in this impressive collection, Ganesh Pyne’s painting, Lady before the Pillar, was acquired 25 years ago, in 1993, when the de Boers relocated to New Delhi. It took the de Boers a couple of days to purchase the work as they were not familiar with Indian art or with collecting at the time. This moment — getting started — was the first of four collecting stages they identify in retrospect. The second — getting hooked — happened when they bought Rameshwar Broota’s large triptych Traces of a Man shortly after its execution in 1998. Until this moment, the duo had justifications and rational arguments for each purchase but not in this case, where they felt they had no choice but to buy the work. The next two stages go in tandem — getting confused and finding peace — in the effort to stay true to a collecting method, and not to please or to be influenced. In these final stages, the only reason to buy a work of art for someone is the personal connection to the work itself.

Unsurprisingly, the highlights of the auction include a suite of rare works by Ganesh Pyne dating from the 1950s to the 1990s and a range of works by Broota including the seminal 1982 painting, The Last Chapter. Additional highlights include early paintings by Akbar Padamsee and Maqbool Fida Husain, alongside a strong selection of works from the Bengal School and artists like Francis Newton Souza, A Ramachandran, Bikash Bhattacharjee and K Laxma Goud. Contemporary works in the auction include important early paintings by Anju Dodiya and Atul Dodiya as well as works by Anish Kapoor, Chittrovanu Mazumdar and Hema Upadhyay.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/in-retrospect-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/in-retrospect.html
201,07-1-20,Through a monochromatic lens,"Fine art photographer Amit Verma feels that black and white photography is the purest form of expression as it presents the soul of the image. By Team Viva

Isolated and wild landscape, unique wildlife, Buddhist monasteries, warm people — the journey to Spiti Valley will take you through all of this and also, unexplored roads. Life there is quiet and perhaps that’s why every moment has its own significance.

A visit to the valley will certainly leave you with a thousand pictures. And so was the case with fine art photographer Amit Verma. But what makes his photographs unusual is his monochrome love. He has captured all the pictures in black and white. “People ask me why I shoot without colour and I tell them, ‘I only see in monochrome.’ I don’t see in colour. I only see light and tones,” said he.

His solo exhibition Light and Lines in the Middle Land, a collection of 25 photographs was a monochrome journey through the valley. Shot in a single, 10-day trip, Verma’s images are a trifecta of the region’s wild beauty, a photographer’s control and the optics of the Leica M camera. Light and Lines is also a testament to the professional, digital photographic print.

Explaining the reason to name the exhibition such, Amit in an interview earlier had said, “You will see the drama of light in the landscapes. The drama which the light is throwing where I was, plus the lines and the contours of the landscape because I have captured these photographs in such a way that if there was a river, it also looks like a line reflecting the light.”

Though monochrome has its own charm and popularity but people usually people find beauty in colours. However contrary to this the photographer said, “Monochrome photography for me is the purest form of expression as it presents the soul of image.”

The photographer feels that such paintings have their charm intact as they are very subtle and nuanced. He recently said in an interview, “There is a fine nuance in black and white photography to capture light and present it in a very raw form. It makes the older generation nostalgic as they have seen monochrome prints throughout their life and also created a wonderland for the new generation.”

When it comes to the perspective of fine art, he believes that monochrome photography forces the viewer to imagine where the landscapes are.

For him it is very important to leave his legacy in the analog form. “I started printing on my own because I don’t want to leave my paintings behind as digital dust in hard drives,” said he.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/through-a-monochromatic-lens-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/through-a-monochromatic-lens.html
202,07-1-20,Immortalising the warriors,"Iraqi artists pay tribute to dead protesters with sculptures

The sculptures carved by seven art trainees were lined up outside a makeshift workshop in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square. With them were posters depicting protesters who have been killed in anti-government demonstrations in the past three months.

One sculpture showed a protester with a tear gas canister in his eye. Another showed a volunteer tuk-tuk driver next to his three-wheeled vehicle who was killed while evacuating wounded protesters during clashes. A third illustrated a protester’s hand flashing the victory sign and colored by the Iraqi flag.

For Iraqi artist Mahdi Qarnous, 53, the exhibition that was recently inaugurated in Baghdad’s central Tahrir Square — the epicentre of Iraq’s anti-government protest movement — is a personal contribution to the movement. It is aimed at immortalising fellow protesters killed and kidnapped during the demonstrations that have engulfed Iraq since October 1. It is also a way, he says, to allow young, talented Iraqis to channel their talents away from violence.

Iraq has been roiled by protests that have left at least 490 people dead, the vast majority of them demonstrators killed by security forces firing tear gas and live ammunition. The mass uprisings prompted the resignation of former Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi late last month.

Qarnous said he recruited seven uneducated and unemployed young protesters from Tahrir Square, put them through an intensive six-week course that he personally funded, and after three weeks, they were able to start their own art projects.

“We see this activity as part of the ongoing protests and a memorial monument for our martyrs and our abducted fellow protesters,” he said.

Tahrir Square has emerged as a focal point of the protests, with protesters camped out in tents. Dozens of people took part in the simple opening of the sculpture exhibition on a recent day. None of the art trainees who were presenting their work attended the event, however, and their names were withheld due to security concerns.

“The current regime produced a generation that is poor in producing and cherishing arts. You see here in this exhibition that our people have potential but lack the path,” said Qarnous.

Murtada Muthanna, 23, an artist and activist, said the exhibition is a message to the world.

“It says we are a people with inspiration for life, not death. Our revolution is peaceful and we are seeking reform, not destruction,” he said.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/immortalising-the-warriors-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/immortalising-the-warriors.html
203,07-1-20,Special chemical to blunt dew impact,"In an effort to counter the effects of dew, the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association (MPCA) has been spraying a special chemical on the outfield at the Holkar Stadium.

MPCA chief curator Samander Singh Chauhan said on Monday that to beat the effects of dew, a special chemical was being sprayed over the ground since the last three days. Besides, he said, the grass on the ground was also not being watered since the last three days to minimise the effects of dew.

“We sincerely hope the spectators will get to see fours and sixes raining in the match,” he said.

204,07-1-20,"Dhawan, Rahul battle for opener’s slot","A washed out series-opener means Shikhar Dhawan has one game less to make a statement in his quest to outperform an in-form K L Rahul, making the opener’s fortunes an interesting sub-plot of India’s second T20I against Sri Lanka at Holkar stadium today.

Dhawan, 34, is a proven performer in limited overs cricket but with age on Rahul’s side (27), time is running out for the easy-going Delhi-based cricketer to cement his place for the T20 World Cup later this year.

The left-hander’s strike rate in the shortest format has been an issue for a while and that is one thing he must address in the remaining two matches.

The fact that Dhawan is coming back from an injury, one of the many he suffered in 2019, makes his task all the more challenging.

In the year that went by, Dhawan managed 272 runs in 12 games at a strike rate of 110.

Rahul, on the other hand, has made the most of his opportunities at the top and was in scintillating form in the previous limited overs series (three ODIs and three T20s) against the West Indies, scoring a hundred and three fifties in six innings.

Skipper Virat Kohli has already stated that choosing between Dhawan and Rahul will be a tough call after Rohit, who is rested from the Sri Lanka series, returns to opening the innings.

Considering not a ball was bowled in Guwahati, it is unlikely that Kohli will make changes to the playing XI, having picked three specialist pacers and two spinners for the series-opener.

India are being experimental ahead of the World Cup in October-November but the management has so far not given an opportunity to Pandey and Samson, who are likely to sit out again.

Star pacer Jasprit Bumrah’s comeback after four months was highly anticipated in Guwahati but rain and subsequent wet outfield played spoilsport. He is certain to get game time today with clear weather predicted in Indore.

All-rounder Angelo Mathews, one of Sri Lanka’s most experienced players alongside skipper Lasith Malinga, did not find a place in the playing XI in Guwahati with the visitors also going for three specialist pacers and two spinners. It remains to be seen if Mathews makes the team today.

Sri Lanka, who have not won a bilateral series against India across formats for more than 10 years now, will have to produce a special performance to upstage the domineering hosts here.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dhawan--rahul-battle-for-opener---s-slot-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dhawan--rahul-battle-for-opener---s-slot.html
205,07-1-20,Serena-Wozniacki win 1st doubles match,"They’re friends, they’re former World No 1s in singles and on Monday they became doubles partners for the first time as Serena Williams and Caroline Wozniacki teamed to win a first round match at the ASB Classic in Auckland.

Williams and Wozniacki overwhelmed Japan’s Nao Hibino and Mikoto Ninomiya 6-2, 6-4 in a match which was both historic and poignant.

Serena hasn’t played doubles with anyone other than Venus since 2015 and last played a WTA tournament with anyone other than Venus in 2002.

Wozniacki hasn’t played doubles at all in the last three years.

But the pair have long harbored a desire to take the court as a doubles pairing and on Monday they took what may be their last opportunity to do so.

Wozniacki is playing the Auckland tournament for the sixth-straight year as a prelude to the Australian Open after which she will retire from competitive tennis.

Wozniacki and Williams will face each other one last time in an exhibition match in Copehagen in May which will be Wozniacki’s tennis farewell.

On Monday the pair formed a relaxed and intuitive combination, laughing and exchanging high-fives as they swept past Hibino and Ninomiya in 70 minutes.

Earlier, American teenager Coco Gauff beat Slovakia's Viktoria Kuzmova 6-3, 6-1 in 61 minutes to stay on course for a quarterfinal meeting with Williams.

206,07-1-20,Biggies maintain perfect record,"An ominous Rafael Nadal was in cruise control for Spain at the ATP Cup on Monday but Serbia’s Novak Djokovic was forced to sweat through brutal conditions for his second win in a row.

The Spanish world number one swept past Uruguay’s experienced Pablo Cuevas 6-2, 6-1 in just 73 minutes in Perth to ensure his country won their second consecutive tie at the inaugural 24-team event and moved closer to the quarter-finals.

He came on court after teammate and world number 10 Roberto Bautista Agut made short work of Franco Roncadelli 6-1, 6-2.

“A great match. I played better than the other day. It was a very positive victory against an opponent for who I have a lot of respect,” said 19-time Grand Slam winner Nadal. “I’m super happy.”

Djokovic was back to his dominant best against France’s Gael Monfils, but the sapping heat and humidity made the 6-3, 6-2 win harder than the score suggested.

“It was definitely one of the most humid conditions that I have ever had in my career. Tonight was brutal,” said the world number two, who extended his record over Monfils to 16-0, dating back 15 years.

“Obviously playing Gael, you know you are going to have a lot of exchanges, a lot of rallies. He is a great fighter and a great friend of mine. Tough luck today.”

Eight of the 24 nations will make the quarter-finals in Sydney from the round robin — six group winners and two best runners up.

Other winners on Monday included Japan, Croatia, South Africa and Austria.

World number four Dominic Thiem bounced back from a shock loss in his opening match to beat tenacious Diego Schwartzman in two tough sets to steer Austria to victory over Argentina.

The unbeaten Croats are sitting pretty, spearheaded by former US Open champion Marin Cilic who eased past Poland’s Kacper Zuk in straight sets — his second victory in a row.

One of the biggest surprises has been Japan, which has won both its ties — against Uruguay and Georgia — despite being without injured stars Kei Nishikori and Yasutaka Uchiyama, their third best player.

Yoshihito Nishioka has stepped up, beating world number 26 Nikoloz Basilashvili in straight sets in Perth after thrashing world number 45 Pablo Cuevas on Saturday.

207,07-1-20,Langer takes break as McDonald to lead Australia on India tour,"Australia coach Justin Langer is taking a break and will not travel to India, where his senior assistant Andrew McDonald will lead the side in the three-match series ODI series, starting January 14.

The 38-year-old McDonald will be in charge of the national men's side for the first time and Langer is confident the former medium pacer will excel in his new role.

""I said to him this morning, 'we're not reinventing the wheel'. He's got a really good opportunity,"" Langer was quoted as saying by Sydney Morning Herald.

""I'm so confident in our coaching staff now with the cricket side of things. A lot of the time now I think about the cricket 30 per cent of the time, the rest of the time all the other stuff that goes with it: the bigger picture, the cultural stuff,"" Langer added.

After completing a 3-0 home Test series sweep over New Zealand, Australia are slated to travel to India for a three match ODI series starting with match in Mumbai.

""He's an excellent coach, we've got other excellent coaches to back him up. I said to him I won't ring him, I'll let him go. He said 'I might ring you', that's the difference.

208,07-1-20,World Cup winner De Rossi retires from football,"Veteran former Italy international Daniele De Rossi announced his retirement from football on Monday, just six months after joining Argentine giants Boca Juniors.

De Rossi played only seven matches for the Buenos Aires outfit, scoring once, but said he needed to return home for family reasons.

""I need to go home. I'm leaving Boca and football,"" said the 36-year-old former Italy and Roma midfielder.

""I'm leaving a club that has entered my heart, this sport, my passion."" De Rossi, who suffered several injuries during his time in Argentina, insisted that he has ""no serious health problems"" but merely felt ""the need to be closer to my family, to my daughter. I miss them and they miss me"".

De Rossi spent 18 years at Roma before leaving the club at the end of last season.

He played 117 times for Italy from 2004-17 and won the World Cup in 2006.

""I'm going to continue working in football in Italy, I don't know in what role,"" he said.

""Here we're very far away, it's hard to connect with people (back home) on a day to day basis. I'm going to stay in Rome or cities close by."" When he left Roma last May, De Rossi said he wanted to continue playing.

Upon joining the Argentines he added: ""I couldn't end my career without playing for Boca."" De Rossi's signing was organized by his former Roma teammate Nicolas Burdisso, who was then the Boca sporting director.

But Burdisso has since been replaced by Boca legend Juan Roman Riquelme. De Rossi, though, insisted he had no problems with the new management.

He said his 14-year-old daughter was ""the only one who stayed in Italy and she needs her father to be close by.

209,07-1-20,Nothing tougher than playing India in India: Labuschagne,"Considered another Australian legend in making, young batsman Marnus Labuschagne is keen to test his skills against India, which he says is the toughest place to travel on a cricket assignment.

Labuschagne, 25, had a remarkable Test summer during which he scored four hundreds in five Tests, including a double century against New Zealand in the just-concluded third Test, which Australia won by 279 runs.

As the focus shifts from the red to white ball format, Labuchagne is gearing up for a tough test after being named in the Australian squad for the three-match series, starting January 14 in Mumbai.

""Whenever you play India, it's a tough series because they're a very tough opposition. They've got great batters and bowlers, so it's going to be a challenge,"" Labuschagne was quoted as saying by Cricket Australia website.

""But as a player you always want to test yourself against the best opposition in the toughest conditions, and there's nothing tougher than India in India.""

Just 14 Tests old, Labuschagne is likely to claim the third position on the ICC Test rankings, behind India's Virat Kohli and his compatriot Steve Smith.

He has already drawn comparisons with these modern-day greats but Labuschagne played down the plaudits.

""For people to speak like that is amazing, but there's a lot more work to be done before anything like that can be talked about,"" he said.

""Kane Williamson, Virat Kohli, Steve Smith - those guys have been doing it for five, six, seven years. To have one good summer doesn't make you a great player. So for me it's about trying to be consistent and trying to get Australia to win games.""

Labuschagne, who toured India with an Australia A side in 2018, said he would pick brains of his teammates who have travelled to that country for IPL and many international tours.

""If I get an opportunity that'd be great. Luckily I have a wealth of experience there with Aaron Finch, David Warner, Steve Smith … to continue to learn from those guys is great.""

Labuschagne said competing in Sydney where conditions favoured spinners was a good preparation before the India tour.

""It's probably good preparation coming from (playing on the SCG) going to India … that's probably the closest we have in Australia to spinning conditions. But with the format change, and the wickets will be different.

""I've got a lot of experience to lean on with guys who have played five, six, seven years of IPL and Test tours over there for Australia, so there's a lot to learn.""

210,07-1-20,"Kohli imitates Harbhajan's bowling action, fans thrilled","Known to be fun loving, India captain Virat Kohli was seen at his jovial best ahead of India's second T20I against Sri Lanka here as he imitated veteran off-spinner Harbhajan Singh's bowling style drawing loud cheers from the crowd.

Kohli was seen bowling like Harbhajan, with whom he had won the 2011 ODI World Cup, as Harbhajan also rolled his arms much to the delight of the other India players and the spectators.

After the first T20I got washed out without a ball being bowled in Guwahati due to rain and damp pitch, Kohli won the toss and elected to bowl first in the second T20 international.

The series will bring to the fore Shikhar Dhawan and Jasprit Bumrah who are making a comeback after nursing injuries.

The spotlight will be on Dhawan after KL Rahul scored a lot of runs in his absence while opening the batting with Rohit Sharma.

""There is healthy competition within the group. KL and Shikhar are brilliant players, vying for one spot. It's all about doing what's best for the team,"" Kohli said at the toss.

Dhawan has not been in form lately, especially in T20Is where he scored just 272 runs in 12 innings at a below-par strike rate of 110.56.

Rahul, meanwhile, scored 356 runs in 9 innings at an impressive strike rate of 142.40.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kohli-imitates-harbhajan-s-bowling-action--fans-thrilled-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kohli-imitates-harbhajan-s-bowling-action--fans-thrilled.html

World number six Sindhu had a dream run at the World Championships in Basel, winning the title last year, but she made early exits in the rest of the season, including her failure to defend the World Tour Finals crown in December.

With the Olympics less than seven months away, Sindhu will look to iron out the flaws and hit the right note when she begins her women’s singles campaign at the $ 400,000 event.

Sixth seed Sindhu will have an easy opponent in Russia’s Evgeniya Kosetskaya in the first round and the Indian will look to stay on course for an expected clash with world number 1 Chinese Taipei’s Tai Tzu Ying in the quarterfinals.

The other Indian women’s singles player, Saina Nehwal, who claimed the Indonesia Masters last year before slumping to a series of early exits in the rest of the year, will open against a qualifier at the Axiata Arena.

Kidambi Srikanth will start the new year with a clash against second seed Chou Tien Chen of Chinese Taipei.

B Sai Praneeth will open against Denmark’s Rasmus Gemke, while Sameer Verma, having endured a difficult 2019, will square off against Thailand’s Kantaphon Wangcharoen in the first round. Former world number six Parupalli Kashyap, who showed some sparks of his earlier self last year, will face top seed and world number one Kento Momota of Japan in the first round, while H S Prannoy, who was down with health issues for most part of last season, will meet Japan’s Kanta Tsuneyama.

Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty will open against local shuttlers Ong Yew Sin and Teo Ee Yi.

Ashwini Ponnappa will pair up with her women’s doubles partner N Sikki Reddy, to take on Korea’s Chang Ye Na and Kim Hye Rin.

However, Ashwini and Sikki will have a tough task at hand in mixed doubles.

The likes of Andrew Strauss, Rahul Dravid, Mahela Jayawardene and Shaun Pollock are also on cricket committee.

The proposal, which has been floated for the 2023-2031 cycle, has not gone down well with the greats of the game including Kohli, Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting.

The 26-year-old Spaniard beat Chinese youngster Wang Xinyu 3-6, 6-3, 6-0 and plays the American Shelby Rogers in round two in southern China.

The Shenzhen Open serves as build-up for the Australian Open at the end of the month.

It was the two-time Grand Slam winner Muguruza’s first match since an early exit at the China Open in late September.

“I think it was my first match in a long time and you cannot expect to play your best tennis,” said Muguruza, now 35th in the world.

Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka made a fast start to her season, blowing away Russian qualifier Margarita Gasparyan in just 71 minutes.

The off-spinner led the powerful Australian bowling attack to dismiss the Kiwis for 136 and seal another heavy win over the Black Caps after similar victories in Perth and Melbourne.

Australia have been unbeatable this season, winning all five Tests at home — two against Pakistan and three against New Zealand — after retaining the Ashes by drawing the series 2-2 in England.

“It’s been a great summer for the Australian Test side,” Lyon said.

“It’s pretty special to be part of it, we have been impressive, pretty clinical, the batters have done well and given us bowlers plenty of time.”

Australia declared their second innings at 217 for two with David Warner scoring an unbeaten century, leaving the Black Caps with a revised 416-run target in the fourth innings on a wearing Sydney Cricket Ground pitch.

But the Kiwis buckled under the pressure of Australia’s superior bowling attack with Mitchell Starc taking three for 25 to support the wiles of spinner Lyon.

“They were clinical in all areas and after the first match they put us under pressure session after session,” said skipper Kane Williamson, who missed the Test with a virus.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/standing-tall-down-under.html

Terrorists who attacked Mumbai on November 26, 2008 were also masked and the same was seen at JNU. Such elements need to be exposed, it said.

""Allowing blood stains in universities, colleges and beating up of students and indulging in politics over the burning situation...Such brutal politics was never seen before,"" the Marathi publication said while terming the attack on JNU students as a ""blot"" on the law and order situation.

Lashing out at Amit Shah, the Sena said he his in Delhi and busy distributing official pamphlets door-to-door to promote the Citizenship Amendment Act.

There is ""confusion and unrest"" in the country over the new citizenship law, it pointed out.

""The BJP wanted to see Hindu-Muslim riots over the issue, but that did not happen. The nationwide protests are not being done by Muslims alone. Hindus will also be affected due to the new Act,"" the Shiv Sena said.

It said the BJP has been cornered over the CAA issue.

Since the prevailing situationis ""BJP versus the rest"", hence ""out of revenge"", several things are happening, the Marathi daily said, adding that ""there is room for doubt if the JNU attack was part of the revenge.""

The BJP has condemned the violence and said universities should stay away from politics, it noted.

""Who brought violence and politics in universities in the last five years? Who is implementing the policy of destroying those who don't agree with your ideology by use of power?"" it asked.

Without taking any name, the Sena said those who call students opposing the CAA as anti-nationals, are themselves anti-national.

""When Amit Shah accuses Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi of inciting violence, he admits that the Gandhi siblings have that much power to create mass awareness against a law brought in by the Centre and bring people to streets,"" the Sena said.

One cannot say if the Gandhi siblings incited violence, but one thing is sure that the Union Home Minister and his party are forced to distribute pamphlets to ""clarify"" on the new citizenship law, it said in sarcastic comments.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sena-slams-modi-shah--says-such--brutal-politics--never-seen-before-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sena-slams-modi-shah--says-such--brutal-politics--never-seen-before.html

Satyendra Das, the chief priest of the makeshift Ram temple said that the contribution of Kalyan Singh towards the temple movement was immense and he should be included in the trust.

""Kalyan Singh sacrificed his chair (as chief minister) and even went to jail for a day after the demolition of the Babri mosque. He is a true Ram Bhakt and deserves the honour,"" he said.

It may be recalled that Kalyan Singh was chief minister of Uttar Pradesh when the Babri mosque was demolished on December 6, 1992. His government was dismissed hours after the demolition and Kalyan Singh was sent to jail for a day because he had given an undertaking to the court that he would protect the mosque.

Kalyan Singh later admitted that he had given orders that no firing should be done on the 'kar sevaks' in Ayodhya.

Vishwa Hindu Parishad spokesman Sharad Sharma also acknowledged Kalyan Singh's role during the demolition and said: ""Not a single Ram Bhakt was touched by the police and para-military personnel deployed in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992.

233,07-1-20,"""Free Kashmir"" placard holder apologises, bats for J&K peace","The woman behind the controversial ""Free Kashmir"" placard displayed at the protest rally at the Gateway of India here on Tuesday said she was just demanding lifting of restrictions in the new Union Territory and claimed her act has been ""blown out of proportion"".

The placard with ""Free Kashmir"" message, held aloft by a woman at the Gateway of India on Monday during the protest against the violence inside the JNU campus on Sunday night, had caught the attention of many.

As it snowballed into a controversy and triggered a war of words between ruling and opposition leaders, the woman, Mehak Prabhus, issued an apology, while Maharashtra government ordered a probe into her ""antecedents"".

""If by being naive in understanding the impact it would have and in the process create this stir, I apologise. I am an artist who believes in basic human compassion. Let power of love overcome hate,"" she said.

A large number of students, common citizens and activists had taken part in the protest rally at the Gateway of India in south Mumbai.

In a video statement, Prabhus, a resident of Mumbai, said through the poster she was just highlighting the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, which had been put under a slew of communication curbs post revocation of its special status by the Centre on August 5.

""In the last five months, the basic rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir have been taken away. If we say they are 'ours', then we should treat them accordingly. They should get the basic rights that we are getting,"" she said.

""They should have the freedom of expression, and with that thought, I had raised the poster,"" she said.

As soon as Prabhus's photo went viral on social media, BJP leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis objected to her ""Free Kashmir"" message.

In a late Monday night tweet, Fadnavis asked, ""How can we tolerate such separatist elements in Mumbai.""

Fadnavis sought to know what exactly was the protest for and if Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will tolerate this ""anti-India campaign"" right under his nose.

Maharashtra minister Jayant Patil accused Fadnavis of trying to confuse people by ""decoding words"" in a hateful manner.

""Devendraji, it's 'free kashmir' from all discriminations, bans on cellular networks and central control. I can't believe a responsible leader like you is trying to confuse people by decoding words in such a hatred way. Is it losing power or losing self control?"" Patil tweeted.

Expressing her anguish over the way the message has been received in some quarters, Prabhus said she was just stressing on peace.

""I was quietly standing. Actually, there were flowers in my hand. It was meant to be offering peace. Let's make peace together. That was my only intension in holding that placard,"" she said.

But it has been ""blown out of proportion"" completely, she added.

""And I do not understand why they are now calling me a member of some gang or some organisation and suggesting that I have been paid to stand there,"" Prabhus wondered.

Meanwhile, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said the antecedents of the woman are being probed.

Talking to reporters, he said the woman's background is being verified.

""If she is involved in any anti-national activity, action would be taken against her,"" Deshmukh said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-free-kashmir--placard-holder-apologises--bats-for-j-k-peace-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/-free-kashmir--placard-holder-apologises--bats-for-j-k-peace.html
234,07-1-20,Watch those headaches,"Almost 28,000 cases of brain tumour are reported in India annually. Dr Aditya Gupta tells you the risk factors and how to treat the disease

Brain tumour is the 10th leading cause of morbidity in India. The incidence of this deadly disease is rising and different kinds of tumours manifest at different age groups. As per the Globocan 2018 report, issued by the International Association of Cancer Registries (IARC) associated with the World Health Organisation (WHO), in India over 28,000 cases new brain tumour cases were reported annually. Around 24,000 patients lost their lives battling this neurological ailment.

A brain tumour is a collection, or mass of abnormal cells in the brain. These tumours can be cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous.

When a benign or malignant tumour grows, they cause immense pressure in the skull. This can lead to brain damage and it can be life-threatening.

What are signs and symptoms of it?

Symptoms and signs of brain tumour depend on the size and location of the tumour. Some tumours can directly affect by invading the brain tissue while some cause pressure on the surrounding brain. Major symptoms of brain tumour include:

Headaches (worsens in the morning).

Vomiting

Blurred vision or double vision

A change in the mental functioning

Seizures

Weakness of a limb or part of the face

Difficulty in physical movements

RISK FACTORS

Family history: As per the recent study, only five to 10 percent of cancers are genetically inherited, or hereditary. It’s a rare that brain tumour can be inherited but if you have family history of the disease then you should get health screenings and consult the doctor at regular intervals of time.

Age: Though the frequency of this disease is likely to affect people above the age of 55 years, but many such cases have also been seen in children in the age bracket of three years to 15 years of age, irrespective of the gender.

Exposure to radiations and chemicals: People who have been exposed to ionising radiations and chemicals have an elevated risk of developing brain tumour.

Types

Brain tumours are categorised as primary and secondary. A primary brain tumour is the one which originates in the brain. Many of them are benign. A secondary brain tumour is known as metastatic brain tumour. It occurs when the cancer cells spread to brain from the another organs such as lungs and breast.

Primary brain tumours: These tumours can originate in your brain and can develop from:

Brain cells

Nerve cells

The membranes that surrounds the brain

Glands

Primary brain tumours can be benign or cancerous. In adults, the most common types of brain tumours are gilomas (which develops from glial cells) and meningiomas (that develops on the membranes of brain and spinal cord).

Secondary brain tumours: These consists majority of the brain cancers. They start from the one part of the body and then spreads of metastasize to the brain.

The following can metastasize to the brain.

Lung cancer

Breast cancer

Kidney cancer

Skin cancer

These tumours are always malignant as benign tumours do not spread from one to another part of the body.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis of brain tumour begins with a physical exam and a look at the patient’s medical history. After the physical tests, the doctor will recommend for the further tests which include:

CT scan of the head: These scans helps the doctors get a more detailed scan of the body than X-rays. Using a special dye it helps them to view some structures like blood vessels more clearly.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): An MRI is different than CT Scan as it does involve any radiations and provides much more detailed pictures of the brain.

Angiography: This study involves a special dye which is injected in the artery. The dye travels to the arteries in the brain. It helps the doctors to see what the blood supply of tumour looks like.

Surgery shows the way

Endoscopic brain surgery is minimally invasive treatment procedure that allows neurosurgeons to find and treat the conditions that are deep within the brain.

During this surgical method, thin tubing that transmits the video images of the brain is inserted through one or two small incisions in the skull or through an opening in the body. This tube like instrument is called an endoscope which contains a small camera that allows the neurosurgeon to see the problem area of the brain.

The ultimate goal is to remove tumour without causing damage to healthy parts of the brain. It has revolutionised the treatment method as it provides crystal clear visualisation of tumour.

Early treatment can prevent complications that can occur as a tumour grows and puts pressure on the skull and brain tissue. If experiencing any symptoms then one should consult the doctor immediately.

235,07-1-20,It is in the genes,"Dr Sanchita Dubey is a Consultant, Obstetrics & Gynecology at Motherhood Hospital, Noida

A congenital disorder (CD), also known as a birth defect, congenital defect, is a health issue that occurs with the health of the baby while it is still in the womb. In India, congenital malformations and genetic disorders are the third most common cause of mortality in newborns in urban areas. As medical science is developing at a fast pace, treatments and follow-up care for defects have improved drastically over the past few decades.

The severity of the disorders varies depending on its nature. For example, in some cases, the condition may not manifest until much later in life, if ever, and at other times, the disorder is incompatible with life.

Many congenital conditions are genetic in nature. The risk of genetic problems gets higher in families with a history of the disorder, and it is also elevated in older parents, as they are more likely to pass down imperfectly duplicated chromosomes.

Types of congenital disorders:

Birth defects can be broken down into three different categories:

Chromosomal Birth Defects (CBD): Babies who have a problem with one or more of their chromosomes. Chromosomes contain genes, and genes help tell your body how to grow and work. When there is something wrong with your genes it can result in Down’s syndrome.

Biochemical Birth Defects (BBD): A form of defect that occurs when there is a problem with the baby’s body chemistry. BBDs prevent the body from properly breaking down food to create energy.

Anatomical Birth Defects (ABD): When a baby is born with a body part missing or malformed, it’s called Anatomical Birth Defect. The common types of ABDs are heart defects, cleft palate, clubfoot and congenital dislocated hip.

Causes

Congenital disorders are caused by genetic factors:

Chromosomal defects: Caused by too few or too many chromosomes, or problems in the structure of the chromosomes single gene defects — a mutation in one gene causes the defect.

Dominant inheritance: When one parent (who may or may not have the disease) passes along a single faulty gene.

Recessive inheritance: When both parents, who do not have the disease, pass along the gene for the disease to the child.

Treatment:

Gene therapy: In this therapy, the defective or missing gene is replaced. Gene therapy is generally used to help treat a rare group of diseases known as severe combined immunodeficiency disease.

Surgery: Is used to help repair anatomical congenital disorders such as severe heart defects.

Enzyme replacement therapy: When a gene is mutated and is unable to produce the gene product, an enzyme is missing or defective. One of the ways to treat this is to replace the enzyme that the gene is incapable of producing.

Prevention:

A woman can make many alterations in her lifestyle for lowering down the chances of having a child with a birth defect. Some of them include:",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/it-is-in--the-genes-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/it-is-in--the-genes.html

Sebum is secreted as a result of dry skin during winters. Excess sebum production can make the cells in skin to stick together. Which can lead to clogged pores and acne breakouts on the skin. Dehydration, sun exposure and windburn is very common which cause chapped skin, which has a severe impact on the healthy skin. In this season, skin around the nail often bear the brunt of cold weather and can be painful cuticles.

Here are few tips for healthy skin during winters:

There are some people who are allergic to food items like nuts, mushrooms and are lactose intolerant. However, many people who have never had any allergy in their life end up with rashes all over their bodies. Most doctors will tell you that allergies can be triggered due to anything; it can be a fruit you have consumed or could be a sandwich which one ate.

241,07-1-20,Masked marauders still at large,"Terror-stricken JNU students leave hostels as eerie feeling pervades campus

A day after the masked assailants attacked several students, including Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh, and faculty members with sticks and iron rods on the university campus on Sunday, no arrest was made by the Delhi Police till Monday night.

Even as the palpable sense of unease filled the campus after the unprecedented assault on students and faculty members, with allegations of unholy nexus among JNU administration, local police and hooligans, scores of students, including girls, preferred to leave their hostels till normalcy returns on the campus. Despite massive deployment of security personnel on the JNU campus and outside and authorities allowing entry of only students with valid ID cards, these measures did not assuage the concerns of students over their safety.

As the horrific first-person accounts of the violence that left 34 people injured emerged, the Delhi Police on Monday transferred the case to the Crime Branch, which claimed to have found “vital clues” about the masked attackers. They are sifting through CCTV footage to identify the rioters and have registered an FIR against unknown assailants.

The JNU administration, which had called in the police soon after the Sunday attack, on Monday appealed to the students to keep calm and has sent an initial report to the Human Resource Development Ministry which took stock of the situation.

The JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) on Monday took out a march from Sabarmati T-Point to the main gate of the campus to protest against the attack on students and demanded sacking of the Vice Chancellor.

Meanwhile Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday also spoke to Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and directed him to call representatives from JNU for discussion.

The Delhi Police has rejected the charge of reaching the JNU late, asserting that they responded to the Police Control Rooms (PCR) calls and law-and-order situation professionally to control the violence on the campus. According to Mandeep Singh Randhawa, the Deputy Commissioner of Police and PRO, the internal security of the JNU lies with the varsity administration.

“Police have responded to the PCR calls, and law-and-order situation professionally. A fact finding committee under Shalini Singh, Joint Commissioner of Police, Western range, has been formed and the committee will be looking after all aspects. The Crime Branch also visited the spot on Monday and they have collected vital clues. Police are also collecting CCTV footages and even the entry register at JNU gate is being checked to identify the miscreants behind the violence,” said Randhawa.

A total of 34 students and faculty member of JNU who sustained injuries on Sunday night clashes were discharged on Monday morning from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

A doctor said that four out of the 34 people, which included faculty and students of JNU, had minor head injuries, while other had abrasions, fracture and lacerations on the forehead among others.

The JNU Students’ Union President Aishe Ghosh, who was injured in violence on the campus, on Monday alleged it was an organised attack. “It was an organised attack. They were singling out people and attacking. There is a clear nexus of JNU security and vandals. They did not intervene to stop violence,” said Ghosh.

“The origin of present situation in JNU lies in some agitating students turning violent and obstructing academic activities of a large number of non-protesting students.

A day after the violence in JNU campus, a group of students at Panjab University disrupted the address of Haryana Speaker Gian Chand Gupta.

Carrying banners, the students belonging to some Left-leaning student bodies, shouted slogans against the BJP, RSS and the ABVP when the Haryana speaker was addressing a seminar at the Panjab University on Monday.

In Kolkata, students of Jadavpur University began their protest after midnight and chanted slogans against the violence at JNU. Students of the Jadavpur and the Presidency universities also took out rallies in Kolkata to protest the violence at JNU campus.

Violence broke out at JNU on Sunday night as masked men armed with sticks and rods attacked students and teachers and vandalised property on the campus, prompting the university administration to call in the police to control the situation.

Many JNU students were injured and admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here. JNU Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh suffered a head injury. All 34 students who were admitted to AIIMS trauma centre were discharged on Monday morning.

The Left-controlled JNUSU and the ABVP blamed each other for the violence that continued for nearly two hours on Monday evening.

Meanwhile, the Delhi Police on Monday registered a case against unidentified people for rioting and damage to property.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/national--foreign-varsities-rise-in-protest-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/national--foreign-varsities-rise-in-protest.html

245,07-1-20,"Delhi Assembly polls on Feb 8, results on Feb 11","The elections to the 70-member Delhi Assembly will take place on February 8 and results will be declared on February 11, the Election Commission announced on Monday. Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora said the notification for the polls will be issued on January 14 while the last date for the withdrawal of candidature will be January 24. With the issuance of the notification, the nomination process will commence.

Responding to a question on the law and order situation in the national Capital, the Chief Election Commissioner said, “I won’t say we (the Commission) are very sanguine, but we are hopeful that they (police) will be able to control the situation (and make it) conducive for polls. And in any case in the polling process, if there is some kind of an extra-ordinary situation, always (there) are provisions for kind of deferring the polls. All these provisions are there. The Constitution empowers ECI to take a call if needed.”

This time Delhi will have 13,659 polling stations as compared to 11,763 in 2014, a jump of 16.89 per cent, according to an EC press note.

Over 1.46 crore voters can exercise their franchise in the February 8 Assembly election.

The Commission has decided to extend the facility of postal ballot for “absentee voters”, people with disability and those above 80 years of age in all 70 Assembly constituencies.

In a separate Press conference earlier in the day, Delhi Chief Electoral Officer Ranbir Singh said there were no instructions regarding registration of refugees covered under the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the electoral roll this time.

He said that as compared to the final voters list in 2019, the number of voters in Delhi has increased by 9.96 lakh in the final roll of 2020 (up to January 1).

For Delhi elections, the Commission will deploy 33,600 ballot units, 18,200 control units and 20,600 paper trail machines.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/delhi-assembly-polls-on-feb-8--results-on-feb-11-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/delhi-assembly-polls-on-feb-8--results-on-feb-11.html
246,07-1-20,"Dev work, colony regularisation competing campaign agenda","With the Election Commission declaring the dates of Delhi Assembly elections, the die is cast for a humdinger of a poll. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Government led by Arvind Kejriwal is expecting to reap rich dividends on the basis of its performance and the works done in various fields, whereas its main political rival Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has come out with all guns blazing to corner Kejriwal.

The AAP and the BJP are locked in tussle on the issue of regularisation of 1,734 illegal colonies. BJP leaders are painting the town red with the posters and hoardings of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for having passed a Bill in Parliament to provide ownership rights to the people living in these colonies. Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri handed over registry papers to 20 persons.

The AAP has been quick to punch holes in the claims of the BJP Government. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and AAP leaders have targeted the Centre alleging that the BJP befooled the people of Delhi as the registry of properties in the “unauthorised colonies has not started yet.” The AAP claimed to have carried out developmental works in all the listed unauthorised colonies from laying sewer lines to building roads and other amenities.

AAP convener and its main face Kejriwal on Monday addressed the media and said the AAP will fight Delhi Assembly election on basis of its work. He appealed to the people of Delhi to “vote for us (AAP) only if you think we have done good work in the last five years”. The AAP’s poll campaign has listed its notable performances in the fields of education, health, transport, free power and water and women safety.

Reacting to Kejriwal’s statement, Union Home Minister and BJP president Amit Shah claimed that people of Delhi will defeat the AAP Government which has misled everyone for 5 years and the BJP will form a Government on the policies of Modi.

The Assembly elections in Delhi will be fought on the basis of performance, and not “lies and hollow talks”,

Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said on Monday after the EC announced the poll dates.

Shah said the people of Delhi are still looking for free Wi-Fi, 15 lakh CCTV cameras, new colleges and hospitals, as promised by the AAP Government.

Delhi BJP leaders said they will seek votes on the failures of the AAP Government as it did nothing for the first four years and blamed the Centre and the Lieutenant Governor for not letting them function.

“Having realised that time was running out, AAP Government started doling out freebies to divert peoples’ attention from the core issues of regularisation of unauthorized colonies. Kejriwal Government has been cheating the people in the name of free power-water, wi-fi etc. and when people raised questions to him then he tried to mislead them by making new announcements. This Government compelled the people to drink poisonous water and breathe toxic air but now the falsehood of Kejriwal has been exposed. Kejriwal and his Ministers also tried to instigate violence and vitiate the atmosphere but BJP did not allow them to succeed”, Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari said.

Delhi BJP Assembly poll in-charge Javadekar attacked AAP supremo and Kejriwal, saying his “lies” were exposed and people have seen his “real face”. “BJP will provide a Triple Engine Government by winning Assembly Elections in Delhi. After forming Government BJP will add new dimensions to development of Delhi because the tenure of Kejriwal Government will come to an end on February 11 next, that created obstruction in Delhi”.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/dev-work--colony-regularisation-competing-campaign-agenda.html

According to the survey, women take around 20.2 grams of added sugar in a day while men's intake of added sugar is 18.7 grams per day.

The other significant finding of the study was that the mean intake of added sugar among metro cities of India, measured in grams per day, was highest in Mumbai and least in Hyderabad.

Prof P K Seth, Chairman, ILSA-India said: “The survey shows population of Mumbai and Ahmedabad with their average intake level of added sugar at 26.3 grams and 25.9 grams per day has a much higher intake than their counterparts in Delhi (23.2 grams/ day), Bengaluru (19.3 grams day), Kolkata (17.1 grams per day) and Chennai (16.1 grams per day).”

The survey measured the intake of added sugar by age groups as well. In general, adults and elderly people were consuming slightly higher sugar than the younger ones. The highest intake of sugar was observed among older adults, 36-59 years age group was 20.5 grams per day, followed by elderly ( greater than 60 years) 20.3 grams per day.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/studycentre.html
249,07-1-20,SpaceX launches third batch of Starlink satellites,"SpaceX on Monday launched its third batch of 60 mini-satellites into orbit, part of its plans to build a giant constellation of thousands of spacecraft that will form a global broadband internet system.

A live broadcast by SpaceX showed a Falcon 9 rocket taking off without incident from Cape Canaveral, Florida at 9:19pm (0219 GMT Tuesday).

The satellites are set to release about one hour after takeoff, bringing the total number of satellites that are part of the US company's Starlink network to just under 180.

But that figure could one day total 42,000, resulting in far more crowded skies, which has raised concerns among astronomers that they may one day threaten our view of the cosmos.

To put that into context, there are currently around 2,100 active satellites orbiting our planet, according to the Satellite Industry Association.

The launch was broadcast live by SpaceX, a company created by tycoon Elon Musk, who is also chief executive of Tesla.

SpaceX's goal is to control a huge share of the future internet market from space. Several rivals have the same ambition, including London-based startup OneWeb and giant US retailer Amazon, whose Project Kuiper is far less advanced.

Musk hopes eventually to control three to five percent of the global internet market -- a share valued at $30 billion a year, or 10 times what SpaceX is earning from its space launches, and plough the profits back into rocket and spaceship development.

SpaceX's boss also entertains a long-time dream of colonizing Mars.

His California-based company has so far received US authorization to launch 12,000 satellites in several different orbits, and it has applied to launch as many as 30,000 more.

SpaceX says its satellite constellation will be operational for Canada and the northern US by next year.

Astronomers say the proliferation of the bright metallic satellites could seriously degrade the night view, interfering with both optical and radio astronomy.

But SpaceX argues it has taken steps to reduce the satellites' reflectivity and is testing an experimental darkening treatment on one of the satellites.

Laura Forczyk, a space analyst, said the measures' effectiveness was still uncertain.

""SpaceX has not yet eased the minds of astronomers concerned about the reflectivity of their Starlink satellites,"" she told AFP.

""The real test will be the days following launch when the smallsats are close together and in a lower altitude before ascending to their final orbit. Astronomers and stargazers will be able to compare the brightness of this current batch of smallsats compared to previous versions.""

Another criticism of more crowded skies is it will result in expensive collisions between satellites, potentially creating thousands of pieces of new space junk.

SpaceX says it has a plan for that, too: its Starlink satellites deploy at an altitude of 290 kilometers (180 miles) and then engage their ion thrusters to reach an orbit of 550 kilometers (340 miles).

At the end of their life-cycles, the satellites will use their propulsion systems to de-orbit over the course of a few months -- or if these fail, they will burn up naturally in the atmosphere in under five years, compared to the thousands of years required at higher altitudes.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/spacex-launches-third-batch-of-starlink-satellites-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/spacex-launches-third-batch-of-starlink-satellites.html
250,07-1-20,"Quake in west Indonesia causes minor damage, no injuries","A strong earthquake hit off the west Indonesian coast in the Indian Ocean on Tuesday, slightly damaging several buildings but causing no injuries, officials said.

The magnitude 6.2 quake was centered in the sea at a depth of 20 kilometers (12 miles) about 17 kilometers (10 miles) southwest of the town of Sinabang in Aceh province, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.

Rahmat Triyono, who heads the earthquake and tsunami center at Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency, said there was no risk of a tsunami from the quake.

National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said the quake caused cracks or broken windows in several buildings in Sinabang, but no injuries were reported.

Residents in parts of Aceh and neighboring North Sumatra province felt a moderate tremor for a few seconds, while people in the Aceh provincial capital of Banda Aceh did not feel the quake, Wibowo said.

Indonesia, home to more than 260 million people, is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions due to its location along the Pacific ""Ring of Fire.""

A powerful Indian Ocean quake and tsunami in 2004 killed a total of 230,000 people in a dozen countries, and Aceh province, which was closest to the earthquake, was hit first and hardest.

""I feel proud to see that we aren't scared to express ourselves... I think the fact that we are thinking about the country and its future.... Whatever may be our point of view, it's nice to see,"" Deepika told NDTV India on Monday night.

""I feel proud about it that people are coming out -- be it on the streets or wherever they are -- they are raising their voice and expressing themselves as it is important. If we want to see change in life and society, it is important that a point of view be put forward,"" she said.

""Chhapaak"", directed by Meghna Gulzar, releases countrywide on Friday.

Meghna, 46, said she can feel the pain of the people even though she is not well versed with the issues.

""Definitely there are thoughts. We live in the same society, so we will react. Unfortunately, we don't have full information as yet so making comments on the same is not our place. But there is pain, there is awareness. There is an uneasiness.

""I hope that the peaceful environment or equilibrium is restored. We don't know what's the solution or the way to go about it. Both people and situation are torn, hope it gets fixed soon,"" she said.

On Monday night, a slew of Bollywood celebrities such as directors Vishal Bhardwaj, Anurag Kashyap, Zoya Akhtar and actors Taapsee Pannu and Richa Chadha turned up at Carter Road in Mumbai in solidarity with those protesting against the violence at the JNU.

In a peaceful gathering of hundreds, the film fraternity was at the forefront with prominent personalities, including actors Swara Bhasker, Dia Mirza and Ali Fazal as well as Sudhir Mishra, Anubhav Sinha, Rahul Dholakia and Neeraj Ghaywan.

252,07-1-20,Iran designates US forces 'terrorists' for killing general,"Iran's parliament passed a bill on Tuesday designating all US forces ""terrorists"" over the killing of a top Iranian military commander in a US strike last week.

Qasem Soleimani, the popular head of the Revolutionary Guards' foreign operations arm, was killed in a US drone strike outside Baghdad airport on Friday, ratcheting up tensions between the arch-foes.

Under the newly adopted bill, all US forces and employees of the Pentagon and affiliated organisations, agents and commanders and those who ordered the ""martyrdom"" of Soleimani were designated as ""terrorists"".

""Any aid to these forces, including military, intelligence, financial, technical, service or logistical, will be considered as cooperation in a terrorist act,"" parliament said.

Lawmakers also voted to bolster by 200 million euros the coffers of the Quds Force -- the foreign operations arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards that was headed by Soleimani.

The bill was an amended version of a law adopted in April last year that declared the United States a ""state sponsor of terrorism"" and its forces in the region ""terror groups"".

253,07-1-20,Australia firefighters race to contain blazes as heatwave looms,"Firefighters raced to contain massive bushfires in southeastern Australia Tuesday, taking advantage of a brief drop in temperatures and some much-needed rainfall before another heatwave strikes later this week.

Exhausted volunteers cleared ground vegetation and carried out controlled burns before temperatures and winds were expected to pick up again by Friday. ""It really is about shoring up protection to limit the damage potential and the outbreak of the fires over the coming days,"" said New South Wales Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons.

He described current conditions as ""much more favourable"" but warned ""we are expecting hotter weather to return later in the week"".

Dozens of vast blazes continue to burn out of control across the east of the country and there are growing fears that two fires in New South Wales and Victoria could connect to form another uncontrollable megablaze.

Rainfall on Monday offered modest relief, but it was not heavy enough in most areas to extinguish the fires, and in some places it hampered firefighters' preparations by making back-burning more difficult.

Twenty-five people have died since the start of the disaster in September, more than 1,800 homes have been destroyed, and some eight million hectares (80,000 square kilometres) has burned, an area the size of Ireland or South Carolina.

Smoke from the fires has been spotted more than 12,000 kilometres (7,400 miles) away in Chile and Argentina, weather authorities in the South American countries said. The cost of the disaster is still not clear, but the Insurance Council of Australia said claims worth Aus$700 million ($485 million) had already been filed and the figure was expected to climb significantly.

The government has earmarked an initial Aus$2 billion ($1.4 billion) for a national recovery fund to help devastated communities.

The human toll was again laid bare Tuesday, as firefighters held a memorial in Sydney for 36-year-old colleague Andrew O'Dwyer who died battling blazes in late December.

Volunteers in bright orange fire suits lined the road as his cortege passed -- with the coffin draped in a Rural Fire Service flag.

Conditions in the next week are not expected to match the worst days of the crisis, but Fitzsimmons told public broadcaster ABC it was important not to ""get lulled into a false sense of security"". Many of the blazes are too big to be put out, so only sustained rainfall would end the crisis.

There were some faint signs Tuesday that a reprieve may be on the way, as a tropical cyclone formed off the northwest coast. ""It was nice to see a cyclone forming. I shouldn't say that -- hopefully no damage -- but it was nice to see a cyclone forming up the top end of (Western Australia),"" said Fitzsimmons.

""Hopefully (it is) a signal that we may see monsoon activity which will disrupt the dominant hot air mass continuing to influence so much of the weather."" In hard-hit communities residents took advantage of the respite to return home and utility firms said they were slowly reconnecting power.

But in the worst-hit areas, like the town of Cobargo, recovery will take much longer.

""There is extensive damage to the electricity network that supplies power from the zone substation to the residents of Cobargo,"" said Essential Energy. ""Helicopters are assisting local crews scope what repairs are needed. Extended outages are to be expected."" Meanwhile, police said they had arrested three people for alleged offences in bushfire areas as the authorities sought to crackdown on isolated incidents of looting.

""We are not living in South-Central LA, we are not living in Syria, we don't do this to each other. This is the south coast of NSW,"" emergency services commissioner David Elliott said.

Anyone, he said, who seeks to take ""advantage of their fellow citizens' disadvantage they should expect the full force of the law.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/australia-firefighters-race-to-contain-blazes-as-heatwave-looms-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/australia-firefighters-race-to-contain-blazes-as-heatwave-looms.html
254,07-1-20,Where is V-C Jagadesh Kumar?,"A day after the violence on the campus, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Vice Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar’s absence from a meeting with the team of the Ministry of Human Resource Department (HRD) raised questions about his whereabouts. Though, a statement was released by the V-C appealing students to maintain peace on the campus.

The JNU officials kept conveying that the V-C was on his way and will reach shortly for the meeting which lasted for almost two hours in the afternoon, sources in the HRD Ministry said. The Ministry met officials from the JNU administration and took stock of the situation on the campus following Sunday’s violence. The meeting was attended by the JNU Registrar, Proctor and other administration officials who briefed the Ministry officials on the sequence of events that took place on the campus and the measures taken to restore normalcy.

The HRD Ministry had called an urgent meeting over the violence that took place at JNU. The Ministry had on Sunday sought an immediate report from JNU Registrar Pramod Kumar.

Alleging that the V-C was unable to cope with the present situation, the JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) demanded his resignation on Monday.

“Where was our supreme authority, the V-C when this attack was happening? Where was he? Why no action was taken?,” asked former JNUTA president Sonajharia Minz.

Former JNU Chancellor and senior Congress leader Karan Singh on Monday slammed the V-C over the violence on campus, alleging that he had been “absent” at this crucial juncture and was completely ineffective.

“As a former Chancellor of the JNU, I have been shocked beyond belief at the violent and condemnable incidents that took place,” said Singh.

“The Vice Chancellor, regretfully, has been absent at this crucial juncture. He seems to be completely ineffective and surely needs to step out and deal with the crisis,” he said.

JNU Student Union president Aishe Ghosh, also accused the VC of incompetency and demanded that he should step down. The CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, a former JNUSU president, said, “the vice chancellor is also complicit in this attack. He must be sacked immediately.”

However, a statement was issued by VC Kumar urging students to maintain peace in the campus. In a statement issued on Monday Kumar stated that “Would like to appeal to all students to maintain peace. The University stands by all students to facilitate their pursuit of academic activities. We will ensure that their winter semester registration will take place without any hindrance. They need not fear about their process.”",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/where-is-v-c-jagadesh-kumar--2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/where-is-v-c-jagadesh-kumar-.html

256,07-1-20,Behavioural issues in kids makes them anti-social: Study,") Researcher have found that young children who exhibited less fear and desire for social connection and who engaged less frequently in a copycat behaviour called arbitrary imitation developed more callous-unemotional (CU) traits, which are known to lead to anti-social behaviour later.

A link between anti-social or aggressive behaviour and CU traits--characterised by lack of empathy, guilt, and reduced sensitivity to others' emotions--is already well known, according to the study published in the Journal of Child Psychology & Psychiatry.

This translates to a child who is ""less compassionate, doesn't care about breaking the rules, doesn't change a behaviour when they're told, 'If you do X, this bad thing will happen',"" said study researcher Rebecca Waller from University of Pennsylvania in the US.

""They're also more likely to be aggressive to get what they want because they don't fear the consequences,"" Waller added.

For the findings, the researchers used data from the Boston University Twin Project.

During two two-hour lab visits, at age 3 and again at age 5, children played out several scenarios, like offering a parent 'candy' from a canister that actually contained a stuffed snake, popping bubbles, or separating different-coloured beads into piles.

Analysis of the children's behaviours showed that less fearful children who cared less about social connections at the first visit were more likely to develop callous-unemotional traits by the second.

""Fearlessness on its own is not the only ingredient, these children also don't feel, to the same degree, that inherent motivation and reward from having positive social bonding with others,"" said Waller.

The researchers also found that harsh parenting--which includes tactics like yelling and spanking--intensified the fearlessness and strengthened the link with later CU traits.

According to the researchers, the study conducted with a different set of two- and three-year-old BU Twin Study participants, compared instrumental and arbitrary imitation.

""Arbitrary imitation is intended to build bonds, to show another person that you're in their group, that you accept their ways, that you can and will do what they're doing,"" said study researcher Nicholas Wagner from Boston University in the US.

For this work, the team built a pair of experiments. In the first, children had to free a stuffed bird from a hard-to-open cage.

An adult showed them how, interspersing necessary instruction with unneeded vocalisations like ""Look, it's a birdy!""

During a second task, children had to use a stick to liberate a cracker stuck in the middle of a clear tube. Again, an adult modelled the steps, mixing essential and arbitrary directions.

In both cases, researchers watched and coded which behaviours the children repeated and which they ignored.

They found that the two-year-olds who engaged in less arbitrary imitation overall--in other words, those who ignored more of the unneeded actions--were at greater risk for developing CU traits later.

""This says to us that these children are less motivated to make connections with other kids or adults. The same was not true for instrumental imitation,"" Wagner said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/behavioural-issues-in-kids-makes-them-anti-social--study-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/behavioural-issues-in-kids-makes-them-anti-social--study.html
257,07-1-20,Half of all women are given insufficient heart failure treatment: Study,"Nearly half of all women suffering from cardiac arrest are given insufficient treatment, since heart failure in them -- unlike in men -- is not caused by a heart attack, but by untreated high blood pressure, a new study reveals.

According to the study, published in Nature Medicine, only 50 per cent of the heart failure cases among women are caused by having a heart attack, which can be treated with modern methods.

However, the researchers, including those from the University of Bergen in Norway, said the cause for heart failure in the other 50 per cent of women is generally related to having untreated high blood pressure levels over time, leading to progressive stiffening of the heart.

There is no effective treatment for this kind of heart failure yet, the study noted.

""Men and women have different biologies and this results in different types of the same heart diseases. It is about time to recognise these differences,"" said study co-author Eva Gerdts from the University of Bergen.

As part of the study, the researchers compared common risk factors for heart disease, and how these affect men and women differently.

They focused on the sex differences in the effect of obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes.

One of the factors assessed by the researchers was the differential influence of obesity on heart failure between men and women.

They said according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 11 per cent of women and 15 per cent men are obese globally.

""If we see this from a life span perspective, we can see that obesity increases with age, and that this trend is greater for women than men. Obesity increases the risk of having high blood pressure by a factor of three. This, in turn, increases the risk of heart disease,"" Gerdts explained.

She said obesity also increases the risk of diabetes, with women facing a much higher relative risk of heart complications and death from the condition than men.

""We know that women with diabetes 2 are usually obese and some of this fat is stored in the heart, which makes it more vulnerable for disease,"" Gerdts said.

When it comes to heart disease, many of the differences between women and men are connected to the sex hormone, oestrogen, she explained.

According to the study, the hormone prevents the formation of connective tissue in the heart, which makes it harder for the organ to pump blood.

However, in men the effects are the opposite, the researchers noted.

""We see that obese men store oestrogen in their fat cells in the abdomen, which has a bad effect on the heart,"" Gerdts said.

After menopause, she added, women lose the oestrogen advantage.

During this phase, she said, women's arteries becomes stiffer and more vulnerable for disease.

""We think that this is part of the explanation for why high blood pressure seems to indicate higher risk of heart disease amongst women,"" the University of Bergen scientist said.

Additionally, Gerdts said, smoking is also a risk factor for women.

""Many women start smoking to reduce their appetite and to control their weight. However, this is not a good choice from a health perspective,"" she added.

""Heart disease remains among the most common cause of death and reduced quality of life in women. Medically speaking, we still do not know what the best treatment for heart- attack or -failure is in many women. It is an unacceptable situation,"" Gerdts said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/half-of-all-women-are-given-insufficient-heart-failure-treatment--study-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/half-of-all-women-are-given-insufficient-heart-failure-treatment--study.html
258,07-1-20,Nissan slams Ghosn's 'extremely regrettable' escape,"Japanese automaker Nissan on Tuesday slammed former chief Carlos Ghosn for jumping bail, calling his escape ""extremely regrettable"" and vowing continued legal action against him for ""various acts of misconduct"".

Ghosn, who faced trial on financial misconduct charges that he denies, fled Japan on December 29 for Lebanon, in an elaborate and apparently carefully planned escape.

His bail-jumping has prompted outrage from Japanese officials, but he insists that he would have been unable to receive a fair trial in Japan.

In a statement, Nissan said Ghosn's escape ""in violation of his bail conditions is an act that defies Japan's judicial system. Nissan finds it extremely regrettable"".

The firm said its ""robust, thorough internal investigation"" had ""incontrovertible evidence of various acts of misconduct by Ghosn"".

""The company will continue to take appropriate legal action to hold Ghosn accountable for the harm that his misconduct has caused to Nissan,"" it added.

Ghosn alleges the charges against him stem from a ""coup"" inside Nissan by disgruntled executives and local Japanese officials who feared his plans to more closely integrate the car giant with its alliance partner, French firm Renault.

Meanwhile, the Tokyo District Court confirmed on Tuesday it was keeping 1.5 billion yen (USD 14 million) in bail owing to his escape.

Ghosn was released on bail in April under conditions that included a ban on overseas travel and limited contact with his wife.

The 65-year-old tycoon is due to give a news conference in Beirut on Wednesday, where he has said he will provide details about the alleged ""coup"" against him.

Details are gradually emerging about his audacious flight from Japan to Beirut via Istanbul -- a dramatic final twist in a story that has gripped the business world since his initial out-of-the-blue arrest in November 2018.

According to Japanese media, he slipped out of his house in Tokyo, boarded a bullet train to Osaka and then a private jet to Istanbul, concealed in a large box.

A transport ministry official has told AFP that security checks on luggage are not necessary for private jet operators and the box was apparently two big for the X-ray machines at the airport.

Justice Minister Masako Mori told reporters on Tuesday that this loophole had now been closed.

""After Carlos Ghosn fled using illegal means, I have ordered controls to be reinforced. The transport minister has informed me that it is now compulsory to inspect significant luggage, including on corporate jets,"" added Mori.

This has been in place since Monday in Tokyo's main two airports Haneda and Narita, Kansai Airport (from where Ghosn's jet left) and Nagoya, she said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nissan-slams-ghosn-s--extremely-regrettable--escape-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/nissan-slams-ghosn-s--extremely-regrettable--escape.html
259,07-1-20,"'Never threaten Iran,' Iran president tells Trump","Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Monday warned his American counterpart Donald Trump to ""never threaten the Iranian nation"", after he issued a US strike list of 52 targets in the Islamic republic.

""Those who refer to the number 52 should also remember the number 290. #IR655 Never threaten the Iranian nation,"" he tweeted, referring to 290 lives lost in July 1988 when a US warship shot down passenger plane Iran Air 655 in the Gulf.

Trump warned Saturday that Washington had lined up 52 targets in Iran if it attacked American personnel or assets in retaliation for a US drone strike in Baghdad that killed Iran's top commander Qasem Soleimani.

He said 52 represented the number of Americans held hostage at the US embassy in Tehran for more than a year starting in late 1979.

Trump said some of these sites are ""at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.""

260,07-1-20,Harvey Weinstein indicted on new sex crimes charges in LA,"Harvey Weinstein has been indicted on new sex crime charges in Los Angeles, just as his trial on separate rape and sexual assault charges in New York was poised to get underway, prosecutors announced Monday.

The Hollywood mogul has been charged with raping one woman and sexually assaulting another in separate incidents over a two-day period in 2013, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a news release.

""We believe the evidence will show that the defendant used his power and influence to gain access to his victims and then commit violent crimes against them,"" Lacey said in a statement.

""I want to commend the victims who have come forward and bravely recounted what happened to them. It is my hope that all victims of sexual violence find strength and healing as they move forward.""

Weinstein allegedly raped a woman in a hotel room on February 18, 2013, after he pushed his way inside her room, prosecutors said. The next night, he allegedly sexually assaulted a woman in a Beverly Hills hotel suite.

Weinstein faces up to 28 years in state prison if he is convicted of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by use of force and sexual battery by restraint. His arraignment has not yet been scheduled and prosecutors will recommend USD 5 million bail.

The news came the same day that Weinstein and several of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct converged Monday at the New York City courthouse where a judge and his lawyers handled the final preparations for his high-stakes trial on charges of rape and assault.

Speaking at the New York courthouse Monday prior to the announcement, Weinstein's attorneys suggested they knew charges might be coming. They asked the judge for potential jurors to be sequestered partly because of the possibility that charges could be brought elsewhere against Weinstein while the trial was ongoing. The denied that request.

""There is a potential LA situation going on,"" his lawyer, Donna Rotunno, told reporters after the hearing.

""We don't know what is going to happen. We're hoping not,"" added another of his lawyers, Damon Cheronis. ""We have no control over what happens in Los Angeles or anywhere else.""

Earlier Monday, Weinstein, 67, entered the courthouse in New York leaning on a walker following a recent back surgery. When asked outside the courtroom how his back felt, Weinstein responded with a thin smile and a so-so gesture with his hand. ""Not so good,"" he said. ""Better.""

Inside, his lawyers and prosecutors spent the morning sparring about procedural matters, including how to keep publicity surrounding the trial from influencing the jury's thinking.

In a brief hearing, the judge declined to gag Weinstein's attorneys from speaking to the media — in addition to denying the motion to sequester jurors. The judge also turned down a defense request to call as a witness a police detective who had been accused of mishandling part of the case.

Across the street, actresses and other women who say they were sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein dismissed him as a villain undeserving of anyone's pity.

""He looked cowardly. He wouldn't look at us. He wouldn't make eye contact,"" said Sarah Ann Masse, a performer and writer who said Weinstein once sexually harassed her in his underwear during a job interview. ""This trial is a cultural reckoning regardless of its legal outcome,"" she said.

Jury selection in the trial will start Tuesday, more than two years since the allegations first came to widespread public attention and catalyzed the #MeToo movement.

Weinstein's lead lawyer, Donna Rotunno, said she was hopeful a fair jury could be found that wouldn't pre-judge the case. ""In this great country, you are innocent until proven guilty,” she told reporters outside the courthouse.

Weinstein faces allegations that he raped one woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and performed a forcible sex act on a woman, Mimi Haleyi, who had come to him seeking film work in 2006.

He has pleaded not guilty and says any sexual activity was consensual. If he's convicted of the most serious charges against him, two counts of predatory sexual assault, Weinstein faces a mandatory life sentence.

For that to happen, prosecutors must demonstrate Weinstein had a habit of violating women, beyond the two directly involved in the encounters in which he's charged. To that end, they plan to call actress Annabella Sciorra, who says Weinstein forced himself inside her Manhattan apartment in 1993 or 1994 and raped her after she starred in a film for his movie studio.

They also wanted jurors to hear from a few of the more than 75 women who have come forward publicly to accuse Weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to assault. The first allegations were brought to light by The New York Times and The New Yorker in October 2017.

Prosecutors got permission from the court to try to buttress their case with four other witnesses: Sciorra and three other accusers who haven't been named.

One of those women said she had an encounter with Weinstein at a Manhattan hotel in 2004. A second was to testify about an interaction with Weinstein at a SoHo apartment in 2005. A third was described in court papers as having had an incident with Weinstein at a hotel in Beverly Hills, California, in February 2013.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/harvey-weinstein-indicted-on-new-sex-crimes-charges-in-la-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/harvey-weinstein-indicted-on-new-sex-crimes-charges-in-la.html
261,07-1-20,"No decision on withdrawal of US troops from Iraq yet, says Defence Secretary Esper","The US has not taken any decision to withdraw American troops from Iraq, Defence Secretary Mark Esper has said, shortly after the US military in a letter to Iraqi officials said that the US forces would be relocating ""to prepare for onward movement"".

Some 5,000 US soldiers are deployed in Iraq as part of the international coalition against the IS terror group. The Iraqi Parliament on Sunday passed a resolution to terminate the agreement that allows for American troops in the country.

Iraq's move comes in response to the killing of Maj Gen Qasem Soleimani, the 62-year-old head of Iran's elite al-Quds force and the architect of its regional security apparatus, in a US drone attack in Baghdad on Friday.

The strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy chief of Iraq's powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force.

In a letter released on Monday, Marine Corps Brig Gen William H Seely said the US forces ""respect your sovereign decision to order our departure"".

Seely said the US-led coalition would ""be repositioning forces"" and the American troops would be relocating ""to prepare for onward movement"". ""In order to conduct this task, Coalition Forces are required to take certain measures to ensure that the movement out of Iraq is conducted in a safe and efficient manner,"" the letter stated.

However, shortly after the letter was released, Defence Secretary Esper said no decision has been taken yet to leave Iraq.

""There has been no decision whatsoever to leave Iraq. There's no decision to leave, nor did we issue any plans to leave or prepare to leave,"" he told reporters here on Monday.

The US remains committed to the campaign to defeat the Islamic State group in Iraq and the region, Esper said.

Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, during an off-camera briefing, told reporters that the letter incorrectly implies withdrawal and it was sent by ""mistake"".

""It (the letter) was a draft, it was a mistake, it was unsigned, it should not have been released,"" he said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-decision-on-withdrawal-of-us-troops-from-iraq-yet--says-defence-secretary-esper-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/no-decision-on-withdrawal-of-us-troops-from-iraq-yet--says-defence-secretary-esper.html
262,07-1-20,"IKEA to pay $46M in boy's dresser tipover death, lawyers say","IKEA has agreed to pay $46 million to the parents of a 2-year-old boy who died of injuries suffered when a 70-pound (32-kilogram) recalled dresser tipped over onto him, the family's lawyers said Monday.

Jozef Dudek, of Buena Park, California, died in 2017 of his injuries, and his parents sued the Swedish home furnishings company in a Philadelphia court in 2018.

In the lawsuit, the Dudeks accused IKEA of knowing that its Malm dressers posed a tip-over hazard and that they had injured or killed a number of children, but that the company had failed to warn consumers that the dressers shouldn't be used without being anchored to a wall. The dresser was recalled in 2016, according to the suit.

The settlement also requires IKEA to meet with the advocacy organization, Parents Against Tip-overs, and broaden its outreach to consumers about the recall of IKEA dressers, according to the Dudek's lawyers, Feldman Shepherd Wohlgelernter Tanner Weinstock Dodig.

The Dudek family will donate $1 million from the settlement to organizations that advocate for more rigorous stability testing for dressers, they said.

In a statement, IKEA said it offered its deepest condolences and is working to address “this very important home safety issue,” including offering consumer education and safety workshops and working to make safer products.

“While no settlement can alter the tragic events that brought us here, for the sake of the family and all involved, we're grateful that this litigation has reached a resolution,” it said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ikea-to-pay--46m-in-boy-s-dresser-tipover-death--lawyers-say-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/ikea-to-pay--46m-in-boy-s-dresser-tipover-death--lawyers-say.html

264,07-1-20,Indore T20I: All-round India make short work of Sri Lanka,"All-round India ticked all the boxes on Jasprit Bumrah and Shikhar Dhawan's return to international cricket and swept Sri Lanka aside by seven wickets to take 1-0 lead in the second T20 international at the Holkar Stadium here on Tuesday.

The first match in Guwahati was called off without a ball being bowled due to rain and damp pitch. Virat Kohli and his boys will now look to seal the series in the final match of the series in Pune on Friday.

Chasing a reasonable 143 for victory, Kohli (30 not out) smashed a six in the 18th over to seal the deal for the rampaging hosts with 15 balls to spare.

K.L. Rahul scored 45, Shreyas Iyer got 34 and the returning Shikhar Dhawan made 32 as India never really looked in any sort of trouble after their bowlers fired in unison to keep the Lankans in check.

The two openers, vying for the second opener's slot along with Rohit Sharma for the World T20 later this year, got India off to a solid start. Rahul looked good, hitting six fours before his ambition got the better of him as leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga cleaned him up with a delivery wide of the crease in the 10th over.

Dhawan followed suit soon, trapped in front by Hasaranga which was confirmed by a successful review after the umpire ruled the southpaw not out.

Shreyas Iyer, promoted to No. 3, and Virat Kohli then made short work of the remaining runs as the former took 17 off Hasaranga in the 16th over with the latter hitting Sri Lanka skipper Lasith Malinga for 16 in the next over.

Iyer was caught by Dasun Shanaka at square-leg off Lahiru Kumara, but it was all over for Sri Lanka by then as Kohli whipped a six over long leg off Kumara to win it in style with Rishabh Pant (1 not out) at the other end.

Earlier, the bowlers put up a good show with Navdeep Saini shining bright as India restricted Sri Lanka to 142/9. All eyes were on the returning Bumrah after India captain Virat Kohli decided to field first.

Bumrah, who has been out of action after India's tour of the West Indies in July-August last year due to a stress fracture on his back, started off with a wide in the first ball of the match and was hit for a four in the second as he finished conceding seven runs.

Danushka Gunathilaka and Avishka Fernando hit boundaries off him in the fourth over as India's premier pacer looked a bit rusty starting off, but in the end bowled a superbly disguised slower to castle Dasun Shanaka in the 17th over.

Bumrah was taken for 12 in the final over by Wanindu Hasaranga (16 not out) who hit a hat-trick of fours to end the innings with a flourish as the fast bowler returned figures of 1/31 in his four overs.

Shardul Thakur (3/23) was the pick of the bowlers for the hosts but it was Saini (2/18) who impressed the most while Kuldeep Yadav (2/38) also picked up two wickets.

For the Lankans, Kusal Perera top-scored with a 28-ball 34 (6x3).

The Sri Lanka openers looked good against India's pace trio of Bumrah, Shardul and Saini before Kohli went to Washington Sundar (1/29) and the spinner did the trick as Fernando (22) hit straight to mid-off where Saini took a simple catch.

Sri Lanka raced to 48/1 after six overs but just as Gunathilaka was looking good, thumping Shardul Thakur for a four down mid-off in the sixth over, a Navdeep Saini thunderbolt at 147.5 kph beat him all ends up to rattle the stumps. He was gone for 20.

In-form Perera welcomed Kuldeep with a six over deep midwicket in the 12th over. But the chinaman, who recently became the first Indian to take two hat-tricks in international cricket, had the last laugh as he got Oshada Fernando (10) stumped in the third ball of the same over.

Perera reverse pulled Kuldeep for a six in the first ball of the 14th over as Sri Lanka looked to up the ante. But in the very next delivery Kuldeep once again emerged victorious as the batsman holed out to Shikhar Dhawan at long-on while trying to clear the boundary.

Bhanuka Rajapaksa (9) was caught behind off Saini whose searing pace caused the batters a lot of trouble as Sri Lanka reached 104/5 after 15 overs.

In the last five overs, the visitors managed just 34 runs, losing four wickets as Shardul picked up three in quick succession.

Brief scores: Sri Lanka 142/9 in 20 overs (Kusal Perera 34; Shardul Thakur 3/23) India 144/3 in 17.3 overs (K.L. Rahul 45; Wanindu Hasaranga 2/30)",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/indore-t20i--all-round-india-make-short-work-of-sri-lanka-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/indore-t20i--all-round-india-make-short-work-of-sri-lanka.html

271,07-1-20,Indian bowlers fire in unison to restrict SL to 142,"The Indian bowlers fired in unison on Jasprit Bumrah's return to international cricket with Navdeep Saini shining bright as they restricted Sri Lanka to 142/9 in the second T20 international at the Holkar Stadium here on Tuesday.

All eyes were on the returning Bumrah after India captain Virat Kohli decided to field first after his counterpart Lasith Malinga called wrong at the toss.

Bumrah, who has been out of action after India's tour of the West Indies in July-August due to a stress fracture on his back, started off with a wide in the first ball of the match and was hit for a four in the second as he finished conceding seven runs.

Danushka Gunathilaka and Avishka Fernando hit boundaries off him in the fourth over as India's premier pacer looked a bit rusty starting off but in the end bowled a superbly disguised slower one to castle Dasun Shanaka in the 17th over.

Bumrah was taken for 12 in the final over by Wanindu Hasaranga (16 not out) who hit a hat-trick of fours to end the innings with a flourish as the fast bowler returned figures of 1/31 in his four overs.

Shardul Thakur (3/23) was the pick of the bowlers for the hosts but it was Saini (2/18) who impressed the most as Kuldeep Yadav (2/38) also picked up two wickets.

For the Lankans, Kusal Perera top-scored with a 28-ball 34 (3x6).

The Sri Lanka openers looked good against India's pace trio of Bumrah, Shardul and Saini before Kohli went to Washington Sundar (1/29) and the spinner did the trick as Fernando (22) hit straight to mid off where Saini took a simple catch.

Sri Lanka raced to 48/1 after six overs but just as Gunathilaka was looking good as he thumped Shardul Thakur for a four down mid off in the sixth over, a Navdeep Saini thunderbolt at 147.5 kph beat him all ends up to rattle the stumps. He was gone for 20.

In-form Perera welcomed Kuldeep with a six over deep midwicket in the 12th over. But the chinaman bowler, who recently became the first Indian to take two hat-tricks in international cricket, had the last laugh as he got Oshada Fernando (10) stumped in the third ball of the same over.

Perera reverse pulled Kuldeep for a six in the first ball of the 14th over as Sri Lanka looked to up the ante, but in the very next delivery Kuldeep once again emerged victorious as the batsman holed out to Shikhar Dhawan at long on trying to clear the boundary.

Bhanuka Rajapaksa (9) was caught behind off Saini whose searing pace caused the batters a lot of trouble as Sri Lanka reached 104/5 after 15 overs.

In the last five overs, the visitors managed just 34 runs, losing four wickets as Shardul picked up three in quick succession.

Brief scores: Sri Lanka 142/9 in 20 overs (Kusal Perera 34; Shardul Thakur 3/23) vs India",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/indian-bowlers-fire-in-unison-to-restrict-sl-to-142-9-2020-01-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/indian-bowlers-fire-in-unison-to-restrict-sl-to-142-9.html
