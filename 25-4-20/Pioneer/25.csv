0,25-4-20,Post-pandemic sport,"Cricket and other sports are working on how to reduce contact. Soon, spectator-less sport may become a reality

The German football league, the Bundesliga, is mulling to restart matches on May 9, albeit behind closed doors. The American National Football League (for American “Football”) is planning to conduct its annual draft online for the first time. Cricket bosses, too, are actually discussing a point that was brought up by former Australian fast bowler Jason Gillespie regarding shining a ball. Legendary cricketer Sachin Tendulkar himself made it clear that he revelled in the full-throated chants that accompanied his stay at the crease and that this is one reason why the very idea of sport inside an empty stadium is disappointing. Without any actual games taking place on the ground, the world of tennis has been rocked with the likes of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal promoting a combined men’s and women’s global tennis body. Other sports, too, have taken time during the lockdown to contemplate their future. While by their very nature, racquet sports are socially distanced, possibly with the exception of squash, sports such as football are having serious debate about their future.

And then there is that small issue about spectators. Modern sports is all about having tens of thousands of fans in the stadium. The fans bring with them not only substantial gate revenues but also add atmosphere and colour to the match.This is why “home” games are considered such an advantage for the host team, with the crowd often playing the role of the twelfth man. Indeed, sports associations often punish teams for infringements such as racial abuse by forcing them to play games behind closed doors, thus depriving them of both revenue and support. But now, in a post-COVID world, all games will, perhaps, be played behind closed doors or maybe with very few fans being allowed. It is almost impossible to predict how that will impact the psychology of the athletes. Test cricketers might be used to playing in front of empty stadia but how will Team India cope playing a one-dayer at an empty Eden Gardens? Or for that matter, how will teams like Manchester United and Arsenal play with an empty stadium? These cathedrals of sport, like real religious sites, are huge and organised. They could become a vector of this viral outbreak just like organised religion. It may be months before large audiences are allowed at these venues again. And even though games can be played behind closed doors, officials will have to find a way to ensure players are kept extra safe, particularly for contact sports. It would be interesting to see if the Bundesliga experiment goes ahead and what will come out of that. This might determine if organised sports can restart across the world.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/post-pandemic-sport-2020-04-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/post-pandemic-sport.html
1,25-4-20,Congress demands power bill waiver,"While Uttar Pradesh Congress demanded waiver of power bills for three months due to lockdown, party’s national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra lauded those helping out people in distress and providing relief to them.

On Friday, Priyanka hailed an elderly woman, Kamla Saini of Muzaffarnagar, for contributing her pension to fight coronavirus pandemic.

In a letter to Saini, who lives in an old age home on Nadi Road in Muzaffarnagar, Priyanka praised her efforts in helping the nation fight the coronavirus pandemic.

Terming Kamla Saini a true patriot, Priyanka said the example she set before the country by donating her saving of Rs 21,000 in PM CARES fund for coronavirus care was not just appreciable but would motivate others to follow her.

“During coronavirus pandemic, we all are proud of the rare gesture shown by you by donating your saving from pension. Helping out people in distress is true patriotism. It increases my respect for you. I learnt that you are living in an old age home, the country will never you forget for your love and affection,” Priyanka mentioned in her letter which was handed over to an emotional Saini by former Congress MP Harendra Malik on Friday.

Earlier on Thursday, Priyanka hailed the efforts of students of Ambedkar Hostel in Gorakhpur for running a community kitchen to feed the poor and needy. She also praised similar efforts by a physically challenged girl in Prayagraj, who has been serving the needy with her small savings.

Meanwhile in Lucknow, UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu demanded that power bills be waived for three months as a large section of the people did not have income or salaries due to lockdown.

In a letter to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Lallu said that people were facing economic crisis and it would be difficult for them to pay their electricity bills.

“Hence the government should waive power bills or at least give people 200 units free every month till normalcy is restored,” Lallu wrote in the letter.

Earlier, traders associations made similar demands claiming that they were forced to pay power bills even when their establishments were lying closed for over a month now.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/congress-demands-power-bill-waiver.html
2,25-4-20,People badly hit by lockdown: Akhilesh,"Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said that the daily lives of people had been badly affected due to the ongoing lockdown while various promises of the Central and UP governments were not working at the ground level.

“The poor are facing a grave crisis of food and livelihood. Health facilities are in a shambles. In such a situation, it is obvious that questions will be raised on the claims of relief measures provided by the government,” Akhilesh said on Friday.

On migrant labourers from other states, the SP chief said that a large number of people had returned to Uttar Pradesh and were facing various issues and several among them had become ill.

“There is neither any well-planned arrangement for their treatment nor are they being checked for the coronavirus,” he said.

“The myopic policies adopted by the Yogi Adityanath government is no solution of the problem. Instead, it is going to further aggravate the problem. The government claims of providing livelihood to people through MGNREGA and other means are not reaching the intended beneficiaries,” he alleged.

Akhilesh claimed that industries had been shut down in the state, including in the VVIP district Gorakhpur, due to lockdown.

“Daily wagers are the worst affected as they have not received any relief. Besides, there are complaints of poor quality food grains being distributed through the public distribution system (PDS) shops,” he charged.

“Farmers have not been getting anything but indifference and insult from the BJP regime. Wheat purchase centres are working only on paper. Neither farmers are getting minimum support price, nor is there any hope in future. As a result, they are forced to opt for distress sale of crops. Cane growers have not received long-pending dues yet. Compensation for losses to crops due to unseasonal rains and hailstorms have also not been paid yet,” he said.

Akhilesh further said, “Apart from the dangers of coronavirus, numerous people have serious ailments like heart, kidney, cancer, liver diseases among others. Blood pressure and diabetes patients are also perturbed these days. OPDs are closed in hospitals, surgeries have been postponed. People are not getting medicines and treatment on time.”

The SP chief also said, “While the prime minister merely addresses on Panchayati Raj Diwas, we will have to take a pledge to make villages resource-rich if India has to emerge as a strong nation. The BJP dreams of a ‘vibrant India’ through big industries rather than developing villages or improving the economy of farmers.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/people-badly-hit-by-lockdown--akhilesh.html
3,25-4-20,PM lauds Basti’s woman pradhan,"

A village in Basti has suddenly hogged into limelight due to the steps being taken by a woman gram pradhan in containing the spread of coronavirus. Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself acknowledged the effort of the village head.

On Friday, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacted with heads of gram panchayats and sarpanchs of the country, he also spoke to head of Nakti Dei Bujurg gram panchayat in Basti, Varsha Singh, and after being informed of the steps initiated there and praised her.

The prime minister said that earlier people used to say that if one rupee was sent from Delhi, only 15 paise reached the village. “But today, when one rupee is released, the entire amount is deposited in beneficiary’s account,” he said.

Modi asked Varsha Singh how the villagers felt now and she replied that the residents were satisfied and said that they were getting all facilities since the Bharatiya Janata Party government came to office.

Varsha Singh has been actively working to deal with spread of coronavirus in the village in Kaptanganj development block of Basti. Working on the formula of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, she has ensured sanitisation of the village thrice and provided masks, soaps and sanitisers to every household.

Poor and nomadic families, who did not have ration cards, were also provided ration. Besides providing ration to very poor families, essentials and vegetables were also arranged for them. In addition, eligible women beneficiaries of Ujjwala Scheme, Labour department, PM Kisan Samman Nidhi and Jan Dhan Yojana were provided help by Singh.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pm-lauds-basti---s-woman-pradhan.html
4,25-4-20,Sunni Waqf Board to toe guidelines on coronavirus,"



|

Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board said that it would strictly comply with government guidelines for battling COVID-19 like lockdown and social distancing during Ramzan.

This decision was taken by the Sunni Waqf Board after Union Minister for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi directed mutawallis and management of waqfs through video conferencing on Friday to ensure compliance with lockdown and social distancing during Ramzan.

In a statement issued on Friday, the Sunni Waqf Board said that it was the foremost duty of Muslims, especially mutawallis and management of waqfs, not to allow gatherings in any institution for sehri or aftari, taraweeh and other prayers. It also advised them to ask people to perform prayers at homes and motivate others to comply with government directions.

“It is our joint responsibility to carry out and comply with orders of the Union and state governments. If any mutawalli fails to discharge his duties, then he would be accountable for the lapse,” said Sunni Central Waqf Board Chief Executive Officer Syed Mohammad Shoeb.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sunni-waqf-board-to-toe-guidelines-on-coronavirus.html
5,25-4-20,Yogi to bring back stranded workers from other states,"



|

After ensuring the return of stranded students of UP from Kota in Rajasthan, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath directed officials to prepare a roadmap to bring back migrant workers of the state who were stranded in other states and had completed 14-day quarantine.

“Those UP labourers who have completed 14-day quarantine in other states will be brought back in a phased manner and officers should prepare an action plan for it,” Yogi said while addressing a review meeting at his official residence in Lucknow on Friday.

The chief minister said that a list would be furnished with all details of labourers followed by screening and testing by states concerned to send them to UP border from where they would be sent to their respective districts by bus.

“The nodal officers for different states should prepare a list of people who want to return to UP and start making arrangements for their return. Shelter homes should be sanitised and community kitchens set up their for quarantined labourers of other states. Nodal officers should contact respective states and migrant workers who want to return,” the chief minister told officials .

Yogi said that adequate number of shelter homes and centres should be readied for 14-day quarantine of migrants. “After quarantine, they would be sent to their homes with a ration kit and Rs 1,000 as sustenance allowance,” he said.

Last week, 10,500 UP students taking up coaching in Kota (Rajasthan) were brought back to the state on the initiative of the chief minister and for this around 300 buses were put into service. Later, the students were asked to quarantine themselves in their homes for the next 14 days.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/yogi-to-bring-back-stranded-workers-from-other-states.html
6,25-4-20,Group clash over gambling leaves a dozen hurt,"



|

Objecting to urchins gambling in public led to a group clash that left at least 12 persons injured in Rampur over the last two days.

The police later arrested 15 persons and additional force was deployed in the troubled area.

As per reports, some youths were gambling in a vacant plot in Ratanpura Shaumali locality in Rampur on Thursday evening. The plot owner, a doctor, objected along with his relatives after which a clash ensued. However, the police reached there in time and nabbed three youths and brought them to the police station.

However, on Friday morning, the situation took a violent turn when the two groups again came to a head, pelted stones at each other and even opened fire that left half-a-dozen injured.

Later, the cops reached there and arrested a dozen troublemakers.

Cross-cases were registered at the local police station. Two named accused were absconding and efforts were being made to nab them.

Meanwhile in Hardoi, frustrated due to lock- down, a youth hit his father on the head leading to his death on Friday.

As per reports, Neeraj Pandey of Puranbhadhur area of Kotwali Dehat became depressed as his earning dried up due to lockdown. On Friday morning, he had an argument with his father Radhey Shyam (70) and fatally hit him on his head with a brick.

The critically injured Radhey Shyam was taken to district hospital where he was pronounced dead upon arrival. A case was registered and Neeraj was arrested.

Elsewhere in Campierganj area of Gorakhpur, fire broke out in a hut in Khadkhadiya village leaving a 12-year-old girl, Seema, dead and her father, Sudama, critically injured.

Beside the girl, 20 goats tied outside the hut were also charred.

A case was registered and the injured Sudama was shifted to a hospital where his condition was said to be critical.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/group-clash-over-gambling-leaves-a-dozen-hurt.html
7,25-4-20,The eternal City of Joy,"There was no migrant workers’ crisis in Kolkata, in the industrial areas, or in the rest of Bengal, which has been peaceful unlike the Hindi heartland

Bengalis and fish and how can this classical ode to joy fall apart? No way! Bengalis and mishti (sweets). How can they ever be brutally separated, even in a nationwide lockdown, even while diabetes is itself an epidemic in Bengal, especially Kolkata?

Indeed, it’s like saying how can the average middle class Bengali bhodrolok (genteel folk) survive without his daily dose of Boroline, Digene/Gelusil and Ananda Bazaar Patrika, to use a hackneyed cliché once again. But, clichés, despite being repetitive, are life-affirming too. They tell you that the world has not changed and what Bengal thinks today, India thinks tomorrow. Not even Kerala, though they love Bengal out there, I tell you.

Starting the working day for a working Bengali is a precious ritual. Going out with a jhola (bag) to the fish market early morning is a favourite daily one. Haggling is an eternal joy. A thin fish curry with black cumin and rice and the whole day is made. Only jhaal moori at lunch time might break this daily fulfillment.

It is fulfilling truly and nourishing, too. And the food has nothing to do with calories hereafter. Often it is kachori (crispy savoury snack) in the morning from the nearest Sharma loochir dukaan, often stuffed with motor shooti (green peas) and a thin potato curry. As it is phoochka in the night, especially for women.

So, at least, two things have not changed in the eternally outgoing “City of Joy”, where “ghore-baire” is a beautiful obsession and a routine dilemma. One, the fish markets are open in many places. And I am told by reliable sources that the mishti shops, now open from 12 noon to four in the evening, might get a four hour additional bonus.

If Kolkata is the microcosm of the unfinished painting of the Bengali canvas, it seemingly hates the lockdown. Who does not? The urge to go out is as tangible as the crowd in the fish markets, even now, which are reportedly not so sanitised or following the highest of health standards. And, yet, the death toll is just about seven. How come?

And that, too, is a kind of hidden and expressed controversy. Unlike, surprisingly, in Uttar Pradesh (UP), (where the graph might seem to be flattening like Kerala, where they have literally blocked the virus now, especially in Thrissur, Kottayam and Idukki). There is a lack of testing, health infrastructure, poor safety condition of doctors, nurses and health workers, abysmal hospitals in UP, too, but a partially totalitarian regime calls the disciplinary shots. Nobody even knows what the tens of thousands of workers are going through in the small towns or the rural hinterland of UP, or, if the deadly virus is spreading out there.

However, in Kolkata, or Bengal, the graph on the death toll, as much as selective or mass testing is too low. Sources say that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has been efficient, on the spot, on the dot, and she started early, even though not as early as Pinarayi Vijayan in Kerala. That she has no faith in the Central laboratories with their “bureaucratic paraphernalia”, not in the unfulfilled promises of help from Delhi. For long, her Government has complained of lack of testing kits and medical equipment for doctors and nurses, saying that Delhi simply seemed too reluctant or late in response.

It is no wonder then that the Union Home Ministry sending a Central team to Bengal, among other States, to make “on-the-spot assessments” on the Covid-19 crisis has not gone down well with the fiercely independent leader. In her characteristic manner, Mamata has strongly protested against this unilateral move which goes against the federal spirit, even as the graph in Bengal just cannot be compared to the serious situation in many other States.

In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Chief Minister has reiterated that the Inter-Ministerial Central Team’s (IMCT) visit to several districts — Kolkata, Howrah, 24 Parganas North, Medinipur East, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling — amounted to a “unilateral action” by Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

“I am sure you will kindly agree that such unilateral action on the part of the Central Government is not desirable at all, especially in the backdrop when both Central and State Governments are working together relentlessly round-the-clock to contain the covid-19 crisis,” Mamata said in the letter.

Meanwhile, the the Calcutta High Court last week asked the West Bengal Government to go on a “war footing on the Covid-19 tests” and that it should follow the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR and World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines.

Till now, in this entire process, Mamata’s total focus has been on the prestigious Calcutta Medical College and other State and private institutions, for medical care. Besides, she has been fast in her crisis management. A stadium in Howrah was converted into a fully-equipped hospital with 1,000 beds. A private high-rise building in post-modern Rajarhaat was turned into another makeshift hospital. Private hospitals were asked to cooperate. And the lockdown, sensitively done, was fully implemented.

There was no migrant workers’ crisis in Kolkata, in the industrial areas, or in the rest of Bengal, which has been peaceful unlike the Hindi heartland. She announced quickly that no one will go hungry till September. There was no mass migration nor starvation on the streets and slums. Food rations were given and is being given, to all those who seek it with a ration card, for free and with dignity. Those who don’t have ration cards or official documents can also avail of it with a temporary slip. Cooked food is being given to those who can’t cook food. Even police stations are being organised to cook food and distribute to people who are going hungry.

An activist, who works in the red light area in Kolkata, told this reporter that not one among the 10,000 residents in the area is going hungry. Those who can’t cook are being given cooked food. Even in poor villages of Purulia, Midnapore and so on, the problem of hunger has been taken care of with local official networks. “No one is really going hungry in Kolkata and Bengal, that I can assure you,” he said and he is no Mamata supporter.

There are reports of hunger stalking in the eternally-starving tea gardens of North Bengal, which have seen stark unemployment, destitution and starvation deaths in the past. Civil society initiatives are desperately working on the ground and a lot of food distribution is happening through the Trinamool Congress local networks. “It’s a difficult and tragic situation out here. The problem is not only perennial out here, it is kind of become intensified after the lockdown,” said a Jadavpur University student from Cooch Behar on the border of Bangladesh, where the “chitmahals”, too, are facing longstanding problems.

“Chitmahals” are villages which lived in a twilight zone after Partition in East Pakistan and India and later after the formation of Bangladesh. They were citizens of no man’s land and had no rights, no identity, no citizenship of any country. Recently, many of them have gone over to Bangladesh and others have been allocated to India, though the borderlines are thin and blurring. And, yet, their economic and social condition remains abysmal.

There have been recent reports of new hotspots of the epidemic in Kolkata, including in the slums. Kolkata, Howrah, East Medinipur and the North 24 Parganas have been declared sensitive zones. Eight districts have been declared as possible hotspots: Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri, Hooghly, Nadia, West Burdwan, West Medinipur, the South 24 Parganas and Darjeeling. New areas are being marked.

Meanwhile, civil society groups, especially students, have been working on the ground with great commitment. Students, research scholars and the alumni of Jadavpur University, for instance, are distributing sanitisers, rations and cooked food, which they themselves cook in the campus. They distribute it all over Kolkata, to cops, health workers, doctors, shopkeepers, vegetable vendors and slums.

“We are short of money, almost always. The alumni is helping. But we need more help,” said a research scholar.

However, life is like this only, as the story goes. Kolkata and Bengal are observing the lockdown with discipline and patience. The Government is in control. And while Rabindra Sangeet (music) and Western music still floats in the bylanes, people are waiting for a new life after the lockdown ends.

Tomaar holo shuru, aamar holo shaara, (it’s your beginning, it’s my end...) as the eternally beautiful Robi Thakur song goes.

8,25-4-20,Challenges to digital ecosystems,"A bottom-up approach would ensure that the benefits of digitisation are enjoyed by all, particularly by those who need them the most

As India looks to adopt the maxim of “minimum government and maximum governance”, the role of digital ecosystems has become paramount. Such an ecosystem usually comprises an interconnected or interdependent group of people, things and enterprises which share a standardised platform and seek to achieve a beneficial purpose. They possess immense potential in increasing efficiency, reducing leakages and ensuring on time delivery of services. Starting with digitisation of documents and automation of processes, the scope of digitisation in India has now expended to end-to-end delivery of services and the creation of unified Government portals. The Government is now seeking a transition to National Open Digital Ecosystems (NODEs), which are “open and secure digital delivery platforms, anchored by transparent governance mechanisms, which enable a community of partners to unlock innovative solutions, to transform societal outcomes.”

In a Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) consultation White paper, which sets out the broad principles that would govern the functioning of NODEs, the creation of digital ecosystems is described as the third paradigm in the evolution of GovTech. Examples of GovTech 3.0 include the United Payment Interface and Goods and Services Tax Network. The key objectives of an ecosystem approach include the need to optimise service delivery, integrate data across departments and ministries, create inter-operable and modular platforms and include the private sector by allowing them to build solutions on top of Government architecture. Achieving these objectives involves open delivery systems, governance, regulations and a community of innovators and users. The White paper captures factors that would contribute to the creation of successful NODEs but certain challenges remain unaddressed.

Success in the digital provision of services is dependent on many underlying factors, including digital literacy, education and access to stable and fast telecommunication services. The development of digital infrastructure also determines the ability of users to effectively benefit from digital services. Furthermore, digital ecosystems should be guided by factors of availability, accessibility, affordability, value and trust. These factors are important as disparities in access and availability exist across multiple dimensions. For example, urban Indians are more likely to have mobile connections and internet than individuals in rural India. Women are 28 per cent less likely than men to own a mobile phone and are only half as likely to use the internet. Other factors such as age and socio-economic status also determine how easy it is to access such services.

In this setting, undertaking large-scale digitisation of services without bridging these digital divides could result in services not being delivered to those who are most in need of them, thereby increasing existing inequalities. Other concerns relate to the cybersecurity and data privacy architecture required to engender trust in users and thereby promote uptake of such services. India is yet to adopt a comprehensive legislation on the same. Given the prevalence of denial of service and distributed denial of services attacks as well as ransomware and malware in the last few years, it is crucial to have in place regulations providing for rapid response and coordination in case of an attack, continuous threat assessment and analysis and regular updating of databases pertaining to viruses and other threats. Another cybersecurity challenge is ensuring end-to-end protection of data throughout the whole ecosystem. While channels and databases used by the Government for transmission and storage are usually secure, other players in the ecosystem may not possess the requisite expertise or security to prevent and respond to breaches. The breach of Aadhar database is a case in point.

The White paper also mentions its use of data registries, comprising both personal and community information/records. It is, therefore, imperative, that regulations governing the NODE take into account provisions of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, which will determine the regulatory landscape of protection of personal data. A committee to regulate Non-Personal Data has been set up by the MeitY. The panel’s recommendations will be instructive in determining how data provided by communities can be used in digital ecosystem operation.

It is also unclear how data autonomy can be ensured across such a broad spectrum of participants as India does not have a universal identifier which can be used to authenticate an individual and enable provision of services without leakages. While Aadhar is nearly ubiquitous, it suffers from lacunae in the form of ghost beneficiaries and identity fraud. Second, creating a consent framework that is easy to use, available on multiple platforms (including over SMS and IVRS) while still allowing a granular degree of control is a significant challenge.

The push to creation of digital ecosystems is a welcome step as it can prove to be an effective tool in overcoming governance deficit and improving quality of life for individuals. However, it is essential to adapt such ecosystems to the peculiarities of India. A bottom-up and inclusive approach would ensure that the benefits of digitisation are enjoyed by everyone and particularly by those who need them the most.

9,25-4-20,New anti-virus weapons give hope,"As the world looks for answers to fight the pandemic, two potential treatment and testing procedures which have come to light are Convalescent Plasma therapy and Rapid Diagnostic Testing

The Coronavirus has brought the world to a standstill and doctors and scientists are working overtime to develop vaccines/drugs and new treatment strategies to cure patients. Two such potential treatment and testing procedures which have come to light are Convalescent Plasma (CP) therapy and Rapid Diagnostic Testing (RDT).

In order to understand CP it is essential to grasp the concept of antigen-antibody. If any thief tries to come inside your house, your defence mechanism will kick in and you will either stop him or he will be successful in robbing you. However, in the process of defending the house, there is bound to be some damage to it. Then, you will call the police in order to get the thief arrested. In the long-term you will get a burglar alarm system or CCTV camera installed. This will burglar-proof your house.

Now, apply this allegory to the human body. The thief is the Antigen and your response is what the body does to these Antigens with the aid of antibodies. There are various types of antibodies, like IgM, IgG, IgE, IgA, IgD. Your initial response is similar to the IgM which is the first antibody to respond to any antigen. The long-term measures you have taken is IgG and the collateral damage to your house is akin to inflammation that manifests as fever, swelling, redness and pain.

Just like you don’t react adversely to everyone who enters the house, the same way your body does not react adversely to self-Antigens. But if you spot the same thief you become vigilant and try to take evasive action before he harms your home further. The body reacts in the same way to any Antigen that has already been contained by it by producing anti-bodies. If the Antigen is re-introduced into the body, its response is intensified. This is why if you have chicken pox once, you don’t get it again. This principle is used in creating an “active” vaccine, where a small quantity of infection (Antigen) is introduced into the body so that antibodies are produced and provide protection to the individual against the infection.

However, there is also a “passive” type of vaccine under which pre-prepared antibodies are given to a person. However, the immunity acquired by this vaccine is not life-long and once these antibodies given from outside are used up, they no longer provide protection. Since the antibodies were not produced by the body originally, the number of antibodies in the body is not adequate to neutralise any antigen which enters it in the future. This is the reason people need to get tetanus injections repeatedly. The CP therapy is a process in which the antibodies from the plasma (the largest part of blood, which when separated from the blood is a light yellow liquid) of a recovered patient of COVID-19 is transferred to a patient who has an active Coronavirus infection, with chances of it worsening. This is a type of passive immunity only, in which a patient battling the infection is assisted by someone. CP therapy had been previously used for SARS and influenza and has shown positive results. However, the results of CP therapy in Coronavirus are variable and still evolving. Trials conducted on 10 COVID-19 patients given CP therapy in China showed positive results. A task force created by Kerala has got permission from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to conduct further research on it. The ICMR is also not planning to conduct it for all patients but select ones and this will not be a treatment per se but a clinical trial. However, if approved and successful, it will be scaled up to a treatment.

The antibodies are proteins formed by B-Lymphocytes and they are part of Humoral Immunity. There is another system called Cell-Mediated Immunity, in which major work is done by T Lymphocytes. However, CP therapy requires further research (it has been approved by the US FDA) and also requires monitoring while transfusion of the plasma into another patient as there can be life-threatening reactions. Hence, careful monitoring and a due call needs to be taken by doctors and the researchers on the use of CP therapy. RDT has become a very important strategy to contain the spread of the Coronavirus. In this, confirmatory testing is by RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction) in which absolute confirmation is provided as the presence of RNA of the virus is demonstrated in the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. However, this is costly and time-consuming and hence there is need for development of RDTs. These RDTs work in two ways. One is the demonstration of the protein (antigen) of the virus from the respiratory tract of the individual and second is demonstration of antibodies in the blood of the person suspected to be infected by the Coronavirus.

In the first type there are specially made paper strips on which antibodies to the Coronavirus are affixed and this is enclosed in a plastic casing. So, if a person’s respiratory tract sample has the antigen of the Coronavirus then there will be a detectable signal in 30 minutes. These antigens, which are detected are only expressed when the virus is replicating i.e it is in the active stage of infection. However, these factors depend on many other factors. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says, “How well the tests work depends on several factors, including the time from onset of illness, the concentration of virus in the specimen, the quality of the specimen collected from a person, how it is processed and the precise formulation of the reagents in the test kits.” Based on experience with antigen-based RDTs for other respiratory diseases such as influenza, in which affected patients have comparable concentrations of influenza virus in respiratory samples as seen in COVID-19, the sensitivity of these tests might be expected to vary from 34 per cent to 80 per cent. These then will show “false negative” results which mean that the individual is positive to COVID-19 but is not detected due to the above reasons. There may also be “false positive” results as the antibodies on the paper strips may attach to the antigen of another common influenza virus which gives us the common cold.

The second type includes demonstrating (by detectable signals) antibodies to the Coronavirus antigen in the blood sample of an individual suspected to have COVID-19. However, the issue with this technique is that the patient may develop antibody response a few weeks after the onset of symptoms, i.e in recovery phase when chances of clinical intervention would have passed. Further, the WHO states that, “The strength of antibody response depends on several factors, including age, nutritional status, severity of disease and certain medications or infections like HIV that suppress the immune system.”

However, the ICMR has developed a protocol to use these rapid tests and approved kits. Only time will tell if it is the right strategy.

10,25-4-20,An asymmetric threat,"The havoc wrought by the spread of Coronavirus has raised concerns over bioweapons but the real fear is more from the domain of reckless terrorists accessing them

Security doctrines and threat perceptions are constantly evolving and it invariably takes a deliberate or an inadvertent incident/accident to widen the scope of the full spectrum of possible security threats. Beyond the conventional and nuclear dimensions of “threat” perceptions, to which most militaries are conversant with, the nature of threat angularities is increasingly veering towards the “unconventional” or the “asymmetric” realm. The commonly understood dimensions of the asymmetric threat-entailed phenomenon, like slow-bleed insurgency, chemical warfare, cyberwarfare or even economic permutations, act like sanctions.

By definition, asymmetric warfare is “a broad and unpredictable spectrum of military, paramilitary and information operations, conducted by nations, organisations, individuals or by indigenous or surrogate forces under their control. It specifically targets the weaknesses and vulnerabilities within an enemy Government or the armed forces.” In the same light, the debilitating COVID-19 crisis and its impacts are getting posited as a possible “asymmetric” security mutation; though this is still in the realm of unverified speculation.

The ragtag militia of the Yemeni Houthi rebels had made a mockery of conventional weaponry when the American Patriot missile system, procured for almost $6 billion, failed miserably against modified civilian-made drones (these could have cost $15,000 each), which flew through 500 km of land and attacked the world’s largest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia. The state-of-the-art defence “shield” was hopelessly pierced by a substantially lower technology assemblage that was deployed as an unconventional tactic against the combined might of a much larger Saudi military, which was backed by the US’ wherewithal.

Just a month ago, the powerful nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, was leading a deadly flotilla of heavily armed warships under the nose of the Chinese waters. Today, that $20 billion battle platform, packed with up to 90 fighter aircraft, helicopters, missiles and weaponry, has embarrassingly “run aground” and succumbed hopelessly to what the Commander-in-Chief of the US military, Donald Trump, calls the “Chinese virus.” Even though the theory of a bioweapon has been dialled down by the Pentagon’s top General, Mark Milley, who stated that the preponderant “weight of evidence” pointed towards “natural” origins as opposed to laboratory manufactured, nonetheless, a new threat dimension has unmistakably emerged. This needs to be accounted for in the national security calculus.

The concept of a “dirty bomb” or radiological dispersal device (RDD), which aims to contaminate the area with radioactive material, has existed for long. However, a crude rendition of the same, using biological elements (bioterrorism), will haunt the security experts going forward. The usage of biological warfare entailing infectious agents like viruses and bacteria among others, which come under the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), is explicitly prohibited. The deployment of the same is tantamount to war crimes.

By its nature, biological agents (like in the case of Coronavirus) are transmitted from person to person and aerosolised respiratory droplets. Hence, they are uncontrollable to a restricted population. However, the deliberate or unintentional “escape” of its “weaponable” elements cannot be ruled out as that is subject to human handling, intentions and infrastructural controls.

Weaponisation of biological elements is an established fact with the US, the Soviet Union, the UK, France, Japan and China among others. They have established dedicated facilities and research centres to undertake the same. Be it plague, tularemia, vaccinia viruses, brucellosis or encephalomyelitis — all have been successfully weaponised under these covert programmes. However, given its inherently “evil” nature and uncontrolled spread, almost 182 countries have ratified a ban on biological weapons. Though some, like China, are suspected to have persisted with the research and development on it.

Among the foremost research institutions in China that are involved in the programme is the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the epicentre of the Coronavirus. However, given the considered view of most apolitical and functional experts on this subject, as also the “cost” China paid to Coronavirus, it seems highly unlikely to be a deliberate case of deployment of a biological weapon.

The real fear is more from the domain of reckless terrorism, wherein relative affordability, undetectability and ease to “spread” mechanism of a potential bioweapon could make it escape the current levels of security and safety protocols in existing laboratories and research centres. While access to all sophisticated elements and delivery systems may still be a challenge for rogue elements, a cruder contraption of bacteria-based (example anthrax) weapon can be assembled with regular laboratory equipment and materials. Terror organisations like the Al Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS) are known to have partaken interest in the related sphere of ricin and cyanide attacks. But a possible assembly of a “dirty bioweapon”, given the established havoc achieved by the Coronavirus, can trigger malicious interest in the domain.

Governments will have to review their security-related budgetary allocations in line with the evolving threats. The Trump administration had badly undermined itself by slashing funds and headcount towards the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), part of which was team-based with China overlooking global health threats. The US administration’s obvious disinterest had led to a domino effect of ill-preparation of the medical infrastructure, reaction and administration in containing the Coronavirus crisis.

Countering this new threat will necessitate the conjoining of various military and non-military specialists to jointly address the technical, scientific and operational counters.

The Chinese have a robust intermingling of civil-military competencies. The recent takeover of the Wuhan Institute of Virology by Maj General Chen Wei of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is indicative of the same. Chen is among the foremost specialists in genetic engineering vaccines and comes with a reputation as the “terminator of Ebola” after leading a team to create a counter-vaccine to the fatal virus. However, Governments must immediately enforce strict restraints against “dual usage” of chemicals, materials and equipment to deter a do-it-yourself attempt to create a “dirty bioweapon” by any rogue element. It was the free availability of “dual utility” technology that incubated the Yemeni-Houthi drone contraptions to outsmart the top-of-the-line defence shield in Saudi deserts. The sight of a hopelessly impoverished and anchored USS Theodore Roosevelt was another grim reminder of the latest mutation in security threats.

11,25-4-20,An exit strategy,"With supply chains running dry, the Government must plan a life after lockdown relying on a battery of green pool workers

We have completed a month of the lockdown and India Inc is bleeding. And while we have been able to rush essentials for a while given existing stocks, the cessation of production and breakage in the logistics chain mean that consumer goods are going to be in short supply now. Nearly 43 per cent of the 157 units owned by FMCG majors are in the Coronavirus red zones in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal. This includes the likes of Colgate, ITC, Britannia, Nestle, Dabur and Bajaj Consumer. Apart from being short of labour due to the shutdown and the exodus of migrants, the other issues they are facing range from sourcing of raw material, movement of products and supply chain disruptions due to the forced closure of factories of suppliers and MSMEs the FMCG majors depend upon. According to global research firm Kantar, 12 major cities in the country are witnessing the closure of a whopping 76 per cent of micro and small businesses while another 60 per cent of the businesses are uncertain about their financial health going forward. This is not unique to us. In the UK, large firms are coming across more supply chain issues than those in smaller companies. US firms, too, are finding it difficult to substitute products from other countries for the missing inputs from China. Even though some factories have opened up as part of the Centre’s graded lockdown exit strategy, they are facing a manpower problem as most of their workers have gone back to their villages/towns and those who are in the vicinity are scared to come back for fear of contracting the “big city” virus. So this means that India is looking at a massive consumer goods shortage in the near future even after the lockdown is lifted. In order to avoid this scenario, FMCG majors are requesting the Government to allow companies in hotspots that have not had any Coronavirus cases among their staff to be allowed to function. In return they are promising to adopt and implement all safety protocols and screening measures, including social distancing norms. However, for the Government it is a catch-22 situation. On the one hand, it has to look at the demands of the economy, India Inc and the consumers and on the other, it has to weigh in the risks associated with opening up as all approaches to easing the lockdown carry risks of infection spikes. Sure the lockdown has given it some time to prepare healthcare facilities for an expected surge and helped map the trajectory and extent of the disease.

So, the big question in front of the Government now is how to minimise the risk of an exponential spike in Coronavirus cases, which current data might not reveal, while allowing business as usual? As of now, the Government has distinguished three zones, green, orange and red, with the green zones being the ones with no new cases reported in 28 days. Orange zones are those with a few cases and reds are, of course, the clusters. The Government wants to open up the green zones first but India is discovering to its horror that a majority of its cases are asymptomatic. Maharashtra has 83 per cent of such cases and Delhi over 25 per cent. So if green zones are opened and anything between 25-83 per cent people are asymptomatic carriers, infections will spike. In such a situation, the most effective, minimal-risk approach could be to create infection-free worker pools or “green worker pools.” This would include people who have already been infected by the Coronavirus and have recovered, thus having some immunity to it. This would mean they don’t have to live on the factory premises as they have immunity, thus solving the major problem of housing that most industries have to comply with. Besides, they can travel through any of the three zones. Thus by repeated testing, antibody and pool testing and creating this “green pool” of workers, we will be able to start up our economy. The other option before us is to rely on the “herd immunity” method and take our chances as the workforce of the country consists of the youth who will be able to fend off the worst effects of the virus and take the economy out of the red zone it is in now. Something that Sweden is doing. But this is a big gamble and for the time being we need discipline by way of distancing and following restrictions if we are to capitalise on the little gains we have made.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/an-exit-strategy-2020-04-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/an-exit-strategy.html
12,25-4-20,High co-morbidity in dead corona patients,"

|

After 24 deaths were reported due to coronavirus infection in Uttar Pradesh, the government claimed that 88 per cent of these deaths were due to co-morbidity that hastened the patients’ end.

“The death audit suggests that 21 of 24 people who died of COVID-19 had co-morbidity. This implies that they were suffering from other diseases like diabetes, heart or other ailments besides being aged. This comes to 87.5 per cent of the toll. Although the remaining three patients did not have any other ailment, they were above 50 years of age,” Principal Secretary (Health) Amit Mohan Prasad said in Lucknow on Friday.

“Hence, the government has been repeatedly saying that people should take care of the elderly with diseases (co-morbidity) as they are more vulnerable to the coronavirus.

“Elderly people with high blood pressure, sugar, cancer or cardiac problems need special care. They should be kept inside and not allowed to meet outsiders. This is the only way of not exposing theme to the disease,” Prasad said.

The senior official said that the silver lining in the crisis was that though the total coronavirus positive cases in the state reached 1,604, 206 of them had recovered and they had been discharged from hospitals.

“Initially, we had coronavirus positive cases in 56 districts but now 10 districts have been declared coronavirus-free and the infection is present only in 46 districts. Also, earlier the rise in number of positive patients was in three digits but now it has come down to double digit which is a welcome sign,” he said.

Prasad said that as per the trend of coronavirus spread in the state, fresh cases were detected in 13 districts. Interestingly, of these, 80 cases were found in hotspots of five districts of Kanpur, Firozabad, Saharanpur, Amroha and Moradabad.

“This means we have been able to contain the spread of coronavirus in the red zone,” he said.

The principal secretary said that all Level-1 COVID hospitals had oxygen facilities and each had 15 oxygen cylinders along with other equipment.

“Besides, Level-2 and Level-3 hospitals have ventilators along with oxygen facilities,” he said.

Prasad said that several private hospitals would be attached with Level-1 COVID hospitals for asymptomatic patients.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/high-co-morbidity-in-dead-corona-patients.html
13,25-4-20,Punjab commences telemedicine services in Health & Wellness centres,"In the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, Punjab Government has started telemedicine services in 300 HWCs (Health and Wellness Centres) to provide ‘Comprehensive Primary Health Services’ on door steps of people in rural areas.

Giving details, Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu on Friday said that telemedicine services are being given in the State through hub and spoke model. A ‘Telemedicine Hub’ has been established at Civil Hospital, Mohali with four medical officers and one telemedicine executive. In next phase, number of medicals officers would be increased after assessing the response across the State while CDAC’s e-Sanjeevni telemedicine application is being used to roll out telemedicine program in the state.

Sidhu said that under this initiative, the Community Health Officers (CHOs) at HWC – sub center level connects with medical officers at the hub through video calling. The CHO then dispenses medicines to patient, based on prescription received through e-Sanjeevni app from the medical officer.

GOVT ASKS BANKS TO PROMOTE DIGITAL TRANSACTION, MAINTAIN VISITING CUSTOMERS PROPER LOG

Issuing a detailed advisory on maintaining hygiene and sanitization in banks to contain the spread of Covid-19 pandemic, Punjab Government on Friday asked them to promote digital transaction, and maintain visiting customers’ proper log.

As per the advisory of the Health and Family Welfare Department, social distancing of at least one meter amongst the customers has been advised, besides asking the banks to ensure that all customers are wearing a mask before entering the branch, and sanitizes hands in the prescribed manner at the entrance. All banks have been advised to provide separate timings for senior citizens, women and other category of customers depending upon nature of accounts they hold.

Encouraging to launch a massive awareness campaign for promoting digital transactions, the government asked the banks to use electronic media to redress grievances or queries of its customers, use of mobile based apps for quick information on available balances or loans etc, and minimal human interface in physical bank branches.

The banks have also been asked to maintain a proper log of customers’ visit at the entry gate, including name, address, and phone number. The accomplices, if any, with the customer should be discouraged to enter the banks until absolutely necessary as in case of challenged customers.

IIT ROPAR DEVELOPS INFRARED VISION SYSTEM FOR IDENTIFICATION OF COVID-19 PERSONS

IIT Ropar has developed a prototype remote temperature mapping device for monitoring the infrared radiation emanating over human face and is looking for clinical tests by medical industry experts. The infrared vision system has the decision making capability to detect suspects based on relative temperature measurement over selected features of the face with self reference, which makes screening process easy and risk less unlike limited range hand held thermal imaging devices widely used presently at various crowed places with human involvement.

This infrared vision system measures wide range of temperatures with a pixel resolution of 160 X 120 and sensitivity of 70 mK. Further, the thermograms captured during screening process are exported to the processing unit wirelessly and the decision will be displayed almost in no time.

The present developed infrared vision system can make the self decisions in detecting the suspects without any human intervention by considering the relative temperature distribution over the selected features over the face region.

IIT Ropar team of researchers, Dr Ravibabu Mulaveesala, Associate Professor, Department of Electrical Engineering; Dr Vanita Arora, Post-Doctoral Researcher, Department of Electrical Engineering, in association with SS Automation Private Limited Bangalore MS Suresh and his team, developed this intelligent infrared vision system.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-commences-telemedicine-services-in-health---wellness-centres.html
14,25-4-20,‘Baitarani to become dry due to faulty policy',"As the State goes through lockdown for COVID 19 and summer approaches fast, access to safe water emerged as one of the biggest problems . Various community leaders, NGO leaders and concerned citizens in a videoconferencing on the Earth Day organised by JANMAT and Citizens’ Action Forum urged for effective long-term water management policies to increase water affordability to prevent the impacts of water crises.

The participating community leaders, NGO leaders and concerned citizens expressed their grave concern on depleting water availability in many areas. They talked about the mining district of Keonjhar where river Baitarani serves as a lifeline for the natives. The allocation of water to industries and planned allocation of water for new slurry pipeline projects for mineral transportation without a provision of return water pipeline will further aggravate the situation of poor people, including farmers .

Many companies are drawing huge quantity of water from river Baitarani for mineral transportation through slurry pipe projects.

The slurry pipeline of Brahmani River Pellet Plant (BRPL) of 4mtpa and length 230 km from Barbil to Kalinganagar has annual water allocation of 41,99,544 cum of water from river Baitarani. Slurry pipeline of Essar Steel pellet plant of 6-mtpa and length 253 km from Dabuna to Paradip has annual water allocation of 105,16,730 cum of water from river Baitarani. On similar lines, many slurry pipeline projects such as 30mtpa capacity of JSW and 24mtpa capacity of Thriveni have already been approved by the State Government where there is no provision of return pipeline for replenishment of water and consistent drawl of water a single source. These projects will further aggravate the water flow of Baitarani river.

The present situation on water availability at Keonjhar is already alarming and many villagers say that the reason behind this is the 'faulty policy' of the Government. The water of the district is allocated to different industries and mining houses, without any consultation with the people there, who have the first right on the water. It is unfortunate that the Government is taking so many years to complete the construction of a dam over Baitarani at Kanupur, which will help farming and help in preservation of water. Instead of taking steps to complete the project and clean the river to preserve the water, the Government is allocating water to the companies to turn the district into a desert.

Only 28 percent of available water of river Baitarani could be converted for irrigation purpose. The Kanupur project started about 40 years back is still waiting for completion.

The leaders of JANMAT and CAF demanded that ,the slurry pipeline projects without return water pipeline may be discouraged as consistent drawl of water in stressed zone will further aggravate the situation. The justification of usage of water at the delivery end in water rich zone for other purposes is not equivalent to provision of return water pipeline for stressed zone. They suggested that the common carrier slurry pipeline under Government control may be promoted in place of individual slurry pipeline projects to cater to needs of many consumers in the region.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---baitarani-to-become-dry-due-to-faulty-policy-.html
15,25-4-20,Experts discuss approaches to strengthen testing strategy for Punjab,"The experts from USA’s Johns Hopkins University, New Delhi’s Centre for Policy Research, and PGIMER Chandigarh on Friday discussed approaches to strengthen testing strategy for Punjab.

A video conference meeting was organized by the state Health Sector Response and Procurement Committee (HSRPC) in pursuance to directions of the Chief Minister to have a proper strategy for testing for Covid-19, in order to ensure early detection as well as curtailment of spread. HSRPC chairperson Vini Mahajan said that these experts have years of experience and knowledge behind them. While the State Government is focused to increase its testing capacity and numbers, it is mindful of taking an approach to testing that shall be most effective in containing the infection and preventing its spread any further, she said.

Mahajan said that the State is also preparing for the post lockdown period and is therefore making efforts to design testing strategies for during and post mobility restrictions when the social engagements rise.She said that the discussion was extremely productive and the team shall be preparing a testing strategy for Punjab for the coming weeks.

Amidst the nationwide lockdown, the Indian Railways delivered a package of camel milk weighing about 20 kg from Falna in Rajasthan to Bhubaneswar for the autistic child on Thursday. The delivery was made through the Parcel Express service of Indian Railways on the request of 24-year-old mechanical engineer Chandan Kumar Acharya to the IPS officer on Twitter.

A few days back, Chandan had tweeted about his three-and-a-half-year-old nephew, who is autistic and survives only on camel milk and pulses. He also mentioned that due to the lockdown, his family was not being able to source the milk. As Bothra had recently helped a Mumbai-based woman in a similar situation, the former requested him for help in arranging camel milk for his nephew too. In a quick response, Bothra forwarded Chandan’s request to the IRTS SETU, a unified helpline that facilitates movement of necessary goods through available modes of transport. The delivery was made at the Bhubaneswar railway station within two days of the request in exchange of a transport charge of Rs 125.

Later, Chandan with the help of the Ganjam police got the travel pass and reached the Bhubaneswar railway station to collect the package. He expressed his deep gratitude to Bothra, the Ganjam police and railway officials for their joint efforts helping him get the camel milk for his nephew.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bothra-again-earns-praise-for-generous-act.html

It drew appreciation from the Centre for being among the top two States in containing and combating the pandemic efficiently.

Senior officials of the State said there is no room for complacency and they must remain in a state of preparedness for months to come.

According to the date of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, between April 12 and 18, Odisha and Kerala were the best-performing States as they took 34.12 days and 67.2 days, respectively, to double COVID-19 cases.

Odisha was the first state to have declared COVID-19 as a disaster and imposed lockdown.

“Way too early”, said State Government’s Chief Spokesperson on COVID-19 Subroto Bagchi on Wednesday. He said the Government as well as the people must remain alert for at least six months and strictly adhere to social distancing and norms of hygiene.

While the State has so far reported 82 positive cases, 30 of them have recovered and a 72- year-old man has succumbed

Mandatory steps like registration of foreign returnees, strict enforcement of lockdown guidelines, setting up of hundreds of quarantine and isolation centres, substantially increasing number of tests, establishment of dedicated hospitals for coronavirus patients in all districts have really mattered in checking spread of the virus, said an official.

The Government has also raised the corpus of the contingency fund five-fold to Rs 2,000 crore to meet the expenses required for battling out COVID-19.

Quarantine centres have been set up in all 6,798 gram panchayats Odisha. Each centre can accommodate 50-100 persons. A total of Rs 44.50 crore from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund to 30 districts for this, the Chief Minister said.

The Chief Minister also said that lakhs of people who are expected to return home post lockdown will have ve to undergo compulsory quarantine for 14 days. The Government will bear all the cost for their accommodation, food and treatment. An incentive of Rs 2,000 will also be provided on completionof the quarantine period, he said.

Senior officers rushed to spot and defused the situation by assuring the protesters of a thorough probe and punishment to erring cops.

As per reports, a vegetable vendor from Delhigate area was injured when a team from Kotwali police station went to close a market at Bhojipura, and enforce lockdown on Wednesday.

As the police tried to reason with shoppers and vendors, two vendors started a fight. As cops intervened, they were pelted with stones by local traders which left two cops with injuries. Later the police cane-charged the crowd in which a vegetable vendor was injured.

Later, an FIR was registered against 10 persons and additional police force was deployed in the area to contain the situation and some people were detained.

However, the injured vegetable vendor, who was hospitalised after the incident, succumbed to his injuries late Thursday night.

His death agitated the vendors who accused the cops of being brutal and they staged demonstration on Friday morning.

Meanwhile in Gonda, a gram pradhan’s husband and his aides created a ruckus in the district hospital and misbehaved with doctors on Friday.

As per reports, the pradhan’s husband, Bhuvneshwar, backed by Sarvesh Yadav and Rakesh, reached the district hospital to meet some patients and had heated arguments with the staff when they were told to wear mask and then enter the hospital.

Irked by the counselling, Bhuvneshwar and his cronies created a ruckus and misbehaved with doctors before the police reached there.

21,25-4-20,HP CM briefs Health Minister on coronavirus,"Himachal Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur on Friday had a meeting through video conference with Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare Dr. Harsh Vardhan in which he apprised him about the steps being taken by the State Government to tackle the menace of coronavirus effectively.

Thakur said that there were six districts in the State, where no case has been reported of Covid-19, pointing out that 8847 persons had been kept under surveillance in the state, out of which 5637 people had completed 28 days of necessary surveillance period whereas 3210 people were still under observation. He said that 3994 persons had so far been investigated for coronavirus in the State.

He said presently, reports of 40 people have been found positive out of which 18 persons have been discharged after being found negative. Besides this, four persons have gone for treatment outside the State and one person has died. He said that remaining 17 persons were under treatment in the hospitals of the State.

The Chief Minister said hotspots of coronavirus in the State had been sealed to avoid spread of virus, adding that government had established about 9200 quarantine beds in 183 health institutions of the State. He urged the Union Health Minister to provide more ventilators for the State to meet out any emergent situation.

Thakur said investigation of samples for Covid-19 were being done at four places viz. IGMC, Shimla, Dr. Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College, Tanda, IHBT, Palampur in Kangra district and Central Research Institute, Kasauli in district Solan.

He said the State Government had notified five hospitals as dedicated hospitals for Covid-19 including Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Government Medical College, Nerchowk, district Mandi, ESI Hospital, Katha Baddi in Solan district, Charitable hospital Bhota in district Hamirpur, Civil Hospital, Sarahan, in district Sirmaur and Agarwal hospital, Jwalamukhi, district Kangra.

Thakur said that under Active Case Finding Campaign launched in the State, over 70 lakh people had been covered and out of these about 10,000 persons had been identified with influenza like illness (ILI) symptoms, who were being examined.

GOVT STRESSING ON HOME-BASED TEACHING, SAYS CM

Himachal Government has launched ‘Har Ghar Pathshala’ programme to provide home-based teaching facility to the students so that their studies do not suffer due to curfew imposed in the state in wake of corona pandemic, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said.

Presiding over the meeting of education department here, he said under this programme, multiple programmes were being used to ensure maximum reach of the students, pointing out that a three hours slot per day on Doordarshan Shimla was focusing on classes X and XII. Besides, online classes were also being conducted by teachers via whatsapp and centralized website. He said that efforts were on to start teaching module through All India Radio to ensure maximum coverage as well.

Thakur said the Government was also contemplating to honour the teachers of education department for developing best academic contents for the programme besides ensuring effective implementation of these programme in their schools. He said that focus should be laid on providing best contents to the students on important subjects besides ensuring coverage of all classes from I to XII standard.

The CM said effective and acceptable mechanism must be evolved for providing marks to the students of Plus two in vocational subjects where paper could not be conducted due to lockdown. He said that a foolproof mechanism should also be developed for evaluation of answer sheets. He said that the department of education should also prepare an effective exit plan so that functioning of educational institutions could be normalized as soon as possible.

23,25-4-20,Hry CM urges farmers to adopt crop diversification,"Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday exhorted the farmers' leaders to encourage farmers to adopt crop diversification and sow crops consuming less water like Maize, Arhar, sesame, Guar, moong etc, instead of rice.

Interacting with the leaders of various farmers’ associations of the State, through video conferencing here, Khattar said that the message needs to be given that to conserve water, instead of sowing paddy, other crops should be sowed with which the same income can be generated

The Chief Minister directed Director General, Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Haryana, Vijay Dahiya to seek complete information from the farmer leaders regarding their suggestions by calling them to the Agriculture Directorate. Apart from this, new water conservation schemes should be formulated within next 15 days, he added. The Chief Minister also gave directions for preparing a consolidated plan of bore wells in fields and ponds for ground water recharge.

In the meeting, Mukesh Yadav, a progressive farmer from Manjhawali village in Faridabad district, suggested that the farming models of progressive farmers should be visited by other farmers. On this, the Chief Minister directed the officers to prepare a list of 50 to 100 farmers in every district and observe the model adopted by these progressive farmers. He said that the farmers should also adopt the same to increase their income.

Khattar said last year, Haryana had set an example in the country, by starting 'Crop Diversification Pilot Scheme' to grow maize, arhar and other crops in place of paddy in 50,000 hectare area in paddy dominated districts. It was informed that now the scheme has been expanded to an area of 1,00,000 hectares. He said that it is necessary now that the farmer leaders should also come forward for this initiative so that we can ensure water conservation for future generations.

The Chief Minister assured the farmer leaders that as the government has procured mustard and bajra, every single grain of maize grown in place of paddy would be purchased at the minimum support price. He also informed that a committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Additional Chief Secretary, Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Department, Sanjeev Kaushal, for addressing issues related to farmers.

While interacting directly with about 16 farmer leaders through video conferencing, the Chief Minister appealed to motivate the farmers to make up their minds to reduce paddy sowing and take advantage of the schemes launched by the government.

Giving the example of Gram Panchayat Pentawas Kalan in District Charkhi Dadri, the Chief Minister said that the Panchayat has passed a resolution not to sow paddy crop in their village, which itself is a big consideration for any Panchayat. He said that the dark zone, depleting level of groundwater and its excessive exploitation has become a challenge for us. He said that we have begun to solve these challenges for the sake of the future generations and to save water as well as electricity.

The Chief Minister appealed to the farmer leaders that the Panchayats who have given their panchayat land on contract should also appeal to the tenants to sow maize, arhar and other crops in place of paddy and contribute to make the campaign ‘Jal Hi Jeevan Hai’ successful. He said that farmers should understand that growing one kilogram of paddy consumes 3000 to 5000 liters of water and the department has started this scheme to reduce this consumption of water.

In addition, some farmer leaders also said that migrant labourers would not be available due to the Covid-19 pandemic and therefore may face problems in growing paddy this time. In the meeting, the Chief Minister was also informed that instead of paddy, farmers of some districts also grow Dhaincha crop after harvesting the wheat crop which is used for fodder as well as green manure, which increases the fertility of the land. The Chief Minister was informed that 29000 quintal Dhaincha crop seeds have been made available by the department through Haryana Seed Corporation.

Expressing gratitude towards the Chief Minister for the extensive arrangements made to carry out the procurement of mustard and wheat in a phased manner, despite the nationwide lockdown period, the farmer leaders informed that till April 27, the farmers have been asked to register on ‘Meri Fasal Mera Boyra’, but they are facing problems in registration in Saral Kendras and mandis. On this, the Chief Minister directed the officers to ensure that youth running their startup should be immediately sent for registration in the villages along with laptop and dongle.

Similarly, farmer leaders also informed about the problem faced by the farmers for moisture checking of mustard in the mandis. Responding to this, the Chief Minister suggested that Panchayats should purchase moisture meter at their level so that the farmers can get the moisture checked before going to the mandis. He said that the officers should explore the possibilities for the same.

In the video conferencing, Principal Secretary to Chief Minister, Rajesh Khullar, Additional Principal Secretary to Chief Minister, V. Umashankar, Additional Chief Secretary of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Department, Sanjeev Kaushal and Director General, Vijay Dahiya were also present.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hry-cm-urges-farmers-to-adopt-crop-diversification.html

38,25-4-20,"Decentralisation, fiscal autonomy can do wonders","Just before the Panchayati Raj Diwas on April 24, the Odisha Government in an exemplary policy decision, and extraordinary step towards a meaningful act of democratic decentralisation, has delegated the Sarpanches with the power of district Collectors within their jurisdictions in accordance with the provisions of the Disaster Management Act,2005, read with the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 and the Odisha Covid-19 regulation.

The entire exercise is done to effectively take policy decisions at gram panchayat level so as to contain corona infection and efficiently carry out the registration and quarantine exercises.

Surprisingly, so far Odisha remains the only State to do this. This is being said here to not only to highlight the democratic decentralisation of power in attaining effective and practical governance only at the level of Panchayati Raj Institutions as envisaged in the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments, but to show, the essence of optimum democratic decentralisation across the federal structure in attaining good governance.

Over the last many weeks, as we have faced the worst humanitarian crisis of our times, one thing that has come to the forefront is the governance model and leadership in governance shown by the Chief Ministers of different States and the proactive role played by the bureaucracy across the country in policy designing and implementation, to contain the spread of the virus.

Some States have empowered the district administrations to take autonomous and independent decisions at their levels after understanding the ground realities. This is not only prudent but also pragmatic. With the citizens remaining indoors, the steps taken by the respective State Governments and the State machinery have indeed shown us that, ‘minimum Government and maximum Governance’ is not actually impossible. But it seems that, the crux lies in a pragmatic, effective democratic decentralisation of power at all levels.

In fact, much before the Union Government, the State Governments have taken crucial steps in containing, preventing and combating Covid-19 infection and its spread, both by significant policy designs and decisions and use of legal means such as invocation of Disaster Management Act, 2005 and Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. The Governments of Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka have not only been doing pretty well in designing their policies to cater to the situation, but have effectively established communication with the public in conveying their decisions with clarity.

Man is to err, so it is obvious that, there have been instances of flaws in implementing the decisions but even then, the tailoring of the policies have been broadly welcome and have specifically addressed the local concerns, be it Bhilwara in Rajasthan or the Odisha story of effective containment, and many standalone Covid-19 hospitals within a short period of time. Any way, they have become the laboratories of policies and governance. May be, it is that face of the bureaucracy and political leadership which we have least seen before, as the role they are playing now as ‘founts of reasoned authority’.

However, even though the State Governments have shown extraordinary leadership but there has always been a boundary imposed by the federal arrangement. According to experts, under such a federal arrangement there has always been firstly, a hindrance before the State Governments to have access to funds and therefore are often forced to design their own welfare packages; secondly, the criticalities of public finance management system which pose a bottleneck in procuring medical equipment and other essential healthcare products and thirdly, access to essential goods and services where it is supposed to reach them through a pan India process of production, transportation and supply chain. So, it is time to do away with such limitations, and the State Governments and local bodies are empowered to take much of such managerial exercises and the Union Government is to simply monitor the broad network of such activities.

Indian federalism as understood from the premises of the Indian Constitution has always been about equal partnership between the Centre and the States. The seventh Schedule has clearly demarcated the domains of action as regards legislation and consequent implementation and administration between the State and the Central Governments, while matters of national importance have remained with the Central Government. Subjects like agriculture, law and order, public health and sanitation have remained with the States and they have been absolutely vested with State ’s domain of activity.

The intent behind such provisions have been even farther than what is imagined of, being equal players in policy, legislation and administration to fiscal autonomy of the States in order to structure and implement policies according to the necessities at the ground level of the particular demographic setup. However, in practice, things have been quite different from the theory envisaged in the Constitution, as truly said by the Supreme Court in SR Bommai v. Union of India, that is, the Centre has always treated States as mere “appendages of the Centre”.

But the current crisis that we are facing now has made us go decentralised. The repeated conversation through video conferencing between the Prime Minister and the Chief Ministers, most importantly the address by the Prime Minister to Sarpanches across India, are nothing but the growing realisation by those in the helm of the affairs that, it is wiser, effective and practical to decentralise power in the sake of better and optimum governance.

Having said so, it is also important to understand that, the States apart from greater administrative autonomy should have increased share in total tax revenues to handle such situations, with the strength and vigour which is essentially rooted in financial strength. As recommended by the 14th Finance Commission the States should get an increased share out of the total tax revenues from 32 percent to 42 percent. However, on the contrary, what we have seen in the recent past is the increase in States contribution in various Centrally Sponsored Schemes.

It is not difficult to understand now that, democratic decentralisation of power, transparency and financial autonomy at all levels of governance can better our prospects not only in the current moment of corona crisis but in the long run as an efficient and vibrant democracy and economy.

40,25-4-20,"Centre appreciates Haryana’s Covid response, says Anil Vij","The Centre on Friday praised Haryana's Covid-19 response, lauding its performance on multiple parameters including the recovery rate and better-than-national doubling rate, State Health Minister Anil Vij said.

He said that Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, who held a meeting on the Covid-19 situation with State Health Ministers over videoconferencing, was appreciative of the steps taken by Haryana.

“He appreciated the way Haryana has handled the situation. He was impressed when we informed him that our State's recovery rate was 67.63 per cent. He said it was a good sign. I also informed him that as of today, the state has 86 active Covid patients, the rate of doubling of infections has now increased from 13.5 days to 17 days, while tests per million being conducted were 743, and fatality rate was 1.09 per cent,” Vij said.

The national doubling rate stood at 10 days as on Friday.

Vij said that none of the patients admitted in hospitals in the state is in ICU or has needed ventilator support, adding early detection of cases has helped. He appreciated the role of doctors, nurses and paramedics in taking care of the patients and praised the police force for effectively implementing the lockdown.

The Haryana Health Minister said that during the meeting, the state was told not to use rapid testing kits, as has already been advised by the India Council of Medical Research, the country’s apex medical research body.

Vij said he brought to the Health Ministry's notice that Haryana had procured 25,000 rapid test kits from a South Korean company and it was not using the Chinese ones, but the state was asked to put these also on hold for the time being.

He said over 46 lakh people have been screened for the virus in the state. As many as 9,997 people have complained of some symptoms like difficulty in breathing and the state wanted to use the rapid test kits of the South Korean company for screening them, he said.

Vij said he apprised the Union Health Minister that the Haryana Government on Monday ordered a probe after four samples reported positive for corona virus by a private laboratory tested negative in confirmation tests done at government centres.

“I said the results of this lab were found not correct when samples of the four patients from Ambala district came negative in confirmation tests done at different government labs. I told the minister that it can create havoc in the state if people who are negative turn positive in this manner,” said Vij.

He said Harsh Vardhan has assured that the ICMR will look into the issue and do the needful. As fallout of the incident, Vij said that a committee has been constituted to inspect all the five ICMR-approved private labs in the state. “This committee may visit the premises of the private labs once in 10 days to have on-the-spot assessment. This committee will report to the Director of Health Services,” an official order said.

Meanwhile, Vij said that a central team visited some hospitals and containment zones in the State.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/centre-appreciates-haryana---s-covid-response--says-anil-vij.html

43,25-4-20,Social distancing flouted in Brahmapur,"In spite of the best efforts and repeated requests of the Ganjam district administration to maintain social distancing particularly at business locations and hospitals in Brahmapur, the guidelines are flouted by the people in several places.

The physical distancing norms are hardly maintained in the places like outdoor ticket counter as well as the medicine delivery counters of different departments of the MKCG Medical College Hospital.

On the other hand, the security staffs on duty in these places are unable to control the crowds. The hospital authorities reportedly have instructed to install temporary barricades in these places within three days to tackle the crowd, said MKCG Hospital Dr Santosh Kumar Mishra.

According to information available, the medical authorities so far have tested the swab of 90 corona suspects out of which two are from the MKCG Medical College and the remaining are from different parts of district. The swab of all the suspects was sent to the RMRC in Bhubaneswar for testing. While four corona suspects were admitted into the isolation ward of the MKCG Hospital earlier, two more suspects were admitted in to the isolation ward on Thursday raising the number of patients to six who are currently under treatment, Dr Mishra said.

Meanwhile, as an effective preventive measure, the district administration has imposed restrictions on physical movement of persons in the city after 12 pm. It is found that only 25 percent of the shops of the city are transacting their business and closing their shops before noon.

In spite of lockdown, the pro welfare measures are at place as usual. According to information available, ration received from different voluntary and social organisations have been distributed to 20,000 families and 22,000 beneficiaries have received their amount. Each family was given rice, five kg dal, refine oil, flattened rice and sugar for their survival.

Notably, 43,000 families of Brahmapur so far have been included under Food Securities Act to avail benefits. The beneficiaries were given rice and wheat for three months during first phase of distribution and during last three days each of the 22,000 families were now given cash of Rs 1, 000 each, said Brahmapur Municipal (BeMC) Commissioner Chakravarti Singh Rathore.

The district BJP also distributed dry foods and masks to the poor families residing in and around Kumbhar Sahi and Malikeswar temple on Thursday in which Old Brahmapur Mandal president Binayak Rath, former district president of the party KC Pati; district Yuva Morcha president Sidhanta Gangadev; district vice-present Prabhat Sadangi were present.

Meanwhile, the city police have succeeded in unearthing guthka worth crores of rupees by intensifying raids on various guthka godowns in Desibehera Street and Jena Street of the city and seized guthka worth crores during last three days here, sources said.

While apprising Modi of the Covid-19 situation in the State, Patnaik reportedly informed the Prime Minister that about 10 lakh devotees assemble in Puri to celebrate the mega festival every year. The two leaders discussed as to how to maintain social distancing when a large number people would gather for the Car Festival, which is scheduled on June 23.

Meanwhile, Jagannath culture researcher Bhaskar Mishra said the Rath Yatra has been held uninterrupted since 1736.

Opposition parties Congress and BJP have urged the State Government to take a decision on holding the Rath Yatra at the earliest.

According to the schedule, construction of chariots of the deities should begin on April 26 and Snana Yatra, the annual ceremonial bathing ritual of the deities at the temple, will be held in early June.

The Jagannath Temple has remained closed for devotees since March 22 though the rituals at the shrine are followed by the priests as usual.

Meanwhile, the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA) has begun discussions on the issue with Govardhan Peeth Shankaracharya Swami Nischalananda Saraswati and Puri Gajapati Maharaja Dibyasingha Deb.

However, Shreemandir chief servitor Janardan Pattajoshi Mohapatra has suggested that the Rath Yatra, if organised this year, should be a low-key event to follow the tradition.

In a letter to the Shankaracharya, he wrote, “If the lockdown period continues up to the day of Rath Yatra, we would like to submit that the festival must still be performed for the important reason that the Rath Yatra constitutes not just a festive procession but an important ritual/event.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/naveen-speaks-to-modi-over-rath-yatra.html

52,25-4-20,PUNJAB TO AGAIN RAISE SALE OF LIQUOR ISSUE WITH PM,"Punjabis have a reason to keep up their spirits. A day after Centre’s decision against allowing liquor sale in the State, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh has resolved to once again discuss the issue of “prohibition” with the Prime Minister Modi on Monday for enabling the people of the State to raise a toast in the days of low feeling.

Unhappy with the Centre’s denial, Capt Amarinder on Friday said that he would again raise the issue with the Prime Minister during the scheduled video conferencing on Monday.

At the same time, he questioned the connection between the spread of the novel coronavirus and the sale of liquor — which the state has been demanding to generate revenue amidst fiscal crunch.

“I will again raise the issue of reopening alcohol business to generate revenue during Monday’s video conference with the Prime Minister,” said the Chief Minister during a webinar with nearly 100 industrialists and senior executives, foreign envoys and others on Friday.

Pointing out that Punjab was a small state, he asked how the Centre expected it to cope with the current crisis without GST (Goods and Services Tax) and without liquor sales.

Punjab had made a formal request after the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, in its consolidated revised guidelines on April 15 for the second phase of lockdown that runs till May 3, categorically stated that no liquor shop will be permitted to open anywhere in the country. Only a day before, Punjab’s plea to resume sale of liquor in the state amidst the lockdown was rejected by the Union Ministry.

The guidelines stated, there will be a strict “ban” on sale of liquor, gutka and tobacco during the lockdown, and no permission was either given to bars to remain open during the lockdown period.

After the guidelines, two northeastern states — Assam and Meghalaya — which had earlier allowed sale of liquor in the first phase of lockdown from March 25 to April 14, also ordered them to shut down starting April 15.

Questioning the logic behind closing liquor shops, Capt Amarinder said: “What’s the connection between coronavirus and liquor sale? Coronavirus spreads through mucus. You have allowed vegetables to be sold in the open. But, what’s the logic behind banning the sale of liquor in sealed bottles? This is affecting state revenue.”

Capt Amarinder pointed that Punjab has incurred revenue losses of Rs 6,200 crore because of the ban on liquor sales during the lockdown period, while Centre is also not ready to assist us and releasing state’s pending GST arrears.

Punjab’s GST compensation of approximately Rs 4,400 crore for the last four months – from December 2019 to March 2020 – was pending for disbursement by the Union Government.

On the other hand, the state’s committed expenditure — including debt servicing, pensions, salaries, relief measures for Covid-19, healthcare and infrastructure — is budgeted at

Rs 7,301 crore for April 2020.

As Capt Amarinder would raise the issue with the Prime Minister during the video conference meeting, he is expected to be joined by the Chief Ministers of other states too including Delhi and Kerala. Even Haryana too is keen to start the liquor business.

Liquor sales are a significant source of revenue for Punjab, which is currently facing a severe financial situation without the Centre’s assistance.

In fact, instances of liquor smuggling are being reported from different parts of the state. Only a day before, an illegal liquor distillation plant in Khanna was busted, with the arrest of five men and seizure of 1,857 cartons of illicit liquor along with machines, vehicles, and Rs 5.8 lakh cash.

Several states are keen the Centre allows sale of liquor. BJP-ruled Assam and Meghalaya had ordered opening of distilleries and liquor sales to resume when a three-week lockdown was about to end on April 14 but was extended till May 3.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-to-again-raise-sale-of-liquor-issue-with-pm.html
53,25-4-20,‘Ensure health insurance for journalists’,"Expressing concern over a large number of journalists in Mumbai testing positive for Covid-19, Union minister Pratap Sarangi on Friday urged the Centre to introduce a health insurance scheme for scribes covering the pandemic in line with the one for frontline health workers.

62,25-4-20,Increasing the reach of digital learning in India,"The wave of digital learning reached India in 2016 with the launch of SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active-Learning for Young Aspiring Minds) platform by Ministry of Human Resource Development. However, the foundation was already laid down by NPTEL and e-PG Pathshala, a decade ago with the availability of e-contents in the form of audio-video, text etc with free availability for all.

The author remembers attending a workshop on open educational resources (OERs) in Faculty Development Centre (FDC) of HNB Garhwal University, Srinagar, with other faculty participants. Apart from many eye opening sessions, one got the essence of digital /blended/ flipped learning through OERs and SWAYAM Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). During a session, professor Rajat Agarwal from the Department of Business Management, IIT Roorkee had said, “This train is going ahead and those who board early will reach the destination of the digital world earlier; digital education is the future.” Within a few months, I got two MOOC proposals approved by two different national coordinators. With the help of training extended by UGC/ MHRD in IIM Bangalore and NITTTR Chennai, the courses were developed. Both The two MOOCs ‘Academic Writing’ and ‘Industrial Pharmacy’ performed very well. Moreover, Academic Writing MOOC was ranked number one in July 2019 cycle with maximum exam registration. These were the happy moments which refreshed us after tiring journey of developing two MOOCs together. We had the feeling of “mission accomplished” but it was just the first insight of the entire story.

Just developing MOOCs was not serving the actual need of the education system. The awareness level even in urban areas about digital learning initiatives like SWAYAM is very low. Most of the universities and faculty members do not want to change the conventional teaching and learning process. The challenge was not the production but marketing of the same as a thumb rule of management. So, after checking the success and failure story of various platforms, one realised that having good intention without significant results takes even a major project down. It happened with many ICT initiatives of MHRD for the time being. Many of the e-contents were hardly viewed. When the government is spending huge amount of taxpayers’ money, the results must be tangible with fixed accountability. The success model of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, US) and many world leaders of digital learning are just having commercial interest. But SWAYAM is carrying the Vishwaguru legacy forward.

SWAYAM, the digital platform of MHRD has a plethora of courses and contents for the learners of classes IX to PhD and even for the faculty members in the form of ARPIT (Annual Refresher Programme in Teaching). Moreover, 20 per cent of credits of a semester may be earned through SWAYAM MOOCs. The contents are used also for blended and flipped learning.

The challenge is to take SWAYAM to the grassroot level and to address the fear among faculty members that digital education is being disseminated to replace them. This will increase the willingness to accept even from the administrative part of the institutions. The awareness level must be identified in each region of the country and a need-based strategy must be planned to address the problem. In Uttarakhand, where connectivity and speed of the internet is the major challenge in many remote areas and even in an educational hub like Srinagar (Garhwal), a strong strategy must be planned based on the inputs and suggestions of the stakeholders of that area. Recently, the Uttarakhand Government has taken the initiative of establishing an e-learning lab in every government PG college. Now we have the courses, we have the experts, we have the contents, but what we don't have the users of this platform in the tune of our population of young learners. In COVID-19 scenario when the entire country is in lockdown, the importance of SWAYAM and SWAYAMPRABHA and other ICT -initiatives of MHRD, Government of India has been revalidated by the historic boom of its users. Amid the COVID -19 lockdown, the Indian Government has made it mandatory for all the DTH providers to telecast the SWAYAMPRABHA educational channels and this is a great step in increasing the reach of digital education to the larger population of the country. The need of the hour is to bring more and more regular classroom learners to SWAYAM. And the dissemination of this needs the support of every citizen of our country. At this moment one remembers what Rabindranath Tagore said 100 years ago- “Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high, where knowledge is free…”. In continuation of this spirit, can we take up the challenge to make knowledge accessible to all citizens and the next generation through digital learning?

We, as humans have that innate propensity allowing our peculiarities squeeze out of ourselves when pressed in a water tight compartment. It is our coping mechanism first and later, a forte.

So this lockdown is a 'semicolon' in a 'polysyndeton'! ...I couldn't think of a better metaphor!

This read is far from how the pandemic has brought the economic arena to a turmoil, so chill !

We actually needed this. Driving high on a long haul , a sudden speed breaker!

While you were doing the dishes and thinking of the laundry, you were also feeling gratitude of having to do the dishes; which assures you of the grains in the house. While playing it up...cooking , mopping , sweeping etc... and recording, the jocular memes and other tuck on the social media... we know we are happy souls.

Souls!

There are species of 'souls' who, if were given even more flourishing senses, in the court of Mother Nature , would undisputingly win their claim on Earth .

There is this clan of yellow butterflies swarming my garden all day long. My husband, owing to the job he is in , has to move out in the city , tells me about these lemon coloured winged caterpillars being the new inhabitants of the town.

Adjacent to my house , stands a traffic light.

So, honk and beeps, wheel roar-rush , hooters hooting are the perennial deafening melodies we are ears to without a choice.

I repeat...'we are ears to...'

....were these noises defeaning 'only ' us !?!

I answer myself in a 'no'.

And these raptors and fledlings are so naive. Sans rancour , they returned.

Parrot, koel , pigeon and sparrow , yellow beaked joy , owl and crow.

Since when did they not belong here! And where were they all this while?

That they are here now, let us connect with their soul.

They don't seek food from us nor do they tax upon our lives. Only some calm.

This Earth is theirs as much.

So, dear yellow butterflies and chirpy birdies, joy abundant for all of us !

Though the allegations are yet to be proved correct, they have influenced public opinion regarding Chinese products.

Ram Singh Kohli, a toy and gift store owner in Rajpur said, “More than 40 per cent of the gifts and toys are generally imported from China because the made in India products are costlier and the customers prefer cheaper products.

But considering China’s dubious role in the pandemic and its negative impact on the economy of several countries, I am not going to import any Chinese products.” After the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no point in buying Chinese products because the scare of the spread of the virus will remain for at least the next two years whether China is responsible for it or not, said the owner of a cosmetic store Ritu Sharma.

Many local customers have also emphasised on not purchasing Chinese products after the lockdown. Karnpur resident Ruchika Bhalla said that all the claims of China being responsible for the spread of COVID-19 appears true so the countries should not help their economy by buying Chinese products.

“I have always preferred to buy made in India products but now is the high time when everyone should stop buying any Chinese products, especially during the festivals like Diwali and Holi.

Everyone should buy Indian products and contribute to making our economy strong,"" added Bhalla. However, some shopkeepers and locals opined that people do not care about China or Indian products once they see the price.

71,25-4-20,Education Dept acting under pvt schools pressure: UAS,"The Uttarakhand Abhibhavak Sangh (UAS) has alleged that the State education department is influenced by some private schools. The department takes decisions under the influence of some private schools, alleged the UAS. The Sangh questioned why the Uttarakhand Government was lagging behind when various State Governments have provided relaxation in school fees during the lockdown. ""The education department recently declared that the parents who are capable of depositing the fee should submit it. Subsequently, the schools bombarded parents with several messages and emails reminding them to pay the fee that includes activity charges and lab charges besides tuition fee. Why is nothing being done against such schools?” questioned the UAS president Ram Kumar Singhal.

He further added that the government just heard the side of Principals Progressive Schools’ Association (PPSA) and did not consider how the parents will deposit the fee during such a crisis. According to the members of UAS, the parents have to buy new sets of books in the new session that costs thousands of rupees which is quite difficult to afford during the lockdown for several parents.

But the State Government is not giving any relaxation to parents, all it cares for is the private schools and their requirements, stated the members. ""We will not accept it and we will not pay any kind of school fee during the lockdown. If other states can provide relaxation to the parents, our government can do it too. If needed, we will go to High Court too but will not submit to such irresponsible behaviour of the government and schools,"" stated Singhal.

Talking about the private schools asking for the fee including all the other charges, chief education officer Asha Rani Painuly said, ""The parents must be looking at the old fee structure on schools' website as I recently received some similar complaints. Most of the schools have updated their website with a new fee structure."" Painuly added that the schools have been instructed by the government to charge only tuition fees during the lockdown period. On being asked about the schools pressurising parents by sending emails and messages to deposit the fee, Painuly said that those who cannot submit the fee currently can reply to the school administration that they are incapable of paying the fee for now. The parents cannot be forced to pay the fee during the lockdown, stated Painuly.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/education-dept-acting-under-pvt-schools-pressure--uas.html

Yadav said that, despite being an elected panchayat representative of this region, despite the demand of distributing food and rescue materials to the needy in the villages falling under the ambit of Bokaro Thermal Establishment and necessary sanitization etc. for protection from Corona local officials were indifferent. But the formalities were completed by distributing only one hundred rupees worth of food items by arbitrarily flouting the social distance among some people by the local officials who came into action after talks with the high officials of the headquarters.

Whereas the Central Government, State Government and District Administration had called upon all PSUs to discharge their respective social obligations. Therefore, the apathy of the local management in this matter will be conveyed at all levels.

Civil surgeon John F Kennedy described this youth’s health card as asymptomatic and all healthy with no remote sign or symptom of any morbidity.

SDPO, Lesliganj, Anup Baraik, said, “The youth was buried with body bag. It was not opened at all. His family members cooperated with us. The body in bag was straight taken down to the grave yard.”

Baraik said, “Some family members wanted thebody in bag to be given to them but we knew their sentiments, emotions and tremendous grief over the death of the youth would made them ignore health safeguards and so we did a hard persuasion and this family agreed to our point which was body in bag at graveyard not at home.”

Baraik said the burial was done quite silently and without any protest or resistance. The village mourned but not erupted in any anger suspicion or doubt unlike other places where cremation or burial is now a challenging task.

However Baraik said some in the Muslim community wanted last bath for the dead which is a very important post death ritual in Islam but here permission for last bath would have meant opening of the body bag which was not beneficial from health point to any one and so here again police did hard job and got the family ready to skip this rite more for the peace of the dead and the family did accordingly.

SP Ajay Linda said police are waiting for the post mortem report. The post mortem has been done by a board of 3 doctors.

Sources said the family has expressed its utmost suspicion over the death of the youth in the governmental quarantine centre citing allegations that this youth was given a separate room, the window from where it is said he hanged himself to death is very low in height, there is scratch on his one hand only, a woman with grams went to his room on Wednesday evening and finally police found this body in bed not hanging then who the inmate is to remove and place this body in bed.

SP Palamu Ajay Linda said, “Police are investigating this case from all angles. This inmate lived single in that centre. He had wounds on his left wrist only. There was a ball pen with its nib broken. “

Linda said a woman who is the inmate of this centre did go to his room with gram only to find him dead there.

SP agreed the body was found in bed when police reached there but he added this could be when some good samaritans tried hard to untie the hanging knots with the hope the fellow may resuscitate to life.

Linda said call details of this youth had found him ‘only talking on phone’ for 4 days that he spent at this centre from day one April 18 to day end April 22.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/burial-in-palamu-helps-humanity-shine-in-extreme-distress.html

Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel on Friday requested Union food and consumer welfare minister Ramvilas Paswan to permit to raise the rice procurement limit for the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in the current kharif marketing year from 24 lakh MT to 31.11 lakh MT.

In a letter to Paswan, the CM said that the current circumstances due to Covid-19 pandemic have created increased requirement of rice in the other states as well.

“Due to which, the FCI had to transport food grains to other states in April 2020. This has created an empty space in the warehouses of the FCI in Chhattisgarh, He said.

For the prevention of Covid-19 pandemic, the state government is making consistent efforts in an integrated manner with awareness and compassion, Baghel said in the letter.

“To prevent the spread of Covid-19 infection, the lockdown has been in effect in Chhattisgarh as well, and it is being implemented without interruptions, as per the guidelines. The Centre’s Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Ann Yojana is also being implemented effectively, which has brought great relief to people of the state,” he said.

“In view of the current circumstances, I would like to draw your attention towards the fact that in Chhattisgarh, a total 83.67 lakh tons of paddy was procured from 18.34 lakh farmers in 2019-20.

“Paddy procurement and collection of custom milling rice is done in the state as per the MoU signed between the Chhattisgarh government and the Union food and public distribution department, the chief minister said.

The Section 18 of the MoU signed between the Chhattisgarh government and Union food and public distribution department includes the provision that states the FCI should procure all the surplus rice, he said.

In a letter, the Union public distribution department had given permission to procure 24 lakh tons of Usna rice in kharif marketing year 2019-20 under central pool of the FCI.

In KMY 2019-20, out of the 56.51 lakh MT of rice produced from the 83.67 lakh tons of paddy procured in Chhattisgarh, the state government will procure 25.40 lakh MT of rice for PDS requirement of the state (Central pool 15.48 lakh metric ton, State Pool 9.92 lakh metric ton) and remaining 31.11 metric tons of rice will be surplus, the CM said in his letter.

Out of which the Centre will permit FCI to procure 24 lakh MT of rice, which will redress only 73.30 lakh MT of the procured rice, whereas nearly 10.47 lakh metric tons of paddy (proportionate to 7.11 lakh metric tons of rice) will remain unaddressed, he said.

Under the circumstances created due to Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown will have long-term adverse effect on the economy of the nation as well as the states, Bgahel said.

“In this situation, if the surplus rice in Chhattisgarh is not redressed properly, the state may incur losses worth nearly Rs 1500 crore, which will further adversely impact economic development of the state in this already critical situation.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/baghel-urges-centre-to-extend-rice--procurement-limit-under-central-pool.html

Indore, after slight recession in number of positive patients yet again exploded with fresh cases as 84 new cases of coronavirus patients were reported on Friday taking up the tally of total positive patients to 1029 including 55 deaths and 79 patients who have recovered completely.

Besides Indore, the State capital too has ended up a breeding ground of covid19 cases as the city reported 37 new cases by morning on Friday which led to the overall tally reaching 340.

Ujjain is no better as tally of positive cases have reached to 101 here with 11 deaths while Khargone too has been a hotspot of covid19 with 60 cases of infection till now including five deaths.

As the country is inching closer to conclusion of second phase of lockdown by May 3, the State Government is worried about several red zones including these four districts where Covid19 is yet to subside.

Couple of days ago, talking to a news channel, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had expressed satisfaction over the fact that half the State was corona-free adding districts like Shivpuri have reined in Covid19 spread.

Chouhan, however, had added that districts including Indore, Bhopal, Ujjain and Khargone could not get relaxation after May 3.

Health and Minister for Home Narottam Mishra during an interaction with the media in Bhopal on Thursday too had hinted that four worst affected districts could see lockdown extended beyond May 3.

Adding that Indore is still the worst affected district in the State, Mishra had feared that the city could see one more surge in positive cases.

Bhopal Collector Tarun Pithode on Friday also claimed that administration was considering extension of lockdown in Bhopal where 10,000 samples were taken, report for 6,000 has been received and remaining is pending.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lockdown-extension-in-four-mp-dists-likely-after-may-3.html
102,25-4-20,BJP flays ‘free rice’ through PDS,"Leader of Opposition in the state assembly Dharamlal Kaushik on Friday criticized the state government’s policy of free distribution of ration through PDS shops, terming it as a deception.

The state government is indulging in trading of rice through the panchayat and civic bodies, Kaushik said in a statement.

The government is charging Rs 32.00 per kg of rice from the panchayat while from the urban bodies, it charging Rs 33.13 per kg, he said.

“It means that the state government is selling rice to the local self-governing bodies from the state civil supplies corporation. In the open market, the price of rice is less than what the government is charging,” Kaushik said.

The BJP leader said then it can never be said to be free distribution, when the local self-governing bodies are paying for it.

On issuing of ration cards, he said, earlier the state government said all ration cards have been made. Now, from where did the people not holding ration card have emerged?

“It is double flip-flop on the part of the state government, which it should clarify,” he said.

Kaushik also said that the BJP will constitute an internal three-member committee to probe into the alleged suicide of a young sarpanch in the assembly constituency of the chief minister on Thursday.

Terming the incident on occasion of the ‘National Panchayati Raj Day’ as most unfortunate, he said, “A human being makes all efforts to survive but is forced to take extreme step when left with no other option or his voice goes unheard.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-flays----free-rice----through-pds.html

117,25-4-20,"Guv writes to Mamata, accuses her of minority appeasement","The ongoing war of words degenerated into a grimy war of letters with Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar casting a 13-page memo at Mamata Banerjee accusing the Chief Minister of “minority appeasement” “cover up her monumental failures in tackling” the corona pandemic in the State.

With daggers drawn from both sides over their mutual claim of mastery as corona warriors Banerjee had on Thursday shot off a stringent letter to Dhankhar questioning the “tone, tenor of your languages and messages to me” and wondering how a ‘nominated functionary’ could humiliate an elected office.

On Friday the Governor — who had for the past a few days been rebuking the Government for below par performance and not keeping him informed about the pandemic situation — slapped a blunt reply accusing the Chief Minister for her alleged minority politics.

He wrote, “your appeasement of the minority community was so explicit and awkward on the Nizamuddin Markaz incident. This is most unfortunate and cannot be appreciated,” in an apparent reference to how the Chief Minister had during a press conference reprimanded a journalist for asking communal questions when he asked her to comment on the whereabouts of the Tablighi Jamaat attendees who might have come to Bengal from Delhi’s Nizamuddin area.

Though the Left and Congress had earlier blamed the Chief Minister for minority communalism that created by default, a ground for the BJP’s Hindutva politics in Bengal, “no Chief Minister let alone Mamata Banerjee had ever received a similar official admonition from a constitutional office,” critics said.

Referring to the Chief Minister’s letter he further wrote, “your constant refrain of Governor being 'nominated' is lamentable and can be ascribed only to elementary ignorance of the Constitution.”

As the Governor he could not be expected to be in “sleep mode” when the State was in a “stressful condition” or work as a post office or a rubber stamp he iterated alerting the Chief Minister about another letter from him with vivid details to follow in future saying, “this response be taken as initial one and a thorough one will be imparted to you tomorrow with complete documentation so that people of the state, as you say, are made aware and come to know the series of acts of indignities and indiscretions heaped by you, your ministers on the Governor all through.”

Urging the Chief Minister to “disable your political antenna” and shun confrontational politics which would only increase miseries of the people of the State the Governor said “your communication is part of the alibi strategy that emanates from a script that seeks to cover up monumental failures in these challenging times by a series of blunders.”

Among the blunders the Governor underscored the alleged suppression of facts regarding the number of corona infections and deaths in the State apart from large-scale mismanagement in public distribution system that led to a police-public clash at Baduria in North 24 Parganas leaving several men in uniform injured. The Baduria incident was just a “tip of the iceberg,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/guv-writes-to-mamata--accuses-her-of-minority-appeasement.html

127,25-4-20,"Health Ministry OK’s pool testing, plasma therapy in Maha","The Union Health Ministry on Friday gave a go-ahead to the Maharashtra Government to undertake “Pool testing” for suspected Covid-19 patients and “Plasma therapy” to treat coronavirus patients in the State.

While interacting with State Health Ministers and Secretaries across the country, Union Health Minister Dr Harsha Varshan accepted the Maharashtra Government’s request to undertake “Pool Testing” and “Plama Therapy” to deal with the coronavirus situation in the State.

Announcing this, State Health Minister Rajesh Tope said: “Some days back, we had requested the Centre to permit us to undertake “Pool Testing” and “Plama Therapy” to deal Covid-19 patients in the state. Today, the Union Health Minister gave us a formal go ahead to us in this regard”.

In view of the fact that the Covid-19 cases are rising exponentially in India, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has favoured the “Pool Testing” . “It is critical to increase the number of tests conducted by laboratories. Positivity rate in cases is still low. Hence, it may help to use the pooled samples for screening,” ICMR has said in one of its advisories.

A pooled testing algorithm involves the PCR screening of a specimen pool comprising multiple individual patient specimens, followed by individual testing (pool deconvolution) only if a pool screens positive. As all individual samples in a negative pool are regarded as negative, it results in substantial cost savings when a large proportion of pools tests negative.

“Pool testing” is very useful for Maharashtra can be evidenced from the fact that it is the worst Coronavirus-affected state in the country. Till Thursday evening, there were as many as 283 deaths and an alarming 6427 cases.

Till Thursday evening, as many as 96,369 samples had been clinically tested, while 89561 cases had turned out to be negative and 6427 persons had tested positive.

Given the gravity of Coronavirus situation in the state, “Plasma therapy” may prove to be boon for Maharashtra. The convalescent “plasma therapy” aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

This therapy's concept is simple and is based on the premise that the blood of a patient who has recovered from Covid-19 contains antibodies with the specific ability of fighting novel coronavirus. The theory is that the recovered patient's antibodies, once ingested into somebody under treatment, will begin targetting and fighting the novel coronavirus in the second patient.

Till Thursday evening, as many as 840 Covid-19 patients have fully recovered and been discharged from various hospitals across the state.

The Delhi government, which had earlier been permission by the Centre to undertake limited “Plasma therapy” trials on the seriously ill patients, has got “encouraging results”. So much so that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has urged recovered coronavirus patients to donate their blood plasma so that it could be used to treat the Covid-19 patients in the national capital.

Meanwhile, the Union Health Minister -- who took stock of the coronavirus situation in various states across the country -- has appreciated the suggestions made by the Maharashtra government that ""Portable Pulse Oxymeter"" and ""X Ray diagnosis "" could be used effectively to treat Covid-19 patients and that the Persona Protection Equipment (PPE) could be re-used through sterilisation.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/health-ministry-ok---s-pool-testing--plasma-therapy-in-maha.html

The 24-year-old Kamlesh Meena walked all the way from Ajmer to reach his village Sherpura in Bhilwara, however, was stopped by villagers while entering into his village fearing corona spread.

He was advised to go to district hospital first and get himself tested. However, Kamlesh refused to go out of his village. As the tension gripped the village, a medical team soon reached the spot and collected the samples of youth. Other medical tests were also done.

132,25-4-20,"ITBP to deploy 8,000 troops permanently in Naxal-hit C’garh","Following nod from the Centre, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) has decided to keep its eight battalions (8,000 troops) in Chhattisgarh for anti-Naxal operations on a permanent basis on the lines of the Indian Army’s Rashtriya Rifles (RR) deployed in Jammu & Kashmir on a fixed basis.

Earlier, the ITBP troops were rotated every three years from the Naxal theatre and the latest move is aimed at bolstering operations against the ultra-Left extremists in Chhattisgarh, the worst Naxal-hit State, officials said.

“The move to deploy battalions on a permanent basis as against rotational basis in Chattisgarh will strengthen the anti-Naxal security grid as the troops will not only have a good grasp of the insurgency dynamics but also a better intelligence network,” an official familiar with the decision said.

As many as eight battalions of the ITBP are deployed for anti-Naxal operations in Chhattisgarh. The ITBP is essentially a border guarding force deployed along the 3,488km Line of Actual Control (LAC) along the frontiers with China. In the rotational deployment, the maximum tenure of an ITBP battalion in Chhattisgarh was three years and every time a new battalion was moved in a pre-induction training was imparted in order to familiarise the troops with topography and the extent of the Naxal menace in the area.

The ITBP’s fixed deployment in Chhattisgarh is modelled on RR that is tasked for anti-terror operations in Jammu & Kashmir.

The RR is an elite counter-insurgency unit of the Army and has permanent in terror-hit Jammu and Kashmir and keeps participating in counter-terror operations with the State police and CRPF. Unlike RR, Army’s battalions are rotated on regular basis.

Following the move, the ITBP battalions will be exclusively used against the Naxals and intensify the operations against them in Chhattisgarh.

Besides containing terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, countering the Naxals is a top priority of the Union Home Ministry that has been harping on intensifying operations against the ultras in Naxalism-hit States.

133,25-4-20,Be prudent in spending: Rajnath to forces,"In view of the financial implications arising due to COVID-19 and the lockdown, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday asked the three Services to use resources prudently and avoid wastage while maintaining operational readiness. He also asked the commanders to identify and prioritise tasks and assist in the revival of the economy after the lockdown is lifted.

The Minister’s directive to the Services chiefs came in the backdrop of the impact of the lockdown on the economy on the whole and likely setback for some months in procurement of weapons systems. The armed forces were asked a few days back to avoid inking new deals in the first quarter of the current fiscal due to economic factors.

Moreover, with the possibility of budgetary constraints or cuts in the near future, the three Services were also asked to put on hold their acquisition processes to buy new weapon systems. The Department of Military Affairs in a letter also asked the forces to put on hold their capital acquisition processes till the time the COVID-19 situation continues in the country, sources said.

Faced with global slowdown, the delivery schedule of 36 Rafale fighter jets is likely to get delayed by some weeks now. The first four jets were scheduled to come to India from France next month. The deal is worth over Rs 59,000 crores.

Similarly, the S-400 missile shield system deal worth over Rs 45,000 crore with Russia may get delayed too though the Russians have assured of timely delivery schedule.

Some other procurement time lines pertaining to tanks, artillery guns and assault rifles from different countries may also get affected besides the Navy’s recent deal with the US for 24 multi-role helicopters.

Given this backdrop, the defence minister in a video-conference here with the commanders of the three Services directed them to initiate measures to spend the financial resources, avoiding wastage in view of the economic burden imposed by COVID-19.

In his address, Singh said he expected the forces to ensure their operational preparedness, “while they are battling COVID-19 and the adversary should not be allowed to exploit the current situation,” defence ministry officials said later.

“Stressing on the requirement of jointness of the armed forces, the Defence Minister asked the Commanders in Chief to identify and prioritise tasks that could be accomplished quickly and assist in revival of the economy after the lockdown is lifted,” the Ministry stated.

The Service Commanders appreciated the recent devolution of emergency financial powers by the Ministry that has ensured timely procurement of necessary medical supplies, to bolster the health infrastructure of the hospitals.

The conference was attended by the three Service Chiefs including General M M Naravane, Admiral Karambir Singh, Air Chief Marshal R K S Bhadauria, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat(CDS),Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar and Secretary (Defence Finance) Gargi Kaul besides other senior officials of the ministry.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/be-prudent-in-spending--rajnath-to-forces.html

Another major project is the ‘Swamitva Yojana’ launched by the Central Government. Under this project, household areas will be mapped via drones. Title deed will be given to property owners post mapping. Swamitva Yojana is already in its trial phase in states like Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh.

""There was a time when less than 100 hundred panchayats across the country were connected to broadband. Today, broadband has reached more than 1.25 lakh panchayats”, he said.

""Indian villages have become a subject of research for international scientists as well as scientists and researchers back home. You have given the 'Do Gaj doori' mantra to the world to combat COVID-19 without using lofty words like social distancing and lockdown.

“It is because of you that the world is discussing how India has managed to combat COVID-19,"" said Prime Minister on the new norms mandated by the one-month-long lockdown across the country.

“It is true that we are faced with obstacles and problems but resolve to keep moving forward with new energy, finding new ways to work, saving the country and advancing the country is strong,” Modi said and assured that the country would emerge stronger through the crisis.

Modi suggested that there should be a sanitisation campaign in villages to ensure minimal spread of coronavirus. The Prime Minister also urged the gram panchayats to make quarantine centres for people coming from cities and to help people with essential needs.

It had cited the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) appeal which noted that the harmful effects of tobacco use are well established and accepted globally. Also the role of tobacco use/spitting in public place in spreading infectious diseases like Coronavirus. Chewing of smokeless tobacco products (gutkha, zarda, khaini and other chewing tobacco products and paan masala) and areca nut (supari) increases the production of saliva followed by a very strong urge to spit.

Spitting in public places increases the dangers of spread of Coronavirus/Covid-19.

States like Bihar, Jharkhand, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarkhand, Maharashtra, Haryana, Nagaland and Assam have already issued orders on the ban of use of smokeless tobacco products and spitting in public places during the Covid epidemic.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/road-ministry-bans-smoking--tobacco-at-work-stations.html
136,25-4-20,Global shares fall as Wall St rally fizzles,"Global shares extended losses Friday as hopes faded for a quick turnaround for the global coronavirus pandemic.

France’s CAC 40 dropped 1.9% in early trading to 4,368.03, while Germany’s DAX fell 1.8% to 10,321.87. Britain’s FTSE 100 shed 1.5% to 5,741.36. U.S. Shares were poised for losses, with the future for the Dow industrials down 0.3% at 23,272.50. The future contract for the S&P 500 lost 0.4% to 2,771.12.

Investor sentiment was again fragile as attention shifted to the economic damage the world is likely to suffer because of the pandemic, says Prakash Sakpal and Nicholas Mapa, economists at ING.

A report from the Financial Times that said an antiviral drug failed to improve conditions in patients in a Chinese clinical trial cast a shadow over hopes it might turn out to be a potential treatment for coronavirus patients.

The report cited documents published accidentally by the World Health Organization. Researchers said the sample size was too small to draw scientifically valid conclusions and the trial ended early.

The Foster City, Calif.-based company behind the drug, Gilead Sciences, said the data represented “inappropriate characterizations” of the China study.

“Investors will continue to be monitoring developments on the Covid-19 front with a setback on clinical testing for a treatment to the virus. Meanwhile, the U.S. Passed a fresh round of stimulus while oil prices continued to inch up slightly,” they said in a commentary.

Market players are also focusing on upcoming policy meetings at the Bank of Japan, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank for signs of what they may say about the state of global economies that appear on the brink of collapse.

Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund voluntarily decided to wind up its six debt schemes citing redemption pressure and lack of liquidity in bond markets due to coronavirus pandemic. This is the first instance when a fund house is shutting its schemes because of coronavirus-related situation.

Market participants are also concerned that a sharp rise in coronavirus cases could weigh on the global as well as the domestic economy.

The number of coronavirus cases around the world has crossed 27 lakh. In India, over 23,000 cases have been reported so far.

“Any piece of bad news regarding coronavirus, rattles the risky assets including rupee and we see it breaching fresh record lows,” Emkay Global Financial Services Head of Research — Currency Rahul Gupta said.

Gupta further noted that “all this while, investors were hoping on flattening coronavirus cases and progress of a vaccine, but now there are doubts in the development of drugs. This uncertainty will continue to fickle the forex market”.

141,25-4-20,Central team indicts Bengal,"The Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT), which inspected healthcare facilities at two dedicated Covid hospitals in Kolkata, has found major anomalies in the existing system like waiting time of five days or more for test results of patients in isolation wards putting even negative ones at risk; bodies lying on the beds of the ward for four long hours while a death certificate is being prepared; and no social distancing being maintained during “chaotic” patient admission process thus increasing the risk of spread of the infection among others.

The IMCT has also sought explanation on the methodology used by State-appointed ‘Committee of Doctors’ to ascertain deaths due to Covid-19 amid suspicions over West Bengal’s coronavirus data. It has written two separate letters to the West Bengal Chief Secretary in this regard and also apprised the Ministry of Home Affairs of the situation.

In his letters, Apurva Chandra, head of the IMCT, sought the State government’s clarification on these observations and further details on its testing capability besides whether all those persons who returned to Kolkata from abroad till March 8 were tested and were found negative.

The team had visited CNCI (Chitranjan National Cancer Institute) and M R Bangur hospitals in Kolkata on Thursday.

“There were a large number of patients in isolation wards of CNCI as well as Bangur hospital awaiting Covid-19 test results for five days or longer. It is not clear why the test results should take such a long time and there is a danger of Covid-19 negative patient acquiring the infection in the hospital while awaiting his test result.

“The patient admission at Bangur hospital appears to be chaotic. There was no social distancing in the waiting area. Two patients appear to be in very poor health but there was no medical support available,” he said.

Though patients from other hospitals are referred to the Bangur facility, the IMCT head noted, “However, it seems the patients are left on their own to report to the hospital and are not escorted. This would always leave scope for some patients not turning up or delaying reporting to the hospital”.

The team noted that there were only 12 ventilators at Bangur hospital while it caters to 354 serious Covid-19 patients. To this, the hospital authorities informed the team that in case a ventilator is not available and ventilator support is required for a patient, the patient is transferred to some other facilities.

Following social media reports that dead bodies were lying on beds in a ward, the IMCT enquired about the matter and found that “it is possible that dead bodies were lying on bed in a ward as it takes at least four hours to issue a death certificate, after which the body is shifted to a mortuary”. The State Government has been asked to furnish records in this regard.

On the State Government’s claim that number of tests having gone up from around 400 per day to 900 per day, the IMCT sought details like how many of these are repeat tests and how many are first time patients. It suggested the State to conduct 2,500 to 5,000 tests a day.

In a separate letter regarding the methodology, the IMCT asked the State chief secretary to explain the methodology used by a Committee of Doctors appointed by the West Bengal government to ascertain whether the deaths being reported are due to coronavirus.

The IMCT asked whether the methodology adopted by the state panel is in line with what has been laid down by the ICMR and sought an interaction with the Committee of Doctors to understand their methodology. It also asked if such a committee exists for any other disease in the state. The team further asked about the time taken by the Committee to reach a conclusion whether a patient died of the virus.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/central-team-indicts-bengal.html
142,25-4-20,BJP lashes out at Bengal Govt,"The BJP on Friday accused the State Government of playing with facts regarding the extent of corona infections in Bengal saying it took two strong letters from the Inter Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) for the State Government to cough up the truth about the exact number of infected people and real number of deaths due to the dreaded virus in the State.

Referring to the objections being raised by his party on earlier occasions on “how the numbers are being fudged”, State BJP president Dilip Ghosh said that the Government should have been honest enough to come out with the genuine numbers (of deaths and infection) instead of suppressing the facts.

The BJP was referring to the two letters of inquiry dashed off by the visiting IMCT to State Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha asking the Government to explain the total number of victims that had corona infections.

The Government later said that the total number of deaths due to corona infection stood at 18 that included three deaths in the past 24 hours. However, it also said that there were 39 other deaths where the patients had corona infections alongwith comorbidity.

“This means that the total number of deaths should be taken as 57 instead of 18,” a senior CPI(M) leader and a former MP said adding “our leaders like Biman Bose and Suryakanto Mishra were arrested a few days ago when they were protesting against suppression of facts.”

Incidentally the Government had filed an FIR against CPI(M) central committee member Sujan Chakrabarty for reporting false cases in the social media.

The Chief Secretary on Friday said that the total number of deaths due to corona were 18 while the total number of active infected patients were 385. This figure included the new 57 cases in the past 24 hours.

Among the seven districts from where reports of corona infections were coming are Kolkata, Howrah, East and West Midnapore, Hooghly and East Burdwan, he said.

The State had conducted a total number of 8,933 tests with 930 tests being conducted in the past one day, the Government said.

Meanwhile, the IMCT on Friday visited a large part of Kolkata and Howrah to gather reports of the extent of corona infections.

143,25-4-20,Cong flays Centre for freezing DA hike,"The Congress on Friday slammed the Government for freezing the Dearness Allowance (DA) of Central Government employees and pensioners and demanded scrapping of the bullet train and central vista projects to save 30 per cent from the Government expenditure.

Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted: ""Cutting the expenditure on dearness allowance is inhuman.""

""It is an insensitive and inhumane decision of the Government to cut DA of central employees, pensioners and jawans who are serving the public while fighting coronavirus, instead of suspending the bullet train project and the Central Vista beautification project of lakhs of crores (of rupees),"" he said in a tweet in Hindi.

Addressing a Press conference on the issue, party chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala too asked the Government to curtail 30 per cent of its own expenses and shelve the Central Vista redevelopment and bullet train projects to save money to be used to fight the coronavirus outbreak.

""The Government of India, instead of helping people by giving them financial support in this crisis, is hurting them. Instead of curtailing its own wasteful expenditures, the Government is cutting the money of the middle class people,"" he told an video press conference.

The Government should scrap their pet projects and save Rs 1,30,000 crore and divert the money to fight COVID-19, added Surjewala.

The Congress said that the decision of the Government will adversely impact the morale of the armed forces.

As part of the austerity drive, the Centre on Thursday announced suspension of DA hike for the central employees till July 2021. Moreover, ministries and departments have also been categorised for fixing a cap on their quarterly expenditure, limiting it to 15-20 per cent of the annual budget expenditure for FY21 in the first quarter.

""Only one month ago, on March 23 , 2020, the Centre passed a budget of Rs. 30.42 Lakh crores. It is, but, presumed that budget is a correct accounting of expected revenue as also expected expenditure. In case, ever, the expected revenue was to fall, the first thing that you will proceed to do, is to cut down wasteful and vanity expenditure rather than hitting at the income of people of India,"" said the party in a statement.

""This is not the first time in the last 30 days that they have proceeded to do so, please remember that only recently in March 2020, the Government had proceeded to reduce the interest across the board of 1-1.5 percent on all national savings schemes. Not only that, the State Bank of India had reduced its interest rate on savings bank accounts from Rs 3.25 to 3 percent and on fixed deposit by half percent. By these two steps alone, Government of India from national savings schemes had deducted Rs 19,000 crore annually from the 30 crore depositors and the national savings scheme and of the 44 crore 51 lakh depositors in State Bank of India by reduction of interests on FDs and on saving accounts, they have lost annually interest component of Rs 9,429 crore,"" Surjewala said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cong-flays-centre-for-freezing-da-hike.html

They are battling against the Centre, not COVID-19,"" Union Minister andsenior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar said.

He alleged that the Congress leader never comes up with a 'constructive suggestion' rather he advises others to oppose the government. Referring to Rahul's latest tweet on the Centre's decision to stop the hike in Dearness Allowance (DA) and Dearness Relief (DR) to all government employees and pensioners in view of the country's financial situation, Javadekar said ""The people of India will not tolerate this type of behaviour.""

""Today's tweet of Rahul Gandhi falls in the same category of opposing the government. This behaviour of Congress at this time will be questioned someday and they will have to explain it then,"" he said. Taking to Twitter, Rahul criticised the Centre for its ""inhuman and insensitive decision"" on DA and DR and reminded the government that crores of rupees could be recouped by suspending the ambitious bullet train project and the Central Vista beautification scheme.

On Thursday, Congress President Sonia Gandhi charged the ruling party with “spreading communal prejudice and hatred”, to that the BJP described former’s comment as “cheap politics” and demanded that she tenders an apology.

With regard to rice planting, the ministry has advised states to promote Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) which require less labour and tend to mature faster than transplanted crops. It has also asked them to promote cultivation of hybrid rice.

Currently, 8 per cent farmers use this method especially in states like Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, it said.

""Our shared commitment is to ensure all people have access to all the tools to defeat COVID-19,"" he said.

The event was co-hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen and Melinda Gates of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

It included UN chief Antonio Guterres as a speaker, as well as global leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.

Conspicuously absent were leaders from China, where the novel coronavirus first surfaced late last year, and from the United States — the country currently hardest-hit by the pandemic, with nearly 50,000 dead and close to 900,000 infected.

Worldwide, more than 190,000 people have died in the pandemic and more than 2.7 million have been infected.

""We face a global public enemy like no other,"" Guterres told the briefing. ""A world free of COVID-19 requires the most massive public health effort in history.""

149,25-4-20,Trump set to sign bill with $500bn more in virus aid,"President Donald Trump will hold a signing ceremony Friday for a bill providing a nearly $500 billion infusion of coronavirus spending, rushing new relief to employers and hospitals buckling under the strain of a pandemic that has claimed almost 50,000 American lives and 1 in 6 US jobs.

The measure passed Congress almost unanimously Thursday, but the lopsided tally belies a potentially bumpier path ahead as battle lines are being formed for much more ambitious future legislation that may prove far more difficult to maneuver through Congress.

The bipartisan measure passed as lawmakers gathered in Washington as a group for the first time since March 27, adopting stricter social distancing rules while seeking to prove they can do their work despite the COVID-19 crisis.

Lawmakers' face masks and bandannas added a somber tone to their effort to aid a nation staggered by the health crisis and devastating economic costs of the pandemic.

“Millions of people out of work,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. “This is really a very, very, very sad day. We come to the floor with nearly 50,000 deaths, a huge number of people impacted, and the uncertainty of it all.”

Anchoring the bill is the Trump administration's $250 billion funding request to replenish a fund to help small- and medium-size businesses with payroll, rent and other expenses.

The payroll programme provides forgivable loans so businesses can continue paying workers while forced to stay closed for social distancing and stay-at-home orders.

It also contains $100 billion demanded by Democrats for hospitals and a nationwide testing program, along with a $60 billion set-aside for small banks and an alternative network of community development banks that focus on development in urban neighbourhoods and rural areas ignored by many lenders.

China has come under increasing pressure from nations across the world, including the US, over the lack of transparency in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has so far claimed more than 190,870 lives globally, with America leading the tally with nearly 50,000 deaths.

President Donald Trump had said his administration was looking into reports that the novel coronavirus ""escaped"" from a Wuhan virology laboratory before it spread to the world.

""I am very confident that the Chinese Communist Party will pay a price for what they did here, certainly from the United States. I don't know exactly what form that will take,"" Pompeo told Fox News in an interview on Thursday night.

However, he underlined that the focus was not on China now but the US administration's goal is to control the virus and revive the American economy. ""It's on making sure we keep Americans safe, take down the health risk, keep people healthy as we can, and get this economy going back,"" he said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/china----will-pay-price--for-causing-huge-challenge-for-global-economy--pompeo.html

155,25-4-20,Rs 1-lakh cr fund in the works to repay pending dues to MSMEs: Gadkari,"The Centre is working on a scheme to address the issue of delayed payments to MSMEs wherein a Rs 1-lakh crore dedicated fund will be created to reimburse outstanding payments owed by Central and State Government undertakings as well as major industries, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Friday.

The minister said he is devising the scheme to set up the fund and the proposal will be placed before the Cabinet for approval once the Finance Ministry gives its go-ahead.

“We have decided to set up a fund of Rs 1 lakh crore. We will insure this fund with the government paying the premium. We will come up with a formula for sharing of the interest burden between the paying entity, payment-receiving entity and banks against this fund, for the payments due to MSMEs that are stuck with the PSUs, central and State Governments, and major industries,” Gadkari said.

The Minister for MSME and Road Transport and Highways said the fund will impart relief to the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) sector to a certain extent.

He said the corpus will be a mobile fund that will help increase liquidity in the market.

While commenting on delayed payments to MSMEs, Gadkari said all efforts should be made to make payments immediately, and all Government departments have been given directions in this regard.

Addressing a webinar, Gadkari also said he has mooted a proposal to Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar to make use of Rs 80,000 crore lying with the ESIC to tide over the immediate crisis faced by the MSMEs, as the pressure for April salaries and wages is mounting.

The proposal will have to be examined by the finance ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), he said.

Besides, the minister said all national highways have been re-opened.

“We have informed state governments and collectors that we have opened up all national highways and till yesterday (Thursday), about 55-60 per cent transport movement had started.

156,25-4-20,ESIC scheme got 11.56L new members in February,"The National Statistical Office (NSO) of Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation on Friday released a report saying that the Employee State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) scheme has got around 11.56 lakh new members in February 2020 against 12.19 lakh members in the previous month.

According to the report, similarly, the EPFO Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has enrolled 10.34 lakh new members in February as compared to 10.71 lakh in the preceding month. The new jobs are just before the corona pandemic aggravated and struck all sectors. March onwards data would actually reveal the blow the disease has struck on employments in India.

The NSO report titled ‘Payroll Reporting in India: An Employment Perspective - February 2020’, is based on the payroll data of new subscribers of various social security schemes run by ESIC, retirement fund body EPFO and pension fund regulator PFRDA. It has been releasing such data of these bodies since April 2018, covering a period starting from September 2017.

The report said gross enrolments of new subscribers with ESIC were 1.49 crore during 2018-19. It also showed that during the period from September 2017 to February 2020, around 3.75 crore new subscribers joined the ESIC scheme.

The report noted that gross new enrolments with ESIC during the September 2017-March 2018 period were 83.35 lakh. According to NSO, around 10.34 lakh new enrolments with the EPFO were recorded in February 2020, compared with 10.71 lakh in the preceding month. However, during the April-February period in 2019-20, the number of net new subscribers rose to 76.53 lakh compared to 61.12 lakh recorded by the EPFO in entire 2018-19. The net new enrolments were 15.52 lakh during September 2017-March 2018.

The latest data showed that during September 2017-February 2020, around 3.29 crore (gross) new subscribers joined the Employees’ Provident Fund Scheme.

The NSO report said that since the number of subscribers is from various sources, there are elements of overlap and the estimates are not additive. The NSO said the report gives different perspectives on the levels of employment in the formal sector and does not measure employment at a holistic level.

Amid coronavirus lockdown, unemployment rate has risen to 26.2 percent in India in the third week of April, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy ((CMIE). Similarly, the rate of labour participation has plunged to 35.4 percent from 35.5 percent. The employment rate has now dipped to 26.1 percent as against 27 percent in the earlier week, CMIE added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/esic-scheme-got-11-56l-new-members-in-february.html

158,25-4-20,"Govt completes disposal of 35,857 tons of imported onions","The Ministry of Consumer Affairs has finally managed to dispose of 35,857 tonne of onion, imported from Turkey, Egypt, European Union and other countries in 2019 to check spiralling domestic prices. In its latest report, the ministry said it has completed the disposal of imported onions by the end of March. Total of 35,857 tonnes of imported onion has been sold to different states. Presently, onion price in the wholesale market has touched Rs 8-10 a kg. In the retail market, onion is being sold at Rs 15-20 a kg depending on the quality and areas.

According to the Ministry, imported onions were dispatched to States such as Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Telangana, Chandigarh, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal, and Goa among others.

The Government was grappling to find a way to dispose of huge quantity of onions it imported from Turkey, Egypt and Iran. The States have refused to accept the imported onions because they don’t excite the domestic taste buds. The Modi government had approached Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka to sell these onions at “no profit no loss” basis. A drop in the price of the desi variant has also posed a challenge to imported onions.

To contain onion prices, the Government had in November 2019 decided to import 1.2 lakh tonnes of onion through the Metals and Minerals Trading Corporation of India (MMTC). Since then, it purchased 35,857 tonne of onion from the overseas market under the Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF). Much of the onion (about 29,836 tonne) was disposed of during February when there was an increase in offtake for the imported onions, it said.

Some quantity of onion was sold through auction. Agencies such as Mother Dairy, Kendriya Bhandar and NAFED were advised to retail imported onions to cool down their prices, the report added.

The Government was forced to import onions in a bid to contain prices that had touched the peak of Rs 160/kg in second half of 2019. The damage in the kharif onion crop due to late monsoon rains and later excess rainfall had led to supply constraint and sharp rise in prices.

The ministry has also directed the National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed) to commence procurement of 40,000-50,000 tonne of summer onions towards the creation of buffer stock. Last year, too, the Centre had procured 57,000 tonne of onions through Nafed to create a buffer stock. Earlier, the target was 50,000 tonne, but Nafed had made additional procurement as per instructions from the central government. Of the total 57,000 tonne procured, around 48,000 tonne of onions were procured from different pockets of Maharashtra, while the remaining 9,000 tonne were bought from Gujarat.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-completes-disposal-of-35-857-tons-of-imported-onions.html

163,25-4-20,Asked to leave my culture behind: Raja,"Indian-American rapper-songwriter Raja Kumari has come out with a new single N.R.I. She says the song stems from the duality of being from two different cultures. Recently, Raja became the first female rapper to be signed with the label Mass Appeal India. N.R.I is her first track off Mass Appeal India.

Raja said, “This single stems from the duality of being from two different cultures, while being told you don’t quite belong in either of them. N.R.I stands for non-resident of India, and is used as a derogatory term for ‘not really Indian’ for people born outside of India, in the diaspora.”

“In America, I was asked to leave behind my culture and assimilate. In India, I was told I didn’t belong to my culture because I wasn’t born here. I decided to re-claim this term and make it my own. My forthcoming EP The Bridge is about symbolising bridging the east and the west, the ancient and the modern, and connecting us from the old world to the new,” she added.

Talking about working on the single, the Grammy-nominated songwriter-rapper said, “The EP was mostly recorded in Mumbai but this song in particular was written in Los Angeles. We shot the video for this just as the borders were closing for India, the morning of my flight. We’ve been able to edit the video while we’ve been in quarantine. I knew N.R.I would never be complete without both sides — my American and Indian story. I hope you’ll share your #mynristory with the world as well.”

The track offers a look into her upbringing, highlighting the duality of growing up in two different cultures and being made to feel alien in both. She throws some sarcastic puns in the song. Produced by American record producer and songwriter Rob Knox and co-written by Grammy-Award winning American hip hop recording artist Sirah, the track was penned in Los Angeles whilst the video was shot in India right before the country declared the lockdown to fight the ongoing global pandemic.

Rob Knox said, “We wanted to make something that felt international, bringing together western pop and hip-hop while calling to Raja’s Indian roots and my Egyptian background.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/asked-to-leave-my-culture-behind--raja-2020-04-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/asked-to-leave-my-culture-behind--raja.html
164,25-4-20,Joy of the heart,"Actor Emily Blunt tells us that listening to music is like stepping into a time machine. You are always transported back to a particular moment

You were the first and only choice of filmmaker Rob Marshall for Mary Poppins Returns. How did it happen?

I have been friends with Rob Marshall for a while. He called me one day and I knew that there was some sort of a different energy behind that phone call. He was so charged up and excited to tell me the news. I thought for a second that he is going to ask me to marry him (laughs). He said, “Emily, we have been looking for something to do. Now we know, we are going to do the remake of Mary Poppins. I know It’s been more than 50 years since the original film was released but we are doing it.” I just felt my hair sort of like blow back. I was completely shocked but immensely happy. It was such a ceremonious phone call. Later, I realized this was such an iconic character. How much impact she had made on people in the first film. Now I was going to be her, so I was slightly terrified.

First will always remain first. No matter for how many days you shoot. Even now, whenever you remember your first day, it surely brings back all the memories. How would you describe it?

It was full of music and joy. My first day on the set was the animated sequence. I think I really like the character. She just doesn’t care. And Rob Marshall is such an amazing man. He sorts of transports you into the character with such ease. He blares the music so loudly from the speakers that everyone feels it. The whole crew had real fun.

How did you feel in this classic presence of Disney films on set? How was the aura of it?

Honestly, the whole atmosphere on the set was completely bewitching. We all knew we were taking on something completely iconic. But I think Rob has this wonderful way of creating sort of an exquisite intimacy that it didn’t feel overwhelming or bigger than me. Or something that I couldn’t do. He’s very embalming in that way. Every day was imbued with a sense that we were making something very special, unique and important.

What did you tap into when you were going through hard times?

I listen to music. Whenever you hear a piece of music, you are always transported back to that particular moment. It’s like stepping into a time machine. You can feel everything as if you were actually there. I feel everything comes into perspective.

165,25-4-20,The dark side rises,"Actor Priyanshu Painyuli tells Chahak Mittal that a villain doesn’t necessarily have to shout or act crooked to seem menacing. And that’s exactly what he followed in his latest, Extraction

When Hollywood actor Chris Hemsworth recently expressed his disappointment while calling off his visit to India for the promotion of his latest Netflix film, Extraction, due to Coronavirus pandemic, Priyanshu Painyuli felt the same surge of sadness. The actor, who makes his Hollywood debut with the film, essays the role of a Bangladeshi drug mafia leader. However, while home quarantine might have ruined the promotion plans, it couldn’t contain his spirit and excitement for the film, which was originally titled Dhaka.

Excerpts from the interview:

How did you get the part? What’s the story behind it?

It’s quite a funny episode. I had never imagined that so early in my career, I would get such an opportunity — to work with such a huge cast and some of the best actors like Chris Hemsworth, Pankaj Tripathi, and Randeep Hooda. It’s a big deal in itself, let alone for someone who is as new as I am. When I was called by the casting director, she asked me whether I could speak Bangla. I laughed as though it might seem like I do, because of my name, but I don’t, I told her. She had thought I am a Bengali. But I am actually a pahadi from Dehradun. How could I even know Bengali? Though she didn’t explain much about the character but I learnt that it’s a crime thriller. She asked me to give it a try and reminded me about my roles in Bhavesh Joshi Superhero and Upstarts.

I have done theatre that revolved around other Indian cultures and languages so I thought I could give it a chance. Why not Bengali this time? So I took help from actor friend, Ranjini Chakraborty, whose Tumbbad had just released at that time. Finally, they really liked my audition and I got the part. Then I got to know that this project was being produced by the team of Avengers: Endgame. I hadn’t imagined working with them one day after admiring Marvel for years!

Since it’s a negative character, how did you prepare for the role?

It was my versatility that I had to show and bring forth, as an actor. I felt that while doing a negative character in front of the camera, I should not pretend to look ‘bad’. Rather, I should look like a real mafia don, who did possess all those qualities. To act as a bad guy, I don’t think I have to shout because I am a villain or even look a certain way to be menacing. Even a wrong person is always right in his mind.

Sam (Hargrave, director) and I discussed the way he wanted the mafia to be. He explained to me as to where the man was coming from. I just had to be very confident to portray a character like this. I had to be convinced that what I was doing and saying was right. There’s no other approach to portraying a dark character.

Also, the kind of costumes that I wore had a huge role in making me look like a don. There was a lot of gold jewellery, kurtas and shiny shoes (or jootis).

What were the challenges?

First, to adapt to the Bangla dialect. It was difficult to get it right because I have never encountered the language in such a direct manner before. Getting the accent right was the biggest challenge because it was not Hindi or English, which I could have improvised as per the varying emotions. I had to make it look authentic so that it seems like I actually came from there. It took me some time to get into the skin. I watched a few documentaries on Dhaka. It took around three to four months of training in the language prior to the shoot. I conversed with Bangladeshi filmmakers on video chats to rehearse the dialogues.

It is a crime thriller. And, especially, talking about Indian cinema, and not Hollywood, the idea of thrillers for the Indian audience has evolved after online shows like Sacred Games and Mirzapur. Earlier, they were more of fantasy and fiction merged together and released only on theatre. But now, it is mixed with reality too. What is your take on this change?

Due to platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and many other web channels, everything is going global and getting a wider reach. So I know for a fact that whatever project I star in, it would be viewed by several people and in many different countries. So today, filmmakers, directors, and writers have to create something for the audience which they can really love.

It’s a huge challenge because people have a variety of options to choose from. They might even stop watching a series within five minutes of the first episode if they do not like it. It’s a personal choice. If it’s a movie theatre, where you buy the ticket and watch it with your popcorn tub, you will sit for two hours even if you don’t like the film. So, for online content, they definitely have to up their game. In theatres, the challenge is to get people inside the hall, and in case of web films or series, the challenge is to keep the audience hooked till the end. If they get bored in the middle, you’ve lost the game! Hence, for that, not just in India, even in the West, the challenge is the same — to keep the viewer engaged.

Hollywood has a huge history of blockbuster thrillers. Did you see any difference between the way they work and the way Bollywood works on thrillers?

Well, I would say that even we make a lot of good action films/series. For instance, Tiger Shroff films. Even I have been a part of one, — Bhavesh Joshi Superhero. They were crazy and big budget action ones but we did them. Hollywood, in thrillers, takes longer and puts more money into each shot. They are very calculative. But nowadays, I think it’s all the same. Even we are making some fantastic thrillers.

You have talked about how Hollywood industry is very particular about their work ethics and professionalism. How did it differ from that of Bollywood?

Well, as Indians, we are very loud people. But there, they talk softly. Everything happens softly and very silently. It’s different in India when we are shooting with 200 people around us. But that is how we are!

One more thing, which I really liked about them was that they are very particular about time. Here, if you are late or early, it doesn’t matter. But they work according to very detailed plans and, I think, that really helps them a lot.

How was it working with Chris? Was there any nervousness initially?

Yes, there was a lot of nervousness from day one. It was also because I had to act and speak like a mafia in a language that wasn’t mine. That’s quite a tough thing. When I got to know about the brilliant cast, I was excited and nervous at the same time because I had to prove myself. I had to really give my 100 per cent and put my best foot forward. That’s how I tried to achieve this character. And it has worked. Some good reviews are coming in.

What do you think is the future of films as we are currently swamped in a digital world and can’t head out to theatres?

Yes. This will definitely take time. But we have to stay protected and safe. Digital world, anyway, without even a pandemic, has seen a boom over the past two to three years. People prefer to have more options to choose from and watch content whenever convenient for them. Films will be lost, at least during this year, till we find out how to take it forward. It’s also required otherwise the future would get affected. We have to be patient this year. There are many people who love watching films on big screen, including me. In fact, small screen doesn’t even do justice to some films, which are always better on the big screen. But this is temporary, people would definitely love to go back to cinema later.

What was your takeaway after doing this film?

One important thing which I learnt is that whether it was the director or anyone else on the set, they all were really calm and composed. They silently did their job. Sam was very open and confident about what he wanted to make. He was handling one of the biggest equipment and doing one of the most deadliest stunts, which you’ll know when you watch the film. Even for me, it came as a surprise that this is a different scale of action that I have never done before.

We will see you next in Rashmi Rocket with Taapsee Pannu...

Yes! We wanted to start off this summer but thanks to Corona. I was looking forward to working with her because she’s the finest versatile actor. I am physically trying to change myself for that film as I portray an Army man.

I am also a part of the second season of a great web series, which will be released by July. But that’s a surprise!",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-dark-side-rises-2020-04-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-dark-side-rises.html
166,25-4-20,True to themselves,"Mike Diamond, Adam Horovitz and Spike Jonze offer jokes, playful moments and remember the good times while talking about the documentary, Beastie Boys Story

Getting the Beastie Boys’ Michael “Mike D” Diamond and Adam “Ad-Rock” Horovitz and longtime collaborator and friend, Spike Jonze, together during normal times would be full of jokes, playful banter and overall fun.

But on a Zoom video call during the quarantining era? It’s a hilarious nightmare.

“I feel like I’m oddly better looking than I was back then,” Horovitz said, referring to the archival footage in Beastie Boys Story, a new documentary about the legendary group.

“You’re hot now. But you were pretty hot then,” replied Jonze, who directed the film. “Different kinds of heat,” Horovitz said. There are more moments like it as the lifelong friends, though more like siblings, remember the good times.

“Adam Horovitz is making me laugh,” Diamond said after trying to answer a question. “I would like to put Mike in a box. Put him on someone’s doorstep,” Horovitz replied. “Like, my head in a box?” Diamond asked. “I’ve got your head in a box,” Horovitz answered.

The trio of Diamond, Horovitz and Jonze offer more jokes and playful moments in Beastie Boys Story, which also highlights the longtime bond between the band members, including the late, great Adam MCA Yauch, who died in 2012.

The documentary was filmed like a live comedy set in front of audience with a backdrop of photos and videos bringing Horovitz and Diamond’s words to life as they walk through the history of one of music’s best-selling bands — a genre-defying act, though rooted in rap, who explored and experimented in other sounds, including rock, punk, jazz and funk. Few acts have won Grammys in the rap, rock and pop categories like them.

The film’s performances, taped at the Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, was originally produced for promoting Beastie Boys Book, their 2018 New York Times best-seller.

“We asked Spike if he would film it,” Horovitz said. “He wanted to rewrite it. We did the show and Spike filmed it. Then he took the footage from the show to the editing room and then...” “Then the (expletive) really went down,” Diamond chimed in. “Then Adam and I had to wrestle,” Jonze replied. “It was like Ice-T in a real action, procedural TV show. The (expletive) went down,” Diamond said. “Ice-T and Steven Seagal,” said Jonze.

The band members say they had been thinking of doing a documentary for quite some time. “Way earlier on, yeah. Adam (Yauch) had this thing and he was obsessed with this film The Kids are Alright,” Diamond said, referring to the 1979 rockumentary film about The Who. “He had this idea about doing something like that with existing footage of the band. That was around the time that we started working on the book when he was still alive, conceptually. I shouldn’t say working; conceptually, we knew that that’s something we wanted to do.”

Jonze, who has directed several Beastie Boys music videos and won an Oscar for writing the 2013 film Her, said he enjoyed going through hours of archival footage of the band in the 80s and 90s. He said though the Beastie Boys came together through music, the center of their story is true friendship. “What made me want to make it is all the things I love about the band — the music for sure, but also their relationship and their loyalty to each other. Their trueness to themselves and themselves as a group. I’m really glad to put that out into the world right now,” he said. “It’s really rare,” Jonze added. “I’ve worked with many, many bands and yeah, to have a band that’s friends for 35 years or more is really rare.”

Beastie Boys last released an album in 2011 with Hot Sauce Committee Part Two. But the members said they have a ton of unreleased music, and they’re in the process of deciding what to do with it. “That’s something that Adam and I talk about, going back and working on (that music),” Diamond said. “There’s tons of stuff that we did together. There’s a lot of stuff that gets edited out. There are quite a few unfinished ideas, tracks, cuts there that at some point Adam and I, I don’t know, might be fun to delve in and look at that stuff a little bit.”

There could even be new music — at least from one of the Beastie Boys. “Mike’s starting a band, I guess,” Horovitz revealed. “I’m starting a band, only because I’m quarantined,” Diamond said. “The two songs that I’ve written so far for the band, one of my teenage sons has taken both songs so far. He’s my engineer, so that’s what I get.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/true-to-themselves-2020-04-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/true-to-themselves.html
167,25-4-20,Reel and real,"In Starry Nights GEN Y, actor Vicky Kaushal talks about his journey, struggles and fellow actors of the industry

Today, I stand on the same platform as the people I used to look up to and that is my biggest milestone,” says actor Vicky Kaushal when asked about his definition of success in the forthcoming episode of Starry Nights GEN Y. The show hosts candid conversations with Bollywood’s Gen Y celebrities about their personal and professional lives. It also shares the gossip doing the rounds of the Bollywood world.

The actor, recipient of The National Film Award talks about his reel and real life in-depth on the show. He is accompanied by his mentor, and director of Uri: The Surgical Strike Aditya Dhar in an engaging conversation with Komal Nahta.

Giving his parents due credit for his success, Vicky says “While growing up my mom and dad made it very clear that they are going to provide us with all the necessities but never with luxuries. That is something that Sunny (Kaushal) and I had to earn ourselves.”

He was all praises for versatile actor Rajkumar Rao saying, “I used to feel that if I have bumped into Rajkumar at the auditions, I know I’m not getting the part.”

He even shared about his self-doubt and self-believe phase. He says, “The first time I said to myself that I wanted to be an actor, it wasn’t a full stop, it was a question mark.”

Recalling his struggle days, the actor says, “My allowance in my early days was Rs 600 per month which came up to Rs 20 a day. A life lesson learnt in my upbringing and hence, whatever I earn now, it’s really special to me and I hold onto it.”

Speaking about fellow actor Ayushmann Khurrana, he says, “His selection of scripts and the way he has just moulded a niche for himself is absolutely amazing. It’s a dream for every actor.”

The actor never thought of being an actor, it was his passion for acting that brought him here. “During my engineering tenure, I visited an industrial place and that made me clear about my goals. It made me realise what I didn’t want to do in life. So I channeled my thoughts and interest only to find that performing is what I love the most.” He goes on to add: “My father was quite astonished when I broke out the news of pursuing acting as a career. He was always of the opinion that one of the family members would have a sedentary life with a desk job paying fixed income on monthly basis and vacationing in Diwali with all the family members.”

Sitting next to him, Aditya recounts his journey in the industry. “It was patience and perseverance that took me more than 10 years to finally get my big break as a directorial debut with Uri,” says he.

Talking about his life changing moment, Aditya says, “I had given up. I was packing my bags to leave for the US when suddenly my brother calls me and makes me realise about the research and efforts I have put in my work. He instructs me to write the screenplay and give it to just one producer. Believe it or not, I struck gold and went on to make a blockbuster hit, else if I would have met rejection, I would have given up on this completely.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/reel-and-real-2020-04-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/reel-and-real.html
168,25-4-20,"Virat, AB to auction cricketing gears","India skipper Virat Kohli and former South Africa batsman AB de Villiers will auction their cricketing gears, including the bats with which they scored hundreds for Royal Challengers Bangalore during an IPL match in 2016, to raise funds for the fight against Covid-19 pandemic.

The items to be auctioned also include their respective gloves and shirts from that particular game where both of them had scored centuries to power RCB to a challenging 248 for three against Gujarat Lions.

RCB had won the match by 144 runs.

“We had a few nice knocks together. There is a particular one in 2016 IPL against Gujarat Lions. I got 129 and you also got 100 right at the end, that doesn’t happen always when two batters get 100s. It is a special memory for me,” De Villiers said during an Instagram Live chat.

“I was thinking how we can make a difference, that’s why I told you to get hold of that bat from that game and I still got that shirt from that game, which I got you signed, I also signed my shirt. So I got my shirt and my bat, I gonna get hold of your bat, my bat, your gloves, my gloves. That’s quite a big package.

“The plan is to get it on an online auction platform (bidorbuy.Co.Za). It could be a nice collector's item. We both can share a picture of that game. People can go and bid and all the proceeds can go for the Covid-19 cause both in India and South Africa, particularly, for the cause of getting meals on people’s table. We can make it 50-50 and support the cause in memory of that day.”

RCB skipper Kohli, who had scored 109 in that match, said he would give away anything for the cause.

“It sounds amazing. The fact that you want to share a part of it with India where you have a massive fan, I think it is quite special, it is an amazing gesture from you,” he said.

“I don’t think I will be able to score that many runs in a single season. I have kept most of the things from that season. For this cause I will give anything away.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/virat--ab-to-auction-cricketing-gears.html
169,25-4-20,SRH has the best death bowling in IPL: Warner,"Sunrisers Hyderbad captain David Warner believes his side’s death bowling is “probably the best” in the Indian Premier League.

The 2016 champions boast of a fine combination of pacers and spinners with India’s Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Afghan leg-spinner Rashid Khan being the prominent names.

“We’ve got a very good squad. One of the best things about our squad is we have great depths in our bowling,” Warner said in an Instagram Live session with Sunrisers teammate Jonny Bairstow.

“We have got got good upfront swing bowling and our death bowling is probably the best in the competition,” he added.

While Warner has been in the side since 2014, Bairstow joined the Sunrisers last season. They shared some brilliant opening partnerships including a 185 stand against the Royal Challengers Bangalore.

Asked about what they liked most about batting with each other, both said running between the wickets was a major contributing factor in their successful partnership.

“I love running between wickets and I think our energy running between the wickets is outstanding,” Warner said.

“I know how fast your ability and game awareness is. It’s one of my favourite things to do and a strong point for us,” he added.

While Warner scored 692 runs from 12 games, Bairstow notched up 445 runs from 10 matches last season.

“Yes definitely there is an understanding between us. We can both gauge if it’s 2 runs we don’t have to look, it’s just touch and go,” Bairstow said.

“And that started really early on, we were getting twos when we had no right to get them.

171,25-4-20,Fight against malaria could be set 20 years back: WHO,"One of the hard lessons the World Health Organisation learned during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa was this: Other diseases can be forgotten and take a deadlier toll.

The WHO is now warning that the battle against malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, where it already kills hundreds of thousands of people a year, could be set back by 20 years as countries focus energy and resources on containing the coronavirus.

The WHO said new projections indicate that in a worst-case scenario, 769,000 people could die of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa this year as campaigns to combat it are interrupted.

That's more than double the deaths in the last detailed count two years ago, when more than 360,000 people died, and would be the worst figures for the region since 2000.

""We must not turn back the clock,” Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said Thursday.

While health experts express fears that the coronavirus pandemic could erode the global fight against many diseases, sub-Saharan Africa is by far the worst affected by malaria. It had 93% of the world's cases and 94% of deaths in 2018, the WHO said. The deaths were mainly children under the age of 5.

There have already been “severe disruptions” to anti-malaria campaigns and access to anti-malaria medication in Africa, WHO said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/fight-against-malaria-could-be-set-20-years-back--who.html

“It is extremely concerning to see the disproportionate toll coronavirus is taking on our BAME communities. We cannot afford to treat this as an issue to investigate once the crisis is over. We must address it now,” said Starmer. “In the face of this national emergency, Labour will continue to work constructively with the government. That includes shining a light on issues where it is clear more detailed understanding is needed,” he said.

173,25-4-20,Key nose cells identified as likely entry points of virus,"Scientists have identified two specific cell types in the nose as likely initial infection points for the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

The researchers, including those from the Wellcome Sanger Institute in the UK and University Medical Centre Groningen in the Netherlands, discovered that goblet and ciliated cells in the nose have high levels of the entry proteins that the COVID-19 virus uses to get into our cells.

The identification of these cells could help explain the high transmission rate of COVID-19, they said.

The finding, published in the journal Nature Medicine, shows that cells in the eye and some other organs also contain the viral-entry proteins.

The study also predicts how a key entry protein is regulated with other immune system genes and reveals potential targets for the development of treatments to reduce transmission.

While it is known that the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, known as SARS-CoV-2, uses a similar mechanism to infect our cells as a related coronavirus that caused the 2003 SARS epidemic, the exact cell types involved in the nose had not previously been pinpointed, the researchers said.

To discover which cells could be involved in COVID-19 transmission, they analysed datasets of single cell RNA sequencing, from more than 20 different tissues of non-infected people. These included cells from the lung, nasal cavity, eye, gut, heart, kidney and liver.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/key-nose-cells-identified-as-likely-entry-points-of-virus.html
174,25-4-20,11K deaths: Ravaged nursing homes plead for more testing,"After two months and more than 11,000 deaths that have made the nation's nursing homes some of the most terrifying places to be during the coronavirus crisis, most of them still don't have access to enough tests to help control outbreaks among their frail, elderly residents.

Neither the federal government nor the leader in nursing home deaths, New York, has mandated testing for all residents and staff.

An industry group says only about a third of the 15,000 nursing homes in the US have ready access to tests that can help isolate the sick and stop the spread. And homes that do manage to get a hold of tests often rely on luck and contacts.

“It just shows that the longer that states lapse in universal testing of all residents and staff, we're going to see these kinds of stories for a very long time,” said Brian Lee of the advocacy group Families for Better Care.

“Once it's in, there's no stopping it and by the time you're aware with testing, too many people have it. And bodies keep piling up.”

That became clear in some of the nation's biggest nursing home outbreaks. After a home in Brooklyn reported 55 coronavirus deaths last week, its CEO acknowledged it was based entirely on symptoms and educated guesses the dead had COVID-19 because they were unable to actually test any of the residents or staff.

At a nursing home in suburban Richmond, Virginia, that has so far seen 49 deaths, the medical director said testing of all residents was delayed nearly two weeks because of a shortage of testing supplies and bureaucratic requirements. By the time they did, the spread was out of control, with 92 residents positive. Mark Parkinson, CEO of the American Health Care Association, which represents long-term care facilities, says “only a very small percentage” of residents and staff have been tested because the federal and state governments have not made nursing homes the top priority.

“We feel like we've been ignored,” Parkinson said.

“Certainly now that the emphasis has gone away from hospitals to where the real battle is taking place in nursing homes, we should be at a priority level one.” Two-thirds of U.S. Nursing homes still don't have “easy access to test kits” and are struggling to obtain sufficient resources, said Chris Laxton, executive director of The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

“Those nursing home leaders who have developed good relationships with their local hospitals and health departments seem to have better luck,” said Laxton, whose organisation represents more than 50,000 long-term care professionals.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/11k-deaths--ravaged-nursing-homes-plead-for-more-testing.html

176,25-4-20,My name is Khan,"Actor, director, producer and writer Sanjay KHAN tells Saimi Sattar that his book Assalamualaikum Watan is his ode to the country where the duty of the citizens is to create an invisible yet strong bond with each other

For anyone who grew up watching Doordarshan and the mandatory Chitrahaar, Sanjay Khan bounding about wearing an impish grin while teasing Mumtaz with the song, Gori ke haath me jaise ye challa is hard to forget. It was aided, of course, in ample measure by the fact that he was easy on the eye in Mela (no resemblance to the horror starring Aamir Khan which masqueraded by the same name). Having made his debut in Chetan Anand’s 1964 war film, Haqeeqat in a small role as a soldier, he went on to play a pivotal supporting role in the blockbuster Dosti. He starred in hits like Dus Lakh (1966), Ek Phool Do Mali (1969), Intaqam (1969), Shart (1969), Mela (1971), Upaasna (1971), Dhund (1973) and Nagin (1976). In 1977, he made his directorial debut with Chandi Sona starring himself, Parveen Babi and Raj Kapoor. In 1980, he directed and starred in Abdullah alongside Raj Kapoor and Zeenat Aman. He made his last film appearance in the 1986 film Kala Dhanda Goray Log, which was his third and last film as a director.

He burst upon the small screen with the big-budget historical series The Sword of Tipu Sultan, which was nothing short of Khan’s labour of love. Not even a fire that broke out on the sets that killed more than 40 crew members and inflicted 65 per cent burns on Khan could deter him from its completion. After several surgeries, he swung back into action. He directed the series jointly with his brother, Akbar Khan and also played the lead. The series first aired on DD National from 1990 to 1991 and lasted 60 episodes. He produced and directed other popular television series like The Great Maratha, Jai Hanuman and 1857 Kranti.

Khan has turned his hand to writing and his second book, Assalamualaikum Watan, talks about his journey and more.

What is the reason behind naming the book Assalamualaikum Watan?

An author in principal will always look for a pertinent title which advocates the content with a flair.

What prompted you to write this book? In days when Islamophobia is rife, when Muslim bashing on social media and news has become the norm, what is the reason why we have come to this? And what can be done to thwart it?

This is most unfortunate. The WhatsApp University is filled to the brim with mischief mongering sections of misguided people. This should not be taken for granted. The good and wise people of India do not appreciate this as it tars the image of our Democratic Republic of India in the eyes of the entire world and also will devastate the economic parameters and prosperity of this country. Only a peaceful country can be successful. This is the responsibility of all good thinking Indian citizens to challenge this attempt at sabotage. We must take a lesson from Finland where, I’m told, every citizen respects the other creating a bond which is invisible but the strength, mutual love and respect is the underlying factor for peace and tranquility of the country. This small country is the richest in the world. I would like the reader to think about this.

You speak about the role of Muslims in fighting for Independence in the book but now the narrative has changed completely...

It’s not difficult to see how people of diverse faiths and regions have come together and stitched the fabric of India. It’s always best to read history backed by facts, based on documented evidence written and accepted by world-renowned historians and researchers and not WhatsApp forwards, where people often share false information to suit their own bias. It will only be fair to warn the future generations of the effect the absence of a factual and fascinating history of this great land will have if it is hidden and reconstructed to benefit an ideology. It will deprive them of this wealth of knowledge. Real history has an uncanny knack of emerging from the labyrinths of the earth.

You talk about setting up the Indian Muslim Socio Economic Trust. What exactly is its role? How many people are involved with it?

The IMSET will be a non-profit organisation in the form of a digital application. A trained team of youngsters with complete knowledge and functioning of the digital app will guide it. This team will be monitored by an expert and eminent committee from the community who will offer their services. It will engage pre-eminently successful Muslims in today’s India from each state, which will include captains of industry and tycoons in their respective fields of expertise. The IMSET app will be defined by a collaborative spirit and genuine empathy, as all the members will be invited to serve based on their seminal achievements and inclination for volunteerism and social responsibility via video webinar, online meetings, training, and support. These positions will be highly prestigious, not due to the traditional business perks of compensation, rather due to the substantially impactful work. They will leave their indelible imprints on the sands of time and their heroic deeds will inspire generations to come. The organisations’ operating budget will invite like-minded people to participate in this venture. There are many anxiously waiting to participate. It will be inappropriate to mention any names at this time. We cannot proceed with our plans currently due to the unfortunate COVID-19 in which India and the entire world is embroiled in.

You’ve also dwelt upon another popularly propagated myth that Mughals looted India...

The Mughals came to India as conquerors but lived in the subcontinent as Indians and not as colonisers. They merged their identity as well as that of their group with India and the two became inseparable, giving rise to an enduring culture and history. Mughals being seen as foreigners was never a point of discussion till quite recently, so well had they integrated and assimilated into the country that they made their own. There was no reason for it either, since Akbar onwards, all Mughals were born in India with many having Rajput mothers and their ‘Indian-ness’ was complete. As I have explained, Muslims have selflessly contributed an immense amount to India, from the standpoint of art, architecture, science, technology and governance, making India the richest country in the world. These timeless, priceless and permanent contributions make India just as much ours as anyone else’s.

You’ve dwelt at length on the prescriptive qualities of Islam. Are Indian Muslims particularly adhering to it?

Islam is a casteless and egalitarian religion. The essence of it is equality and humanity. The reading and understanding of Islam worldwide as per the tenants of holy Quran are equally adhered to everywhere. Its message to the people is to be loyal to their motherland.The heart of an Indian Muslim is truly patriotic as their history is replete with numerous sacrifices for the country which they will continue with. Indian Muslims represent 200 million of the country’s population who profoundly contribute to the cultural vitality and demographic vibrancy of India on a daily basis. This number represents the second largest critical mass of Muslims in any nation in the world. First and foremost, as Indian Muslims, we should feel tremendous pride, a sense of empowerment and responsibility because we serve as the trajectory to the compass of achievement for Muslims worldwide. The age old saying of safety in numbers is only partially true as there is also an inspiration in numbers. The social responsibility should serve as the spark for the guiding light that is ingrained in the mentality of all Indian Muslims. If given proper opportunity of education, they can contribute heavily to the GDP of our country.

You’ve had your share of ups and downs. The fire during the shooting of The Sword of Tipu Sultan being one. How do you bounce back?

I have answered this question many a times, I would like to quote the great genius Albert Einstein in which you will find my answer and the readers would be refreshed by this beautiful message under the present Covid 19 circumstances. “Love multiplied by the speed of light squared, we arrive at the conclusion that love is the most powerful force there is, because it has no limits. Love is light, that enlightens those who give and receive it. Love is gravity, because it makes some people feel attracted to others. Love is power, because it multiplies the best we have and allows humanity not to be extinguished in their blind selfishness. Love unfolds and reveals. For love we live and die. Love is God and God is Love.”

While the films of your time talked about the beauty of diversity, the ones currently border on jingoism. What do you attribute the change to?

This is a temporary phenomenon. Let us look at it as a passing shower. The industry is highly sensitive, intelligent and knows it’s way. The power of good stories and the sweet melody of the songs will soon return.

The film industry has become much more politicised than it was before. What is your take?

I don’t believe it. The film industry is untouched. But there is always a joker in a pack.

You look upon Tipu Sultan as a hero. But he has become a contentious figure in today’s time. What do you have to say to this?

My tryst with history is one of the strong pillars of my personality. I have always been a flag-bearer of peace and harmony. I’ve delved deep in the research from Bhagwan Gidwani’s best seller, The Sword Of Tipu Sultan to bring few important aspects which have been swept under the carpet from public view and I strongly feel it is a threat to our nation’s fabric to do so. As many historians would like to agree with me that ‘bad history’ affects our youth and development. Several Kannada folk songs (lavanis) lamenting his death were in circulation in the 19th century, the earliest dating back to 1800, the year after he died in the battlefield. This is a very special fact since folk songs do not exist for any of the kings of Karnataka. They exist for only tragic heroes like Tipu Sultan and other local chieftains who were martyred at the hands of the British. As an Indian, I felt it was my duty to place these facts of history for the greater understanding of our people as this would cure the minds of faulty judgements.

How long did you take to write the book?

It took seven years of deep and accurate research and two years to complete it.

Any more in pipeline? Future plans?

180,25-4-20,Can never think of leaving RCB: Kohli,"The love and loyalty of the fans will never let him leave Royal Challengers Bangalore till the time he is playing IPL, skipper Virat Kohli said on Friday.

RCB have reached the IPL final thrice but have not gone on to win the trophy.

During a live session on Instagram with former South African captain and RCB teammate AB de Villiers, Kohli said winning the tournament remains the goal but he would not leave the team irrespective of the results.

“It has been such an amazing journey. It is always going to be our dream, winning the IPL together. There is no scenario where I could think of leaving the team ever.

“You can feel emotional about the season not going well but till the time I am playing IPL, I am never leaving this team. The fans, their loyalty has been amazing,” said the India skipper.

Responding to Kohli’s feelings towards RCB, De Villiers too acknowledged the support of fans over the past nine years. Kohli, on the other hand, has been with RCB since 2008.

“Same for me. I never want to leave RCB but to do that I got to keep scoring runs. I am not the captain you see,” said the South African in jest.

Both recalled their early days in international cricket and their growth as cricketers and friends.

Kohli said at times, the youngsters coming in have too much regard for the “system” and he wants to see them break the norm.

“I want to see youngsters coming in scoring 500-600 runs. I want people to break the norm. Sometimes I feel people have too much regard for the system in sport. When you break the shackles, you do something special.”

Kohli also acknowledged contribution of Mark Boucher, Gary Kirsten and Duncan Fletcher early on in his international career.

“Gary always gave me positive feedback. Boucher told me in 2008 to improve my game against the short ball. He had the vision. Then Fletcher, he had a keen eye for the game. So many people who have contributed (to my growth),” said Kohli.

De Villiers picked the 119 at Wankhede in the 2015 series decider as his best knock against India. Kohli picked the 119 he scored in Johannesburg Test in 2013.

“I was always really motivated to win the series after 2-2 . I was incredibly motivated to do something special,” de Villiers said.

They also picked their combined South Africa and India ODI team. It included Sachin Tendulkar, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ab de Villiers, Jacques Kallis, M S Dhoni (captain), Yuvraj Singh, Yuzvendra Chahal, Dale Steyn, Jasprit Bumrah and Kagiso Rabada.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/can-never-think-of-leaving-rcb--kohli-2020-04-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/can-never-think-of-leaving-rcb--kohli.html

183,25-4-20,Kohli can knock it off in 7-8 years: Lee on Tendulkar's 100 tons record,"Former Australian fast bowler Brett Lee on Saturday backed Indian captain Virat Kohli to surpass batting great Sachin Tendulkar's record of 100 international centuries, provided he keeps firing for another seven-eight years.

The iconic Tendulkar holds the record for highest number of ODI centuries with 49 hundreds and current batting maestro Kohli is second on the list with 43 from 248 matches.

In Tests too, Tendulkar leads the tally for most number of hundreds with 51 tons. Kohli has 27 from 86 matches till now.

Lee said it will all boil down to three things -- talent, fitness and metal strength -- and Kohli has all these traits.

""One thing that I would like to eliminate is his talent as a batsman. He definitely got that, so we eliminate that. The second will be his fitness. Kohli has surely had that, because for me it's all about fitness.

""Last would be the mental strength and the capacity to get through the hard games and being away from home,"" Lee said.

""I believe he has all these three components to go past Sachin, but again we are talking about Sachin and how can somebody go past God. So, we just have to wait and watch.""

Lee, who has played 76 Tests and 221 ODIs, was speaking on Star Sports show 'Cricket Connected'.

The 43-year-old former fast bowler further said, ""We are talking about phenomenal numbers here. Give it another seven-eight years of cricket and the way he is going currently, Kohli can definitely knock it off easily.""

Tendulkar retired in 2013 after a 24-year glorious career that saw him create a plethora of batting records in top-flight cricket.

Since then, Kohli has stepped into Tendukar's role and has been scoring runs at will all over the world.

185,25-4-20,Experience wins you matches in shortest format: Ashwin,"Former Chennai Super Kings teammates Suresh Raina and Ravichandran Ashwin spoke at length about what sets Chennai Super Kings apart from other franchises in the Indian Premier League. With no cricket being played due to coronavirus pandemic, former and current players are engaging with fans on social media to keep themselves entertained.

Raina joined Ashwin for a Live video chat session on popular social media platform Instagram and the duo spoke about various things during their time together at CSK.

The Chennai-based franchise is one of the most successful teams in the history of the cash-rich league. Apart from winning the title three times, they have also entered the playoffs in every edition of the tournament thay they have participated in.

Ashwin feels the presence of skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni takes a lot of pressure away from the other players while Raina claimed the the franchise treats every player like family and that has helped them play consistency over the years.

“At CSK most of the pressure is taken way by the presence of Mahi bhai and because of the victories that we had... the oneness of the team,” Ashwin said.

“The franchise also looks after each and every aspect of the player. They also look after their families... that is what I felt when we came back after two years and won the title. Our families were there, kids were playing. You know how things are... we play a lot of matches and travel a lot and the presence of kids help us remain calm,” Raina chipped in.

Over the years, CSK have drawn flak from pundits and social media for focussing too much on older players in the auction but Ashwin believes experience is what wins you matches in the shortest format.

“Initially people talked about how T20 is a young man’s sport. But over the years I have felt it can be dealt only by experienced people. People who have the experience of playing for years are the one’s who have been delivering for years,” Ashwin said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/experience-wins-you-matches-in-shortest-format--ashwin.html
186,25-4-20,Lucky to have support from team management: Bhuvi after injury,"Coming back after injury is a challenge but the road could be smooth if teammates are supportive, feels senior India pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar.

Bhuvneshwar's career has been riddled with injuries and the last one was a surgery for sports hernia and he was set to come back during South Africa ODIs which got cancelled.

Prior to that, he had suffered a groin injury during tour of West Indies last year.

“You always need support from the management and the team and (I’m) lucky to have support from the management,” Bhubaneswar, who has played 21 Tests and 114 ODIs apart from 43 T20s, told Sunrisers Hyderabad teammate David Warner during an Instagram chat.

Playing three formats as a fast bowler makes it difficult at times to maintain peak fitness.

“It is very difficult being a fast bowler especially when you play all the three formats. It gets difficult at times. Injury is something which is always associated with fast bowler,” he said.

The difficult part is to get back the pre-injury rhythm.

“But what’s more difficult is to come back with the same rhythm that you were in. And especially in India there are so many players, so many first class teams and so many talented players, they are always in line to play.

“So when you comeback, you have things in mind like you have to be in rhythm like what were you in (earlier), so it gets difficult,” he elaborated.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/lucky-to-have-support-from-team-management--bhuvi-after-injury.html

Gopichand was speaking on the LIVE with SAI session on Sports Authority of India’s (SAI) Facebook page.

“Winning at all cost is not necessary as a society. It should be more about good character than good features. If you are in a position of power it should be about justice to everybody and as a celebrity to be about being a good role model,” Gopichand said.

“In money vs relationships, we should be able to choose good relationships and that is what matters,” he said.

Gopichand reflected on his own life as a player and then as a coach, saying we should aim at realising our full potential.

“Coaches should give their 100% and not only think of success in terms of winning a competition but as something their ward sets out to do and then achieve. Each individual is talented and has potential but only one athlete at a time can represent the country at a particular Olympics,” he said.

He gave examples of Abhinav Bindra, Sania Nehwal and PV Sindhu and said the reason they were able to win medals at the Olympics was because they gave their all.

“As a society, we need to stop being goal-oriented and rather become process-oriented because that is what will help all of us grow.”

191,25-4-20,"Don’t rush to restart La Liga, warns Bale","Real Madrid star Gareth Bale says there should be no rush to restart La Liga during the coronavirus lockdown as the Spanish football federation plans tests and a return to training.

Testing players is being discussed with a view to completing the Liga season and thereby avoiding financial disaster, a source cose to La Liga said on Thursday.

Bale said he wanted to get back into action but felt it wise to wait and see.

“Everyone wants to play football, but the most important thing is everyone stays safe, we don’t want to come back too early. We need to make sure everything is done safely so we avoid the second wave of this virus,” Bale told BT Sports.

The Bundesliga in Germany, where there have been far fewer coronavirus deaths, said on Thursday they are “ready” to restart on May 9 but needed government approval.

Rafael Ramos of the Spanish Association of Football Team Physicians said La Liga is planning to return to action in a series of stages.

“The idea according to La Liga is to test everyone on April 28 and 29,” Ramos said on Spanish radio on Thursday.

He added that the tests would be repeated every three or four days.

La Liga president Javier Tebas said several alternatives for a return to action were being mulled with May 4 slated for the return to training.

“The scenarios we are looking at could see La Liga restart as early as 28-29 May, but could also be 6-7 June or even as late as June 28,” Tebas said, calculating that the move could save Spanish clubs a billion euros in revenue if they complete La Liga and the European competitions.

Whatever Tebas wants, Spain is under a severe lockdown quarantine and is reeling after 22,000 deaths from coronavirus in the country so far.

The Spanish players union (AFE) agree with Welsh winger Bale in his call for prudence.

“Ask yourself if this is really a good idea. Is it safe? isn’t our main concern everybody’s safety?” Diego Lopez the Espanyol goalkeeper said.

Eight Espanyol players are sick with Covid-19.

Barcelona and Spain midfielder Sergio Busquets was also sceptical on the proposed dates.

“I suppose it’s workable, to train without getting too close to the other guys, showering at home, but meetings and travelling to a match would be difficult,” said Busquets.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/don---t-rush-to-restart-la-liga--warns-bale.html

193,25-4-20,Plasma therapy results promising: Kejriwal,"CM urges recovered patients to donate plasma to help the ailing fight corona

After initial positive results of the use of plasma therapy on four Covid-19 patients at Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital (LNJP) in the national Capital, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal appealed to the recovered patients on Friday to donate their plasma to help other patients recover and contain the fatalities caused by the deadly virus.

Addressing an online media briefing, Kejriwal said more clinical trials of plasma therapy will take place over the next two-three days, and his Government will seek the Centre’s nod next week for using the technique on all seriously ill Covid-19 patients.

The CM expressed hope that the Centre will give a go-ahead to the treatment regimen. Kejriwal said two patients have recovered while other two are showing improvement and will be soon out of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

“Our efforts in the fight against corona are two-fold: One, how to contain the spread of corona which includes social distancing, lockdown and various other measures, and two, how to control the deaths caused by the pandemic,” said Kejriwal, who was joined by SK Sarin, the director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Science, at the Press conference.

Dr Sarin, who is heading the task force of the Covid-19 patients, said, “Our initial plan was to use plasma therapy as per the age-old traditions, as it had also been used in the 1900s. This virus has three phases, first is when the virus enters the body, second is the pulmonary phase which affects the lungs and causes difficulty in breathing.”

“Ten days ago, we had got permission from the Central Government to conduct clinical trial of plasma therapy only on four serious Covid-19 patients admitted at the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital. The initial results are every encouraging and good. It gives a ray of hope to save people’s lives from coronavirus,” he said.

The four patients who were given plasma therapy have shown improvement in their health condition, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation, Kejriwal said.

Two of the four patients, whose condition was serious, have now been shifted to general ward from the ICU and two others are also responding well, he said.

The Chief Minister, however, said that these are only initial results and nobody should think that the government has found a cure for coronavirus.

In the plasma therapy, antibodies from the blood of a patient who has recovered from Covid-19 are used to treat serious patients.

“Once we get nod from the Centre, we will be able to use plasma therapy on all serious Covid-19 patients across Delhi. I reiterate that this is early result which is very encouraging. We must not think that we have found a cure for Covid-19,” Kejriwal said.

Sarin said donating plasma would be an act of patriotism by recovered patients. It does not lead to any weakness in the body of the donor, he said.

“It is not blood donation...Plasma therapy is also inexpensive,” he said.

Kejriwal said people who have fully recovered from coronavirus would be saving lives of people by donating their plasma.

“In the plasma therapy, donor plays an important role. Plasma is extracted from their blood as our doctors often do in case of dengue patients. “I appeal to you (who have recovered from COVID-19) with folded hands to come forward and donate your plasma. Your plasma will be given to only serious patients. You can save their lives,’’ he said.

On Thursday, the total number of coronavirus cases in the national stood at 2,376, with 128 new cases and two fresh deaths being reported in a day.

Of the total number of 50 fatalities reported till Thursday, 27 of the deceased were aged 60 years and above, constituting over 52 per cent of fatalities.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/plasma-therapy-results-promising--kejriwal-2020-04-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/plasma-therapy-results-promising--kejriwal.html

In the last 24 hours ending 8 am on Friday, the country had reported 1,752 new coronavirus cases and 37 deaths.

As of 10 pm, on Friday, Maharashtra added 390 cases and 18 deaths as against 728 cases on Thursday. Maharashtra total count of positive cases stood at 6,817 and a casualty of 300.

Gujarat, which recorded 250 plus cases on Thursday, saw reduction of Friday, adding just 190 cases for total count of 2,815 and death count of 127. Delhi recorded 138 cases and three deaths. Now the national Capital has a total of 2,514 cases and 53 casualty.

Rajasthan added 44 new cases, Madhya Pradesh 159 and Tamil Nadu 72. Uttar Pradesh added 11 new cases for total count of 1,621 and 25 deaths.

Incidentally, States like Bihar which were virtually out of corona radar till now, have started to report significant number of cases. On Friday the State reported 44 cases, the single day high, for total ,count of 214.

Union Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said that in the last 28 days, 15 districts have had no new case. Till date, there are 80 districts in the country that have reported no new cases in last 14 days. “A total of 4,748 people, which is 20.57 per cent of the total number of cases, have been cured so far,” Agarwal said.

“As on today, 15 districts in the country which earlier had cases have not reported any fresh cases since the last 28 days. Besides districts already highlighted, three new districts which got added to this list include: Durg & Rajnandgaon from Chhattisgarh; and Shivpuri from Madhya Pradesh,” said the official at the routine press briefing here.

195,25-4-20,4 cr users may lose cellphones by May end if curbs not lifted,"About 4 crore mobile phone users in the country are expected to be without handsets due to faults and breakdowns by May-end if restrictions on the sale of handsets and spare parts continue, an industry body said on Friday.

At present, more than 2.5 crore mobile customers are with non-functional devices due to non-availability of components and the restriction on sales of new handsets due to the lockdown to contain coronavirus, the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) claimed.

Operations of telecom, internet, broadcast and IT services are permitted but not for mobile devices that are pivotal for accessing these services.

The ICEA, whose members include leading handset makers like Apple, Foxconn, and Xiaomi, said on an average, approximately 2.5 crore new mobile phones are sold every month and the active population of mobile phones is 85 crore currently.

“A very large proportion of these purchases are replacements.

In addition, even with a much-improved quality of phones and mobile devices, there is an approx 0.25 per cent break down on a monthly basis. With the current mobile base at nearly 85 crore, it is clear that nearly 2.5 crore individuals are suffering due to non-availability of new devices or repair of their existing devices,” ICEA said.

The industry body has approached government authorities several times including the Prime Minister for including mobile phones in the list of essential goods as there can be life threatening situations for many without the devices.

“We have written to the government that these numbers will expand to nearly 4 crores before the end of May. It is critical that mobile device sales via online, and in a phased manner via retail, as well as service centres with facilities for home delivery and pickup must be declared as “essential services”, in addition to grocery and medicines,” ICEA Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo said.

Some district administrations have made the government’s coronavirus case tracking app Aarogya Setu mandatory for those who venture out of their homes, making it challenging for those who do not have smartphones.

ICEA said that it has made a joint representation with the traders’ body CAIT to the Home Minister, Home Secretary, Commerce & Industry Minister, Secretary DPIIT and Secretary MeitY (also currently the chair of the Empowered Group on Technology and Data Management) for allowing sales of mobile devices under the “essential services” category.

The Ministry of Electronics and IT has recommended to the Home Ministry to include mobile devices including laptops in the list of essential goods but the MHA is yet to accept it.

196,25-4-20,Covid to diminish IT sector revenue growth to decadal low of 2%: Crisil,"The Indian IT sector is staring at a revenue growth sliding to a decadal low of up to 2 per cent and an impact on profitability owing to narrowing of margins due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a report said on Friday.

The companies will lose out on new deals, which will compromise future revenues, and also face reverses on the exiting ones, which may be renegotiated as their overseas clients face difficulties due to the lockdowns, domestic rating agency Crisil said in the report.

The $97 billion IT sector is one of the largest service exporters and helps the Indian economy also by supporting over 40 lakh jobs if the IT-enabled services are also included.

Major companies, including Infosys and Wipro, have earlier this month discontinued the practice of giving yearly guidances, while TCS hinted at pain during the first two quarters of the year.

“Typically, new deals get finalised between March and May, but this time around, most clients will focus on mitigating emerging business risks and defer discretionary IT spend, while letting existing contracts continue,” Crisil’s senior director Anuj Sethi said.

Crisil said that revenue growth for the industry will decline to a decadal low of 0-2 per cent.

The ongoing restrictions on mobility, which has resulted in the entire aviation sector being closed, will also cause delays in deal consummations, Sethi added.

The IT industry’s largest client segment of banking, financial services and insurance which accounts for 28 per cent of the industry revenues will deliver an 8 per cent topline growth on rising share of digital transactions and presence of larger and longer-term maintenance contracts that are critical to operations, Crisil said.

While healthcare segment, which accounts for 8 per cent of the IT industry revenues, will also grow at similar levels, it said.

However, other segments including retail (32 per cent of IT service revenues), and communication, aerospace, defence and transportation (22 of revenues) and manufacturing, travel and tourism and oil and energy will see a steep and immediate impact on revenues considering sluggish demand in these sectors, it said.

The rating agency said operating profitability could moderate by 2-2.50 percentage points to a decadal low of 20 per cent for 2020-21, despite gains from rupee depreciation.

The slowdown in revenues will have an impact on profitability because the IT firms will have to continue investing in new age technologies to showcase their ability to execute complex digital projects, its associate director Rajeshwari Karthigeyan said.

Karthigeyan explained that in the last four years, the share of digital revenues has grown to about 40 per cent of the total revenues, but at the same time has seen a narrowing of profit margins by up to 1.50 per cent.

IT companies have already streamlined costs and raised utilisation rates to record high of 85-90 per cent by increasing the share of fixed price contracts, which will make it impossible to derive any gains from optimising employee or outsourcing costs, the agency said.

The ratings agency, which studied 15 companies constituting 70 per cent of the total revenues, said there will not be any impact on ratings as a result of this and limited itself to say that ones with revenue concentration in weak segments may face some challenges. It flagged the extent of the pandemic and its impact on the global economy as a key monitorable factor going ahead.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/covid-to-diminish-it-sector-revenue-growth-to-decadal-low-of-2---crisil.html
197,25-4-20,Cops’ help offer makes migrants shelve plan to leave Capital,"At a time when poor migrants who have run out of their sustenance are pulling out all stops to head for their villages, good Samaritans among the police have been successful in persuading a sizable number of them to stay put in the national Capital. In return, the cops assured them to help provide food and convinced house owners to not insist on demanding rents from their poor tenants.

Around 70 labourers who had planned to leave the national Capital amid the lockdown were successfully persuaded to stay put by the police, which also arranged for their meals and assured them of further help, officials said on Friday.

The police received information that around 70 daily wagers, who were living in rented accommodations at the Gujar Chowk area of South Delhi’s Sangam Vihar, were planning to leave for their native places in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

“Assistant Sub-Inspector Devraj and constable Chetan were sent there and the workers were convinced to stay put. But the workers said they were not being served food as they did not have plates,” said Atul Kumar Thakur, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South).

Plates were procured by ASI Devraj for all of them and they were provided meals. Their landlords were also asked not to demand rent from them, he said.

The labourers were given phone numbers of police officers in case of any emergency, he added.

In another incident, 29 labourers who were attempting to return to their villages in Bihar from Delhi’s Khirki village on cycles were intercepted by the police near Pushpa Bhavan in south Delhi. After they were counselled, they returned to their accommodations and promised not to leave again, the DCP said.

The police also intercepted 15 people at a picket on Aurobindo Marg in south Delhi, he said. They were coming from Kabadi bazar area in West Delhi’s Mayapuri and were travelling to Azamgarh and Faizabad in Uttar Pradesh. All of them were sent back by a DTC bus, he added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/cops----help-offer-makes-migrants-shelve-plan-to-leave-capital.html
198,25-4-20,"Now, Yogi Govt plans to bring back migrant labourers, gives order","After successfully bringing back stranded Uttar Pradesh students from Kota, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has directed officials to prepare a road map to bring back tens of thousands of migrant workers from the State stranded in other States and have completed 14-day quarantine.

“Those labourers of UP who have completed 14-day quarantine in other States will be brought back in a phased manner. The officers should prepare an action plan for the same,” Yogi said while addressing the lockdown review meeting at his official residence here on Friday.

The Yogi Government’s decision could create more trouble for Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who has refused to even bring back his State students from Kota and is facing strong criticism from Opposition parties.

Yogi said a list will be furnished having all the details of the labourers followed by screening and testing by concerning States to send them to UP border from where they will be dispatched to their respective districts by bus.

“The concerned nodal officers of different States should prepare a list of the people who want to return to UP and start making arrangements for their return. These shelter homes should be sanitised and community kitchens should be set up to quarantine labourers from other States. The nodal officers should contact the respective States and migrant workers who want to return,” the CM told the officials.

He said that the adequate number of shelter homes and centres should be readied for 14-day quarantine of the migrants. After institutional quarantine, they will be sent to their homes with ration kit and Rs 1,000 as sustenance allowance, he pointed out.

Earlier last week on the directive of the CM around 10,500 students from Uttar Pradesh who are studying in Kota Rajasthan were brought to the State. Around 300 buses were put into service. Later these students were asked to go in for quarantine in their houses for next 14 days.

Political parties in Uttar Pradesh have been asking the Yogi Government to bring back these labourers.

“We support the UP Government in bringing back students from Kota. The migrant workers should also be brought back who are suffering because they are not getting food and other essential items,” UP Congress State president Ajay Kumar Lalu said.

Early this week around 1,000 laborers from Uttar Pradesh who have got stuck in Jammu & Kashmir had appealed to the Chief Minister to make arrangements for their return to their villages as they have run out of money.

Suresh Kumar, who hails from Bahraich reached Kashmir in the first week of March and had earned around Rs 3,500 when lockdown was announced. Since then he is putting up in a Government building in north Kashmir along with 400 non-local labourers from various States.

“All the money I had earned have exhausted. Government should have given us three days to reach to our homes before announcing lockdown,” he said.

He has been lodged in a shabby room along with 20 non-local labourers. “There is no hygiene here. Labourers are not safe because we are not maintaining any distance. We fear we may get infected,” Suresh said.

“Our families are worried about our safety. We are even not able to make a video call to our families due to low internet speed. We want to leave for our home as soon as possible,” Kumar said and requested the UP Government to take them back.

He said that his brother told him that the Yogi Government had brought students back from Kota. “If they can be brought back to UP why cannot we,” asks Kumar.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/now--yogi-govt-plans-to-bring-back-migrant-labourers--gives-order-2020-04-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/now--yogi-govt-plans-to-bring-back-migrant-labourers--gives-order.html
199,25-4-20,"Indians, ethnic minority medics in UK at high risk from COVID-19: Survey","Medical and healthcare professionals from Indian and the minority ethnic backgrounds fall into a higher risk category of contracting the deadly coronavirus in the UK, a first-of-its-kind survey among medics in the country has concluded.

The Research and Innovation Forum of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO) conducted the week-long online survey between April 14 and 21 to determine risk factors and emerging concerns within healthcare professionals as wider community data began to reflect black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) vulnerabilities during the pandemic.

Around 2,003 respondents from all backgrounds returned the questionnaire, with the majority (66 per cent) being hospital doctors and primary care practitioners forming the second large group (24 per cent). Of those surveyed, 86 per cent were from BAME backgrounds, with South Asians forming the bulk of the sample at 75 per cent.

""This is the largest survey of its kind that involves BAME healthcare workers from all backgrounds. And the results are no surprise, that being of BAME background is a major risk factor for contracting the virus,"" said Dr Indranil Chakravorty, Chair of the BAPIO Research and Innovation Forum.

The survey also shows that a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) is a major concern to medics and also confirms that being BAME is a significant independent risk factor in contracting COVID-19 irrespective of comorbidities or the presence of one or more additional conditions co-occurring with a primary medical condition, such as obesity.

The survey also found that 64 medical professionals reported being reprimanded for wearing or wanting PPE.

""We have been urging government to protect those who are vulnerable, so that frontline workers do not themselves fall ill,"" BAPIO President Ramesh Mehta said.

""BAPIO is very keen to do research in this area and we are looking to getting involved with large studies with partners such as Imperial College London to ensure we have the scientific evidence that can be applied in clinical practice,"" Mehta said.

The overall conclusion of the survey is that further research is crucial to establish the factors behind the higher risk faced by BAME communities of Britain during the pandemic.

""There are a number of areas highlighted in this important survey. Being BAME is a clear risk factor, and we need more sophisticated research into this area,"" said Dr JS Bamrah, BAPIO Chairman.

""Also testing was not available to a sizeable number so they may have been isolating needlessly, as well as the fact that the lack of appropriate PPEs remains a recurring issue for our frontline staff,"" he added.

The UK government has launched a review into the ethnic disparity of COVID-19 impact and also vowed to address the shortage of PPE among hospital and care home staff.

The Opposition Labour Party set up its own separate review into the issue of BAME risk factors this week to push forward the timescale for solutions and steps that could be taken to address the issue.

203,25-4-20,Ready to cooperate with Indian agencies: Chinese suppliers of rapid test kits,"Two Chinese pharma companies, which supplied 5.5 lakh rapid testing kits for COVID-19 to India, said they are ready to cooperate with Indian agencies looking into allegations of poor accuracy of their products.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said: ""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products,"" it said.

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people. These take around five to six hours to show the results.

In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result.

206,25-4-20,Lockdown helping flatten Covid curve: Govt,"Without curbs, cases must have mounted to 1 L by now; 10 L people under observation

The Government on Friday said the nationwide lockdown was a timely step without which the cases would have skyrocketed to over one lakh by now. Officials also claimed that nearly ten lakh people who have a travel history or were in touch with corona positive patients, are under observation.

While maintaining that India has fared better than many countries in the fight against the pandemic on various parameters, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said the virus outbreak is under control in the country and thanks to a robust surveillance network with implementation of the lockdown and other containment measures.

Nearly ten lakh people, who have either returned from abroad or were in touch with corona positive patients, are under surveillance.

“Had we not taken the decision to impose nationwide lockdown, we would have had around one lakh Covid-19 cases by now. Cases are now doubling in every 10 days and this is a reasonable estimate,” Niti Aayog member VK Paul, who is also the Chairman of the Government’s Empowered Committee-I said at a Press briefing here.

“As on March 21, our doubling time of cases was three days. Results started showing on March 23, due to travel restrictions imposed earlier. On April 6, further slowing of doubling rate became visible, thanks to the nationwide lockdown,” he added.

He said the decision to impose the lockdown was timely and asserted that the curve has begun to flatten.

“Nationwide lockdown helped take us away from the exponential growth curve and thereby contain the growth of Covid-19 cases,” he said.

“Besides containing the spread, augmenting testing and improving preparedness, the nation has brought about a massive behavioural change through a ‘’Jan Andolan’’ (mass movement),” he said.

Vardhan too echoed similar views saying the Government has saved India from going into stage 3 or community transmission stage. “The positive cases are not rising more than 4 per cent...We were all worried if we are in stage 3, but we have been able to save the country largely from going into stage 3,” said Vardhan, adding “we have all the information connected with clusters and hotspots.”

Detailing the country’s progress in the past 3.5 months in tackling Covid-19, Vardhan said, “On January 8, we held our first meeting, and today, in comparison with many other countries, India has done very well... We have fewer cases per million percentage. We have a mortality of 3 per cent, which is less. Recovery rate of patients, who contracted viral infection, is better than the world. In March, the doubling rate of coronavirus cases was 3 days; today it is close to 9 days.”

Responding to the issue of faulty testing kits, he said, “We will return the testing kits to their country of origin, and we have not paid money yet. Strategies were made to use these kits in hotspots.

Paul also cited a study which that there is no spike in utilisation of fever and cold medicines in the country.

“Our routine surveillance of pneumonia and fever shows that there is no spike. There is no crowding of ICUs or lines outside the hospitals. A study was done on whether the utilisation of medicine used for fever and cold has increased. It has not,” he said.

He pointed out that even after the testing was increased in the country, no proportional increase in cases was seen. “No need to fear hidden spikes in cases,” he insisted.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/lockdown-helping-flatten-covid-curve--govt-2020-04-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/lockdown-helping-flatten-covid-curve--govt.html
207,25-4-20,US will make sure other countries know that coronavirus originated in China: Pompeo,"The United States is working with other countries to make sure they understand that coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said.

Stressing that the burden is on Beijing to explain where the virus came from, Pompeo told The Ben Shapiro Show in an interview on Friday that China knew about the virus by December, 2019.

We need to hold accountable the parties responsible for the deaths here in the United States and the enormous economic costs that have been posed on the US, he said.

Pompeo said that the entire global economic system has been decimated.

""Diplomatically, we're reaching out to countries all across the world to help them do the right thing, to help their economies get started back up, to make sure that when the time is right we can get international travel kicked back up so that global commerce can recommence, he said.

If you get demand back up, that will matter an awful lot to workers right here in the United States of America, he said.

We are also working with those countries to make sure they understand that this was in fact a virus that originated in Wuhan, China, that the Chinese government knew about this certainly by December of 2019,"" he said.

""... and that they (China) failed to comply with their most fundamental obligations as a nation, and importantly, too, failed to comply with the international health regulations of the World Health Organization and then did a lot of things and we can talk about them at great length to cover that up, Pompeo added.

Those are the kinds of things that the US needs to address, he said.

Pompeo alleged that the World Health Organization failed in its mission to protect the world from the pandemic.

We're not going to let that happen again, and we're going to set up something, a system, which delivers an outcome which reduces the risk that anything like this can ever happen again, from China or from anyplace else, he said.

Responding to a question, Pompeo said that even the world's largest businesses now can see the political risk associated with operating in China.

When the Chinese Communist Party refuses to uphold basic norms of transparency, basic set of functions that preserve human rights, and the things that need to happen just to make sure the globe doesn't end up in crises like I think out of their own economic interest they're going to make very different decisions going forward. I think that's completely appropriate for them to evaluate that, he said.

Meanwhile in an interview to NPR, National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said that the burden is on the Chinese to explain where the virus came from. But there is a lab in Wuhan that deals with this sort of virus. And we need to know if there was some sort of release. Accidental, perhaps.""

""We don't know where the virus came from. Maybe it came from a wet market in Wuhan. Maybe it came from one of the two virology labs in Wuhan, O'Brien said.

In a statement, Congressman Jeff Van Drew called out China's government for their role in the ""death, destruction and dereliction"" of human decency in their behaviour over the handling of the coronavirus outbreak.

Every American of every background and creed should be furious with China for their disregard of human well-being amidst the Coronavirus cover-up they have participated in,"" he said.

""Had we known sooner, or had the Chinese government been honest, we would not be in the position we are today, he said.

We have relied on China for far too long to provide cheap labour and goods at the expense of America and our workers. We must bring that supply-chain home and end the export gap we have; It's time to hold China accountable for their actions, Drew said.

Congressman Michael Waltz on Friday introduced a legislation in the House of Representatives that would ban members of the US military and federal employees from funding China's People's Liberation Army through their federal retirement plans.

It is absolutely crazy for our military and federal employees to be indirectly contributing to China's military operations and what's worse is that nearly all of these people are completely unaware of this situation, Waltz said.

Congressman Waltz's bill would ban the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) all five of whom were appointed by President Barack Obama from steering military and federal employees' retirement contributions to China.

Every month, a combined 5.6 million US military members and federal employees contribute to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), a 401K-style plan taken out of their paychecks.

The TSP, which is administered by the FRTIB, is responsible for over USD700 billion in assets, making it one of the world's largest retirement funds.

208,25-4-20,Central teams to visit 4 more States to assess execution of lockdown,"The Centre on Friday constituted five more inter-ministerial teams (IMCT) for spot assessment of lockdown implementation in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Telangana and Tamil Nadu’s Covid-19 pandemic affected areas. Two teams will soon land in Ahmedabad and Surat and one team each will visit Thane, Hyderabad and Chennai.

Six teams were constituted a few days ago — two teams each for West Bengal and Maharashtra and one team each for Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Now in total, Maharashtra is dealing with three Central teams in Mumbai, Pune and latest in Thane.

The IMCT will look into the implementation of the lockdown norms and administration of health sector in these areas. “In some of the districts of the country, a number of violations of the lockdown measures have been reported, posing a serious health hazard and risk for spread of Covid-19, which is against general interest of public. These violations include incidents ranging from violence on frontline healthcare professionals, attacks on police personnel, violations of social distancing norms in market places and opposition to setting up of quarantine centres and so on,” said the Union Home Ministry in statement issued in relation of the new five teams.

These teams would make on-spot assessment of situation and issue necessary directions to State authorities for its redressal and submit their report to the Central Government.

The situation is especially serious in major hotspot districts or emerging hotspots like Ahmedabad and Surat (Gujarat); Thane (Maharashtra); Hyderabad (Telangana); and Chennai (Tamil Nadu). These teams would use expertise of the Centre and support State efforts to fight and contain spread of Covid-19 effectively.

According to Home Ministry officials, except West Bengal, all States are co-operating with the Central teams and working jointly. The Centre and TMC-ruled West Bengal locked horns many times in past three weeks. The Centre’s teams in Kolkata and Jalpaiguri complained that the State administration is not even giving logistic support and preventing State’s health officials to interact with them.

The IMCTs would also be focusing on a range of issues including compliance and implementation of lockdown measures as per guidelines issued under the Disaster Management Act 2005; supply of essential commodities; social distancing in movement of people outside their homes; preparedness of health infrastructure, hospital facilities and sample statistics in the district; safety of health professionals, availability of test kits, PPEs, masks and other safety equipment; and conditions of the relief camps for labour and poor people.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/central-teams-to-visit-4-more-states-to-assess-execution-of-lockdown-2020-04-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/central-teams-to-visit-4-more-states-to-assess-execution-of-lockdown.html

212,25-4-20,"Challenge to have viewers glued to content on web, says Apoora Lakhia","Apoorva Lakhia, the man behind massy entertainers such as Shootout At Lokhandwala and Mission Istanbul , says he is excited about his first web series ""Crackdown"" and hopes the show will be liked by the audiences.

The Voot Select series features a cast of Saqib Saleem, Shreya Pilagonkar, Iqbal Khan, Rajesh Tailang, Waluscha De Sousa and Ankur Bhatia.

Lakhia said unlike movies, web format is altogether a new world and he had a great time working on the series.

""It was a different experience for me, I had fun doing this series. It is a very interesting format, especially the scripting process, there are eight episodes and you need to have enough substance to keep the person hooked every time.

""I hope we have managed to sustain the level of interest of viewers, the way we have made it we are hoping people will binge watch it,"" Lakhia told PTI.

The filmmaker said that while in films there are song sequences to dazzle the audiences, there is no such thing in series and it is only the content that will keep them hooked.

""There is so much content (on the web) that if it is not up to the mark then a person can easily switch off. I hope we have managed to crack the code with our show.

""In movies you can have your pace, songs, but in this (web) you can't have songs and other stuff. The whole idea is to keep the person glued with great content, that's the formula one needs to crack. All this is a challenge.""

Lakhia described ""Crackdown"" as a fast moving show with a lots of twists and turns.

""It is a RAW based, whodunit spy-thriller. It is interesting, fast moving and has lots of twists and turns. We had shot it in seven to eight locations.""

The director said he had finished shooting for the web series a while back but there is a lot of work to be done.

""In this period, the maximum we can do right now is edit the show but that is also taking time, like what would normally take three days is now taking ten days. This is the only process that can happen now.

""It is still going to take time for the series to come out because actors will have to dub, the post production studios are shut, so special effects work and etc is still pending.""

Lakhia hopes the web-series will come out on Voot Select in June or July.

I am editing a video again, for my YouTube channel, and have been trying to see if we can work on some music remotely as well.""

While her big screen debut is likely to take time to come out, the social media star is happy that her foray into digital space with ""Maska"" on Netflix has been well received.

214,25-4-20,'The Falcon and the Winter Soldier' is jam-packed with massive action scenes: Sebastian Stan,"Actor Sebastian Stan has teased that his upcoming Disney Plus series ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" is loaded with massive action sequences.

Stan is reprising his Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) character of Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier in the series, which also features Anthony Mackie returning as Sam Wilson/Falcon.

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the actor said the series is in the same vein as his 2014 blockbuster ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", which critics had hailed as an international espionage thriller.

""In a lot of ways, it felt like a movie. Again, we're not finished; we still have some stuff to do. What I loved about it was that, tonally, it was very much in the same world that 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' was, which was one of my favourite experiences that I've ever had, period.

""So, in a sense, it was grounded and very much in the world as we know it. But, it's also really jam-packed with a lot of massive, massive action scenes mixed with deep focus on character. That's what's really exciting about this,"" Stan said.

The actor further said that the six-episode series will explore the two titular characters in depth and test them by putting them in complex situations.

""We're getting to keep it in the world of the movies, so it's recognisable that way, but at the same time, these characters are getting so much more mileage for all of us to explore them.

""We can put them in situations that we've never been able to put them in before because you now have six hours as opposed to two. It's always a discovery,"" Stan added.

Created by Malcolm Spellman, ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" will debut on Disney Plus in August.

215,25-4-20,US accounts for over one fourth of global COVID-19 deaths,"The United States accounts for more than one fourth of the global COVID-19 deaths and over one-third of the total number of people infected with the deadly virus, latest figures revealed on Friday.

The coronavirus pandemic that started from Wuhan City in China in November, 2019 has so far killed more than 195,000 people across the world and infected more than 27 lakh.

The United States, which has been the worst hit by coronavirus alone accounts the highest number so far; wherein more than 9.2 lakh Americans have tested positive for COVID-19 and the fatalities count on Friday stood at 51,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University.

In fact, the number of COVID-19 cases in the US is more than the next six countries taken together: Spain (219,764), Italy (192,994), France (159,495), Germany (154,545), United Kingdom (144,635) and Turkey (104,912).

Despite accounting for the largest number of fatalities, the death rate, however, in the US is much lower than other countries, according to Johns Hopkins University.

So far, 51,000 people have died due to COVID-19 in US, followed by Italy (25,969), Spain (22,524), France (22,245), and United Kingdom (19,506).

In the United States, New York accounts for the largest number of fatalities (17,671) with 271,890 confirmed cases.

However, the US seems to be past its peak.

Nationwide the per cent of tests that come back positive has declined very significantly, President Donald Trump told reporters at his daily White House news conference on coronavirus.

Last week, roughly 38 per cent of the tests in New York were positive; this week that number is down to 28 percent. New cases in New York are down 50 per cent compared to a week ago, and fatalities are down 40 per cent over the same period, he said.

In Louisiana, the rate of positive test result declined from 25 per cent down to 15 per cent in the last seven days alone. As many as 18 states now show a decline in a number of positive tests in the last seven days which is a very, very significant progress, Trump said.

As a result, half of all Americans live in states that have now taken steps to open their economies, Trump said, a day earlier California, Minnesota, and Tennessee announced additional plans to restart certain sectors.

We ask every American to maintain vigilance and hygiene, social distancing, and voluntary use of face coverings. We are opening our country. It's very exciting to see, he said.

Trump said that he spoke to Tim Cook of Apple and that they have a good sense of the market.

He feels it's going to be a V. The V is sharply upward later on as we actually get it fully open, he said.

Earlier in the day, Trump signed a Paycheck Protection Program and Healthcare Enhancement Act providing USD 320 billion to keep American workers on the payroll.

Of this USD 30 billion of the Paycheck Protection funds will be reserved for small financial institutions, including those that serve minority and distressed communities, extending vital relief to thousands of African American and Hispanic American small-business owners and their employees.

More than 80 million Americans have already received their payment USD 3400 for a typical family of four.

The CARES Act requires that the federal government send out a notice of what benefits Americans are receiving; to fulfil the requirement the Treasury Department is mailing a letter to him.

It will include the amount of their economic impact payment, how it will arrive direct deposit, check or prepaid debit card as well as a message to the nation letting each American know that we are getting through this challenge together as one American family and that is what has been happening, Trump said.

Observing that 184 countries have been hit by coronavirus, the president said that they are all watching the US.

They are all watching, and they're calling, and they respect what we are doing so much. I spoke with the leaders of numerous countries today; they are asking if we can send them ventilators, and I am agreeing to do it,"" he said.

Federal government has over 10,000 ventilators and is helping Mexico, Honduras, Indonesia, France.

We are sending (ventilators) to France, we are sending to Spain, we're sending to Italy, and we will probably be spending to Germany should they need them, he said.

More than 40,000 people have signed the 'Stop Communist China' petition by Friday night, hours after being launched by the former governor of South Carolina who has set a goal of getting 100,000 signatures.

""China's Communist government needs to be held accountable for their role in lying about the Coronavirus pandemic, and the US Congress needs to respond now, said 48-year-old Haley, a former US Ambassador to the United Nations.

Join us in our fight to stop China from gaining influence in America and around the world. Sign this petition and please share with your friends, she added.

Sign our petition to stop the Chinese Communist government's deception and manipulation. We need Congress to act NOW to prevent China's growing influence, the petition said.

Among other things, the petition urges members of Congress to probe whether China covered up the coronavirus outbreak, end the United States' reliance on China for critical medical supplies and pharmaceuticals, make China pay its fair share to the United Nations, back Taiwan against China's bullying, and mandate all US colleges to disclose Chinese funding.

Early this week, she called for an emergency Security Council meeting on China's involvement and knowledge of the virus.

Haley has been a fierce critic of China.

As soon as the UN opens again, the US should call for an emergency Security Council meeting on China's involvement and knowledge of the virus. When did they know & decisions made. If ever the was a time to have a world discussion, it would be following this pandemic, Haley said in a tweet.

Responding to her tweet, the Chinese Ambassador to the UN Zhang Jun asserted that his country has nothing to hide.

All the facts are on the table. Epidemics may occur anywhere. The most important thing is to defeat the virus and save lives. China has done its job and is now working hard in helping others. Attempts of scapegoating or stigma go nowhere, Zhang said.

If that is the case, Haley argued than China would have no problem in a Security Council meeting on the coronavirus pandemic.

I'm assuming you would have no problem expressing that in a Security Council meeting. Other countries including the US have some questions we would like answered, Haley said.

The country also on Saturday reported no new deaths for the second straight day. The figures released from South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Saturday brought national totals to 10,718 cases and 240 deaths.

While a slowing caseload has allowed South Korea to relax its social distancing guidelines over the past week, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun raised concern over possible transmissions by quiet spreaders and instructed officials to conduct antibody tests in Daegu and nearby towns to learn how widespread the coronavirus is.

218,25-4-20,Trump says he was,"Trying to wriggle out of the backlash he received for his outlandish suggestions, US President Donald Trump has said that he was being ""sarcastic"" when he told his medical experts that they should consider using UV light, heat, or injecting disinfectants into the COVID-19 patients as a potential treatment.

Trump faced intense rebuke on Thursday for his far-fetched suggestion from health experts who urged people not to listen to the President's ""dangerous"" advice.

Doctors and the company that makes Lysol and Dettol warned that injecting or ingesting disinfectants was dangerous.

When Trump was asked about his comments during a bill signing on Friday, he said: ""I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen"".

""I was asking a sarcastic and a very sarcastic question to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside,"" he said.

Trump suggested he was talking about disinfectants that can safely be rubbed on people's hands.

""But it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to the reporters,"" The Hill quoted Trump as saying.

When a journalist in the Oval Office pointed out that Trump had turned to experts next to the stage when he first raised the idea on Thursday, the president claimed he was asking those officials ""whether or not sun and disinfectant on the hands can help us.""

Trump on Thursday latched on to a presentation from the Department of Homeland Security for Science and Technology Under Secretary Bill Bryan who detailed initial findings that the coronavirus deteriorates more quickly when subjected to higher levels of heat, humidity and ultraviolet rays from the sun.

""So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light and I think you said that hasn't been checked but you're going to test it,"" Trump said.

""And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside of the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you're going to test that too. Sounds interesting,"" he said.

Trump also asked if there was a way to use disinfectants on the body ""by injection inside or almost a cleaning.""

Asked later if it was irresponsible to give Americans the impression that going outside amid the pandemic would be safe based on the findings, Trump turned to Deborah Birx, a physician coordinating the White House response to the pandemic, and inquired about using the light and heat as a treatment.

""Deborah, have you ever heard of that? The heat and the light, relative to certain viruses, yes, but relative to this virus?""

""Not as a treatment. I mean, certainly ... when you have a fever, it helps your body respond. But not as I've not seen heat or light,"" Birx replied.

""I think it's a great thing to look at,"" Trump said.

The president's remarks were widely and quickly panned by medical experts, elected officials and private companies who warned Americans not to ingest chemicals.

Former Food and Drug Administration head Scott Gottlieb said there was ""no circumstance"" in which an individual should inject themselves with a disinfectant.

The company that makes Lysol also warned on Friday against ingesting its products.

The White House sought to pin the backlash on the media, issuing a statement that accused the press of taking Trump's remarks out of context.

""President Trump has repeatedly said that Americans should consult with medical doctors regarding coronavirus treatment, a point that he emphasised again during yesterday's briefing,"" press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said.

The US has reported over 890,524 COVID-19 cases and over 51,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

219,25-4-20,China approves third COVID-19 vaccine for clinical trials,"China has approved its third coronavirus vaccine for the second phase of clinical trials as it reported 12 new COVID-19 cases, taking the total number of infections in the country to 82,816.

China has approved three coronavirus vaccines, including the one developed by Chinese military, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) for clinical trials.

An ""inactivated"" vaccine developed by Wuhan Institute of Biological Products under the China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) and the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) started its clinical trials, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

An ""inactivated"" vaccine consists of virus particles, bacteria, or other pathogens that have been grown in culture and then lose disease producing capacity. In contrast, live vaccines use pathogens that are still alive.

WIV has been in the eye of the storm in recent weeks as US President Donald Trump and top American officials alleged that the coronavirus may have escaped from there and demanded a probe into it. An official of the WIV denied it, terming the allegation ""entirely based on speculation"".

A total of 96 persons in three age groups have received the vaccine in the first phase of clinical trial as of April 23. The vaccine has shown good safety results so far and vaccine receivers are still under observation, said the Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinopharm.

The randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trials of the inactivated vaccine are conducted in Jiaozuo, central China's Henan Province, and the second phase of clinical trial will focus on the vaccination procedure, it said.

The vaccine will also go through the third phase of the clinical trial, and it may take about one year to complete the clinical trial before finally reaching the conclusion on the vaccine's safety and efficacy, it said.

China has approved three COVID-19 vaccine candidates for clinical trials.

An adenovirus vector vaccine, developed by Institute of Military Medicine under the Academy of Military Sciences, was the first to be approved to enter a clinical trial.

The first phase of the clinical trial was completed at the end of March, and the second phase started on April 12.

Meanwhile China's National Health Commission, (NHC) said on Saturday that 12 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in the country on Friday, of which 11 were imported.

The other one was domestically transmitted in Heilongjiang Province bordering Russia.

The death toll in the country remained at 4,632 people as no fatalities were reported due to coronavirus on Friday, it said.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland had reached 82,816 by Friday, including 838 patients who were still being treated and 77,346 people discharged after treatment.

The total number of imported cases of the coronavirus in China increased to 1,629 on Friday, of this 909 had been discharged from hospitals after recovery, and 720 were being treated with 25 in severe conditions, it said.

Also on Friday, 29 asymptomatic cases were reported. So far, 983 suspected asymptomatic cases, including 150 from abroad, were still under medical observation, it said.

Coronavirus' first epicentres Hubei and its capital Wuhan had 553 asymptomatic cases under medical observation, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

The asymptomatic cases were a cause of concern as the government has lifted over two-month lockdown in Hubei and Wuhan after cases abated.

Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested positive for the coronavirus but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. They are infectious and pose a risk of spreading to others.

220,25-4-20,"Singapore reports 618 new coronavirus cases; total infections increase to 12,693 with 12 deaths","Singapore on Saturday reported 618 new cases of novel coronavirus, taking the total number of infections to 12,693 with 12 deaths in the country, media reports said.

The vast majority of the new cases are among the work permit holders residing in dormitories for foreign workers, including Indian nationals, who work in the labour intensive construction sector.

A total of 25 dormitories, housing foreign workers, have been gazetted as isolation areas.

Singapore is going through a ""circuit breaker"" period to stem the spread of COVID-19.

The period was at first scheduled to end on May 4 but will now last until June 1.

All the non-essential work places have been ordered to stay closed and residents are barred from leaving the house except to buy food and groceries or to exercise alone in the neighbourhood, Channel News Asia reported.

The COVID-19 has so far infected more than 2.7 million people and killed over 190,000 globally. The US is the worst hit with over 51,000 deaths and more than 905,000 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University.

In Singapore, the total number of cases are 12,693 with 12 deaths due to the deadly infection, The Straits Times reported.

Meanwhile, Singapore has changed the dynamics of its care of COVID-19 patients by treating nine out of 10 in community isolation facilities instead of acute hospitals.

The move not only differentiates those with mild illnesses from others with life-threatening conditions, but also saves the hospitals from being deluged, the paper reported.

Community facilities now house 9,878 patients - out of the current patients.

Health experts said that placing the coronavirus-infected patients in isolation facilities will prevent acute hospital beds from being unnecessarily filled by relatively well COVID-19 patients, who would otherwise be discharged only when doctors are certain that they are no longer able to infect others.

""The strategy of moving patients who are well out of hospitals has been applied for some time, even before the first isolation facility became operational on March 24,"" Hsu Li Yang, an expert on infectious diseases, said.

""We have learnt that for many patients, particularly those who are young and have no chronic medical conditions, COVID-19 is no worse than an ordinary flu,"" said Hsu, who leads the infectious diseases programme at the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/singapore-reports-618-new-coronavirus-cases--total-infections-increase-to-12-693-with-12-deaths-2020-04-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/singapore-reports-618-new-coronavirus-cases--total-infections-increase-to-12-693-with-12-deaths.html
221,25-4-20,Pakistan Navy successfully test-fires anti-ship missiles,"Islamabad, Apr 25 (PTI) The Pakistan Navy on Saturday successfully test-fired a series of anti-ship missiles in the North Arabian Sea, a spokesman said.

The missiles were fired from surface ships, fixed and rotary-wing aircraft, the Navy's spokesperson Rear Admiral Arshid Javed said.

Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Zafar Mahmood Abbasi witnessed the firing of the missiles, he said in a statement.

The anti-ship missiles were fired at the sea level by warships and aircraft, according to the statement.

The successful demonstration of missile firing is a testament to the Pakistan Navy's operational capability and military readiness, the official said.

On the occasion, Admiral Abbasi said that the Pakistan Navy is fully capable to respond enemy's aggression befittingly .

Relations between India and Pakistan are strained and they further nose-dived after the Indian government abrogated Article 370 that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir in August last year. Pakistan downgraded diplomatic relations with India and expelled Indian High Commissioner.

India has maintained that Jammu and Kashmir is an internal matter of India and does not want anyone's interference in it.

""I live in Goa so I'm at home right now. The other day my friend was asking me how my life has changed, and I told him nothing has changed for me. I get up in the morning, I come make music in my studio at home and that's it,"" said Mucleya, when asked how he is managing work at a time like this.

""What I usually do is when I go to bed at night I think about the music I will be working on the next morning. So, I try to work as much as I can in my head and have a couple of options ready the next day,"" he added.

Nucleya continued: ""This has gotten me into a bit of trouble with my son when he asks me something about dinosaurs and I am absently agreeing with him. It happens to me a lot when I am mentally thinking about my music during conversations with others.""

Talking about how he is someone who collaborates with a lot of artists, Nucleya said: ""Honestly, I am a very shy person in the studio and most of the songs I make are done over the internet. I was telling my friend the other day to send me the song he had been working on through WhatsApp and not bother recording in the studio and before sending. I was reading something the other day and this one line really stayed with me that goes, 'it's better to have a bad recording of something really incredible than a good recording of a bad song'.""

He has advice for young musicians who are just starting out.

""It's important to have some degree of musical education where you know about chords and scales and melodies and how to stitch different melodies together. That kind of helps in a huge way,"" he said.

233,25-4-20,"Facebook takes on Zoom with Messenger Rooms, no time limit","Alarmed at the popularity of Zoom in social distancing times that allows up to 100 people to join a video meeting from the comfort of their homes, Facebook has announced Messenger Rooms that will allow group video calls of up to 50 people with no time limit.

People can create a room right from Messenger or Facebook, and invite anyone to join the video call, even if they don't have a Facebook account.

In Facebook Messenger Rooms, the users can post links in their News Feed or in Groups or event pages.

""When you create a room, you choose who can see and join it. You can remove people from the call and lock a room if you don't want anyone else to enter,"" Facebook said in a statement late Friday.

If your friends or communities create rooms that are open to you, you'll see them on Facebook so you can find things to do and people to hang out with.

""When you're invited to a room, you can join from your phone or computer — no need to download anything to get started. If you have the Messenger app, you can play with AR effects like bunny ears, and new AI-powered features like immersive 360 backgrounds and mood lighting,"" informed the social networking giant.

Messenger Rooms is rolling out in some countries like the US this week and will expand to the rest of the world soon.

According to Facebook, between WhatsApp and Messenger, more than 700 million accounts participate in calls every day.

In many countries, video calling on Messenger and WhatsApp more than doubled, and views of Facebook Live and Instagram Live videos increased significantly in March when the lockdowns and social distancing came into practice globally.

Messenger Rooms is rolling out in some countries this week and will expand to the rest of the world in coming weeks.

""We're rolling out a new product called Messenger Rooms, the first video chat designed with social interactions in mind,"" said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

""The ability to feel like you are directly connected with someone live over video"" is essential to maintaining that togetherness, Zuckerberg said in a Facebook Live broadcast.

Messenger Rooms will have Zoom like ""immersive 360-degree backgrounds and 14 new camera filters that offer ambient lighting to brighten your space and your face"".

Marred by privacy and security issues, Zoom has surpassed 300 million daily users globally, a 50 per cent increase over the 200 million users it had last month and significantly more than the 10 million members it had at the end of 2019.

The video meet app has seen a spike in users since the COVID-19 pandemic as millions have been forced to work from home.

Facebook also made it official that people will soon be able to have group voice and video calls with up to eight people on WhatsApp.

""As before, these calls are secured with end-to-end encryption so no one else can view or listen to your private conversation, not even WhatsApp,"" it added.

The company also announced to add an option in Facebook Dating to invite people to a virtual date.

""When they accept, you'll start a video chat in Messenger to get to know each other. This will roll out in the coming months,"" said Facebook.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/facebook-takes-on-zoom-with-messenger-rooms--no-time-limit-2020-04-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/facebook-takes-on-zoom-with-messenger-rooms--no-time-limit.html
234,25-4-20,"Apple, Google allay privacy fears around contact tracing app","Amid the growing debate over privacy and security around contact tracing technology, Apple and Google have announced new updates to allay such fears, saying the Bluetooth-driven exposure notification system to enable iOS and Android phones trace the spread of coronavirus is completely safe.

Cybersecurity researchers have questioned the contact tracing technology, saying tracing apps that allow attackers to access a user's Bluetooth also allows them to fully read all Bluetooth communications.

Apple and Google representatives said that they are encrypting metadata associated with Bluetooth.

""By encrypting this data, we make it more difficult for someone to try and use it to identify a person (for example, by associating the transmit power with a particular model of phone),"" the companies said in the updated document.

On April 10, Google and Apple announced a joint effort to enable the use of Bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of COVID-19 through contact tracing, with user privacy and security core to the design.

The tech giants said that the ï¿½Exposure Notification Bluetooth Specification' does not use location for proximity detection. It strictly uses Bluetooth beaconing to detect proximity.

""A user's Rolling Proximity Identifier changes on average every 15 minutes, and needs the ï¿½Temporary Exposure Key' to be correlated to a contact. This reduces the risk of privacy loss from broadcasting them,"" the document read.

Proximity identifiers obtained from other devices are processed exclusively on device and users decide whether to contribute to exposure notification.

""If diagnosed with COVID-19, users must provide their consent to share Diagnosis Keys with the server. Users have transparency into their participation in exposure notification,"" the update added.

Among the technical changes proposed by Apple and Google to the system is that it can now share the strength and duration of a Bluetooth signal so that the apps can make a better judgment of who someone has been in contact with.

To provide even stronger privacy protections, Apple and Google made a slew of changes.

""We are updating the API so that keys will now be randomly generated rather than derived from a temporary tracing key"".

""When the app asks for exposure time, the time is recorded in five minute intervals, and we cap the maximum exposure time reported at 30 minutes,"" the companies added.

Contact tracing is a technique used by public health authorities to measure and slow the spread of infectious diseases.

It requires gathering information from infected individuals about the people they've previously been in contact with. These people can then be notified by public health authorities to take appropriate safety measures, such as undertaking self-quarantine and getting tested.

This is how Apple-Google exposure notification works in the first phase.

Once enabled, users' devices will regularly send out a beacon via Bluetooth that includes a privacy-preserving identifier ï¿½ basically, a string of random numbers that aren't tied to a user's identity and change every 10-20 minutes for additional protection.

Other phones will be listening for these beacons and broadcasting theirs as well. When each phone receives another beacon, it will record and securely store that beacon on the device.

""At least once per day, the system will download a list of beacons that have been verified as belonging to people confirmed as positive for COVID-19 from the relevant public health authority,' said the document.

Each device will check the list of beacons it has recorded against the list downloaded from the server. If there is a match between the beacons stored on the device and the positive diagnosis list, the user may be notified and advised on steps to take next.

In the second phase, available in the coming months, this capability will be introduced at the operating system level to help ensure broad adoption.

Both Apple and Google emphasized that this system does not collect location data from the device, and does not share the identities of other users to each other, Google or Apple.

""The user controls all data they want to share, and the decision to share it,"" they said.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/apple--google-allay-privacy-fears-around-contact-tracing-app-2020-04-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/apple--google-allay-privacy-fears-around-contact-tracing-app.html

Starting this Saturday, Instagram is testing 'Challenges' in Stories, which makes it easy to join challenges through a sticker, via the stories text tool, or from nominations from friends.

""We've seen that challenges are a fun way to interact with your friends on social media and that people are using @mentions, text and hashtags to join popular challenges,"" the company said in a statement.

With this new sticker, people will be able to participate and nominate their friends.

China has approved three coronavirus vaccines, including the one developed by Chinese military, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) for clinical trials.

An ""inactivated"" vaccine developed by Wuhan Institute of Biological Products under the China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) and the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) started its clinical trials, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

An ""inactivated"" vaccine consists of virus particles, bacteria, or other pathogens that have been grown in culture and then lose disease producing capacity. In contrast, live vaccines use pathogens that are still alive.

WIV has been in the eye of the storm in recent weeks as US President Donald Trump and top American officials alleged that the coronavirus may have escaped from there and demanded a probe into it. An official of the WIV denied it, terming the allegation ""entirely based on speculation"".

A total of 96 persons in three age groups have received the vaccine in the first phase of clinical trial as of April 23. The vaccine has shown good safety results so far and vaccine receivers are still under observation, said the Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinopharm.

The randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trials of the inactivated vaccine are conducted in Jiaozuo, central China's Henan Province, and the second phase of clinical trial will focus on the vaccination procedure, it said.

The vaccine will also go through the third phase of the clinical trial, and it may take about one year to complete the clinical trial before finally reaching the conclusion on the vaccine's safety and efficacy, it said.

China has approved three COVID-19 vaccine candidates for clinical trials.

An adenovirus vector vaccine, developed by Institute of Military Medicine under the Academy of Military Sciences, was the first to be approved to enter a clinical trial.

The first phase of the clinical trial was completed at the end of March, and the second phase started on April 12.

Meanwhile China's National Health Commission, (NHC) said on Saturday that 12 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in the country on Friday, of which 11 were imported.

The other one was domestically transmitted in Heilongjiang Province bordering Russia.

Also on Friday, 29 asymptomatic cases were reported. So far, 983 suspected asymptomatic cases, including 150 from abroad, were still under medical observation, it said.

Coronavirus' first epicentres Hubei and its capital Wuhan had 553 asymptomatic cases under medical observation, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

The asymptomatic cases were a cause of concern as the government has lifted over two-month lockdown in Hubei and Wuhan after cases abated.

Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested positive for the coronavirus but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat.

244,24-4-20,From image to action,"Incidents of attacks on healthcare professionals and the poor bring deep shame to us as a society. They leave us diseased in a far worse way than Corona ever could

A large number of people from the Indian middle and upper middle class have a certain image of themselves. They view themselves as modern, progressive and ambitious. This segment of society (to which I and many readers of this esteemed newspaper belong) dreams of all nice things that are available to the rest of the world: Houses, multiple cars and an upgraded wardrobe. They are intent on keeping up with the Joneses. This ambition is important and plays a crucial role in India’s growth story. After all, this segment also employs a large number of people in different capacities and provides demand for the country’s manufacturing sector.

However, buying nice and expensive clothes and taking lovely holidays abroad are not the limited import of modernity and progressiveness. This middle class also views itself as modern in thought: Readers of books on equality; on economics; and on income distribution, among others. We talk and lament about how the migrant workers are suffering so much. We hypothecate about how the economy, which is on a standstill due to the nationwide lockdown, is affecting the poor and the needy. But what about our actions? Do they betray something else and threaten to shatter this self-image?

As Richelle Goodrich said, “Words have less substance than air. Don’t tell me about your zealous dreams, your firm convictions, your profound love — show me.” The spread of the Coronavirus and the ensuing nationwide lockdown are an opportunity where we have a chance to not just preach or talk about modernity and progressiveness but we can practise it. Unfortunately, events of the past few weeks have shown how quickly we turn selfish and self-absorbed in times of crisis.

In the past month, we have seen numerous examples of how Coronavirus patients and healthcare professionals have been harassed by their neighbours in middle class housing societies. We seem to have forgotten that these individuals are “victims” of a virus that can afflict anyone of us. Instead, we seem to have given in to fear and abandoned compassion. This is a heady combination. Any harm that the virus can cause will only be exacerbated by a return to our more basic tendencies.

Another story was reported from Defence Colony, where a family was affected by the virus and as per reports, based on the family’s complaint, the Delhi police registered a first information report (FIR) against the security guard working at the house for allegedly hiding information about him visiting the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters. Ultimately, however, it turned out that the guard tested negative for COVID-19. When the FIR was filed, many messages were forwarded to this writer’s friends who lived in Defence Colony. The forwards warned them against the threats of being exposed to security guards and their help who can be a carrier of the virus. Sadly, there were no similar apologies or retractions after the concerned security guard tested negative. This because it is so easy for us to blame the poor for all our troubles but much harder for us to accept our latent biases. The victims of these biases are not only the poor.

In Madhya Pradesh, for example, a team of policemen and doctors were attacked by locals in Sheopur district. This team had gone to check on a resident who had travelled from Indore, which has become a hotspot for Coronavirus. This type of threat has spread to medical professionals and lab technicians, who are required to travel to the residence of individuals to ensure that the spread of the virus is curtailed as much as possible. But it appears that many of us have given in to fear. We are even getting violent towards these heroes.

Another incident that brought great pain was that of a doctor in Chennai, who died of the Coronavirus, but was refused a proper burial by locals as they protested at the cemetery where his body was taken. Stones were pelted on the ambulance and the doctor’s colleagues were forced to dig a grave with their brave hands to bury him. Is this what we have become? Do we lack any sort of control? Are we so driven by fear that we attack the very people who are working day in and out to ensure we remain safe? When did caution so easily become paranoia? These incidents bring deep shame to us as a society and leave us diseased in a far worse way than Corona ever could.

Look at how the disease itself has been communalised. So much so that the Prime Minister was forced to break silence on the issue and clarify that this disease has no religion or caste. The middle class is increasingly accepting WhatsApp forwards that target a particular community and a particular class.

Whether it is the security guard or a household maid, we find it so easy to lay the blame on an entire community without realising that they make our lives much easier while they risk exposing themselves to protect our societies. We do not want to cook our food or risk being unsafe but we also do not want to accept the fact that by asking our maids to come to our house or the security guards to do their job, we are risking not only their lives but our own.

Similarly, why do we elect politicians, who all but reflect this shameful and hateful idea? Take the example of Tejasvi Surya, the Member of Parliament from Bagalur. He quoted a shameful, embarrassing and disgusting tweet about Arab women, causing India great embarrassment in front of the international community. This is not the first time he has been guilty of promoting such hateful, petty and embarrassing views. While discussing the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests, he had described the protestors as “puncture wallahs.” Of course, this speaks volumes about Tejasvi Surya, but it also says a lot about the urban rich constituents of Bagalur, whom he represents. The voters have to share much of the blame as Surya. The same goes for the voters of Bhopal, who voted for BJP MP Pragya Thakur, someone who is a terror accused and who has repeatedly insulted Mahatma Gandhi.

We can no longer live as if we are a degree of separation from the hate that we see around us. When we forward a WhatsApp text that encourages hate or makes derogatory comments about a particular class or caste or for that matter even when we elect representatives, who give an amplified voice to hate speech, the blood is on our hands as well. No matter how much soap and water we use or how often we wash our hands, this is a virus and a disease that will stay with us till the end unless we face our true image in the mirror and start acting to change this.

246,25-4-20,"Five more test positive for COVID-19 in Bihar, total cases 228","Five more people tested positive for COVID-19 in Bihar on Saturday, taking the total number of cases in the state to 228, a top Health department official said.

Principal Secretary, Health, Sanjay Kumar said two males - aged 27 and 55 years - from Rohtas, a 35-year-old man from Kurtha in Arwal district and two females from Bhojpur and Saran district tested positive for coronavirus.

""We are ascertaining their infection trail,"" Kumar said.

Of the total 38 districts in the state, the outbreak has spread to 21. Arwal, which reported its first positive case, is the new entrant in the list of districts where cases of COVID-19 have been reported.

The state on Friday witnessed the biggest spike in COVID-19 cases when as many as 53 people tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of cases to 223 till Friday evening, less than a week after crossing the three-digit mark.

Jamalpur town in Munger reported an alarming 30 cases, while a dozen more were reported from a village in Buxar apart from Madhepura and Aurangabad registering their first cases on Friday.

Munger accounted for 62 cases while Nalanda reported 34 cases, making these the two worst affected in the state. Six patients from Munger have recovered and one has died.

Although the state, which is home to about 10 per cent of the country's population, accounts for less than one per cent of the total number of COVID-19 cases, the spike witnessed in the past one week has sparked concerns.

The state had witnessed its first couple of cases on March 22 and on April 19, it crossed the three-digit mark with the total reaching 113. The number has nearly doubled since then.

Taking serious note of the rise in cases, the state Health department has already issued a circular making it mandatory for all people to wear face masks while travelling and visiting public places like food, vegetable and dairy and medicine shops.

Those failing to do so would be penalized as per provisions of the Bihar Epidemics Diseases, COVID-19 Regulations, the department added.

249,25-4-20,"Delhi govt to implement MHA guidelines, more categories of shops to open","The Delhi government Saturday said it will implement the Centre's latest guidelines on opening of neighborhood and standalone shops including those selling mobile phones, garments and stationary items.

Sources in the Delhi government, however, said shops in coronavirus containment zones will remain shut and no activity will be allowed in such areas.

Standalone shops and those in residential areas will open with social-distancing norms strictly followed, they said.

However, shops located in market places and malls will continue to remain shut till May 3 in the national capital, as mentioned in the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, the sources said.

On Saturday, the number of containment zones rose to 95 in the national capital.

Asked if allowing additional shops to open was a prudent decision given that the coronavirus cases in the national capital crossed 2500- mark and more areas got added to the containment zones, sources said the Delhi government had to take this decision as people had started opening their establishments in several areas anyway after they heard about the latest MHA guidelines.

Asking them to down shutters resulted in a law and order situation in some areas, they said. ""The Delhi government did not have any option, but to implement the MHA's guidelines.”

""However, no activity will be allowed in containment zones,” a source said.

According to the MHA's guidelines issued late Friday, the shops will be functioning with 50 per cent workforce and adhere strictly to precautions which include social distancing and wearing of masks.

In rural areas, all shops, except those in single and multi-brand shopping malls, are allowed to open.

The Union Home Ministry also said malls, liquor and cigarette shops, sale of non-essential items through e-commerce platforms continue to remain shut.

Restaurants, hair salons and barber shops will not be allowed to open as these render services and do not fall under the shop category.

On Friday, the total number of coronavirus cases in the national capital rose to 2,514, with 138 new cases and three fresh deaths being reported in a day.

250,25-4-20,Centre: No spike in fever and pneumonia; no flooding of ICUs,"Allaying fears over unchecked spread of the COVID-19, the Centre has said there is no spike in fever and pneumonia cases, no flooding of ICUs with patients and that other data-sets indicate there is nothing to suggest a large-scale spread of viral infection in the country.

V.K. Paul, Chairman Empowered Group 1, said: ""The utilization of PM Jan Arogya Package (PM-JAY) indicates, as also other data-sets say, there is nothing of this sort.

""Our routine surveillance of pneumonia and high fever shows that there is no spike as such. Nobody has heard about ICUs being flooded with patients and long queues being formed outside hospitals. A study was done on drug utilization whether the consumption of medicines, in connection with fever and cough, has increased But even this did not happen"".

The response came on a query on the testing capacity of the country, where over 5 lakh tests have already been done for COVID-19. He said that after a the testing was scaled up, ""we have not seen an increase in the proportion of positive cases"".

Dr Paul said the picture the government has presented is the real picture of COVID-19 in the country largely, and there is no undercurrent to conclude that the viral infection is unchecked and that it has spread. ""There is nothing of this sort in the country"", he said.

Dr Paul said only a minor refinement could be made in the picture that ""we have projected"". ""The disease is under control and it is limited, and the effort by the government, including the major decision of lockdown, has helped effectively to bring the outbreak under control. We are ready to move on to the next stage in our fight against COVID-19"", said Dr Paul.

Reacting to the testing strategy, Dr Paul said: ""we have had a nuanced approach for testing in our country, the testing strategy has evolved in accordance with the changing situation. If the situation demands, we will modify and recalibrate our testing strategy. We have enough testing as per the existing situation. We have already put in all efforts to increase our testing capacity"", he added.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/centre--no-spike-in-fever-and-pneumonia--no-flooding-of-icus-2020-04-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/centre--no-spike-in-fever-and-pneumonia--no-flooding-of-icus.html
