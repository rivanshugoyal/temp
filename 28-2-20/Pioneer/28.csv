0,28-2-20,Delhi to host Ayodhya Parv highlighting the birthplace of Lord Rama,"Amidst the preparations of Ram Mandir construction in Ayodhya, the national Capital is hosting three days festival showcasing the cultural, historic and intellectual relevance of the birthplace of Lord Rama. The festival is beginning February 28 at sprawling IGNCA campus at Dr Rajendra Prasad Road.

The 3-day festival will bring together many facets of the place believed to be the birthplace and capital of Lord Ram, including food, music, art, folk dance to documentary representing the heritage sites and socio-cultural life of Ayodhya.

The festival will be inaugurated by HH Mahant Nritya Gopal Das Maharaj, Chairman of Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, eminent Ramayana scholar Vijay Kaushal Maharaj, Union Minister for Women and Child Development Smriti Irani and Dattatreya Hosabale, Sah-Sarakaryavaah of the Rashtriya SwayamsewakSangh (RSS) along with Ram Bahadur Rai, Chairman, IGNCA.

The festival will also be graced by a host of union ministers and eminent personalities from the filed of politics, art, culture and literature over the 3 days, including Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Dharmendra Pradhan, and former union ministers Dr. Sanjay Paswan, Manoj Sinha.

“Ayodhya plays a pivotal role in the religious, spiritual and cultural history of India not just because it’s the birthplace of Lord Rama but also because of its rich past which saw many legendary Kings of Ikshvaku dynasty of which Lord Ram was one of the descendants, as well as for being the place which was the abode for many great sages of our country. Through this festival we wish to present a glimpse of that Grand Ayodhya to the people and highlight its role and relevance in the evolution of Indian civilization,” said Lallu Singh, Member of Parliament from Ayodhya and also the key force behind this initiative.

He added, “ if one wants to know more about India then one should first know the culture of Ayodhya as it is an integral part in the cultural, intellectual history of our country. Through the representation of food, music and art of the town, we want to make a lasting impression in people’s mind, which is much beyond the political, or religious issues Ayodhya was once associated with.

The festival will host Sita Rasoi, the representation of a site at the Ram Janma Bhoomi complex believed to be the kitchen used by Goddess Sita.

The Sita Rasoi will offer various authentic food belonging to the region and the city of Ayodhya along with a series of performances from noted artists including that of folk and classical singer Malini Awasthi, Kathak Dancer Anu Sinha and presentations from Awadhi folk dancers and singers.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/delhi-to-host--ayodhya--parv-highlighting-the-birthplace-of-lord-rama.html
1,28-2-20,"Akhilesh backs Azam, kin; alleges political vendetta","Throwing his weight behind senior leader and party MP from Rampur Azam Khan, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav met him, his legislator wife Tazeen Fatma and former MLA son Abdullah Azam at Sitapur District Jail on Thursday. Nine SP leaders, along with Akhilesh, went to the jail to meet the Khan clan.

After the meeting, Akhilesh told reporters outside the jail that a political conspiracy was hatched to implicate the SP leader.

“We are sure that Khan and his family would get justice from the court. The entire thing is all about political vendetta and cases have been lodged over rivalry. Such type of political vendetta is not justified,” he said.

When asked if Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was responsible for the Khans being in jail, the SP chief said, “There are several people behind the entire conspiracy.”

Akhilesdh also criticised Yogi Adityanath for his language against opposition members in the Assembly. “A CM should use respectful language in public,” he said.

Earlier, the SP chief was scheduled to reach Rampur and even booked a private aircraft for going to Bareilly and then head to Rampur by car to meet the incarcerated Khan, but on being informed that Khan had been transferred to Sitapur jail early Thursday morning, he cancelled his visit and instead went to Sitapur to meet the SP leader.

Upon reaching Sitapur District Jail from Rampur early Thursday morning, Khan told reporters that everyone in the country knew what was happening. “There is nothing secret about how we have been implicated in the case,” he said.

Khan, along with his wife and son, had surrendered before a Rampur court on Wednesday and were sent to judicial custody till March 2. But after Rampur police expressed apprehension over deterioration of law and order situation due to the SP leaders being jailed, they were shifted to Sitapur District Jail.

Jail Superintendent DC Mishra told reporters that the SP MP and his son Abdullah had been provided special security while Tazeen Fatma would be kept in women’s barrack. The case in which the Khans have been sent to jail pertains to two birth certificates of Abdullah Azam, who allegedly gave wrong date of birth while filing his nomination papers for Assembly elections in 2017. His election was set aside by the Allahabad High Court last December. He later approached the Supreme Court, which is still hearing the case.

A BJP leader from Rampur, Akash Saxena had lodged an FIR alleging fraud related to Abdullah Azam’s two birth certificates. In April, the police filed filed a charge sheet in court maintaining that Abdullah Azam also had two passports and two PAN cards.

In one birth certificate, issued by Rampur Municipality, Abdullah’s birth date was mentioned as January 1, 1993 while another certificate said that he was born in Lucknow on September 30, 1990.

A case was also registered against Azam Khan and his wife as they had submitted an affidavit buttressing their son’s second birth certificate.

Khan represents Rampur in Lok Sabha and his wife is an MLA from Rampur Assembly seat. Their son Abdullah won from Suar Assembly segment in 2017 but his election was setaside by Allahabad High Court.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/akhilesh-backs-azam--kin---alleges-political-vendetta.html

3,28-2-20,Anti-CAA protests rock UP Assembly,"The ongoing protests against Citizenship (Amendemtn) Act rocked the Assembly on Thursday with Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna accusing opposition parties of creating anarchy by supporting the protesters across the state.

“Opposition parties like SP, BSP and Congress are provoking people by spreading lies on the CAA. They have forced people to sit on dharna on an allurement that if they come to power, the protesters will be given pensions,” Khanna said during a debate on budget discussion on Thursday.

The minister had a heated exchange of words with Leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary, which led to pandemonium as members of opposition parties raised anti-government slogans and protested Khanna’s statement.

The Parlaimentaryu Affairs Minister made the allegations after Chaudhary said that Khanna had ignored questions raised by him on his budget speech. Khanna, who is also Finance Minister, had earlier finished his reply to the debate on the 2020-2021 budget.

With Chaudhary accusing Khanna of ignoring his question, the minister took a dig at him over his earlier statement outside the House that those sitting on anti-CAA dharna would be given pension.

This triggered a heated exchange between Khanna and Chaudhary with the latter reiterating that pension is given to patriots. “How can you tell people sitting on dharna that they would get pension,” Khanna asked.

The Leader of Opposition reacted by saying that those struggling for restoration of democracy are given pension. “We are also getting it as ‘Loktantra Senanis’ (those arrested during emergency) and people sitting on anti-CAA dharna are fighting to restore constutution,” Chaudhary said.

Khanna entered into a debate and asked Chaudhary to prove what was anti-Constitutional in the CAA. “Tell me one clause which violates the spirit of the Constitution. The SP, BSP and Congress are trying to create anarchy in the state,” he asserted.

Chaudhary questioned as to why Muslims were kept out of the clause of giving special benefits while according Indian citizenship. “This is nothing but pursuing the politics of dividing the society on Hindu-Muslim lines,” the SP leader said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/anti-caa-protests----rock-up-assembly.html
4,28-2-20,Yogi blames previous government for dip in per capita income,"Continuing his tirade against opposition parties, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath blamed the previous dispensation for a dip in per capita income in the state which was being worked on by his government for improvement.

Earlier on Wednesday, Yogi had fired a salvo at opposition parties claiming how his government changed the atmosphere in the state by pushing the development agenda on priority and improving law and order situation.

Addressing the Legislative Council on Thursday, the Chief Minister said that a district-wise look at per capita income indicated that it was Rs 6 lakh in Noida and Rs 3,200 in Balrampur.

“Balrampur, Chitrakoot and Chandauli could also have been developed like Noida, but the previous regimes did not try to strike a balance which is the cause of this disparity. The per capita income in the state is almost half the national average. But when our government completes its term in 2022, it will be touching the national average,” Yogi asserted.

The BJP government in UP presented a budget of Rs 5,12,860.72 crore for 2020-21 fical last week. Yogi also accused previous regimes of discrimination in extending benefits of development schemes.

“The Central government has selected 112 aspirational districts across the country, of which eight are in Uttar Pradesh. These districts are near the national average on development front,” Yogi said.

Detailing works done by his government, the Chief Minister said that a Rs 15,000-crore scheme to provide potable water in every household of Bundelkhand was on the cards. “Medical colleges are being set up in 16 districts including Amethi. When BJP came to power in the state, there were 16,264 bank branches which has now gone up to 18,869. Earlier there were only 8.62 crore bank account hiolders in the staste which has now spiked to 16.36 crore,” he said.

Earlier on Thursday morning, as the House assembled, Congress Legislative Party leader in the Council, Deepak Singh raised the issue of cow deaths, asking that when the government was so concerned, then how was the death rate of bovines increasing. Singh also asked whether Rs 30 per day to feed cows lodged in `gaushalas’ (cow shelters) was enough to feed the animals.

Samajwadi Party and other opposition party members also supported the Congress leader questioning the government over rise in deaths of cows.

Animal Husbandry Minister Laxmi Narain Chaudhary tried to address the issue, but the Congress members were unsatisfied with his clarification and staged a walkout.

Meanwhile, BJP member in the Council Vijay Bhadhur Pathak also raised the issue of rampant corruption in Azamgarh Development Authority (ADA). Highlighting staff crunch in ADA, Pathak said that the entire district was witnessing illegal construction which was creating a big problem for free flow of traffic. He even alleged that government departments were also engaged in illegal construction.

Pathak said that the common man was running from pillar to post to get a map of their houses cleared from ADA. The MLC requested his own government to immediately post more staff in ADA and take necessary action so that illegal constructions were stopped and people did not face traffic chaos.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/yogi-blames-previous----government-for-dip----in-per-capita-income.html
5,28-2-20,Azam’s son disqualified as UP Assembly member,"In another setback to Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan family, presently lodged in jail, Uttar Pradesh Assembly on Thursday issued order for disqualifying his son Abdullah Azam from Swar assembly seat in Rampur district.

The notification was issued by UP Assembly Secretariat stating that on December 16, 2019, the Allahabad High Court, in a case of fake birth certificate of Abdullah Azam, had disqualified the SP member from Swar assembly seat.

7,29-2-20,Dismissals due to batsmen's errors: Vihari,"Hanuma Vihari on Saturday said poor shot selection led to India getting bowled out for a below-par 242 against New Zealand on a ""fair pitch"", dealing a blow to their hopes of a comeback in the two-Test series.

New Zealand were 63 for no loss at stumps on the opening day of the second and final Test.

Vihari, who was very impressive in his 55 off 70 balls, said that he wanted to attack so that Cheteshwar Pujara can play his natural game of grinding the bowling.

""Yes, obviously as the pitch didn't do as much as we expected,"" Vihari was honest in his assessment of the green top.

""They bowled in good areas and knew what to expect from this track. Prithvi set the tone, Pujara spent time. All dismissals happened at wrong time. None of the dismissals were because of the pitch. Mostly it was because of batsmen's error. Pitch was fair,"" the dependable middle-order batsman said.

On this track, a total in excess of 300 would have been an ideal first-innings score.

Vihari looked in command while playing the short ball and he said leaving them would have also hampered Pujara's natural game.

Both of them playing a defensive game in the first Test in Wellington cost India dearly.

""As Pujara was playing at one end and I wanted to take that lead and play positively because he is a player who will play for a lot of time. We know that.

""So I didn't also want to take time and put pressure on Pujara or on our innings because if you don't keep scoreboard moving you will get stuck like in the last game. That's why I decided to play positively and take them on,"" Vihari explained his game plan.

He regretted getting out at the wrong time as his dismissal at the stroke of tea triggered a collapse in the final session.

""It was a wrong time to get out obviously just before tea as we had a good session. We scored 110 runs and lost only one wicket prior to that. I was batting positively but I played one shot too many.""

For Vihari, going after the short ball was his decision.

""It was a personal decision. As a team we wanted to show more intent. Wicket was much better here and it was a personal decision to put the short ball away and put pressure on them.

""It didn't go our way on a couple of occasions. I am sure when we get opportunity again we can do it.""

Vihari had played an A game at the Hagley Oval and his assessment is that the pitch would flatten out eventually.

""I played an India A game here and that's what I was communicating to my teammates that it doesn't do much after the first session and it really flattens out after that.

""It will slow down on day three and four. It played according to our imagination. It's a fair wicket,"" he assessed.

He said Kyle Jamieson's five-wicket haul was well deserved.

""He will get much more bounce than other bowlers and that extra bounce is a factor on these kind of pitches where it is bouncy and much more spongy than Indian tracks.

""To play him on frontfoot balls are more dangerous than back of length or short balls. Jamieson deservingly got five wickets.

8,28-2-20,Shouldering responsibility,"South Asian nations face a water crisis which poses a threat to agriculture and industries. Given its increasing influence, is India willing to become a provider of water security in the region?

On May 23, 2013, while speaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the Indian National Defence University, Gurugram, the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh exuded confidence that India was well-positioned and willing “to become a net provider of security” in its immediate region and beyond. In 2015, the Institute for Defence Studies and Analysis (IDSA), New Delhi, came out with an assessment report titled, India as a Security Provider. The report highlights India’s growing military capabilities and its proactive responses to the human and non-human threats to the littoral nations of the Indian Ocean, which corroborates the country’s image and positioning as a benign power and net security provider in the region. But the question here is: Is India also willing to play the role of net security provider when it comes to ensuring water security in the region? The above-mentioned IDSA report points out, “While traditional security threats limit India’s role; cooperation on non-traditional threats opens up a new opportunity for India to play a regional role.” Thus, it is a geostrategic imperative for India to focus on non-traditional security threats in the region emerging from sectors such as water and energy.

Today all the nations of South Asia face a water crisis in one form or another due to a range of factors — population growth, urbanisation, inefficient use, bad management and lack of governance, among others. The unfolding water crises pose a serious threat to sustainable development, agriculture and industries, poverty reduction and the ecosystem. Climate change has exacerbated the brewing water crises like never before. The United Nations Secretary General António Guterres has termed climate change as “the most systematic threat to humankind.”

Water is a common resource and managing and governing it has always been a challenge at any scale, be it local or regional. A participatory robust institutional architecture for water governance is needed to manage and govern resources in a systematic and efficient way. Many of the important water bodies in South Asia are transboundary and thus their basins spread in more than one country. Integrated basin management would not be a reality without regional cooperation at the South Asian level.

Most of the water treaties in South Asia are bilateral in nature, which form the core of the South Asian political ecology of governance. Be it upper or lower riparian, nations in the region are apparently not content with the existing treaties. For example, India, an upper riparian nation, does not seem to be happy with the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan, a lower riparian nation in this case. Between Bangladesh, a low riparian nation and India, the Teesta river issue still remains unresolved, with Dhaka asking for an increase in water share. People in Nepal, an upper riparian nation, think water treaties with India produces environmental injustices to the riverine people of Koshi river. Along with this kind of political ecology of the region, the issue of sovereignty in South Asia is a very sensitive topic. South Asia represents a typical case of the Westphalian concept of sovereignty, where each nation has exclusive sovereignty over its territory and the natural resources, including water. No nation would like to be seen as compromising its sovereignty. However in reality, in the face of globalisation and trade integration, each nation is bargaining its sovereignty with the other nations and regional and international actors. These two factors — the existing South Asian political ecology and the power politics played out in the name of sovereignty — both hinder and open up opportunities for regional cooperation at the same time. Some may think that regional cooperation compromises on the sovereignty of a State. However, the notion of sovereignty can be broadened to accommodate and facilitate the idea of cooperation, which is not about imposing suzerainty of one nation on another.

India has been quite active in the region in terms of coming to the rescue of its neighbours when they are in trouble. A case in point is when Maldives faced a water crisis in December 2014, India launched Operation NEER to immediately provide Maldives with it. The people and the Government of Maldives were appreciative of India’s quick response and help. Having said that, one must be mindful that those were more of a response to a crisis that emerged and similar exercises could be useful to tackle future contingencies of that sort. However, water woes coupled with the effects of climate change have resulted in a distinct set of challenges that call for India’s proactive role in the South Asian region. What is required today is a continuous regional cooperation in providing water security, which is at present marred by the absence of an institutional architecture for water governance in South Asia.

India should play a lead role in institutionalising regional cooperation by establishing a robust architecture. It has already set an example with the launch of South Asian Satellite in 2017, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his tweet termed as a “symbol of South Asian cooperation” and “a journey to build the most advanced frontier” of regional cooperation and partnership. With India looking for a larger regional role, it cannot afford to be a security consumer. It has to metamorphose itself into a credible security provider. Benjamin Kienzle, a faculty member of Defence Studies at King’s College London, elucidates, “A security provider has a stronger interest in the immediate security of a third party, rather than in direct security gains for itself…the action of a security provider easily lead to a win-win situation…A security consumer, on the other hand, is primarily interested in its own security and is largely indistinct towards the security needs of third parties…In general, security consumers create easily win-lose situations...” Notwithstanding, he makes it clear that a security provider in no way compromises its own security interests.

Domestically India has made some progress to improve water governance. The then Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) constituted a committee led by Mihir Shah to suggest institutional reforms for water governance to deal with the water challenges that India faces in the 21st century. In July 2016, the Committee came out with a report titled, A 21st Century Institutional Architecture for India’s Water Reforms. The report makes a number of critical suggestions to strengthen the governance of India’s water resources. One of them is about its shape and structure. The report underlines that “polycentric governance regimes characterised by a distribution of power but effective coordination structures perform better.” Considering water as one of the sectors most vulnerable to climate change, the report stressed that the ability to respond to it is strengthened by polycentric governance regimes.

The existing political ecology of South Asia makes the space of water resources a geopolitically contested zone. Governance is needed to protect the environment, to save the ecology and to manage water resources in an integrated and holistic manner. Polycentrism is inherent in South Asia and by default distribution of power is effected by the very nature of South Asian sovereignty. What is missing essentially is the effective coordination to realise and unlock water governance potential in the region. Effective coordination can be established only through a well-structured institutional architecture involving all the actors and stakeholders. With the emergence of non-State environmental actors and groups in the region, the role of governments has receded in water governance and self-organised governance networks have found prominence.

In their article “Reflections on Actor-Network Theory, Governance Networks, and Strategic Outcomes”, Ludmilla Meyer Montenegro and Sergio Bulgacov caution that, “self-organised governance networks can impede (policy) implementation…or they can enhance the efficiency of policy implementation…Thus, it is important to determine how these networks are formed, who forms them and how they function, since they have such direct impacts on governance. The more we know about networks, the better we understand governance dynamics and its relationships with the Government, informal mechanisms, and private actors.”

India should painstakingly study the governance networks that exist today in South Asia for conceptualising a regional institutional architecture for water governance in the region, to not repeat another SAARC which is failing under its burden.

9,28-2-20,India’s baptism by fire,"The nation is passing through a transitional period in its history, from a feudal agricultural society to a modern industrial one

Few people in India or for that matter, outside the country, are able to understand what is happening in the nation, particularly after the recent mindless violence in the national Capital in which as many as 38 people lost their lives and a whopping 150 were injured, apart from the massive destruction of private and public property. So let me try and explain this as best as I can. India is passing through a transitional period in its history, from a feudal agricultural society, to a modern industrial one. At present it is not entirely feudal nor entirely modern but stuck somewhere in between. Though there was a limited degree of industrialisation in India after 1947, it was not complete, like in Western countries (or even anywhere near that of China). Feudal remnants in the form of casteism, communalism, religious bigotry, superstitions, gender discrimination and so on are still powerful and well-entrenched.

A transitional period is always a very painful time in history as it is full of turbulence and strife. If we read the history of Europe from the 16th to the 19th centuries, when Europe was passing through its transition from a feudal to modern society, we find it was full of turbulence, turmoil, wars, revolutions, chaotic conditions, intellectual ferment and so on. It was only after going through this fire that modern society emerged in Europe. At present, India is going through this fire and we are going through a very painful epoch, which night last another 15-20 years or so.

For what is a transitional period? It is a time when the old society is being totally uprooted and torn apart, when ancient values are being challenged and destroyed but new values are yet to be created. Can such a historical transition be achieved peacefully? One wishes it could be so. However, historical experience shows otherwise. The vested interests in the old order always put up a fierce resistance to any fundamental change in the political and social order, as that would endanger their interests. So this change can only be achieved by some kind of revolution.

People ask when and how such a revolution will come about in India. Who will be its leaders? No one can say for sure. One can never be rigid about historical forms. But this much can be said with certainty: Some kind of revolution is inevitable in India because everything has collapsed here. All our State institutions have become hollow and empty shells, while on the other hand the Indian economy is sinking and the people’s distress is growing. Nature does not like a vacuum and chaos cannot continue forever. So some alternative to the present political and social system is bound to emerge.

At present we have a parliamentary democracy in our country but this runs largely on the basis of caste and communal vote banks. Casteism and communalism are feudal forces which must be destroyed if India is to progress. However, parliamentary democracy further entrenches them. So we have to have an alternative. What that alternative system will be has to be thought out by intellectuals and for this they have to use their creativity. Intellectuals are the eyes of society and without them a society is blind. However, the test of every political system or act is one and only one: Does it raise the standard of living of the people ? Does it give them better lives?

Before an actual revolution there has to be an intellectual revolution. For instance, before the French Revolution of 1789 there were several decades of intellectual struggles by great thinkers like Voltaire, Rousseau and the other thinkers of the Enlightenment, who attacked the feudal system, religious bigotry and so on. This intellectual revolution is needed to change the mindsets of the masses who are at present steeped in feudal ideas and feudal practices.

So the present stage in Indian history is the pre-revolutionary stage, i.e, the stage of the intellectual revolution. All patriotic, broad-minded intellectuals must contribute to it. In particular, they must attack the poison of communalism which has gripped India, and which is being promoted and fostered by our medieval-minded political masters.

All forces which divide our people and spread religious or caste hatred must be strongly combated, for only a mighty united people’s struggle can lead to the revolution which will transform India into a prosperous, highly developed and highly industrialised country. It will also get rid of the scourge of poverty, record and rising unemployment, appalling level of child malnourishment, almost total lack of proper healthcare and quality education for our masses, atrocities and discrimination against minorities and Dalits, widespread corruption, gender discrimination, female infanticide, child marriage farmers distress and so on, which have bedeviled Indian society for long.

10,28-2-20,Make nature’s value visible,"If bureaucrats could accept poverty-alleviation as a mainstream agenda to make a powerful diminution of rural poverty, accounting for the GDP of the poor can be the way forward

It has taken the world a while to reach the understanding that nature can never be taken for granted. Unfortunately, in India, this is not the case and utilisation of common natural resources like forests, green cover, oceans, rivers, fish stocks and so on, doesn’t reflect anywhere in our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) accounting, as these are difficult to chronicle. This economic inconspicuousness of nature’s services becomes an underlying concern, which has generated debate and discussions like The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) initiated by the United Nations in 2007. TEEB is a global initiative focussed on “making nature’s value visible”. Its main objective is to mainstream the value of biodiversity and ecosystem services into decision-making at all levels. It aims to achieve this goal by following a structured approach to valuation that helps decision-makers recognise the wide range of benefits provided by ecosystems and biodiversity, demonstrate their values in economic terms and where appropriate, capture them in decision-making.

Although conservationists like Pavan Sukhdev and Gretchen C Daily — pioneers in illuminating and quantifying the economic value of our natural environment — who are awarded with the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement in 2020, have clearly put forward the same opinion, acceptance remains elusive. The economic invisibility of nature to drive humanity and dependence upon market-based economic systems, remain at the heart of deserved recognition to account for nature in the GDP, especially in relation to the survival of marginalised sections of society. This invincibility somehow hampers the cognition to acknowledge the GDP of the poor via negative externalities. Often, in the process, the secondary sector (industrial) omits to make the required dent due to an invisible characteristic attached to the transformation, from sourcing of raw material to processing of finished produce.

Think-tanks and economists realised the requirement for true demonstration of environmental economics or “greenomics” for its invisible values much earlier and American biologist and philosopher Garrett Hardin’s The tragedy of the commons is an exemplar to this. For the uninitiated, the tragedy of the commons is a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users, acting independently according to their own self-interest, behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling the shared resource through their collective action. It is quite worrisome that big business houses and people at large are not able to value the gratuitous support provided by nature due to imprudence and the incompetence to distinguish private goods from public goods.

Greenomics is all about economic factoring of public and non-marketed (those not made by man and not transacted in the market) goods in computation of the national domestic product of an economy. It is definitely essential (and poses a challenge in a way) to evaluate the intrinsic economic value, as most of the business minds have tried to comprehend today. One such endeavour comes through the Global Initiative for a Sustainable Tomorrow (GIST) platform to quantify the impact of negative externalities by allocating economic values to invisibles to make it a plausible option for inclusion by the bureaucrats and corporates.

The concept of GDP accounting of the poor appears to be crucial in that it has to blend sustainability along with big data that is accessible to all. The TEEB framework facilitates all of the above by merging it with data analytics, technology and sustainability.

Certainly, it is not about placing a price on nature, rather it is about recognising, demonstrating and valuing nature’s services to people. Nobody is buying or selling a cloud. The reality is that forests can generate rainfall that is vital for agricultural productivity. However, recognising and demonstrating that true scientific value is the reality now.

The idea propagated by TEEB’s Indian members, “GDP of the poor”, holds relevance especially in a fragile atmosphere of everlasting ecological uncertainties that undoubtedly will decide the future placement of the nation on the global map. Their report signals that the rural production system would suffer the most, given the destruction of our ecosystems. The question that we must ask ourselves is, that if nations like Vietnam, Indonesia and so on, can separately compute the GDP of the poor, why not India, despite three of the members on the board of the TEEB being Indian. Initiatives like zero-budget natural farming in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra are welcome and the need of the hour. If bureaucrats could accept poverty-alleviation as a mainstream agenda to make a powerful diminution of rural poverty, accounting for the GDP of the poor can be the way forward.

11,28-2-20,"Some hard, home truths","It is an irony of our times that the very Government, which promised to protect the country from any divisive internal or external force, has failed to fulfill its duties

When the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was voted to power in 2014 and then even more resoundingly in 2019, one of the pillars that the party sought to stand on was its claim that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will represent a strong Government and that it will protect the country from any divisive internal or external force. It is this assurance that forms the backdrop of the now-infamous belief that the Prime Minister’s “56-inch chest” will provide India with a protective shield. Events that unfolded in Delhi over the past week, where clashes broke out between communities that led to the killing of 35 people (at the time of writing), have thrown cold water over the Prime Minister’s hollow claims of leading a strong Government.

In fact, there will be few instances in the history of independent India where a citizen has felt more unsafe than he/she does right now. Delhi is in the midst of its worst riots since 1984. And as relevant authorities examine who exactly is to be blamed for the violence that has been unleashed, there are some issues that are indisputable and require some tough answers.

The first is, how did such a riot take place, that, too, in the capital city? Delhi is not just the capital of this country but is also home to India’s most well-funded and trained police force. Let this sink in. Theoretically speaking, this means that the Delhi police, which functions under the Central Government that is controlled by the BJP and more specifically comes under the direct supervision of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, is India’s best equipped police force. This means that in terms of numbers and assistance, compared to other forces across the country, the law and order situation in Delhi could not have been better protected. Well, hypothetically speaking, at least.

In addition to this, Delhi is also the centre for all intelligence agencies in the country. It is home to several intelligence bodies, whose job includes to be alert about all possible acts of violence or riots that may erupt in the country. But the intelligence bodies and the police force have failed to prevent violence in not more than a 10-km radius from Parliament. How does this make those residing in other parts of the country feel? If the Government could not stop acts of mass violence in places where its base is the strongest, how exactly does it plan to protect the rest of the country?

Let’s once assume that this is not true. But the element of bias cannot be denied because as per reports, the Delhi police was sent at least six alerts on Sunday (February 23), asking for deployment to be stepped up after BJP leader Kapil Mishra called for a gathering in support of the Citizenship Act at Delhi’s Maujpur. Why then was the police so helpless in preventing violence? This is a greater cause for concern because if the Delhi police is better equipped to tackle violence than any other police force in the country, why did it fail to deliver?

These are not the only questions over the conduct of the Delhi police. Why are videos of police personnel destroying CCTV cameras doing the rounds? The only way to get answers and to ensure that such riots do not happen again is to dig deep and find out as to what exactly happened. But how will the destruction of CCTV cameras help answer that question?

What I am concerned about and what should concern all of us is the establishment of truth and the delivery of justice to all those people who have been affected by this senseless violence. This can be done only by taking appropriate action against those involved in the violence. Perpetrators include leaders of political parties of every hue and any official, who allowed such violence to go unabated for three days.

The more serious concern is that slowly but steadily, we have reached this shameful place. There are a few reasons for this. One is the lack of resistance by the bureaucracy. I have some sympathy for the bureaucrats here though. Governments of the past have often shown — and the BJP Government has mastered — how adept they are in the art of abuse, twist and wrangle. This is in contrast to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s vision of the civil services being the “steel frame” of good governance.

Bureaucrats are now routinely being threatened with transfer orders, raids by income tax authorities or the Enforcement Directorate or any other agency which is at the Centre’s disposal with a degree of reckless abandon. I don’t think we would have to go more than a few weeks behind to find an instance of such abuse. It has permeated all institutions, including the Election Commission of India.

More recently came the brazen example of Justice S Muralidhar of the Delhi High Court, who received a presidential order transferring him to the Punjab and Haryana High Court. This order came a day later after he pulled up the Solicitor General and the Delhi police for inaction during the riots in north-east Delhi. Coming down heavily on the Delhi police, he pulled it up for its failure to register FIRs against alleged hate-speeches by three BJP leaders, Anurag Thakur, Kapil Mishra and other usual suspects from the BJP.

While pressure by a Government on the bureaucracy and the judiciary is not an invention of the BJP — there are obvious examples of the Emergency, 1984 and 2002 — rarely has there been as concerted an effort by a Government to undermine all institutions, all at once. Circumstances are not helped by members of these institutions either. So often, we see bureaucrats being asked to jump and respond back with, “How high?” In the judiciary, too, we have recently seen a sitting Supreme Court judge lavish heavy praise on the Prime Minister even as serious allegations of abuse of State power were being examined by the very same court.

Such acts and comments by individuals in positions of authority — whether in the bureaucracy or in the judiciary or any other institution — have chilling effects on the citizens. It erodes their faith in the institutions and the Constitution. This poses a greater risk to India’s democratic health in the long term than individual acts of abuse of power by the BJP that I have highlighted in this article.

So what do we do? If the State machinery is failing us and institutions are displaying a lack of backbone, the answer and burden (unfortunately or fortunately) fall on everyday people. Unfortunate because this is a great burden that the civil society must now discharge when its institutions appear to be found wanting. Fortunate because there is rarely a time in history when any Government or institution can suppress the will of the people. The only thing we must make sure is that we fight, not with violence, but with vigour, voice and vote to uphold the rule of the law and the Constitution. Victory then will be undeniable for everyone who wants to live in a unified, peaceful and prosperous democracy.

12,28-2-20,Costlier casualty,"The Delhi violence is serious because it shows that binaries have been deep-set and a panic economy has taken over

The story of the Delhi violence lies much beyond the headlines or the number of the dead. The terrifying visual of a man, whose photo of being beaten up by a violent mob simply because he wore a certain kind of clothes and sported a beard went viral, validated the pogrom-like sequence of events as the new normal and its casual acceptance in normal life. It’s something as statistical as an accident on the crime charts. It is serious simply because it happened in Delhi, the nation’s capital no less, and not in a far-flung town in India clouded by obscurantism. It is a test case that could get copied elsewhere and worse, be passed off as another law and order situation that can be tamped down by Section 144. When a judge like Justice Muralidhar, whom junior lawyers call an inspiration, gets transferred overnight for daring to question the Delhi police, then we should worry, with deep furrowed brows. Simply because an independent judiciary is the only hope for citizens seeking justice and rights that the Constitution guarantees to them. If this institution is broken, then our statute books mean nothing at all and public morality simply spins out of the orbit of our nation as we knew it. Till now. If north-east Delhi, where various communities have literally lived cheek by jowl for decades and more, is torn asunder by blood-curdling rage at the mere remark of an extremist, it shows that Indians, as a people, are harbouring a tinder box in their minds. This is a separatism that has nothing to do with the unresolved wounds of Partition. But an otherisation propaganda that has been bred systematically on a fertile ground of insecurities and economic denial. The polarisation of the mind is a far deadlier poison for it blunts the edge of humanity. It also means a subterranean conflict, which may bubble up any moment and because of its smouldering nature, engulf every other human possibility of reason, wisdom and compassion. If BJP motormouth and “go and kill” instigator Kapil Mishra has not been reined in despite protests from within his own party, it legitimises the politics of hate as a yielder of fast dividends and delegitimises public service. Politically, socially and culturally, there is a sudden vacuum which nobody wants to plunge into or commit to. That explains why the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), despite winning a solid verdict, seems uncertain about the public stance it should take. It cannot stick its neck out simply because nobody, including the BJP, knows what shape panic can acquire in a vacuum. Prejudice has taken over national pride to such an extent that everybody listens to it, not without it.

The only certainty about these uncertain times is that it is not the best time to seek our place in the world. US lawmaker Bernie Sanders has expressed reservations and concern as has the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF). Even UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was “very saddened” by the casualties in Delhi. He called for maximum restraint and violence to be avoided. Although the Modi Government sought to describe such comments as “factually inaccurate and misleading,” truth is the world doesn’t expect India to indulge in genocidal politics. Especially, when we use the optics of the Sabarmati ashram for visiting dignitaries but forget the non-violence mantra preached by its original resident. When it comes to the Opposition, the BJP anyway wins the battle on competitive whataboutery. So when senior Congress leaders, led by party chief Sonia Gandhi, met President Ram Nath Kovind to demand the resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah over his “abdication of duty”, the party reminded it of the anti-Sikh riots of 1984. BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur, another motormouth who hasn’t been reined in, asked the Congress to review its role during that period. Only RSS general secretary Suresh “Bhaiyyaji” Joshi advised the BJP that nobody had the right to take the law into their hands and that the Centre should ensure that peace is restored in Delhi. Placatory, high-sounding terms that are abstract enough to spare the BJP’s extreme elements, all of whom have been birthed by its ideology. In the end, it is time for the civil movement to free itself from the piecemeal appropriation of causes and issues by political parties. Or be exploited by them. For Delhiites, who have found a new identity in a city that is a melting pot of all migrants, the time for denial is over. We cannot be sporting identity cards like a curfew pass. We must stand up and be counted.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/costlier-casualty-2020-02-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/costlier-casualty.html
13,28-2-20,Imperfect justice,"Harvey Weinstein is convicted of third-degree rape and a criminal sexual act. He’s staring at just 5 years

The battle of justice for women, who take on rich and powerful men for molestation, or worse rape, is long, lonely and hard. No matter in which part of the globe they are, whether it is India, Pakistan, the UK or even the biggest and one of the most technologically-advanced Western countries in the world, the US. What else justifies the fact that movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused by no less than 90 women of sex crimes, was convicted only in two cases whereas he was found guilty of raping one woman and committing a non-consensual sex act on another? It was imperfect justice because he was acquitted of the most serious charges — two counts of predatory sexual assault and one count of first-degree rape, which might have put him in a cell for the rest of his life. The jury only convicted him of third-degree rape and a first-degree criminal sexual act. So now he is looking at just five years in prison. And this was the man, who throughout his long career as a film producer, had silenced multiple accusations of rape and sexual assault with threats, denials, character assassinations, monetary settlements and Non-Disclosure Agreements. He had even scared off journalists who tried to expose his dastardly acts and bring him to justice, till tenacious journalists from the New York Times and the New Yorker brought him down with their exposés in 2017.

However, the verdict is a small victory for women around the world battling hard against their sexual predators. The Unnao rape victim, who accused former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar of rape or the law student, who tried to bring former BJP MP Swami Chinmayanand to book for raping her repeatedly, would tell you at what personal peril they managed to be heard. Weinstein’s conviction is also a defeat of the most belligerent victim-shaming and blaming tactics that are used by ruthless defence lawyers in such cases. More importantly, it broke the stereotype of what a “perfect victim” is as justice was given to the two women who did not end their relationship with their tormentor simply because he was who he was. It is a small measure of vindication for the six women who testified that Weinstein attacked and sought to intimidate them as they were put through the grinder by his lawyers. They can now feel proud of the part they played in getting the predator put behind bars, where he belongs. It is also a victory for the #MeToo movement, which was fast classified as a fad than a cause.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/imperfect-justice-2020-02-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/imperfect-justice.html

15,28-2-20,BJP likely to wrest lone Rajya Sabha seat from Cong in Himachal,"With adequate numbers in the Assembly, ruling BJP in Himachal Pradesh is likely to wrest the Rajya Sabha seat from the opposition Congress, the voting for which will be held on March 26.

One of the three Rajya Sabha seats from Himachal Pradesh will fall vacant as Vipolve Thakur of the Congress will retire from the Upper House of Parliament on April 9. The other two Rajya Sabha seats from the hill State are being currently represented by BJP national president Jagat Prakash Nadda and senior Congress leader Anand Sharma.

While Nadda will retire from the Rajya Sabha in 2024, Sharma's term will end in 2022.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) has decided to conduct the election for this seat along with 54 Rajya Sabha seats of 17 states on March 26.

The BJP is likely to bag the Rajya Sabha seat as it has a total of 44 MLAs in the 68-member Himachal Pradesh Assembly. Two independent MLAs are supporting BJP. The opposition Congress has only 21 members, whereas the CPI(M) has one MLA. Sources indicated that BJP may nominate its former state president Satpal Satti.

Satti had a long tenure as the state president of BJP for about eight years till January 16 this year. The party won all the four seats in 2014 and 2019 parliamentary elections and secured 44 seats in the 68-member House in the 2017 assembly elections.

The minister said that there were numerous reports and complaints of misappropriation of sports kits and gym equipments’ distribution in the state during the SAD-BJP regime, thus it becomes necessary to look into the matter.

Responding to the question of MLA Pawan Kumar Tinu that why sports kits were not distributed to the players yet, Rana Sodhi informed that state government has no such policy, adding that “rather there were many complaints regarding sports kits and gym equipments, distributed during SAD-BJP tenure. There was no record on what basis and which club was given kits and gym equipments by the then Government. Hence, in view of the seriousness of the matter and incurred huge amount to the tune of Rs 30 crores, it demands thorough probe.”

Earlier, MLA asked about the number of players inducted in sports wings and facilities provided to them during the year 2019-20. Answering the query, the Minister said that in the month of July, 2019 and later on, total 4140 players were inducted in various sports wings. He said that residential and day-scholar players are being provided Rs 200 and Rs 100 respectively per player per day for food/refreshments, training and sports kits.

The Sports Minister also said that free facility of hostel, diet, medical assistance and education are also provided to the residential players.

When TS Eliot passed away in 1965, he wrote an essay in his honour for Calcutta-based Odia literary magazine 'Asantakali' titled ""T S Eliot nka Jibana Jigyasa O Bharatiya Darsana"" (TS Eliot's quest for life and Indian philosophy).

That was the first-ever comparative study of Indian and Western literary traditions done by any scholar from Odisha. Soon after, in 1969, he translated Aristotle's Poetics into Odia as ""Aristotle'nka Kabyatattwa"" with a long scholarly introduction, critical commentary, and elaborate notes. It was the first such translation of the “Poetics” in any Indian language which was published by Friends' Publishers, Cuttack, and recently a 50th-anniversary edition of the book came out.

Back then, the book was shortlisted for the Sahitya Akademi Award in the translation category but Sukla chose to withdraw justifying he didn't translate the work for any award or reward, but for his love for comparing Indian and Western literary traditions.

His journey as a critic and comparatist began in 1960 when he travelled to Calcutta from a small village near Bhadrak town to study at Jadavpur University. He went on to complete masters in three subjects, English, Philosophy, and Sanskrit, and then PhD in comparative literature from Jadavpur as his mentors there urged him to study philosophy and Sanskrit as well to pursue a doctorate in comparative literature.

His dissertation ""The Concept of Imitation in Greek and Indian Aesthetics"" was published by Rupa & Co., and this trailblazing work is still referred to and cited by scholars worldwide. He is also the first scholar from Odisha to have had earned a doctorate in comparative literature.

“He was our window to a larger academic world. He taught us comparative aesthetics. In spite of the constraints a very small town imposes upon academic projects, he managed to bring his journal regularly. This is an amazingly impressive intellectual feat,” says former Professor of English at Utkal University and noted translator Jatindra Kumar Nayak.

“While a student at Ravenshaw, I came across his Odia translation of Aristotle’s Poetics and that the book has been translated into Odia from classical Greek filled me with awed respect for him. The issue of the journal that he showed me in 1980 when I was his student was dedicated to the famous American critic and comparatist, René Wellek which also featured a long letter written by the legend,” Prof Nayak recalls.

His journal always featured world-renowned scholars and explored a wide range of topics related to comparative literature and aesthetics. He had already established his reputation as an eminent comparatist in India and abroad then, he adds.

“Immensely humane and erudite, he is one of the very few English professors in Odisha who has filled a gaping void in the heart of English studies, caused by the absence of any encounter with Sanskrit. And he has done it before GN Devy and others have done it,” says former Professor of English at Utkal University Himansu Mohapatra.

Former bureaucrat, former Revenshaw College VC and writer Devdas Chhotray says, “Once, I remember, I sat close to him in a small theatre in Cuttack where one of my father’s plays was being staged, without realising that I was in the august company of a connoisseur of Greek and Sanskrit plays. He sat there, as I recall, with the impassive face of an ascetic. It is a pity that I did not avail the opportunity of knowing him enough when I was the Vice-Chancellor of Ravenshaw University, and the chance of an exceptional synergy

was lost.”

“His work was my introduction to comparative aesthetics. Even today, there is a dearth of publication on Indian aesthetics and it is his work which is still an inspiration for many,” says Prof Parul Dave Mukherji, Dean of the School of Arts and Aesthetics, JNU, New Delhi.

“His lecture notes were among the most beautiful that I have seen in my life,” says Bijay K Danta, Professor of English, Tezpur University.

“My personal interest in his work took birth while I was studying the corpus of pre-modern Odia poetry for writing the introduction to a book. I found a heavily coded Odia critical tradition carrying traces of a powerful Sanskrit tradition. My understanding of the latter began with his writings,” says Urmishree Bedamatta, Associate Professor of English, Ravenshaw University.

Reshmi Mukherjee, Professor of English, Boise State University, USA, says, “He is a true renaissance man and a fighter like Ulysses. He re-established a connection of European thought to Indian philosophy, something that Eliot had long professed to. From a comparative point of view, I think that in 1965 that was a unique connection to make.”

Sukla is simply fascinated by comparing the Orient and the Occident, and this fascination which forms the basis for his works has been recounted by a larger number of eminent foreign scholars than Indian academicians in a recent Festschrift titled “Ananta Sukla: As We Know Him” published last year by Coolgrove Press, New York, USA.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sukla-who-brought-comparative-literature-to-odisha.html
43,28-2-20,Choudwar Buddhist site given to private cement firm,"The historic Asura Vihara Gumphas near Choudwar, an ancient archaeological site having three rock-cut caves, have been handed over to a private cement company by the State Government. The three caves, dating to the 1st century CE, are located at the Indrani hillock near Indranipatana village near Choudwar. The caves are similar to the ones at Khandagiri and Udayagiri in Bhubaneswar and belong to the same period.

A team from Indian National Trust for Arts and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), while conducting a survey of its Mahanadi Heritage Documentation Project, was prevented from approaching the site as it has been walled over by the private company. The three west-facing caves are rectangular in plan and hewn out of an outcrop of laterite rock. Before being walled in, they were visible from NH-42 connecting Cuttack with Talcher, just 300 meter from the highway.

According INTACH Mahanadi Heritage Project coordinator Anil Dhir, these unique caves were made by Jain monks and later used by Buddhist monks. They have been a landmark in the area for centuries and locals also conducted worship at the place. The place has rich oral history. Local folklore has it that the Choudwar region was the Virata kingdom during the Mahabharata era and was the abode of the Pandavas while in exile. Locals believe that a demon named “Manda Khia Rakhyasa”, who lived in the caves, had spread terror due to his demands of a cartload of Manda Pithas along with a “Narabali” (human sacrifice) every day. Bhima, the second of the Pandavas, had challenged the demon and slain him in a fierce duel at this spot. Locals held an annual festival at the spot for centuries which has been discontinued since the last two years. Villagers had protested when the company wall was being constructed, but they were arrested and thrown in jail.

Dhir says the caves were very well-maintained by locals. However, the State Government handed over the entire hillock along with the adjoining land to the private company under the Make in Odisha scheme. The Chief Minister inaugurated the 3.86-lakh-TPA cement plant of Toshali Cements by videoconferencing in May 2018. To ensure that the investments intents received during the Make in Odisha Conclave were converted quickly, the Government saw to it that all required supports such as land, utilities and clearances were made available to the company expeditiously. The archaeological site was overlooked and the caves too were included in the land allotted and were quickly walled in by the company.

Dhir further states that it was a pity that this important site has neither been notified by the State Archaeology Department nor the Archaeological Survey of India. The Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts had documented the site in 2001 and accorded it Monument Serial No OR/CTC-51. Choudwar was an important ancient Buddhist centre and several fine specimens of Buddhist sculptures have been found in and around the caves. Many eminent Odia historians and archaeologists have written about the site. Mentions about the site are found in the works of Ramprasad Chanda’s “Exploration in Odisha”, Paramananda Acharya’s “Odishara Pratnatatwa O Anannya Prabandha”, Dr Harekrushna Mahtab’s “Odisha Itihasa”, Dr Krushana Chandra Panigrahi’s “History of Odisha” and RC Mohapatra’s “Archaeology in Odisha”.

A few mounds near Viratagadi of Choudwar are the remains of an ancient Buddhist monastery. In the last two centuries, many idols and broken stone images and sculptures have been excavated in the area. Many Buddhist idols are being worshipped as village goddesses. A Tara image is being worshipped as Mahalakshmi and a Marichi image as Parvati at the nearby Chateswara Shiva temple. At Choudwar Sabar Sahi, an Avalokitesvara image finds place as Gramadevi. Proper archaeological excavations in the area would reveal rich finds.

Dhir says that presently the caves are covered by thick vegetation which may damage them. The laterite stone is honeycombed, and if proper clearing is not done, the vegetation will split the rock face and cracks will develop. Proper conservation and preservation is the need of the hour.

INTACH State Convener Amiya Bhusan Tripathy demands that the caves be retrieved from the private company and the allotment of the site cancelled. The company should provide free access and open up the caves for the public.

The INTACH has undertaken a comprehensive survey of the entire Mahanadi valley and is documenting both the tangible and intangible assets. The project, flagged off in January 2018, would be completed this year. More than a 1,000 monuments have already been identified on both banks of the river and would be listed along with the intangible heritage.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/choudwar-buddhist-site-given-to-private-cement-firm.html

The axed employees were identified as data entry operators Bigyana Mohanty and Pradipta Kumar Jena and admission in- charge lecturer, Dhiren Mohanty.

Reports said that the college authorities had issued fake certificates to about 124 students who had graduated from the college in the year 2015. The certificates which were issued had fake university registration numbers. As a result, the Utkal University had denied giving migration certificate to students for pursuing higher studies.

45,28-2-20,Horticulture will enrich farmers: CM,"Chief Minister Kamal Nath has reiterated the State Government's commitment to transforming Madhya Pradesh into India's Horticulture Capital.

He said that the horticulture sector is a gateway to the prosperity of farmers. This is the future of the agricultural sector. He said that the credit potential estimated by the NABARD for the horticulture sector should be increased from 6 percent to at least 15 percent.

He said that a large patch of unutilised revenue land in Madhya Pradesh can be utilised for expansion of horticulture activities.

He was releasing the State Focus Paper - 2020-21 at the State Credit Seminar 2020-21 organised by NABARD at Mantralaya here on Thursday.

The NABARD has estimated credit potential for Madhya Pradesh at 1,98,786 crore. This is 13 percent more than that of last year's 1,74,970 Crore.

The Chief Minister stressed the need to approach the agriculture sector with a fresh vision and thinking. The entire scenario is changing. Earlier, millets were out of focus.

Today they have gained prominence. The millets were meant for consumption by the poor population. Now high nutritive value makes them popular.

The Chief Minister said that NABARD has years of experience and intellectual capacity. Its use will be fruitful for the future. The Chief Minister said that NABARD will have to prepare plans for 2024-25.

He said that today's scenario would change after five years. The goals set today can be achieved easily, but the challenge of achieving new targets must be accepted in future.

The Chief Minister said that NABARD has made an unprecedented contribution in Madhya Pradesh with an important role in building agricultural infrastructure. The knowledge

that NABARD has acquired will have to be harnessed in expanding its vision in the future. He said that the plans made for Madhya Pradesh can also be useful for the country.

The Chief Minister said that the biggest challenge is unemployment among the youth as they move from villages to cities.

They have to be connected to emerging technologies and technical skills. He said that the agriculture needs modernisation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/horticulture-will-enrich-farmers--cm.html
46,28-2-20,‘Tasveerien' performed at Ravindra Bhavan,"The experiences of life were brilliantly showcased. A Hindi play 'Tasveerien' was performed at Ravindra Bhavan auditorium here on Thursday. The play marked the fourth day of five day theatre fest.

The play was directed by Ansh Payan Sinha and was performed by Nat Bundele Theatre Group. The play was based on the poems by poet Manas Bharadwaj and playwright Anshpayan Sinha.

Interestingly, this play has no story, but creates one on the stage. The only captivating point of this play was the poetries and the lyrical performance. The play Tasveerien is just the replica of the poetries by these writers.

It is a compilation of rhythmical 24 poems together making a story on stage. Each poem has a story and when they were weaved together on stage they create another exotic story worthwhile watching.

The new production Tasveeriesn is a good watch for the Bhopal theatre buffs. The lyrics, the dialogues and their delivery by the artists is another captivating point that makes the play even more interesting.

Together around 15 to 20 artists come on the stage creating an ambiance of artistry and broad imagery before the audience.

The artists were able to enthral the audience. The performance was brilliant and it was much applauded by the audience.

Besides, poetry recital by Dhruv Shukla was also held on the occasion.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---tasveerien--performed-at-ravindra-bhavan.html

48,28-2-20,‘Ho Sakta Hain Do Admi Do Kursiyan’ staged,"A play Ho Sakta Hain Do Admi Do Kursiyan, was staged on Thursday at Ravindra Bhavan.

Written and directed by Vinay Sharma, the play was performed by the artists of Padatik Theatre, Calcutta.

The play is an exploration of stillness and silence, word and image, inscapes and instresses. Zooming in on fragments from individual lives, the play uses an ironic juxtaposition of humour with the tragic, as two actor-protagonists tell a number of apparently unconnected stories linked by the emotions born of love, loss and absence.

Their two chairs become a mercurial, ever changing metaphor as the play intersects urban relationships and makes the implicit statement that we are given life to experience compassion not to inflict violence or to succumb to an inner decay.

In this play, each scene is open to questions and interpretations. the chairs in this play could be anything, these men could be anyone, these events could all have happened on the same day or be spread over a nation's history.

Though each scene is complete and stands by itself, there is also a meaning or two implied in the order in which the scenes are arranged.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---ho-sakta-hain-do-admi-do-kursiyan----staged.html

50,28-2-20,Seven cops suspended in Balrampur gang-rape case,"Seven cops were suspended for their alleged negligence and laxity in dealing with a gang-rape case at Tangarmahri in Balrampur districts of the state.

Facing ire from the members of his party over the gang rape case, Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel on Thursday announced in the state assembly for suspension of the cops with immediate effect.

The cops who have been suspended are Station House In-charge Umesh Baghel, Sub Inspector Akhilesh Singh, Cyber Cell in-charge K.P. Singh and constables, Johan, Sudhir, Ajay and Shashi Tirki.

The issue was raised in the assembly by Congress legislator from Ramanujganj, Brihaspat Singh through a call attention motion.

Replying to the motion, Home Minister Tamradhwaj Sahu said attempt was made to abduct two girls but somehow one of them succeeded to run away.

He admitted that the second girl who failed to escape from the clutches of culprits was gang raped. Earlier, after the matter was raised by the Congress MLA, the Station House In-charge was line attached, he informed.

The Home Minister further said that he will instruct the concerned Inspector General of Police (IGP) to inquire about any laxity on the part of police officials or employees and submit the report within three days.

In between, Panchayat Minister, T.S. Singhdeo also stood up and expressed his apprehension into the matter to which the opposition member commented that this was the first time in the state assembly that a minister is asking a question to another minister.

52,28-2-20,Women have made rich contributions to science,"The National Science Day is celebrated in India on February 28 to mark the discovery of the Raman effect by Indian physicist Sir CV Raman on February 28, 1928. The event is now celebrated all over the country in schools, colleges, universities and other academic, scientific, technical, medical and research institutions.

The focal theme for 2020 National Science Day is “Women in Science”.

Women have made significant contributions to science from the earliest times. Historians with an interest in gender and science have illuminated the scientific endeavours and accomplishments of women, the barriers they have faced, and the strategies implemented to have their work peer-reviewed and accepted in major scientific journals and other publications. The historical, critical and sociological study of these issues has become an academic discipline in its own right.

The involvement of women in the field of medicine occurred in several early civilizations, and the study of natural philosophy in ancient Greece was open to women. Women contributed to the proto-science of alchemy in the first or second centuries AD. During the middle ages, convents were an important place of education for women, and some of these communities provided opportunities for women to contribute to scholarly research. While the eleventh century saw the emergence of the first universities, women were, for the most part, excluded from university education. Outside academia, botany was clearly the science that benefitted most from contributions of women in early modern times. The attitude to educating women in medical fields in Italy appears to have been more liberal than in other places. The first known woman to earn a university chair in a scientific field of studies was eighteenth-century Italian scientist, Laura Bassi.

Although gender roles were largely defined in the eighteenth century, women experienced great advances in science. During the nineteenth century, women were excluded from most formal scientific education, but they began to be admitted into learned societies during this period. In the later nineteenth century, the rise of the women's college provided jobs for women scientists and opportunities for education.

Marie Curie, a physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactive decay, was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize in Physics and became the first person to receive a second Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Forty women have been awarded the Nobel Prize between 1901 and 2010. Seventeen women have been awarded the Nobel Prize in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine. Overall, the Scientific Revolution did little to change people's ideas about the nature of women – more specifically – their capacity to contribute to science just as men do.

According to UIS data, less than 30 per cent of the world’s researchers are women. UIS data also show the extent to which these women work in the public, private or academic sectors, as well as their fields of research. But in order to reduce the gender gap, we must go beyond the hard numbers and identify the qualitative factors that deter women from pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).

53,28-2-20,"Sidhu resurfaces after 7 months, projects himself as party's saviour","Putting to end the speculations about his leaving the Congress, the cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu on Thursday surfaced after seven months of political hibernation to project himself as the party’s savior in Punjab with a bunch of suggestions already discussed with the top leadership.

Amidst reports that Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), buoyant after its successive third victory in the national capital, is warming up with the Congress’ disgruntled leader, Sidhu shared his picture along with Congress national chief Sonia Gandhi and All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Priyanka Gandhi via e-mail saying that he discussed roadmap for Punjab and prevailing political situation in the State with the high command.

Staying away from the public glare after resigning from the State Cabinet in July 2019, Sidhu remained in the national capital on Thursday also. Making it clear that he has direct access with the high command, Sidhu said that he met Priyanka on February 25 (Tuesday) “for 40 minutes”, and Sonia Gandhi on February 26 (Wednesday) “for more than an hour”.

“I got a patient hearing and apprised them of the prevailing situation in Punjab along with the roadmap to the resurrection and revival of the state back to its pristine glory. I have persisted with conviction about this roadmap for the past many years in the Cabinet and public domain diligently,” said Sidhu in his statement, breaking his silence after months of self-imposed political exile.

Even as it was not clear what actually transpired during the meeting, it is believed that Sidhu has been called by Priyanka amidst the rumours that AAP, SAD Taksalis, and other fronts are wooing the former cricketer offering the Chief Ministerial face.

It has been learnt that Sidhu had also discussed his role in the next state assembly elections, scheduled for 2022, and he would soon make a comeback in active politics.

Known to share close proximity with Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, Sidhu went into deep political hibernation after he formally resigned from Punjab Cabinet on July 15, 2019. His decision was in protest against the “punishment” of changing his portfolio when the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh blamed the former cricketer for party’s not-so-good performance in the urban pockets during 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

Despite being Congress’ star campaigner, Sidhu even stayed away from campaigning in the recently-concluded Delhi assembly polls.

After resigning, Sidhu was seen for the first time in public on November 9 when he was among the first all-party delegation of 500 pilgrims from India that reached Pakistan’s Kartarpur to pay obeisance at the shrine of Guru Nanak Dev, the founder of Sikhism, after the opening of the historic corridor between the two countries.

At that time, Sidhu had made a mark for himself with the Sikh population and is being seen as a face that can stabilize the party’s wobbly ship in the rough political waters.

Only this month, Sidhu made a public appearance in a cultural event attended by his political rival and SAD MLA Bikram Singh Majithia, seen exchanging pleasantries with Akali veteran and SAD Taksali leader Ranjit Singh Brahmpura, and chatting with the Congress MP from Amritsar Gurjit Singh Aujla.

Sidhu has also been absenting himself from the session of Punjab Vidhan Sabha besides skipping public and party meetings ever since he resigned.

As Sidhu has been maintaining distance with the party and also limiting his public appearances since then, a section of party leaders wanted him to be back in the political mainstream, at least for the party. Reports were that the party high command wanted “sidelined” Sidhu to give his “due place”. In fact, reports were that he would be appointed Deputy Chief Minister — something Capt Amarinder would stoutly oppose.

Notably, owing to his cold war with Capt Amarinder in the run-up to 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Sidhu campaigned for the party in Punjab only on the last two days, that too when he addressed hundreds of rallies and public meetings across the nation.

At the same time, the state Congress leaders welcomed the development. “It is a great thing that Sidhu has met the party chief. He met amidst rumours regarding Sidhu joining another party…but after this meeting, he has made it clear that Sidhu has committed his life to the Congress party and would stay with it,” said Congress MLA Raj Kumar Verka.

At the same time, Verka maintained that Sidhu has no differences with the Congress party or the Chief Minister. “It is on the Chief Minister to decide about who should be given what responsibility,” he added.

Agreeing that Chief Minister is the one to decide about his Cabinet, another MLA Amarinder Singh Raja Warring said that Cabinet reshuffle is Capt Amarinder’s decision, or that of Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar or party chief Sonia Gandhi ji.

“Cabinet reshuffle is required and it should be done on the basis of performance,” he said, adding, “I don’t believe that there would be any disagreement or opposition within the party if Sidhu is given any big position…Congress is a disciplined party”.

Showering praises on Sidhu, Warring said: “He is liked by people across the country, in Punjab. He has a big stature…Insaan rutbe naal wadda nahi hunda, imaan wadda hona chahida (A man is not big because of his status, integrity has to be impeccable), and he fits perfectly in that.”

Commending the development, Warring said: “I thank Sidhu for meeting the party leadership and sharing the Punjab road map. There is a requirement to improve our working. The government has done many works but a lot needs to be done. People have lot of expectations from us.”

“If this roadmap is regarding the people’s expectations, it is really a good thing. I feel that it would benefit us in the times to come. We may also come to power again if we solve the people’s issues, resolve people’s problem, meet people’s expectations and demands,” said Warring adding that government should fulfill its all pre-poll promises it made with the people.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sidhu-resurfaces-after-7-months--projects-himself-as-party-s-saviour.html
54,28-2-20,AAP MLAs wear mask in House to protect themselves from ‘KARO NA’ virus,"A day after Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh said coronavirus delayed delivery of Punjab’s smartphones, AAP MLAs on Thursday wore masks inside the House to protect themselves from the ‘Karo Na’ (don’t do) Virus that has caught the Congress led Punjab Government.

“We wanted to send across the message that the Congress Government is afflicted with ‘karo-na’ virus,” said Arora when the Speaker Rana KP Singh asked him why he was wearing a mask and if his health was fine.

Cabinet Minister Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi objected to AAP MLAs sporting the face mask saying that it was against the rules of the House. “They can’t hide their identity…I am not able to ascertain who are they,” he said.

“Sir, hospitalize them if they are not well,” he quipped.

Earlier, the AAP had held a protest outside the Assembly against the Congress Government alleging that the current dispensation was suffering from the ‘Karo na’ virus.

“The State Government is suffering from ‘karo na’ (don't do) virus. It has done nothing in the last three years on any front…Chief Minister’s excuse that the promised smart phones could not be given to students in view of the spread of corona virus in China is a mere face-saving exercise,” said the Leader of Opposition Harpal Cheema.

AAP MLAs, including Cheema, Arora and Kultar Singh Sandhwan, took pot shot on the dismal performance of the Punjab Government, saying that it was not China which was afflicted with the deadly virus, but the Captain government.

57,28-2-20,Sugarcane price in State highest in country: Khattar,"Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday said the State government is giving sugarcane price to the farmers at the rate of Rs 340 per quintal which is highest in the country.

Replying to the calling attention notice during the ongoing Budget Session of Haryana Vidhan Sabha here, he said that to further enhance the price of sugarcane, the state government is taking several measures including increasing the income of both the cooperative and private sugar mills of the State in a phased manner.

Khattar said that though the recovery of sugar mills have been increased upto 12 per cent, efforts are being made to further enhance the same as the rate of sugarcane largely depends upon the financial condition of sugar mills.

The Chief Minister said that it is for the first time in last several years that the price of sugar has increased to over Rs 3000 per quintal and added that if this price continue to increase in a similar way and reached toRs 3300 per quintal, the state government would be able to increase the sugarcane price next year.

He said the State Government aims to enhance the income of farmers and also increase the price of sugarcane. For this, the condition of sugar mills would also be kept in consideration, which he said are running in losses for the last few years. He said that persistent efforts are being made by the state government to enhance the income as well as viability of sugar mills to purchase maximum produce of farmers. The Deputy Commissioner concerned have been made the incharge of Sugar Mill, Naraingarh so as to enhance the income of the Mill.

Khattar said the price of sugarcane depends on various factors. Quoting sugarcane price since 1975-76 in support of his claim, he said that there was also a time when the rate of sugarcane was Rs 26 per quintal but instead of increasing the price reduced to Rs 22 per quintal. Later on it increased from Rs 22 to Rs 23 and Rs Rs to Rs 24 per quintal. Similarly, the price of sugarcane in 1980-81 was Rs 26 per quintal which reduced to Rs 24 per quintal in 1983-84 and again increased to Rs 27 per quintal in 1985-86. He said that likewise, there was also a time when the sugarcane price wasRs 110 per quintal and remained the same for five years.

Earlier, the Congress MLAs accused the Haryana government of hiking sugarcane price by only Rs 30 in five years and dissatisfied with the reply of Agriculture Minister, MLAs stormed the Well of the House, shouting slogans against State government.

Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda, senior leader Kiran Choudhry and INLD chief Abhay Chautala put a defensive government on the mat during debate on calling attention notice on sugarcane price.

The Congress charge was led by Sonepat MLA Surender Panwar, who lashed at the government on sugarcane price. Panwar said the state government has only hiked the price of sugarcane by only Rs 30 in five years. The condition of sugarcane farmers is pitiable and government should hike price of sugarcane. Another Congress MLA Varun Mulana also accused coalition government of ignoring the interest of farmers.

Replying to the calling attention notice on sugarcane price, Agriculture Minister JP Dalal said sugarcane price was Rs 340 per quintal which is highest in the country.

Bhupinder Singh Hooda interrupted the Minister and asked whether government would hike sugarcane price or not. Ignoring him Dalal started informing the House how government would double farmers’ income.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sugarcane-price-in-state-highest-in-country--khattar.html
58,28-2-20,AAP wants foreign breeds of cows sent to slaughter houses,"Punjab Vidhan Sabha on Thursday could not round up the stray cattle issue once again. Debating for three hours on the “sensitive” issue which had been discussed in the House several times before too, the lawmakers failed to arrive upon any decision or find a solution to the ever-growing menace that is claiming hundreds of human lives every year.

Notwithstanding several legislators come up with workable suggestions to tackle the menace at least to some extent, but the issue remained inconclusive — just like the previous times.

The discussion was held after the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Aman Arora, along with two other party MLAs, moved a non-official resolution suggesting sending the stray American breeds to slaughterhouses while sending desi cows to cow shelters as a measure to tackle the stray cattle menace after categorizing them on the basis of their DNA test.

Arora’s suggestion has attracted sharp criticism from not only the Congress, SAD, and the BJP MLAs, but also from the ‘rebel’ AAP MLAs. So much so, that SAD MLA NK Sharma had accused Arora of “hurting the sentiments of Hindu community”.

AAP’s rebel MLA Kanwar Sandhu, condemning the suggestion, noticed its similarity with that of the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). “They want to discriminate between the animals. Just like the CAA by the Centre, we are doing it with the animals,” said Sandhu.

Even as all the legislators expressed their concern over the stray cattle menace, majority of them disagree with the three AAP MLAs — Aman Arora, Kultar Singh Sandhwan and Prof Baljinder Kaur — for suggesting that the State Government should take care of indigenous breed of cows and send the stray cattle of American and Holstein Friesians breeds to slaughterhouses to protect life, property and crops, underling that they would not support or favour killing cows.

Arora, moving the resolution, claimed that there are 2.5 lakh stray cattle and they are responsible for the maximum number of fatal road accidents in the State, besides damage to standing crops worth Rs 200 crore.

“Every year, 150 people lose their lives because of road accidents involving stray cattle,” said Arora emphasizing that we need to differentiate between the two and send the European breed to slaughter houses.

He also suggested to remove superstition among the people by making them aware, form a public opinion by taking along the religious leaders, and form block and district level committees to tackle the menace from the ground level.

Taking on the government for not utilizing cow cess being collected on nine items, Arora said that even cow boards did nothing till date. At the same time, Arora made it clear that he was not in favour of slaughtering any animal, but also sought a practical solution to the problem.

Citing surveys, Prof Baljinder Kaur said that there was 38 percent increase in road accidents due to stray cattle while there was 39 percent increase in deaths on roads due to the menace. She also highlighted the despite High Court ruling, the government has failed to come up with a policy to compensate victims of accidents due to stray cattle.

Congress MLA Amarinder Singh Raja Warring, saying that killing the cattle is no resolution, suggested formulation of law to impose a penalty or ensure punishment against those abandoning their cattle, besides maintaining a register of the number of cows and their owners.

Terming AAP’s resolution against “religion and society”, SAD MLA Dr Sukhwinder Kumar said: “Sending stray animals to slaughterhouses is not a solution.”

BJP legislator Arun Narang said that he could never think of killing any animal and proposed that more funds should be provided to cow sheds in order take care of stray cattle.

With few minutes left before adjournment of day’s proceedings, Cabinet Minister Charanjit Singh Channi asked Arora to amend the non-official resolution by removing the suggestion of sending stray cattle of the foreign breed to slaughterhouses.

Arora said that if the State Government could give a time-bound and viable solution to deal with the problem of stray cattle menace, there was no need to send stray cattle to slaughter houses.

However, just like the previous occasions, the issue remained indecisive.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aap-wants-foreign-breeds-of-cows-sent-to-slaughter-houses.html

71,28-2-20,Health representatives gets lesson on biomedical waste management,"The Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board's (JSPCB) regional office organised a workshop on 'Effective management of biomedical waste and implementation of QR code' at the Adityapur Small Industries Association (ASIA) hall on Thursday.

A team from JSPCB including its regional officer Suresh Paswan attended the workshop. More than 100 health care facility representatives in all the three districts of Kolhan took part in the workshop.

During the workshop the hospital representatives were explained how to weigh everyday waste using a digital platform Safe bio.

Founder of Safe Bio Ashok Kumar from Delhi who has partnered with the JSPCB for tracking and monitoring of biomedical waste explained the process to the representatives.

""Bio medical waste management is the need of the hour. Many hospitals are not following a method to safely dispose the biomedical waste and thus this tracking system was necessary.

Everything will be managed digitally. From picking up the waste to its disposal. Everything will be tracked and reported on an everyday basis. In fact biomedical waste needs to be disposed of within 48 hours,"" said Paswan.

As per our plans the healthcare facilities (HCF) will need to first register themselves on a particular link given on the JSPCB website following which they will receive four different QR codes through courier.

These QR code stickers will be put on the bio waste baskets of four colours- yellow, red, blue and white.

They shall also then download and register on the Safebio mobile app to get a login id and password.

After the waste collection per day, the QR codes need to be scanned before picked up by the Common Bio-Medical Waste Treatment Facility (CBMWTF). The JSPCB shall charge Rs 7 per bed for each HCF for the service. Kolhan division currently has around 357 HCF which will need to follow the new system.

“Bio-medical wastes like used gauze and bandages lying strewn, used injection syringes lying scattered and parts of human bodies like placenta are lying exposed on the hospital premises, causing serious environmental hazards. At a several places, water-logging has generated ground for mosquito breeding.

Uncleaned lavatories and shippage of rain water are also emitting offending smell throughout the hospital premises. Immediate steps must be taken to ensure that new incinerator is set up,” said a Manoj Kumar, a human rights activist.

He noted that hazardous healthcare waste (also known as healthcare risk waste) needs special regulation, but general wastes can be dealt with by municipal waste disposal mechanisms. There are different categories of healthcare waste.

The one way to prevent the spread is proper biomedical waste disposal and adoption of universal precautions. Every surface in a healthcare setting needs to be assumed infected unless proven otherwise.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/health-representatives-gets-lesson-on-biomedical-waste-management.html

73,28-2-20,Conference on Psychiatric Social Work begins today,"A three-day conference on ‘Social Work Practice, Emerging Trends and Challenges’ commencing on Friday will mark the Golden Jubilee of the Department of Psychiatric Social Work at the Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP), Ranchi.

The conference will also mark the completion of 50 years of the Indian Society of Professional Social Work (ISPW) – a national conglomerate of psychiatric social workers and doctors constituted in Ranchi half a century ago.

“It is a proud moment for all of us at CIP that an initiative taken at this institute 50 years ago has reached new heights. Today, the society is in dire need of more psychiatric social workers, and the conference will focus on the various challenges and emerging trends in the field of psychiatric social work,” said CIP Director Dr. D Ram.

Psychiatric social work is a field of psychiatry that helps mental health patients reintegrate in the society after their treatment is over. This process requires expert guidance due to the stigma and superstitions related to mental illnesses in India, especially the rural society, said doctors. A psychiatric social worker also helps patients cope with unfavourable social conditions that may aggravate their mental illnesses. These professionals study the social settings of a patient, help him or her adjust in it, and also spread awareness about the various mental health concerns.

One of the most common objectives of psychiatric social work is to identify substance abuse and initiate treatment for de-addiction.

Substance abuse is often either a reason or an outcome of an adverse social surrounding or situation, said doctors of the institute. “People often develop the tendency of substance abuse at a young age. And it gradually starts affecting their mental health depending on the social surrounding,” said Dr. Christoday RJ Khess, the Director Professor of Psychiatry at the institute. “For instance, if a man addicted to alcohol or marijuana gets married, his spouse may get to know about his addiction and raise objections.

The patient in this situation feels helpless and relies more on substance as he feels that his family fails to understand him,” added Dr. Khess, who is also the director for the conference.

CIP Director Dr. D Ram said that there are four pillars supporting the larger umbrella of psychiatry. The four, he said, are psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychiatric social workers and psychiatric nurses. “We need a balance between all the four pillars in order to effective address mental health issues. There are many mental health disorders that require support from more than one of these pillars. For instance, only medicines may not treat a patient of depression. He or she may also require psychotherapy,” said Ram.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/conference-on-psychiatric-social-work-begins-today.html

83,28-2-20,UT to collaborate with France,"Finding itself in a quandary over how to ascertain the “genuineness” of identified heritage items in the city, the Chandigarh Administration is now likely to collaborate with France based Fondation Le Corbusier.

A French delegation comprising Brigitte Bouvier, Director, France based Fondation Le Corbusier was recently on a visit to Chandigarh to review the restoration work of heritage buildings especially in Capitol Complex, a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Besides seeking assistance from French experts for restoration of heritage buildings designed by city’s architect Le Corbusier, the Administration has also sought help from the Fondation Le Corbusier for identification of genuine heritage items and for its restoration work.

“The Administration has planned to collaborate with the Fondation Le Corbusier, which will provide expertise in restoration works of heritage buildings and items. The team of experts would include conservation architects, research engineers (concrete specialists), historians among others. We have also sought Fondation’s help for preparing a fresh inventory of heritage items and for its repair,” said a senior officer of UT Administration while talking to The Pioneer.

The officer said that the Administration had written to the Fondation Le Corbusier seeking help for the preservation of heritage items belonging to Chandigarh. A team from Fondation and other experts were in the city recently to discuss various issues related heritage preservation.

The Administration is likely to soon sign an agreement with the Fondation Le Corbusier to begin the restoration works of heritage buildings and items, the officer added.

After making the inventory of genuine heritage items, the Administration has proposed to notify it as “art treasures”.

According to the inventory prepared by the UT Administration in the year 2012, Chandigarh has ‘12793’ heritage items designed by city’s creator Franco-Swiss architect Le Corbusier or his team associated with the founding and planning of the city in 1950s and 60s. There are 190 different categories of the heritage items including drawings, murals, models, tapestries, chairs, tables, among others.

As only three-member Chandigarh Heritage Inventory Committee, constituted by UT Administration was involved in the finalization of heritage inventory in the year 2011 and 2012, doubts looms over the “genuineness” of identified heritage items belonging to the city.

Among various departments, the UT Government Museum and Art Gallery has possession of large number of heritage items including furniture, drawings, murals, models among others made by renowned architect Le Corbusier and his other associates. Besides, Punjab and Haryana Civil Secretariat, Punjab and Haryana Vidhan Sabha, Punjab and Haryana High Court also have huge stock of heritage furniture including chairs and tables.

The heritage protection cell under the Chandigarh Heritage Conservation Committee had recently proposed to carry out “physical verification” of these heritage items to prepare a fresh inventory.

Notably, the UT Administration had in the year 2014 also sought Archaeological Survey of India’s assistance in establishing the “genuineness” of heritage items, identified during the finalization of heritage inventory made in 2011 and 2012 here. However, the ASI had turned down the Administration’s request.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ut-to-collaborate-with-france.html

Days after the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh put a lid on the controversy by claiming that anyone can make mistakes and the DGP has apologised for his remarks, the issue of interrogation of pilgrims returned from Gurudwara Kartarpur Sahib in Pak stirred a controversy, with the Opposition demanding Gupta’s dismissal and stern action against him.

Opposition legislators got together to take on the Congress Government after reports of four devotees from Gurdaspur being interrogated by the Gurdaspur police on returning from the Sikhs’ revered shrine in Pakistan.

The State Cabinet Minister and Gurdaspur MLA Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa’s assertion that those pilgrims were questioned following inputs from the Intelligence Bureau has failed to find favour with the oppoisition, who insisted on action against the DGP.

The issue was raised by the SAD’s legislative wing leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon, who objected the same and sought an assurance from the Government that devotees would not be harassed in future. “We all have returned from there…are we all terrorists?” asked Dhillon.

Intervening, Randhawa said that he had called upon the Gurdaspur SSP and he had informed that the questioning of these four devotees from Dhariwal village was being done afgter a letter from the Deputy Inspector General of IB, a central agency.

Randhawa, who also read out the contents of the letter dated February 17, urged the Speaker Rana KP Singh to see that letter and table in the House for clarification.

Aam Aadmi Party MLA Kultar Singh Shandhwan said that it was an attempt to discourage the pilgrims. “We should not accept DGP’s apology…he should bereaved right away,” he demanded. Speaker urged the Government to take up the issue at the appropriate level and ensure that such things would not happen again.

SAD MLA Bikram Majithia sought the suspension of Punjab police officers, including the SSP, SHO, DSP, for harassing the devotees, while accusing Randhawa for shielding “his appointees”.

Not satisfied with the explanations, the SAD-BJP MLAs stormed into the well of the House and staged a walkout.

Randhawa maintained that in case the SSP and SHO were found to be guilty, they would be suspended.

AAP MLA and the Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema said that the Congress was “double-faced”. He targeted DGP Dinkar Gupta and demanded an explanation from the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh.

“Gupta had also worked in the IB and has used his contacts to issue this letter to prove his point. DGP wanted to disturb peace in the state…CM should answer,” he said.

AAP’s rebel MLA Kanwar Sandhu linked the harassment of devotees with “non action” against the DGP for is remarks on the Kartarpur corridor.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/uproar-in-punjab-house-over-kartarpur.html

There are only 2,000 professionals in the country who show their income to be Rs one crore while in the past four years, four crore people went abroad. Similarly, about 2.50 crore people bought new cars.

There are only about 50,000 people who show their income to be above Rs 10 lakh. We will have to really think about paying taxes honestly. The government of India has taken major decisions in favour of tax payers. Now, after October 31, any tax payer will be sent notice only in the digital format.

A committee of three income tax commissioners has been formed for fixing the penalty. On the lines of the Prime Minister’s vision of reform, perform and transform, we are moving ahead for tax reforms and an inclusive India.”

The union minister further said that today 121 crore people in India have mobile phones. Accounts operated on fake names have been closed, leading to savings of Rs 1.40 crore. In addition to providing electricity connection to all villages, optical fibre lines have been laid in 2.50 lakh Nyay Panchayats which will help bring the whole nation on the network. So far, six nations have accorded national honours to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Under Modi’s leadership the nation is moving ahead at a swift pace on the developmental path with the prestige of the nation also rising in the international fraternity. Referring to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), he reiterated that it grants citizenship to the religiously persecuted minorities and is not meant to take away Indian citizenship.

Regarding those protesting against the act, he said that one can try and even succeed in waking up someone who is asleep but it is futile to trye and take up someone pretendeing to be asleep.

Speaking to the occasion, CM Trivendra Singh Rawat said that with the establishment of the ITAT, applicants and lawyers will not need to travel to Delhi repeatedly. Now, their issues will get resolved on time and for lesser expenditure. Rawat said that aware citizens paying their taxes honestly play an important role in facilitating the development of the nation and the state.

ITAT chairman justice PP Bhatt said that the establishment of the circuit bench will benefit the tax payers in the state. Documents of 880 appeals related to the state have been brought from Delhi here. He assured that these appeals will be redressed soon.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/prasad-inaugurates-itat-circuit-bench-in-doon.html
87,28-2-20,Candid Notes,"Bitter Pill

Grudgingly though, the ministers of the Himalayan state on the diktat of chief minister TSR have started spending time in their chambers of Vidhan Sabha. In an attempt to project people friendly image of his government, TSR had decided that he along with his ministers would hear public grievances at Vidhan Sabha on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Initially the order was taken lightly by the ministers but when they saw TSR meeting people at his Vidhan Sabha office on these days, they got the message. Interestingly the ministers are applauding the decision publically but in private conversations their grudge is coming to the fore. Taking refuge in less number of people turning out to meet them in Vidhan Sabha, the ministers opine that the exercise is worthless. The grouse of the ministers is understandable since they have become used to staging private durbars in the comfort of their residences and the order of TSR has forced them to come out of their comfort zone. It is worth reminding here that ministers during the Congress regime used to spend time in their Vidhan Sabha offices but during the present government, the offices of ministers have remained more or less deserted.

Liqour reigns

The excise policy of the state released recently is an excellent example of the blunt truth that Uttarakhand has failed miserably in developing alternative sources of revenue in last 19 years of its existence. Contrary to the public utterances of CM and other leaders that dependence on revenue from sale of liquor would be dissuaded and other sources would be exploited to fill the kitty of the state, the state government has kept a revenue target of Rs 3,600 crore for the excise department for the financial year 2020-21. The increase comes at a time when it is almost sure that the department would not be able to meet the more modest target of Rs 3180 Crore in the current financial year. Though in an endeavour to curtail thriving business of illicit liquor, the government has taken a wise decision to bring down the sky high price of liquor in the state; the announcement has given the opposition parties a stick to beat TSR government. Playing to the gallery, the opposition leaders are churning out slogans like ‘Cheap liquor, expensive ride’ in reference to almost simultaneous decision to increase the price of roadways tickets. However both Congress and BJP are equally responsible for overdependence of state on liquor revenue as no one undertook sincere efforts to create and develop alternative sources of income.

Brave broker

After much deliberations and failure to extract money gobbled up by a smart broker, the powerful association of secretariat employees finally filed a police case in a failed land purchase case. The broker, who is son in law of a former cabinet minister, duped the secretariat association by promising to provide them a piece of land for developing a swanky colony on the lines of a similar high end settlement of IAS officers in Dehradun. It is learnt that the shrewd broker has not only cheated the secretariat workers but many senior police officers and some prominent politicians have also fell prey to him. However due to obvious reasons, they are hesitant to register complaints against him.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/candid-notes-candid-notes-2020-02-28.html
88,28-2-20,Kaushik convenes meeting with employee organisations,"In an attempt to break the deadlock created by the declaration of association of general and OBC employees to go on an indefinite strike from March 2, the senior cabinet minister Madan Kaushik convened a meeting at Vidhan Sabha on Thursday.

The leaders of many employee organisations and senior officials of the state government attended the meeting. Apart from the strike call, 12 issues of the employees came up for discussions in the meeting. It is learnt that understanding on four issues between the government and the employee organisations has been reached. However the issue of strike remained unresolved. When contacted, the President of the Uttarakhand Rajya Kramchari Sanyukt Parishad, Thakur Prahlad Singh refused to divulge the details of the meeting. He said that the employees are waiting for the Government to release the minutes of the meeting.

It is pertinent to mention here that different employee organisations of the State are on a path of agitation on various demands. An understanding between the then finance minister Late Prakash Pant and the employees was reached last year but the employees claim that the government has failed to address the issues.

After the indefinite strike call given by the employees on reservation in promotions, the government has fielded senior Cabinet Minister Madan Kaushik to initiate dialogue with the employee organisations.

Meanwhile, the Transport and social welfare minister Yashpal Arya said on Thursday that the strike is not the solution and the employees should come to the table for talks. On the issue of reservation in promotions, the minister said that he don’t believe in politics of caste and religion and is of the view that rights given by constitution should be protected.

He added that the union government is deliberating on the issue of reservation in promotions and everyone including the employees should wait for the decision of the central Government.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/kaushik-convenes-meeting-with-employee-organisations.html
89,28-2-20,Budget Session begins today sans LoP,"The Budget Session of fifth Jharkhand Assembly will commence on Friday (February 28) and will conclude till March 28. However, the session will be different from earlier session as for the first time in parliamentary history of Jharkhand since the creation of separate State in 2000, there will be no leader of opposition (LoP) in the House even after two months of Assembly election.

Speaker Ravindra Nath Mahto is yet to accord Leader of Opposition (LoP) status to Babulal Marandi, who was elected as BJP legislative party leader on February 24. Former Chief Minister Babulal Marandi, who headed the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha on February 17 merged his party with BJP. A week later on February 24, he was elected as BJP legislative party leader in Assembly. The BJP on same day submitted the letter to Speaker’s house about the election of Marandi as BJP legislative party leader.

On the other hand, two other legislators of JVM—Pradeep Yadav MLA from Poreyahat and Bandhu Tirkey MLA from Mandar too joined Congress claiming themselves as real faction of JVM.

As both the factions have claimed to be original JVM, the Speaker is yet to decide which faction will be considered as the real JVM.

Moreover, the Speaker has also assigned seat to none of these three leaders—Babulal Marandi, Pradeep Yadav or Bandhu Tirkey.

Speaker Mahto said, “As the matter is technical we have sought the guidelines of legal experts over the decision of Leader of Opposition (LoP).”

Meanwhile, the BJP boycotted the all party meet called by Speaker Ravindra Nath Mahto ahead of budget session. The Speaker had invited senior BJP leader CP Singh for the meeting, but he refused to attend the meeting saying that their leader is Marandi in House.

The boycott of BJP from all party meet indicates that the budget session is likely to witness stormy session as the BJP is going to raise issue as BJP is likely to raise the State government’s reported move to rollback the Mukhyamantri Krishi Ashirward Yojana. The BJP will also raise the issue of reports that another welfare scheme might be withdrawn by the JMM- Congress-RJD coalition government led by Hemant Soren.

A spurt in Naxalism in State will also be highlighted during the session.

The budget session will be held at new Assembly building. Chief Minister Hemant Soren on Thursday inspected the new building verifying the sound system and sitting arrangement of lawmakers.

AJSU Party chief and MLA from Silli Sudesh Mahto said, “The AJSU will sit in opposition benches and will raise issue of public interest.”

The new Assembly building on December first week caught fire. Though there was no report of any injury in the fire several files and documents were gutted in fire. The exact cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. The newly constructed Jharkhand Assembly building at Kute in Ranchi was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendr",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/budget-session-begins-today-sans-lop.html

91,28-2-20,MCD claims contradict known facts,"Though the officials of Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) claim that the old trenching ground on Sahastradhara Road will be ready to build Sainya Dham and a city park in a couple of years, sources state that the usual procedure required to make the land suitable for the purpose takes at least seven to eight years.

A few days ago, Dehradun mayor Sunil Uniyal ‘Gama’ inspected the trenching ground and announced that the said land will be used for the construction of Sainya Dham and a city park. According to municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey, “The work of clearing the trash from the part of the trenching ground where there are bushes and lesser garbage has begun. For the remaining place, bio-mining engineers will be called to ascertain what can be done with the garbage dumped there.” He further added that the ground will be ready in one or two years to build Sainya Dham and City Park.

However, observers point out that when it comes to talk of clearing the garbage, one should understand that the MCD is talking to clearing a dump used for about a decade at a time when it is struggling to properly dispose of the garbage generated daily. The existing solid waste management plant of the MCD is already struggling to tackle the 300 metric tonnes of waste generated daily. In such a situation, tackling the waste from the old trenching ground is a highly impractical idea. Further, as per the procedure used in trenching grounds past their capacity, the capping technique is the most suitable way to make the land suitable for any kind of activity. In this technique, layers of soil are laid in the area which is left to settle for about seven to eight years and no activity can be done on the ground during this period. The old trenching ground is filled with non-biodegradable garbage that makes any activity like building a park impossible at the site in its present condition. The only way of giving new shape to the dumping ground is to use the capping technique.

Considering these points, the claims of the officials of MCD appear highly impractical as the disposal of untreated garbage of more than a decade in the trenching ground seems impossible within the span of a couple of years.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mcd-claims-contradict-known-facts.html

Under the new traffic law, the Centre has brought several strict provisions, including an increase of fine up to 10 times. In fact, there’s also a provision under which one can be sentenced jail terms.

While helmet would be compulsory for a pillion rider, all the occupants of a four-wheeler would have to put on seatbelts. Besides, the necessary documents such as driving licence, PUC, insurance and fitness certificates would be verified by RTO and police officials engaged in vehicle inspection.

At a meeting held here with Suzuki in the presence of Union Steel Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, Patnaik made the offer and promised that the State Government would provide all necessary facilitation.

Patnaik also urged the envoy to consider Japan being a partner-country for the Make-in-Odisha Conclave-2020.

Patnaik said Odisha today is the highest producer of steel in India; and the strong base of steelmaking in the State provides huge opportunity for ancillary and downstream industries. The State Government is now focusing on encouraging value addition in steel and stainless steel so as to achieve at least 50% value addition by the year 2030.

In this context, Patnaik proposed Japanese investment in sectors such as automobiles, food processing, chemicals and petro chemicals.

The Union Ministry of Steel Additional Secretary gave a presentation about the new initiatives called “Purvodaya” which aims to drive accelerated development of eastern India through establishment of integrated steel hubs, for which Odisha has the potential.

The eastern belt has the potential to add more than 75% of the country’s incremental steel capacity as is envisioned by the National Steel Policy.

96,28-2-20,Bhojan Mata & teacher responsible for critical condition of child: BEO,"The Bhojan Mata and teacher concerned are responsible for a child suffering from health consequences after being made to undertake physical labour in a government school. This was revealed in the investigation report submitted to the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) after the commission wrote to the Chief Education Officer of Almora last month seeking a report of the investigation.

According to the letter sent by SCPCR, a resident of Dauni village in the Almora district, Anand Ram had complained against a Bhojan Mata and the principal of a government school who made his son Sagar carry three sacks of rice each weighing 50 kilogrammes, to the school kitchen. Such heavy lifting caused swelling in the intestines and kidneys of the child. After the condition of the child got critical, his father admitted him to a hospital in Ranikhet where the doctors had to operate upon him.

Reportedly, the father had also complained to police and district education officer against the school administration but according to him no action was taken against the school. After SCPCR asked the block education officer for an investigation into the matter, an investigation committee was formed. According to the report presented by investigation committee to SCPCR, Bhojan Mata Bhagwati Devi and the teacher Deepa Samant are responsible for the critical condition of the child. Though both have denied the allegations, some of the school children have verified that the Samant called some students to lift the rice sacks and the Bhojan Mata instructed them to carry the sacks to the school kitchen, according to the report.

“Our purpose is to bring smile on the faces of every child,” said Gupta, adding that special campaigns for blood donation will be run in a bid to strengthen the blood banks in State and ensure availability of blood for all needy patients. “Educational institutions, voluntary organizations and NGOs will actively participate in the campaign,” he said.

The day care center has been upgraded under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) by ICICI Bank, a press communiqué from the Health Minister’s office said. Gupta said that neurosurgeries will also be done in the hospital very soon, and it will be a huge step towards providing quality health services at Government-run facilities.

The hospital, in the heart of the city, currently has 200 beds and infrastructure for 300 more beds is under construction. Out of the existing 200 beds, 150 are for maternity ward and remaining 50 for pediatrics. At the time of its inauguration, the Government decided to exclusively treat pregnant women and newborns in the facility.

Sadar hospital already has dedicated Medicine Outdoor Patient Department (OPD), Physiotherapy unit, child care OPD, Inpatient Department (IPD) and Intensive Care Unit (ICU), female care OPD, IPD and ICU, labour room and nutrition unit. “Neonatal deaths are a major concern in Jharkhand. The facility will be of great help in averting such deaths,” said Civil Surgeon VB Prasad.

The Sample Registration System (SRS) survey of 2017 revealed that the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) in Jharkhand was 29 deaths per 1000 live births. The figures, released in 2019, put Jharkhand among the worst 10 states in terms of neonatal deaths. The figures, however, have improved compared to 2015-2016, when the IMR in Jharkhand was 44 deaths every 1000 live births.

Gupta on Thursday also inaugurated Jharkhand's first Mamta Ghar. This dedicated facility for women will provide treatment and care to women who suffer from complications in pregnancy – before as well as after delivering a baby. “I also thank ICICI Bank for their great work under CSR,” he said.

99,28-2-20,Security tightened at PTR after tigress death,"Close on the heels of death of an elderly tigress following a fight with a bison inside State’s lone reserve for big cats, the Palamau Tiger Reserve (PTR) last week, the authorities have decided to tightened security at reserve.

According to the Status of Tigers in India report released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year, it was revealed of five tigers in Jharkhand but none in Palamu Tiger Reserve. The death of elderly tigress now establishes the fact that of PTR having bag cats.

Palamu Tiger Reserve field director YK Das said, “Based on the direct and indirect evidences, we had claimed that there are at least three tigers including two males and one female tiger at the Palamu Tiger Reserve. With the death of one tigress, we have decided to tightened security at PTR.”

Das said, “Directions have been issued to intensify night patrolling in the reserve.

The forest officials along with local police and magistrate have been asked to conduct patrolling in the tiger reserve.” The field director claimed that shoot at sight order has seen issued to security personnel if they see any poachers in the reserve.

The PTR will be closed for tourist in night.

The aged big cat was gored to death by a bison or a herd of bison protecting its young. The tigress was found dead on the grass near road number 2 of the Betla National Park — of which the Palamau Tiger Reserve (PTR) is a part — on the night of February 15.

The carcass was cremated on February 16, after autopsy by a panel of five veterinarians. After the death the PTR officials had closed the gate number 2 for protecting the evidence of fight.

Das said, “Following the death of tigress to protect the evidence we had closed gate number 2 as the area had pug marks and other evidences for ten days.”

“However, in last day most of the pug marks and other evidences of fight have been washed we have opened the gate number of PTR on Tuesday (February 25).”

Moreover, the PTR have decided to install a wooden statue of tigress at the spot where the tigress was found dead. Das said, “We have asked a local artist from Chhipadohar to prepare the wooden statue of the tigress which is equal the size of deceased. The statue will be installed at the spot where the tigress was killed.”

Though the PTR officials claim that the death of tigress was due to attack by bison, sources said that there are several unanswered questions over the death of the big cat in the Palamau Tiger Reserve which is part of Betla National Park.

Moreover, Independent MLA from Jamshedpur East Saryu Roy too has urged the State government to order a “high level” inquiry into the death of the tigress in Betla National Park.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/security-tightened-at-ptr-after-tigress-death.html
100,28-2-20,Markets flooded with Made in India products this Holi,"With the impact of Coronavirus, the regular Chinese products seen in the market may go missing this Holi. However, products Made in India are ready to add to the colours during the festival in Ranchi.

Normally traders start ordering Chinese colours and pichkaris sometime in the month of August and receive the supply about two months prior to the festival. With just about a fortnight left for Holi, there is a shortage of these products.

The Indian products available in the market include colours- both natural or organic and synthetic, water guns, sprinklers, balloons and wigs.

Mohit Garodia, a shop owner in Upper Bazaar, is very happy with the markets being full of Indian items for Holi. “Every year about 80 per cent of the items are imported from China.

But this year not even five per cent of Chinese products are seen in the market. The market is flooded with products Made in India, which is great and it is fun to sell indigenous products. From colourful wigs, masks, hats, designer pichkaris, water tanks are all Indian.”

“There is absolutely no difference in the quality and price. So far, the customers also seem to be very happy with the products. People would generally opt for Chinese goods but this time due to the lack of it, they are discovering locally made goods,” added Garodia.

“Chinese products are quite attractive and children usually insist that their parents buy them the goods. But the Indian make is equally good and colourful.

The lack of Chinese items will give a boon to the Indian economy and also introduce the customers to products Made in India. Various social media posts are also floating around urging people to not buy any product imported from China. Sunscreen lotions and sunglasses are also in huge demand this festival season,” said another shop keeper Sanjeev.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/markets-flooded-with-made-in-india-products-this-holi.html

120,28-2-20,Govt for 3-level action plan to curb pollution,"In order to combat pollution in the national Capital, the AAP Government will prepare a three-level action plan quarterly, annually and five years to reduce its impact, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said on Thursday.

Rai held a meeting with experts who suggested the government to issue a direction to agencies that no outdoor construction activities should be conducted in winters when the pollution levels rise and only indoor construction activities should be allowed during the same period.

The minister said the experts also suggested an inter-state action committee based on the airshed so that the government can study the impact created from either side.

Rai said the suggestions will be sent to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal next week and a final action plan will be prepared. ""A special action plan for three month will be prepared to deal with pollution in winter. An annual action and a five-year action plan will also prepare to curb pollution in Delhi,"" Rai said. He said that experts suggested increasing budgetary allocation for the environment. ""The environment department works like a nodal agency and in coordination with other departments. So, the adequate budget will be allocated so that the environment department can smoothly function,"" he said.

He said that the contribution of biomass to air pollution is less in summers compared to winters and the data shows that in summers it is 8-10 per cent while in winters it is 25-30 per cent. Though coal plants have been closed down in Delhi, pollutants from coal plants situated in the neighbouring states enter the airshed in the national capital, he said.

Similarly, stubble burning in other states contributes to air pollution in Delhi though there are very few instances of stubble burning in the city. Therefore, the experts suggested forming an action committee that includes representatives of departments from various states, Rai said.

""We should create a joint action committee based on the airshed so that we can study the impact created from either side,"" the minister also said.

The experts suggested that the government should have an action plan for the entire year so that it does not have immense pressure during the winter season when the pollution is at its worst levels. ""So, the experts have suggested to us that we should design an action plan to be carried throughout the year,"" he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-for-3-level-action-plan-to-curb-pollution.html

122,28-2-20,HC gives Centre 4 weeks to reply,"The Delhi High Court on Thursday made the Centre a party in the PIL which has sought lodging of FIRs and arrests in communal violence in northeast Delhi over the amended Citizenship Law and gave it four weeks to file a reply to the petition.

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar said that ""looking at the complexity of the situation"", the central government was seeking more time to file a reply to the plea which has also sought lodging of FIRs against three BJP leaders over their alleged hate speeches in connection with the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) related violence.

On Wednesday, a different bench of the high court, comprising of Justices S Muralidhar and Talwant Singh, had expressed anguish over the police failure to register FIR against the three BJP leaders -- Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma and Kapil Mishra -- over their alleged hate speeches and had asked the police commissioner to take a ""conscious decision"" on it by Thursday.

When the arguments commenced post-lunch on Thursday before the new bench, Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta at the outset said some of the alleged hate speeches in question were three weeks to more than a month old and yet instead of waiting for one more day the matter was mentioned by the petitioners before the bench headed by Justice Muralidhar on the ground that there was ""great urgency"".

Mehta said the petitioners could have waited for one more day as the matter was listed for hearing before the Chief Justice's bench on Thursday.

The SG said that everyone was trying to restore normalcy in the national capital and urged the court not to intervene at this stage as it would not be conducive to maintaining law and order in the city.

He further said: ""Considering the prevailing situation, it is the considered opinion of the police authorities that any decision at this juncture may not be conducive for restoration of normalcy. The decision (on lodging of FIR) will be taken at an appropriate stage in accordance with law"".

The SG also submitted that the authorities have examined all the audio/video clips and other material including that on Twitter and ""after having carefully considered all these materials, a conscious decision is taken to defer the decision on the question (of lodging FIR)"".

He also urged the court to allow the impleadment application moved by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), instead of waiting for the petitioners' reply as done by the previous bench.

""Union of India's impleadment cannot depend on the yes or no of the petitioner,"" said Mehta, who also stated he was authorised by the LG to appear for the police.

Delhi government standing counsel Rahul Mehra, who also claimed to be appearing for the police, said he will not get into the issue of appearance and instead urged the bench to issue some directions in view of the seriousness of the situation prevailing in north-east district of the city.

Mehra said, ""The court yesterday had asked why FIRs regarding hate speeches were not lodged when FIRs for other offences have been registered"".

He also told the bench that as on date 48 FIRs have been registered in connection with the deaths, arson, loot and other offences committed in that area.

The death toll in the communal violence reached 34 on Thursday, with around 200 people injured.

""In larger interest of the citizens some directions may be issued,"" Mehra told the court.

However, the SG said the MHA and police need time to file a reply.

He also told the court that the hate speeches would be looked into and a decision would be taken on what has to be done and added that the decision taken would be indicated in the MHA response.

Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, who appeared for petitioners Harsh Mander and Farah Naqvi, said there was ""hatred in the air"" due to the alleged hate speeches and ""it resulted in the deaths, arson and looting"".

He said if hate speeches led to murder, then those making such speeches would be responsible for the death.

123,28-2-20,No exclusive liquor shops for women in State: Min,"Madhya Pradesh Excise Minister Brijendra Singh Rathore here on Thursday clarified that there would not be exclusive liquor shops for women in the State.

While talking to media persons here, Rathore said, “These are liquor shops meant for sale of branded foreign liquor in cities and I am not aware about anything like the concept of all-women liquor outlets.”

Notably, some media reports quoting Commercial Tax Dept senior officials had suggested that in order to boost revenues and facilitate women in buying high end wine and whiskey, outlets exclusive for women were being opened in the state on the lines of metro cities like New Delhi and Mumbai.

“It was seen for long that there were people in the state who prefer branded foreign liquor which is not available on normal liquor outlets and they have to source it

from either foreign countries, airports and others which causes revenue loss to the state so we decided to open two branded liquor shops each at Bhopal and Indore and one each at Gwalior and Jabalpur to tap revenues,” Rathore said underlining the fact that there is nothing like all-women exclusive shops.

“I have absolutely no idea about this.” When asked specifically that if he isn’t aware about all-women shops, whether it means there is no such plan, the minister replied in affirmative.

The minister however added that the makers of branded liquors would be asked to set up their own outlets and sell their products.

He also slammed opposition for engaging in false propaganda on excise policy and urged them to offer statements only after reading the policy properly.

Had they read the policy with attention, they would know that there is no provision of sub shops for liquor outlets and also the online process is meant for tracking illegal sale of liquor and tapping revenue loss, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/no-exclusive-liquor-shops-for-women-in-state--min.html

Party founder S Ramadoss called for implementing the National Population Register as per the 2010 format, even as he wanted the Government to “allay fears” over NPR.

The family members of Intelligence Bureau staffer, Ankit Sharma, had accused Tahir of being behind the murder. However, Tahir on Thursday denied any involvement in the riots or the killing of Sharma.

Ankit Sharma (26), who worked for the Intelligence Bureau (IB), had gone missing on Tuesday and his body was found in a drain near his home in northeast Delhi's riot-hit Chandbagh area on Wednesday.

His family members claimed that the local councillor and his associates were behind the killing. Hussain has rejected the allegations. Meanwhile police said that they are investigating the allegations leveled by Sharma's family.

The AAP leader also demanded strict action against BJP leaders responsible for giving inflammatory speeches. ""I came to know from news reports that I am being blamed for the murder of a man. These are lies and baseless accusations. For our safety, my family and I had moved away from our home on Monday in police presence,"" he said.

Senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh said the party's stand remains clear that strictest punishment must be taken against anyone associated with spreading violence and added that Hussain has given his statement on the matter.

133,28-2-20,Spare no rioters: CM over FIR,"After Delhi Police registered a case of murder against Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain for his alleged involvement in the brutal murder of Intelligence Bureau (IB) staffer Ankit Sharma, Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday sought to corner AAP, even as Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said no rioter, whichever party they belong to, should be spared.

Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari alleged that the recovery of petrol bombs, bags of stones, acid pouches and other items from Hussain's house have exposed a ""well planned conspiracy"" behind the riots.

The violence in parts of north east Delhi in the past few days, has so far led to the deaths of 34 people and injuries to over 200, besides widespread damage to private property, including vehicles, houses and shops.

""The AAP councillor had made advance preparations for violence in Delhi, but the AAP is trying to cover it up. The double standard of the AAP is exposed before the people,"" Tiwari alleged.

Hussain denied any involvement in the riots or the killing of an Intelligence Bureau (IB) staffer whose family accused him of being behind the murder, saying these are ""baseless accusations"".

He called for an impartial probe into the incident and said action should be taken against the guilty. ""It is wrong to target me. I and my family have nothing to do with it,"" Hussain said.

Kejriwal, who is also the AAP's national convener, in a press conference said no rioter, whichever party they belong to, should be spared. ""If those involved in the riots are found to be from the AAP, give them double punishment,"" he said. Tiwari said that Hussain's mobile phone should be confiscated and examined.

""The AAP has been accusing the Delhi Police of failing to stop the violence in the city, but is now saving its own party councillor who has been accused of spreading violence,"" he said. East Delhi BJP MP Gautam Gambhir said the chief minister was maintaining silence over the issue.

""A (public) representative is accused of throwing the body of IB jawan Ankit Sharma in a nallah, sheltering rioters and throwing petrol bombs.

135,28-2-20,348 cases withdrawn so far: Min,"The Maharashtra Government has withdrawn 348 cases registered in connection with the 2018 Bhima-Koregaon violence and 460 cases booked during the various agitations demanding Maratha reservations, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh informed the State Legislative Council here on Thursday.

Replying to a question in the upper house of the Maharashtra Legislature, Deshmukh said: “Out of the total 649 cases registered in connection with the Bhima-Koregaon violence, the State Government has withdrawn 348 cases. Similarly, 460 cases out of the total 548 cases registered during agitations demanding Maratha reservations”.

Deshmukh said that the process of withdrawing cases in connection with the Bhima-Koregaon violence was continuing. “The cases that we intend to withdraw are all of minor nature. However, we will not withdraw cases registered for destruction of property and assault on police officials in connection with Bhima-Koregaon violence,” the minister said.

Slamming the previous Devendra Fadnavis government for carrying out an improper investigations into the Bhima-Koregaon case, Deshmukh said: “The state government may have handed over the case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), but the state government will order a probe into the Bhima-Koregaon case under the Bombay Police Act, 1951 or section 10 of the NIA Act, 2008”.

Deshmukh also came down heavily on the previous BJP-led government for dubbing the activists who were vociferous critics of the ruling BJP and Modi government at the Centre, as “urban naxals”.

The minister said that despite a directive issued by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on December 2 to withdraw all cases filed against protesters who had opposed the proposed oil refinery and petrochemicals complex at Nanar in Rajapur taluka of Ratnagiri district, “only three cases” had so far been withdrawn. Deshmukh’s statement about his plans to order a fresh investigation into the Bhima-Koregaon violence case should be seen in the context of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s decision to let the NIA take over the investigations into the 2018 Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case

Deshmukh had said early this month that the State Home Ministry was seeking legal opinion before going ahead with its plan to order a fresh probe into the Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case under section 10 of the NIA Act. “The Maharashtra government may have let the NIA carry out the investigations in the Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case to the NIA, but we will seek a legal opinion if we can institute an SIT to investigate the case,” th4e minister had said.

If the NCP—which holds the Home portfolio in the state – decides to go ahead with the SIT probe into the Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case, it will send a clear cut message to its ruling ally –Shiv Sena that the chief minister —can ill-afford to “overrule” his party’s allies in the MVA on crucial matters like the one in the case. Simultaneously, the NCP is bound to trigger a confrontation between the State and Centre over a parallel probe on the Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/348-cases-withdrawn-so-far--min.html
136,28-2-20,Political parties to pick issue for Bengal civic polls,"Delhi mayhem may polarise Bengal municipal elections in a big way. There are reports that the political parties of the State are planning to ‘utilise’ Delhi riots as an issue to influence the voters in the upcoming municipal elections.

According to sources in the BJP local leaders and workers have been asked to stage local level meeting and place the party’s views not only on its development plans but also the tumultuous situation in the National Capital and the groups responsible for it.

“We will tell the truth to the people as to what happened in Delhi. How things were planned to defame India during President Trump’s visit. The politically educated people of Bengal must know about the reality as the opposition parties are running a hate campaign in the media accusing the Hindus of perpetrating the riots which is not the real side of the story,” said a senior leader of the State committee accusing the rival community for holding the Capital to ransom.

“Is the central Government a fool to embarrass itself by inciting riots when President Trump is present. Is the BJP so immature as not to understand how Pakistan will take mileage out of the situation. In fact it is the traitors of the nation who have organized the riots to defame India… The Delhi Police in fact has exercised great restraint in not opening fire in many places just because our Government has great regard for the minorities unlike Pakistan,” another BJP leader said. This leader, and a party candidate in the Lok Sabha elections was himself accused of giving inflammatory speeches during campaigning.

On whether the BJP will go to people with an intent of polarizing the atmosphere the leader said “the atmosphere has already been polarized as the Hindus have awakened and learnt to assert their rights. If some people think that speaking the plain truth is polarization, then so be it.”

The Trinamool Congress on the other hand was less vocal while its leaders said the people will be told as to how the BJP was trying to divide India along communal lines.

“It is not only Pakistan which is trying to divide India but it is also the BJP which is dividing the country by playing into the hands of Pakistan,” a senior TMC leader and a Minister said adding his party would go to the people with the report card containing what Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has done for the State in the past nine years.

“And if the BJP tries to communalise the atmosphere then we will not let them do that. Rather we will use the situation to expose their communal plans,” the Minister said adding definitely Delhi riots would be raised during the election campaign but to tell how BJP and

Hindutva goons applied the Gujarat model in Delhi to break the society along communal lines. CPI(M)’s Sujan Chakrabarty, a party central committee member however accused both the parties for being “complementary to each other.”

While Mamata Banerjee was banking on minority communalism, the BJP was taking the opportunity to play its Hindutva card, he said adding “these two parties are communal and are complementary to each other. We will tell the people during the elections how BJP designed and planned the Delhi riots and how our Chief Minister maintained a diplomatic silence so as not to hurt any community.”

This was “political opportunism” he said adding “the Left however would expose both the parties during the election campaign.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/political-parties-to-pick-issue-for-bengal-civic-polls.html

139,28-2-20,Sena complains to RSS about Amruta’s ‘objectionable’ remarks against Aditya,"The controversy over a spat between the ruling Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress alliance and the Opposition BJP over former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis’ ‘bangles’ remark assumed a new dimension on Thursday, as a Sena leader complained to the RSS about ‘objectionable’ remarks by Fadnavis’ wife Amruta against his party’s leader and Minister Aditya Thackeray.

A day after Fadnavis’ banker-wife Amruta came to the defence of her and hit out at Aditya through a tweet, president of the state-run Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swavlamban Mission (VNSSM) Kishore Tiwari – in a letter written to RSS’ general secretary Bhayyaji Joshi—objected to the term “cocooned worm” used by her to describe the Sena minister in her tweet put out on Wednesday.

Addressing a BJP workers rally held at Azad Maidan on Tuesday, Fadnavis had had slammed the Sena for its failure act against Pathan for his much-discussed “15 crore...” statement. ""Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena may be wearing bangles but we are not. If someone says something then he will be given an answer in the same way. BJP has this much power.""

Responding to Fadnavis’ “bangles” comment, Aditya tweeted on Wednesday: “Shri @Dev_Fadnavi ji, normally I choose not to comment back. Kindly apologise abt bangles comment: bangles are worn by the strongest of all- the women. Politics can go on, but we need to change this discourse. Rather disgraceful coming from a fmr CM”.

A couple of hours later, Fadnavis’ banker-wife Amruta Fadnavis – who has of late been taking political stands on various issues and coming out in support of her former chief minister-husband – slammed Aditya through a tweet. “A cocooned worm will never understand the ‘Pun’ of life ! It’s meant to thrive on the glory of the silken life woven for its comfort by its ancestors @AUThackeray ! Proud of ur struggles @Dev_Fadnavis & each and every hardworking member of @BJP4Maharashtra !,"" Amruta tweeted.

Tasking strong exception to Amruta’s tweet, Tiwari stated in his letter to the RSS general secretary: “... celeb- banker Amrita Fadnavis sought to defend her husband (Devendra) by suggesting that Aditya was a “cocooned worm” and she said Rs A cocooned worm will never understand the ‘Pun’ of life ! It’s meant to thrive on the glory of the silken life woven for its comfort by its ancestors @AUThackeray !’.

“This unwanted activism of both Devendra and Amruta is the main cause for souring of good relationship between BJP-Shiv Sena and due to over-confidence and arrogance, which is core cause of historic SS-NCP-INC mega alliance (sic),” Tiwari stated.

In his letter -- a copy of which he posted on his Facebook page, Tiwari said: “Amruta’s unwanted political activism is beyond the understanding and culture of Indian culture as no opposition politician’s spouses –husband/wife, anywhere all over India criticises Govt like this (No even the deserted Jadhodaben!. There are examples like wives of L K Advani, Yeshwant Sinha, Jeswant Singh, Shatrungan Sinha, Arun Shourie etc do not do such things”.

“Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray’s wife Meenatai Thackeray quietly functioned in shadow and her contribution came out after her sad demise... Same is the case of CM Uddhav’swife Rashmi, his cousin Raj T’s wife Sharmila ( who are) in background without making useless remarks and controversial gestures,” Tiwari wrote.

Tiwari also took the examples of the wives of BJP leaders Amit Shah, Nitin Gadkari and Rajnath Singh who, he said, “ don’t go around abusing Sonia/ Rahul or husbands of political rivals” “What’s Amruta Fadnasvis’ hidden agenda? Is she trying to take over the state BJP which has no prominent women leader left now? Will she be acceptable to the BJP-RSS mindset?. These are the questions being asked by the people,” Tiwari stated.

Tiwari urged the RSS general secretary “to look into the matter and ensure that such unhappy womenfolk does not spell doom for BJP in 2024, in centre & State”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sena-complains-to-rss-about-amruta---s------objectionable----remarks-against-aditya.html

All the evacuees will undergo a 14-day quarantine in two batches at the ITBP and Army facilities in Chhawla and Manesar respectively here.

The Union Ministry of External Affairs said that AC-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft of Indian Air Force evacuated 76 Indians and 36 foreign nationals from Wuhan while an Air India flight brought back the group of 124 people from Tokyo.

The foreign national evacuated from Wuhan included 23 from Bangladesh, six from China, two each from Myanmar and Maldives and one each from South Africa, USA and Madagascar.

Besides 119 Indians, the people evacuated from Japan included two from Sri Lanka and one each from Nepal, South Africa and Peru. The group was among 3,711 people who were on board the coronavirus-infected Diamond Princess ship when it docked at the Yokohama port near Tokyo on February 3.

""In line with India's neighbourhood first policy and Indo-Pacific vision, the special flight also evacuated five foreign nationals — two Sri Lankans, one Nepalese, one South African and one Peruvian,"" MEA spokesman Raveesh Kumar said.

Three Indian crew members didn't board the Air India flight as they conveyed their wish to continue their stay on-board the cruise ship to complete the period of extended quarantine put in place by the Japanese government.

Out of the total 138 Indian nationals originally on-board Diamond Princess, 16 Indian crew members have tested positive for coronavirus and are receiving medical care at an onshore medical facility in Japan. They will undergo a 14-day quarantine at the facility set up by the Indian Army in Manesar. Earlier, India had evacuated around 650 Indians from Wuhan in two Air India flights. All these people later tested negative for the virus and were allowed to go home after over a fortnight of quarantine.

""In all 723 Indian nationals and 43 foreign nationals have been evacuated from Wuhan, China in these three flights,"" an MEA statement said.

The AC-17 Globemaster flown to Wuhan on Wednesday had carried 15 tonnes of medical supplies for coronavirus-affected people in China.

Khanna made the allegation during a heated exchange with Leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary, who earlier said the Minister had ignored a question raised by him on the Budget tabled in the House on February 18. Khanna, who is also the finance minister, had earlier finished his reply to the debate on the 2020-2021 budget.

With Chaudhary accusing Khanna of ignoring his question, the Minister took a dig at him over the Opposition leader’s earlier statement outside the House that those sitting on anti-CAA dharna would be given pension.

This triggered a heated exchange between Khanna and Chaudhary with the later reiterating that the pension is given to patriots.

“Those struggling for restoration of democracy are given pension. We are also getting it as ‘loktantra senanis’ (those arrested during emergency),” Chaudhary said.

Khanna at this asked what was there to oppose in the CAA.

“The SP, BSP and Congress are trying to create anarchy in the State,” he asserted.

148,28-2-20,PM to lay foundation stone for 296-KM Bundelkhand E-way,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Saturday lay the foundation stone for the 296-km-long Bundelkhand Expressway in Uttar Pradesh’s Chitrakoot.

The expressway will be supplementing the nodes of the Uttar Pradesh Defence Industrial Corridor announced by the government in February 2018, a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) maintained on Thursday.

The Uttar Pradesh Government is constructing the Bundelkhand Expressway, which will pass through Chitrakoot, Banda, Hamirpur and Jalaun districts.

The expressway will link the Bundelkhand area to the national capital through the Agra-Lucknow Expressway and the Yamuna Expressway.

The prime minister will also be launching 10,000 farmers’ producer organisations all over the country at Chitrakoot on that day.

Nearly 86 per cent of farmers are small and marginal with average land holdings in the country being less than 1.1 hectare.

These small, marginal and landless farmers face tremendous challenges during agriculture production phase such as for access to technology, quality seed, fertilisers and pesticides, including requisite finances.

They also face tremendous challenges in marketing their produce due to lack of economic strength, the statement pointed out. FPOs (Farmer Producer Organisations) help in collectivisation of such farmers in order to give them the collective strength to deal with such issues.

Members of the FPO will manage their activities together in the organisation to get better access to technology, input, finance and market for faster enhancement of their income.

“Though the report of ‘Doubling of Farmer’s Income’ recommended formation of 7,000 FPOs by 2022 towards convergence of efforts for doubling farmers’ income, the central government announced the creation of 10,000 new FPOs to ensure economies of scale for farmers over the next five years,” it said.

In Allahabad, Modi will be distributing assistive aids and devices to senior citizens, under the Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojana, and people with disablities, under the ADIP scheme, at a mega distribution camp.

This is the biggest ever distribution camp being held in the country in terms of the number of beneficiaries covered, number of appliances distributed and value of aids and appliances distributed, the statement said. At the camp, over 56,000 assistive aids and devices of different types will be distributed free of cost to more than 26,000 of beneficiaries.

Stating this at a press conference here , Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said the transfer orders were firmed up in February with the consent of the Judge.

Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also rejected the allegation saying Justice Muralidhar was transferred on the recommendation of the Supreme Court collegium and accused the Congress of politicising a routine transfer.

He added that a ""well-settled process"" was followed in the transfer of Justice Muralidhar to the Punjab and Haryana High Court.

""By politicising a routine transfer, Congress has yet again displayed its scant regard for the judiciary,"" Prasad said in a series of tweets. His reaction came after the Congress alleged that Justice Muralidhar was transferred by the Government to save BJP leaders in the Delhi violence case.

""Transfer of Justice Muralidhar was done pursuant to the recommendation dated February 12 of the Supreme Court collegium headed by Chief Justice of India,"" the minister said.

He said a judge's consent is taken before transferring him or her. Continuing his attack on the opposition party, Prasad said the people of India have rejected the Congress and ""hence it is hell bent on destroying the very institutions India cherishes by constantly attacking them"".

Referring to a tweet by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on the death of Judge Loya, the Union minister said the Loya judgement has been well-settled by the Supreme Court.

151,28-2-20,Govt’s draft on battery waste management ready,"As demand for environment-friendly battery-operated vehicles is all set to rise in the near future in India as a measure to cut down carbon footprints, the NDA Government has prepared draft rules for battery waste management that will make it mandatory for manufacturers and dealers to collect used batteries against the new ones they sell.

The proposed draft rules the 'Battery Waste Management Rules 2020' brings under its ambit all kind of batteries such as . The notification was issued by the Union Environment Ministry recently which has uploaded it on its website, seeking objection and suggestions from the stakeholders.

The Batteries (Management and Handling) Rules, 2001, had mentioned only lead-acid batteries.

The draft rules put the responsibility of collection of batteries and their safe transport to the recyclers on the manufacturers and dealers. They will need to ensure that used batteries are sent only to the registered recyclers and that environment is not harmed during their transportation, as per the notification.

Under the new rules, battery dealers will have to issue purchase invoices (when they collect used batteries). Earlier, dealers were obliged to register with the state pollution control boards, but there was no mention of issuing purchase invoice for old batteries.

According to various reports, an estimated 2.7 billion pieces of dry cell batteries are consumed annually in India, but there is no collection mechanism to ensure that these batteries are safely transported to recyclers. Unsafe disposal of batteries can cause harmful metals like mercury and cadmium to leak out and enter the soil and water.

Discarded batteries, meanwhile, can be a valuable resource to recover highly useful metals in an environmentally-friendly manner.

However, these regulations will not be applicable on batteries used in equipment connected with the protection of the essential security interests such as arms, ammunitions and war material, and intended specifically for military purposes; equipment designed to be sent into space (space exploration), emergency and alarm systems, emergency lighting and medical equipment.

152,28-2-20,"CBI brings back toddler, kidnaped by her own father, from Dubai","The CBI on Thursday brought back a three-year-old girl from Dubai who was taken there by her father in violation of orders of Delhi High Court that is hearing a custody battle between the baby's parents.

The girl's father, Aman Lohia, had taken Baby Raina to Dubai amid a custody battle with his wife Kiran Kaur Lohia in the High Court that had asked him to deposit his passport with authorities to prevent him from leaving the country.

In a case against a High Court order, the Supreme Court had directed the CBI to visit Dubai to bring back the girl to India.

A team of CBI officials had recently gone to Dubai where it coordinated with local authorities to ensure the safe return of the girl and her father, officials said.

After the agency team arrived on Thursday morning, the CBI informed the apex court about the compliance of its orders, officials said adding the girl will be produced before the SC on Friday. The child is presently at her mother's home under the agency's care.

The dramatic developments of Thursday were a culmination of a six-month long trail of a defiant father who in a desperate move escaped to Dubai with his daughter claiming he was a ""victim of gender bias"" of courts and that it was the ""love for his daughter"" which directed his actions.

Aman Lohia, son of a noted businessman, was fighting a custody battle for his daughter Raina in the HC after separating from his wife, a Delhi-based dermatologist.

The high court had granted Raina's custody to the mother with a parenting plan, according to which, Aman Lohia could meet his daughter for some hours on three days of a week. The court also asked him to deposit his passport, which he complied, the officials said.

On August 24 last year, when the girl had come to meet Aman Lohia as per the parenting plan, he took her along with family confidant Pawan Kumar and maid Shiuratia Debi to Dubai using a circuitous route via Nepal and other gulf countries.

Considering ""international ramifications"", the Delhi High Court had handed over the probe to the CBI which had registered a case.

The Interpol had issued a 'Yellow Notice' for the girl on a CBI request. Yellow Notices are issued by the Interpol on the request of member countries to locate missing persons. The CBI had also filed a charge sheet on December 19 last year before a special court against Aman Lohia, his mother Meena Lohia, alleged accomplice Pawan Kumar and maid Shiuratia Debi Mahto, officials further said.

The agency has invoked Indian Penal Code provisions pertaining to criminal conspiracy, kidnapping from India and kidnapping from lawful guardianship among others against the businessman.

Aman Lohia had allegedly decided to flee to Dubai, where ""personal laws enjoin exclusive custody upon the father"", using a passport acquired from Caribbean country the Commonwealth of Dominica.

The high court had termed Lohia's escape with his daughter on a Dominican passport and refusal to subject himself to the jurisdiction of the Indian legal system as a ""contempt of court"".",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cbi-brings-back-toddler--kidnaped-by-her-own-father--from-dubai.html
153,28-2-20,Kiwis look to exploit sideways movement against Kohli,"Virat Kohli will be itching to make a comeback in the second Test and the best chance for New Zealand will be to exploit the sideways movement which can spell trouble for the Indian captain, feels opener Tom Latham.

Kohli had an indifferent tour of New Zealand so far. He was out for 2 and 19 in the first Test in Wellington.

“When Virat comes out to bat we will be ready. He is a quality player and there is a reason why he is up around that No 1 rank for such a period of time,” Latham said at the media conference on Thursday.

“He has done it for long time and done it in all conditions. If the surface is conducive to sideways movement we will try and exploit that,” said Latham.

Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami might have had a below par game in Wellington but Latham said they remain world class bowlers and the team would be certainly wary of them.

“We have played those guys really well in the first Test. But they are World class performers and we will be wary of them. Certainly they would be on top of their game and if we play well it will give us a good chance. We need to be consistent for long periods,” he said.

Latham is sure that Neil Wagner’s comeback will add firepower to the side.

“I haven’t yet seen him but when he rocks up for training he will be absolutely fizzing up to get going and obviously he will be raring to go. He is been a quality performer for a number of years for us,” Latham said.

The Hagley Oval surface will have bounce and Latham expects Wagner to be more than a handful.

“It’s something that Neil has obviously been so good at for so long and he is second to none in terms of accuracy.

“He is a short guy and that makes him harder to play. If the surface is up for that plan he will be looking to go round with that.”

The first day will be important reckoned Latham.

“Generally, it’s a good surface and surfaces in NZ have been on the greener side at the start and then flatten out. So we need to do well on day one.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/kiwis-look-to-exploit-sideways-movement-against-kohli.html
154,28-2-20,Prithvi skips practice with swollen foot,"Young opener Prithvi Shaw missed Thursday’s training session due to a swelling on his left foot, increasing Indian team management’s worries ahead of the second Test against New Zealand beginning on Saturday.

According to sources, Shaw will undergo a blood test on Thursday to ascertain the reason of the swelling.

In case the medical report is favourable, a call will be taken during Friday’s practice session on his availability for the second Test. If Shaw is not comfortable while batting, he will not make it to the playing XI.

Shubman Gill had a good net session on Thursday and it is expected that he would be asked to open the innings alongside Mayank Agarwal if Shaw is unable to make it.

During Thursday’s nets, head coach Ravi Shastri was seen paying extra attention to Gill’s session. At one point, Shastri walked up to Gill and was seen giving some technical inputs about footwork to Gill and what's required to check his uppish drives.

The Indian team management is hopeful that the swelling will not be a serious concern for Shaw.

The Mumbai opener didn't even take part in the customary warm-up session where players had a good time playing touch rugby.

155,28-2-20,Jaffer advises Indian batsmen to score big,"Wasim Jaffer, a domestic cricket giant, says unless the Indian batsmen build on their starts and put a big total on the board, bouncing back in the Test series against New Zealand will be extremely difficult.

“Virat has a lean patch for a while, so I am expecting him to come back stronger. Pujara needs some runs under his belt. Most importantly they need to convert their starts into three figures, if that dosen’t happen and if we don’t put score of 350-400 runs then it is difficult,” Jaffer told PTI.

“In 200-250 (runs) you can’t win a Test match unless there is much help from the pitch. When we bat first or bat second, we need to score 400-450 runs,” Jaffer said.

Jaffer also felt that the team getting bundled out for below 200 in the first Test was not beffiting of its number one rank in the longest format of the game.

“They kept our run-rate in check and kept our batsmen under pressure for long periods. I felt that in the first innings the conditions were favourable for bowlers, but they worked out an strategy of bouncers and we should have batted better in the second innings. To get out both times under 200 is unlike the number one Test team,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/jaffer-advises-indian-batsmen-to-score-big.html
156,28-2-20,Aggressive intent & clear mindset against pace will help us: Rahane,"Ajinkya Rahane wants to take on the New Zealand pace battery with more intent in the second Test and his foolproof strategy includes countering the awkward angles which became a nightmare for Indian batsmen during the first Test.

Rahane, who top-scored with 46 in the first innings of the opening Test, is hopeful that a turnaround will happen on a green top at the Hagley Oval, which he reckons will be better for batting compared to the one they got in Wellington.

“I am not saying (we have to be) more aggressive but having that intent and clear mindset will help us,” Rahane told reporters on Thursday.

New Zealand pacers Trent Boult, Tim Southee and Kyle Jamieson used the short ball liberally after coming wide of the crease with an angle that was disconcerting for the batsmen.

“I think they used that angle really well in Wellington. Bowling wide of the crease or from the centre, they changed angles while bowling the short balls. I think their plan was completely clear.

“As a batsman, if you going to think about a particular shot, then you need to back yourself and play that shot. You cannot doubt yourself. We need to forget what happened in Wellington,” the Indian vice-captain said.

According to Rahane, the two net sessions at the Hagley Oval is being used to practice negating the awkward angles that Neil Wagner and company can create.

“That’s what I said: try and learn what mistakes we did as a group, what can we learn. I think we have to practice those angles. We had a practice session and we have one more tomorrow. And you have to practice that and trust your ability in the middle,” Rahane said in a reassuring tone.

While net sessions are important, it’s the instincts in match situations that counts, he said.

“But to change or adjust those angles there are times you need to be instinctive while you are batting. It can mean standing on off-stump, or standing outside the crease or staying deep inside the crease - like if it is a pitch for cut shot then you can stand deeper in the crease. This is the mental side of the game,” Rahane said.

“For me, as a batsman it is important you show your intent to the bowler, if you stand in one spot then the bowler doesn’t need to change anything. These are small things we have been working on in practice and how to use the crease and the angles. Doesn’t matter how much you practice you must trust or have the belief to be able to do it in the middle,” he added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/aggressive-intent---clear-mindset-against-pace-will-help-us--rahane.html

""We call upon you and the constitutional office you hold, that the life, liberty and property of the citizens is preserved, secured and protected. You should immediately call for the removal of the home minister given the gross ineptitude, abdication of duty and his inability to contain the situation. We owe this to the citizens who have lost their loved ones, their homes and their livelihood and most of all their long cherished amity and brotherhood. We hope you will take decisive action on this matter,"" Sonia told the reporters outside Rashtrapati Bhavan after meeting the president.

He asserted that peace was restored in two days due to Shah's effective handling.

He accused Congress of instigating passions for violence and quoted Sonia and Priyanka Gandhi's comments on anti-CAA protests and also refereed to senior Congress leaders' visits to Shaheen Baag, the venue of 'dharna' against CAA for over 70-days.

The senior BJP leader also saw a pattern in Congress leaders' ""unwillingness"" to condemn controversial speeches of the likes of AIMIM leader Waris Pathan.

He said other political parties were silent on the attack on the policemen and on the death of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma. ""In such a situation, the duty of all political parties should be to consolidate peace,"" he said.

Taking on the AAP, which governs Delhi, Javadekar said that its MLAs should have worked for peace, but Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal identified riot victims by religion in the Assembly.

He alleged that attempts to instigate violence had been made for the last two months since Sonia Gandhi gave the call for 'fight to the finish' at a rally.

Javadekar said the BJP was working to restore peace and condemned the Congress, the AAP for doing politics over the violence that claimed 34 lives in northeast Delhi and left over 200 injured.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-accuses-cong--aap-of----politicising----riots.html

161,28-2-20,"Ministry rejects US Commission, Islamic body’s remarks","Taking exception to comments by a US Commission expressing grave concern over violence in Delhi and asking India to protect Muslims, New Delhi on Thursday termed such statements as ""irresponsible"" and said the remarks by the commission are ""factually inaccurate, misleading and an attempt to politicise the issue."" The external affairs ministry also hit out the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation which also expressed concern over Delhi violence.

The Indian reaction to the comments by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom(USCIRF) came a day after it expressed ""grave concern"" over the violence in Delhi and asked the Indian Government to provide protection to people irrespective of their faith.

US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and a number of other leading American lawmakers have also expressed concern over the clashes in several parts of Delhi in which at least 32 people have been killed.

""We have seen comments made by USCIRF, sections of the media and a few individuals regarding recent incidents of violence in Delhi. These are factually inaccurate and misleading, and appear to be aimed at politicising the issue,"" external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said here.

Though the ministry did not clarify the individuals being referred to, it is being seen as a reference to US lawmakers critical of India on the issue of the Delhi violence.

Kumar said law enforcement agencies are working on the ground to prevent violence and ensure restoration of confidence and normalcy. ""Senior representatives of the government have been involved in that process. The prime minister has publicly appealed for peace and brotherhood. We would urge that irresponsible comments are not made at this sensitive time,"" said Kumar.

The US Commission on Wednesday said in Washington ""the ongoing violence we are witnessing in Delhi and the reported attacks against Muslims, their homes and shops, and their houses of worship are greatly disturbing.""

""One of the essential duties of any responsible government is to provide protection and physical security for its citizens, regardless of faith,"" the USCIRF chair Tony Perkins said in a statement.

The Commission Commissioner Anurima Bhargava said the ""brutal and unchecked violence"" across Delhi cannot continue.

Meanwhile, the Hindu American Foundation (HAF) and the Indian-American Muslim Council (IAMC) issued statements condemning the violence.

In a related issue, India hit out at the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation for its statement on Delhi violence, saying the comments are factually inaccurate and misleading.

Making this point here, the external affairs ministry spokesperson also urged bodies like the OIC not to make irresponsible statements at this sensitive time.

""The statements which have come out of OIC are factually inaccurate, they are selective, they are misleading. There is an effort on the ground, to restore normalcy, to create confidence,"" Kumar said adding ""we urge these bodies not to indulge in irresponsible statements at this sensitive time.""

These assertions by India came after the OIC condemned the violence in Delhi and alleged discrimination against Muslims.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ministry-rejects-us-commission--islamic-body---s-remarks.html
162,28-2-20,HC judge transfer aimed at saving some BJP netas: Cong,"The Congress on Thursday alleged that the transfer of Delhi High Court Judge S Muralidhar was aimed at saving some BJP leaders in the Delhi violence case and exposed the Modi Government's ""intimidation and vendetta politics"" against the judiciary.

Congress said it seems those doing justice in country will now not be spared and the party alleged the government was ""waging a battle of revenge"" against the judiciary. Calling the transfer a classic case of ""hit-and-run injustice"" by the BJP Government, Congress chief spokesman Randeep Surjewala said the saffron party's ""politics of revenge"" has been exposed. He accused the BJP of attacking the impartiality of the judiciary.

Taking a dig at the government over Muralidhar's ""sudden"" transfer, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi also tweeted, ""Remembering the brave Judge Loya, who wasn't transferred."" Special CBI judge BH Loya, who was hearing the high-profile Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case, died in allegedly mysterious circumstances on December 1, 2014.

Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra hit out at the government over the transfer, saying the Centre's attempts to ""muzzle"" justice and ""break people's faith in an upright judiciary are deplorable"".

""The midnight transfer of Justice Muralidhar isn't shocking given the current dispensation, but it is certainly sad and shameful,"" Priyanka Gandhi tweeted.

""Millions of Indians have faith in a resilient and upright judiciary, the government's attempts to muzzle justice & break their faith are deplorable,"" the Congress general secretary said.

The notification of Justice Muralidhar's transfer to the Punjab and Haryana High Court came late Wednesday evening, on a day when a bench headed by him expressed ""anguish"" over Delhi Police's failure to register FIRs against alleged hate speeches by BJP leaders Parvesh Verma, Kapil Mishra and Anurag Thakur.

Responding to Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad accusations the opposition party was politicising a routine transfer, Surjewala hit back at Prasad, describing him as the ""most lawless minister"" this country has ever seen.

""Mr Prasad at the instance of Prime Minister Modi is hell-bent on destroying the independent institution of judiciary.

Perhaps it arises out of his malice and scant regard for the Constitution and the law. But it is not his actions.

He is only a protege who speaks on behalf of Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Shah,"" Surjewala said.

""The sudden and vindictive removal of the Delhi High Court Judge justice S Muralidhar hearing the case against BJP leaders has shocked the conscience of the entire nation. The intimidation and vendetta politics of the BJP against India's judiciary is now out in the open,"" Congress said at AICC press conference.

The party said the people want to ask three big questions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah -- were they scared that the role of their party colleagues in the violence and the ""entire conspiracy"" of Delhi riots would get exposed if a free and fair investigation was conducted.

""How many judges will you transfer to prevent justice being delivered fairly and efficiently?"" Surjewala said as he went on to ask his second question.

Surjewala said there were several past instances that ""expose"" the BJP's attack on the independence of the judiciary. ""Will PM Modi and his lawless law minister answer why Gopal Subramanium's appointment as the Supreme Court judge, cleared by the same collegium of the Supreme Court that he (Prasad) cites, was blocked forever by the Modi government,"" Surjewala said.

Surjewala also asked why the appointment of Justice K M Joseph on the decision of the collegium was blocked for months by the Law minister and the prime minister. He wondered whether it was because Justice Joseph quashed the ""illegal order"" of the Modi government in dismissing the Congress government in Uttarakhand.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/hc-judge-transfer-aimed-at-saving-some-bjp-netas--cong.html
163,28-2-20,CPM terms Muralidhar's transfer selective response to his court orders,"The CPI(M) on Thursday said Justice S Muralidhar's transfer from the Delhi High Court was a ""selective response"" to his court orders in which he rapped the city police for ""trying to shield"" BJP leaders who made ""hate speeches"".

The CPI(M) Polit Bureau in statement demanded the government to keep the transfer order, notified late Wednesday night, in abeyance to reinforce the confidence of the people in the judicial system.

Justice Muralidhar was transferred to the Punjab and Haryana High Court, on a day a bench headed by him expressed ""anguish"" over the Delhi Police's ""failure"" to register FIRs against the alleged hate speeches made by BJP leaders Parvesh Verma, Kapil Mishra and Anurag Thakur. The CPI (M) said in a statement that the transfer was recommended by the Supreme Court collegium, but it has been protested against by the Dei High Court Bar Association for well-argued judicial-administrative considerations.

""Post-haste implementation appears to be a selective response for what unfolded in the Delhi High Court yesterday. The fact remains that the Bench headed by Justice Muralidhar called the bluff of the

Delhi police in trying to shield the hate speeches of top BJP leaders in Delhi in the course of the Delhi assembly election and after.

Gas demand is expected to rise from 148 million standard cubic meters per day in 2018-19 to 250 mmscmd by FY25, Elara Securities said in a report.

The bulk of the incremental demand will come from city gas distribution (CGD) operations being rolled out in 400 districts. As much as 52 mmscmd of additional demand will come from retailing of CNG to automobiles and piped natural gas to industries and households, it said. Another 35 mmscmd is to come from the power sector and 15 mmscmd from fertilizer plants.

“Domestic gas demand is at an inflection point and we expect 66 per cent volume growth or 102 mmscmd over the next five years, given an environment of sustained weak LNG prices, owing to a global supply glut and muted demand from China, which has been aggravated by the coronavirus outbreak,” it said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/india---s-gas-demand-at-inflection-point--to-rise-by-66--in-5-yrs.html

“In August last year, IPPB had reached the landmark of 1 crore customers in just its first year of operations. The next 1 crore customers have been acquired and onboarded in just 5 months. On an average, IPPB has been opening/maintaining a run rate of 33 lakh accounts per quarter,” an official statement said.

With the launch of Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS) Services in September 2019, IPPB has now become the single largest platform in the country for providing inter-operable banking services to the customers of any bank, it said, adding that with AePS services any common person with a bank account linked to Aadhaar can perform basic banking services such as cash withdrawals and balance enquiry irrespective of the bank they hold their account with.

Prasad said that the success of IPPB’s business model underlines the government’s intent in creating an inter-operable banking infrastructure for the public good contributing toward changing the financial inclusion landscape in India.

“Since its launch, IPPB has enabled more than 1.36 lakh post offices and 1.9 lakh ‘dakiyas’ to provide a complete suite of banking services at the doorstep of the customer providing access to any Aadhaar linked bank account, leading to an increase in rural banking infrastructure by almost 2.5 times,” he added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/india-post-payments-bank-now-caters-to-2-crore-customers.html

“Eventually, we hope to have in India a simplified taxation structure, completely reduced rates of taxation, and therefore an easy-to-comply system. So as regards taxation we went in that route.

“Now, if you notice, as we are talking of removing or reducing the personal income tax, we removed the dividend Distribution Tax totally. So every time we are taking a step towards simplifying, we are removing that which is seen as a double taxation, or a regressive taxation,” Sitharaman said during an interaction with traders and industry representatives here on the Union Budget 2020-21.

The Finance Minister, who was accompanied by Finance Secretary Rajeev Kumar, DEA Secretary Atanu Chakraborty, Revenue Secretary A.B. Pandey and SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar, said it was a part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reform-mindedness when dealing with businesses.

“We are steadily but clearly moving towards less regressive system.”

Responding to queries from the businesspeople, she said it was also the government’s clear cut policy to remove elements which introduce the criminality angle to even a civil omission or commission as regards business laws.

“So I think even within the first six months of the present tenure, we have, in one or two Acts, very clearly diluted the criminality angle and in some cases clearly removed them also.

“Even as we speak, there is work going on to look at the Companies Act to see what are the provisions in which criminalisation is coming up and we are trying to remove them,” she said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-steadily-moving-towards-less-regressive-tax-system--sitharaman.html

175,28-2-20,Indian aviation sector outlook remains ‘negative’: Report,"The outlook for India’s aviation industry remains “negative” in the wake of coronavirus outbreak, which has resulted in many international passengers cancelling their travel to South East Asian countries, according to rating agency Icra. More than 81,000 people have been infected and over 2,700 people have died due to coronavirus. China is the epicentre of the virus outbreak.

Icra noted that the outbreak has impacted travel to and from China as well as other South East Asian countries. “The suspension of flights on the India-China sector will not result in any significant impact on the financial performance of the airlines, unless the lockout is prolonged, as the traffic on these routes account for only 0.9-1.3 per cent of the total international passenger numbers.” Icra said on Thursday.

However, the agency said the impact is expected to be severe if passengers from other South East Asian countries, hit by coronavirus, cancel their travel. Traffic from these countries account for around 19.5-23.8 per cent of the total international passengers flying to and from India, it noted. The extent of impact of the flight/ ticket cancellations on the profitability of the domestic airlines would, however, vary depending on the airlines’ presence in these routes. In a note, the agency said it has “maintained its negative outlook on the Indian aviation industry in view of the ongoing lockouts in parts of China following the outbreak of the coronavirus”.

Some airlines have already discontinued flights to China and Hong Kong until June 2020. Air India has temporarily stopped flying to China and Hong Kong till June 30. The airline has also reduced the number of flights to Singapore. Vistara has decided to cancel 54 flights to Singapore and Bangkok in March. GoAir has suspended its operations to Singapore and has also scaled down the number of flights operated to Phuket and Bangkok.

Among other carriers, Singapore Airlines has extended suspension of flights across its network, including India, till end of May. However, Icra said decline in jet fuel prices would partly compensate airlines’ loss of revenues due to flight cancellations. Crude oil prices have fallen in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, which has impacted many countries.

Icra said the medium-term impact on the domestic aviation industry would also depend on the economic shock to the global economy due to the coronavirus outbreak. Historically, foreign airlines have enjoyed high market share while domestic airlines account for less than 40 per cent of the total passengers carried on international routes to and from to India, Icra Vice President Kinjal Shah said.

“Assuming the same proportion on routes to and from China and other impacted South East Asian countries, the Indian aviation industry could see a maximum impact (of 19.5-23.8 per cent) on the international passenger traffic growth...,” she said. This impact would be there in case there is a complete suspension of flights to and from these countries, as they fly 4.5-5.5 million passengers, she added.

According to her, such a scenario would be negative for the Indian aviation industry, which is already reeling under significant passenger traffic slowdown, with the international traffic growth for up to December quarter of the fiscal having witnessed a decline of 8.4 per cent. As per Icra, prolonged shutdown of manufacturing activities in China and subsequent impact of the outbreak on the global economic activity could result in a slump in global oil demand.

“The jet fuel price has declined materially following the coronavirus outbreak in China. This was the sharpest decline in prices since Q4 CY2018,” Shah said. Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) Jet fuel accounts for around 40 per cent of an airline’s operational costs. A decline in the ATF price by USD 1 at the current level would have a positive impact of 0.5-0.7 per cent on the profit margins of the airlines. This would partly compensate their loss of revenues due to flight cancellations, Shah said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/indian-aviation-sector-outlook-remains----negative-----report.html

177,28-2-20,"Rs extends gains, climbs 4 paise to 71.61 against $","Extending gains for the third day, the rupee climbed 4 paise to close at 71.61 against the US dollar on Thursday amid easing crude oil prices and weakening of the greenback overseas.

Forex traders said the rupee consolidated in a narrow range as gains were restricted by sustained foreign fund outflows and robust selling in domestic equities.

Moreover, market participants will be keeping an eye on third quarter GDP growth number scheduled to be released on Friday.

At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local currency opened at 71.65 to the US dollar. During the day, it swung between a high of 71.55 and a low of 71.69.

""Rupee consolidated in a narrow range but traded with a slightly negative bias against the US dollar ahead of the preliminary GDP number that will be released from the US later this evening,"" said Gaurang Somaiyaa, Forex & Bullion Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Somaiyaa further noted that ""on the domestic front, growth number will be released tomorrow and weaker-than-expected number could keep the rupee under pressure"".

184,28-2-20,Parl will pick new PM: Mahathir,"Malaysia’s interim leader Mahathir Mohamad on Thursday said Parliament will pick a new prime minister next week following the collapse of the ruling alliance and that snap elections will be called if the vote ends in an impasse.

Mahathir, who met the king earlier on Thursday, said the monarch couldn’t find a candidate with a clear majority to lead the nation after consulting all 222 lawmakers over the last two days. As such, he said the king decided to have the lower house of Parliament vote on a new leader on March 2.

“If the lower house fails to find a person with the majority, then we will have to go for a snap election,” he told a news conference.

A failed bid by Mahathir’s supporters to form a new government without his designated successor, Anwar Ibrahim, and Mahathir’s shock resignation on Monday broke apart the ruling alliance less than two years after it defeated a corruption-tainted coalition that had led the country for 61 years.

Both Mahathir and Anwar are vying for the premiership, renewing a political feud that stretches back more than two decades.

“The king is obviously being very cautious. He decided not to give Anwar or Mahathir to form a government and let the MPs decide,” said James Chin, head of the Asia Institute at Australia’s University of Tasmania. “This means horse trading will carry on all weekend until Monday morning.”

Anwar was Mahathir’s deputy in the 1990s during Mahathir’s first stint as prime minister, but he was sacked following a power struggle and later jailed on sodomy and corruption charges that he said were trumped up.

Anwar led a reform movement that helped build a fledgling opposition but was jailed a second time for sodomy in 2014 in a move he said was aimed at killing his political career.

Mahathir, who retired in 2003 after 22 years in power, made a comeback in 2016, spurred by anger over a massive graft scandal involving a state investment fund.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/parl-will-pick-new-pm--mahathir.html

187,28-2-20,AGR-hit Voda Idea wants 7-8 times hike in mobile data tariffs,"Vodafone Idea has demanded fixing minimum tariffs for mobile data at Rs 35 per GB, around 7-8 times of current prices, and for calls at 6 paise per minute along with monthly charges from April 1 to enable it pay statutory dues and make its business sustainable.

The loss-making telco is under pressure to clear adjusted gross revenue dues of more than Rs 50,000 crore to comply with a Supreme Court order. The company has sought 18 years time to clear the dues, including a three-year moratorium on payment of interest and penalty, according to official sources.

“There are number of demands that Vodafone Idea has put across the government for its survival. The company wants minimum price of data should be fixed at Rs 35 per gigabyte and minimum monthly connection charge at Rs 50 from April 1, 2020. These are tough demands which is a problem for government to fulfil,” an official told PTI on the condition of anonymity. Current mobile internet prices are in the range of Rs 4-5 per GB. According to the source, Voda Idea wants minimum price of outgoing calls should be fixed at 6 paise per minute.

The demand to raise call and internet rates from Vodafone Idea comes within three months of company raising prices by up to 50 per cent.

“According to the company, increase in mobile call and data rates will help it generate revenue to the same level as Vodafone and Idea individually generated in 2015-16. The company has said that it will

take three years to get to that level after tariff hike hence it has sought three-year moratorium for payment of AGR dues,” the source said.

A Vodafone Idea spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.

188,28-2-20,COAI rings alarm bells,"Industry body COAI has sent out a distress signal to the government seeking easier terms for payment of statutory dues by telcos, including extension of loans at lower rates to cover AGR liabilities, as also fast implementation of floor prices, to rescue the troubled sector.

With the telecom industry plunging into a deep, unprecedented crisis, the association has raised an alarm over banks’ unwillingness to take any risk with regard to the sector, and asserted the “need to give a clear message to banks that government is there to support the sector”.

“Banks are currently unwilling to take any risk with respect to the telecom sector and are constantly asking telecom service providers to reduce their exposures by refusing to issue new bank guarantees or even to renew bank guarantees,” COAI Director General, Rajan Mathews said in a letter to Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash.

Cellular Operators’ Association of India (COAI) has also said that the requirement of financial bank guarantees for securing licence fee payments should be done away with. In case Telecom Department is of the view that financial bank guarantees are needed, the same should be reduced to one quarter of licence fee, as per the industry body. COAI also sought an immediate cut in licence fee levy to three per cent from 8 per cent and reduction in spectrum usage charges.

Citing India’s low average revenue per user compared to markets like China, Brazil and Russia, it further said data prices in India are a fraction of those in markets like the US, China, Germany, France and others.

“Therefore, floor pricing is imperative to ensure the sector is sustainable and in a position to bear the deferred spectrum and adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, while continuing to invest in world class networks,” COAI said.

COAI’s letter, dated February 26, came even as Vodafone Idea has reportedly made it clear to the government that it won’t be able to pay court-mandated AGR dues in entirety, unless a bailout is extended immediately.

In all, 15 telecom entities owe the Government Rs 1.47 lakh crore in unpaid statutory dues — Rs 92,642 crore in unpaid licence fee and another Rs 55,054 crore in outstanding spectrum usage charges.

Of the estimated dues that include interest and penalty for late payments, Airtel and Vodafone Idea account for about 60 per cent.

These dues arose after the Supreme Court, in October last year, upheld the government’s position on including revenue from non-core businesses in calculating the annual AGR of telecom companies, a share of which is paid as licence and spectrum fee to the exchequer. The Supreme Court, earlier this month, rejected a plea by mobile carriers such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea for extension in the payment schedule and asked companies to deposit their past dues for spectrum and licences.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coai-rings-alarm-bells-2020-02-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/coai-rings-alarm-bells.html

Pradhan and Suzuki met Patnaik to discuss development of a steel cluster in the state.

""Japanese investments and technology flow into Odisha will strengthen the steel sector, generate large scale employment and create win-win situation for all stakeholders,"" said Pradhan.

More than 75 per cent of India's envisioned incremental steel capacity will come from eastern India with Odisha alone crossing 100 MTPA, he said, adding that there is immense scope for growth in high grade steel, downstream sector, ancillaries, capital goods and cluster development.

""Japanese technological expertise and investments will further strengthen the steel sector in Odisha and drive socio-economic growth,"" he said.

In this context, he proposed Japanese investment in the sectors such as automobiles, food processing, chemicals and petro-chemicals.

He also made an offer for an exclusive Japan Industrial cluster and township near Bhubaneswar for which the state government would provide all the necessary facilitation.

198,28-2-20,"We read & handle situations better now, says Taniya","Wicket-keeper batswoman Taniya Bhatia says the Indian team has got better at reading and handling different situations, which was evident during the recent tri-series in Australia.

India on Thursday became the first team to seal a semifinal spot at the T20 World Cup following a narrow four-run win over New Zealand here.

“In the last 12 to 14 months, we have improved a lot as a unit. We’re in a really positive position. We’ve been playing well ever since the tri-series. I think we’ve got a lot better as a team in working out how to handle and read situations well,” Bhatia said at the post-match press conference.

“The results are in our favour, but we need to keep up the momentum. If we do that, we will do well and hopefully we can win the final,” Bhatia added.

Bhatia is optimistic that their batters will definitely come good in the remaining matches of the tournament.

“We’re playing well, it’s just one or two odd games where our batters failed to perform. Shafali is giving us a good start and the rest of us batters will take up responsibility,” she said.

Bhatia said she is open to bat at any position for the team's cause.

“I can bat well up the order and I know I’m capable of scoring runs there,” she said.

India will play Sri Lanka in their last Group A game on Saturday.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/we-read---handle-situations-better-now--says-taniya.html
199,28-2-20,three in a row,"India entered the semifinals of the women’s T20 World Cup after Shafali Verma’s 34-ball 46 followed by a superlative performance from the bowlers helped the team notch up a narrow four-run win over New Zealand here on Thursday.

Invited to bat, India posted a below-par 133 for eight in the group A match with Shafali top-scoring with a 34-ball 46 and Taniya Bhatia chipping in with a 25-ball 23.

They, however, produced a disciplined performance with the ball to restrict New Zealand to 129 for six and register their third successive win in the tournament and seal a last-four spot.

With this win, India topped Group A, having beaten Australia and Bangladesh in their last two outing.

“It is a great feeling when your team is performing like that,” India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur said after the match.

“We did the same mistakes, we got a good start in the first 10 overs and we didn’t carry the momentum. We did bowl well in patches and some times, we were not up to the mark and have to focus on those areas,” she added.

Defending a below-par total, India introduced spin straight away but Deepti Sharma bled 12 runs with opener Rachel Priest (12) hitting her for two boundaries.

But experienced pacer Shikha Pandey removed Priest in the next over when she had her caught at mid wicket.

With Shikha and left-arm spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad bowling in tandem, New Zealand played with caution to reach 28 for one.

Back into the attack, Deepti then cleaned up Bates with a beauty of a delivery as New Zealand slipped to 30 for two.

Poonam Yadav and Radha Yadav then mounted the pressure on the Kiwis and soon the Black Caps were 34 for 3 when the former dismissed skipper Sophie Devine (14).

Maddy Green (24) and Katey Martin (25) then tried to resurrect the innings with a 36-ball 43-run stand.

However, Gayakwad returned to remove Green, who danced down the pitch only to end up with an outside edge as Bhatia did the rest.

Radha then dismissed Martin to leave New Zealand at 90 for 5 in 16.3 overs.

Needing 44 off 21 balls, Kerr (34) blasted four boundaries to accumulate 18 runs in the penultimate over bowled by Poonam to bring the equation down to 16 off six balls.

In the final over, Heyley Jensen (11) and Kerr cracked a four each but Shikha held her nerves in the end to ensure India’s win.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/three-in-a-row.html

204,28-2-20,Trump faces credibility test as he plays down virus threat,"President Donald Trump faces a critical personal challenge in grappling with the new coronavirus outbreak: asking Americans to believe him after he and some of his top advisers have contradicted federal scientists in playing down the threat.

Keenly aware of the stakes not just for public health but also his credibility, Trump conducted a lengthy press conference Wednesday evening aimed at reassuring everyone that he has the crisis well in hand.

Trump surrounded himself with his administration’s top health experts. And he encouraged Americans to be prepared for the virus’ potential spread.

But he continued to minimize the risk, saying the outbreak “may get a little bigger; it may not get bigger at all.” And he continued to distance himself from the stated opinion of public health officials that it’s inevitable the virus will spread within the United States.

As businesses, schools and people in general think about preparing, the X-factor may be an unpredictable president who has clashed repeatedly with scientists in his own administration and tends to see any crisis through the lens of his own reelection chances.

“I don’t think it’s inevitable,” Trump said at the news conference, where he announced Vice President Mike Pence would lead the administration’s response to the outbreak. “I think it has a chance that it could get worse. There is a chance you can get fairly substantially worse. But nothing’s inevitable.” He also said he had recently learned that thousands die from the flu each year, contrasting that to the coronavirus.

After two days of the stock market tumbling, Trump took to Twitter Wednesday morning to blame the media and Democrats for causing undue alarm and harming American financial markets.

He singled out MSNBC and CNN for “doing everything possible to make the Caronavirus look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible,” and added that “incompetent Do Nothing Democrat comrades are all talk, no action.”

He blamed part of this week’s stock market slide on people’s reaction to Tuesday night’s Democratic debate and the possibility one of those candidates might replace him. And Trump acknowledged that the outbreak could “have an impact on GDP” but insisted that the U.S. Economy is still “doing great.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump-faces-credibility-test-as-he-plays-down-virus-threat.html
205,28-2-20,Pioneering change,"The Pioneer group is expanding its umbrella of connecting with thinking minds through live talks. Called The Pioneer Agenda series, we hope to generate awareness on ideas that will shape India in 2030 and could be a template for policy-making. The first such dialogue, Exotica Tourism Summit, Exotica being the group's travel and wellness magazine, was held at Shangri-La hotel, New Delhi on February 26. Since tourism is poised to become a major growth driver and employment generator of the economy, the day-long event had interactive sessions with Union Ministers, industry experts, travel operators, tourism boards, the hospitality sector and brand creators

How to rebrand an old concept and link it to the discovery of new destinations, given the Government’s intent to develop 17 iconic tourist destinations? How to get domestic travellers to look for exotica within, given the Prime Minister’s call to travel to at least 15 destinations at home? How to develop a hub and spoke model where the hinterland of known tourist spots can be developed as a linked experience? These were some of the questions that were answered by panellists Ashwani Lohani, Ritu Beri, Pronab Sarkar and Anil Chadha at the inaugural session of the Exotica Tourism Summit. Moderated by Dr Chandan Mitra, it explored the possibilities of a deep-pore look within.

Unveiling another of his films in the Virtual Bharat series, filmmaker Bharat Bala said that the familiar corners of India evoked different emotions when looked at through the eyes of its people. His film on the shabad singers of Amritsar was an interesting perspective of the holy town. Highlighting the need for “felt emotion” to convey a refreshing idea of Incredible India, he said, “It’s very critical to showcase what we are doing and how we can build a new idea for tourism in this country. A place is not a destination, it’s an emotion, a story and a culture. You tell a story, you will find the traveller. When domestic or international tourists travel and hear a story, they become a part of that destination. Almost 20 years ago, I started Incredible India, all thanks to Amitabh Kant. It’s time to discover the new avatar of Incredible India. It has done a wonderful job of showcasing the diversity of this country but today’s marketing and advertising needs are different. We need to move on from typical advertising and find new ways to reach the audience. We talk about 5,000 years of heritage, at least we can make 1,000 stories out of them. I have travelled 150 km by road, discovering India. And what I discover, I put into films. In September, we started the new initiative called Virtual Bharat. It is going to be a repository of virtual stories of India. To start with, we decided to do 1,000 stories of the country. Deeper stories will connect deeper with the audience and they will have something to take home as emotion. When we talk about culture, it is something you need to win over as an emotion. When people look at India, they see the Taj Mahal because they find it as an embodiment of a great love story. We are a 5,000 year old country, we don’t need to hide only behind Taj Mahal. There’s a lot more to showcase.”

Ashwani Lohani, Ex CMD, Air India, felt that there is always scope for exploration and rebranding India. “Nobody can ever beat the impact of tourism in the country. It is the biggest job creator and also sways the image of the country. A few years back, whenever somebody used to talk about tourism of India, it was always about international market and footfalls. Yet the numbers were not encouraging. The fact is you cannot make tourism a growth driver till you cater to a domestic market. When I got a chance to head Madhya Pradesh tourism, I decided to generate new interest in its diversity.”

Lohani shared that people have a fair idea about the places abroad but they are not aware about the rich culture they have at home. He said, “We need to start exploring our own country. Indian tourism has something on offer for everyone in every category with all budgets — India on shoestring, India in luxury, the royal India, urban India, the common man’s India, historical India and much more. Why not circulate the funds in our own country for the good of our own people? There is a need to catalyse a movement of people within the states. Tourism is a sector which has a massive potential to grow. And I feel we are moving towards that.”

Luxury entrepreneur and fashion designer Ritu Beri believes in the idea of India. She understands the value of being Indian. She tries to promote the country in everything that she does. “My first fashion show in Paris was based on Indian heritage. From culture, designs, motifs to fabrics and embroidery, everything was Indian. I presented the collection in Hindi, it had French translations and the music was Indian too. People absolutely loved it. The country is very well accepted abroad,” Ritu said.

“If I go anywhere in the world wearing Pashmina, people go crazy. Khadi, I feel, is true luxury because it’s handmade and today, more and more people are forgetting the art of handcrafted things. That is why it’s our strength and we need to promote it. So when we talk about tourism of India, it’s the whole concept of being Indian. I have a 12-year-old daughter. I am always telling her that India used to be the richest country in the world in recorded history. Our country is very proud of many inventions. From zero, yoga, geometry, snakes and ladders to chess, it all comes from India. So why are we not proud of being Indian or taking a holiday here? Why are we always aping the West. Why are we apologetic of what we stand for. From the Taj Mahal to Rabindra Nath Tagore to Mahatma Gandhi, we have a prolific history,” she added.

Ritu said that we are all empowered today to present an India that is richly felt and authentic. An India that we don’t even think can exist. “Platforms like these are very important for first, us Indians, to accept the fact that we are above the rest of the world. And then to spread the message abroad. I know we can do it together,” said she.

Anil Chadha, COO, ITC Hotels, said that in colleges they always teach you a few lines — if it is to be, it is up to me. Somebody has rightly said that the three biggest drivers in this century are going to be tele communications, information technology and tourism. “India has had a good story so far. Our growth rates have been better than the world. A lot has been done by the government. However, there is still a lot to be done because the numbers coming in are much less in comparison to the numbers going out. One big thing that we all have been speaking about is domestic tourism. I feel, we should take pride in our own country. Domestic tourism is something that has the capability to catch the eyeballs of the world market. That’s probably the way to move the international tourism forward,” said Chadha.

He felt that if we compared ourselves to certain benchmarks available with reference to footfalls, India was at one per cent, China was at three per cent for their domestic tourism and the US was at six per cent. “That is exactly where we probably need to reach. And it has to be a collaborative effort. It has to be a great partnership between the Centre and the states, private players and the government. Everybody has to put their best foot forward,” he says.

As a hotel chain, for example, Chadha said that they had the honour of hosting the US President, Donald Trump. The hotel was full of Americans. They got to see motifs of India that the hotel sports in its decor. “They saw all the artworks and wanted to know what went into their creation. So there’s a lot of storytelling that needs to be done. The travellers are looking for experiences more than anything. And we need to create that for them. They want to really get enriched at the destination they travel, in the hotel they live, in the food they eat, the clothes they wear, the mode of transport they use, it’s all getting experiential day by day,” said Chadha.

The president of Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO), Pronab Sarkar, has been in this industry for last 45 years. He felt that the government plays a bigger role in the promotion of tourism because they are the ones framing guidelines and all the taxes. “We also have to include the state government. It is not possible without their help. India is blessed with domestic tourism with more than 180 million tourists. We get only 10 million foreign tourists in comparison, which is very low. As far as the world scenario is concerned, it is less than 0.5 per cent. We don’t even get one per cent of international tourism. Therefore, there is a huge scope,” he said.

Though some of our neighbours are smaller and have a finite infrastructure, they have had higher international footfalls. “It is very important to state that we are losing out to our neighbours because of the highest taxes. I feel, tourism is not a luxury. It is an economic activity, which is very important. Domestically, we have to be very well connected. Our people must have easy access to reach where they desire. Everybody has to come together and make it happen,” said Sarkar.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pioneering-change-2020-02-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/pioneering-change.html

“You will find that the beautiful smiles of the state seem to weave a poetry. That’s the magic of Punjab. It casts a spell and the rich heritage takes everyone by awe. The spiritual ardor will bring inner peace and every stone in every wall has a tale to tell,” he told us.

Taking pride in being a Punjabi, Ahluwalia focussed on the Kartarpur corridor and the benefits it has brought along. “When people celebrated 550 years of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, almost 60,000 people have visited Sultanpur Lodhi. The government handled the pilgrims in such a way that there was no mishap.

207,28-2-20,Punjab is the heart of India: Charanjit,"Stars, light, mountains, trees, river....everything is yours in Punjab. So said Punjabi poet Lala Dhani Ram Chatrik. At the Exotica Tourism Summit organised by The Pioneer media group, Tourism Minister of Punjab, Charanjit Singh Channi, recited this poem and made people aware about everything that Punjab has on offer. “We have always had a very rich culture. Nowadays, even the Punjabi music and dance industry is making waves. No film is successful without its music and dance. We have the heart of India. Whether it’s the independence movement or any other fight for the nation, Punjab has always been in the front,” said he.

There have been many reasons everyone has been in love with Punjab, which is why the state government is making efforts to promote tourism in the state. The farmers are not only involved in agriculture but also are now setting up homestays by building cottages in their farms. Coupling farming with tourism is the growing trend in the state.

He apprised us of the fact that Virasat-e-Khalsa in Anandpur Sahib has the largest footfall in Asia. The state has also developed wetlands. It has large number of birds coming from outside. Efforts are being made to upgrade the farmhouses so that people can stay and see Punjab’s culture. They can interact with the local musicians and potters.

“We are trying to tap the tourists from everywhere. There’s also a great connectivity, which will in turn help people from all across to visit us. The rail connectivity is good. We are developing the State highways for a better road connectivity. Five airports have been developed to garner more visitors.”

Rahat Indori, lyricist and Urdu poet once said, “Chalte Phirte Huye Mehtaab Dikhayenge Tumhe, Humse Milna Kabhi Punja Dikhayenge tumhe...” The minister said that this poem sums up Punjab very well. In the state, one would feel home. “I invite all of you with a big heart. Come and witness the beauty of the state,” he added.

He also expressed his gratitude for The Pioneer for dedicating a day to promote tourism.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/punjab-is-the-heart-of-india--charanjit-2020-02-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/punjab-is-the-heart-of-india--charanjit.html
208,28-2-20,Disperse the crowds,"The tourism industry needs to set standards, increase awareness among the visitors, diversify and integrate communities to combat over-tourism

Hours long traffic jam in hill stations, hotels displaying “full” in red on their gates, internet flooded with pictures of people forming a beeline for water and residents left with no adequate resources due to over-tourism. All these incidents have become common, especially during the summer as the temperatures goes up and more and more visitors head towards the hill stations. Now the question here is: where do we draw the line and where do we divert the travel addict without denting the tourism economy?

To ponder upon the issue and come up with various solutions across the industry, Mandip Singh Soin, Sumant Batra and Seema Bhatt spoke on Over-tourism and Sustainability at Exotica Tourism Summit organised by The Pioneer media group. It was moderated by Saimi Sattar.

A mountaineer, explorer and environmentalist, Mandip Singh Soin began the session talking about the potential of eco-tourism and the need to reflect upon responsible tourism. “We will soon ask the government to launch an itirenary for responsible tourism. There will be various checkpoints that the travellers will need to look at before embarking on a journey. It will also include checklist for the travel operators of the industry,” said he.

Another panelist, Sumant Batra, an insolvency lawyer and founder of Te Aroha, shared the instances which helped him set up his property in Uttarakhand. He said, “This place was not much discovered earlier. We started with five rooms and now have 22.” It has an unusual but appealing way to attract the visitors through storytelling. It has a museum and houses a library of 12,000 books. This new experiential helped draw tourists to a new Himalayan experience and ease the pressure off usual favourites.

Sitting next to him, Seema Bhatt who has worked extensively on issues related to eco-tourism, biodiversity and climate change emphasised upon carrying capacity, setting industry standards and striking a balance between sustainability and livelihood. “There is over-tourism because there are too many people visiting a certain location only. It is very important for us to see the figures of a particular location, set standards and put a limit on the number of people visiting,” said she.

She talked about the factors that determine the carrying capacity of a region. When its an ecologically fragile area like Ladakh, it depends on its eco-system. It requires detailed involved research such as the revenue generation of the area, population, number of tourists visiting, water consumption, waste disposal and many other factors.

But in order to keep the number of tourists intact, it is very important to route them to a different location. So we need to diversify tourism. “As we are operating in a country, which has the largest number of youth, we need to move beyond the old definition of tourism of just visiting places and focus more upon the experiences,” added she.

However, every solution comes with its own challenges. Mandip said that the people usually don’t take ecological challenges into account during the beginning. For instance, the number of jeeps in Ladakh increased from four to 450 after people watched the film 3 idiots. “When we suggest people on the carrying capacity they say ‘we have just started, we need people.’ And they only react to it when it gets worse. But you need to consider this problem during the beginning in order to disperse the people in a better way,” said he.

While building a property in a local area, it is very important to strike a balance between the local people, the area and tourists. Sumant said that he was very clear about not destroying the apple orchards to build the rooms. “I also decided that I would hire only the local people. But most of them hadn’t stepped out of their homes. So I called an expert from Mumbai who trained the locals for six months. They are very quick learners. Now they are all well-trained, some of them can also read wine labels,” he added.

The emphasis is to aid the local eco-system and ensure that the tourists do not impact the local people adversely. There are literature, art and film festivals to boost the local culture and attract more visitors.

For Seema, it is important to hire the local people, not just as labours but build their capacity too. “One must train and empower them. The local cuisine is a strong tool in their hands, one must use that wisely,” she added.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/disperse-the-crowds-2020-02-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/disperse-the-crowds.html
209,28-2-20,Korea ask NRAI to clarify position on coronavirus,"The national shooting federation of South Korea, one of the global hotbeds of the deadly novel coronavirus, has asked its Indian counterpart to make its position clear on whether athletes from the East Asian country would be allowed at next month’s ISSF World Cup here.

In a letter to National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) President Raninder Singh, Korea Shooting Federation Secretary General Yongjae Lee has said that shooters are keen to participate in the event from March 15 to 26.

“Currently, most of the Korean athletes are wishing to acquire Minimum Qualification Standard at the ISSF World Cup — New Delhi. However, there is a great deal of concern and worries among athletes and officials that they might not be able to participate,” Lee said.

“Kindly state your position regarding COVID-19,” he added.

210,28-2-20,SC holds as illegal lawyers' strike on every Saturday in 3 Uttarakhand districts,"The Supreme Court on Friday held as illegal the strike called by lawyers on every Saturday for the past 35 years in three district courts of Uttarakhand.

A bench headed by justices Arun Mishra and M R Shah said the strike called by lawyers on flimsy grounds is tantamount to contempt.

The court issued notices to the Bar Council of India and state Bar Council seeking their response.

In its September 25, 2019 verdict, the high court had referred to the 266th report of the Law Commission, which had analysed data on loss of working days on account of strikes by lawyers and had opined that it affects functioning of courts and contributes to the mounting pendency of cases.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-holds-as-illegal-lawyers--strike-on-every-saturday-in-3-uttarakhand-districts-2020-02-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sc-holds-as-illegal-lawyers--strike-on-every-saturday-in-3-uttarakhand-districts.html

217,28-2-20,Rangers break Europe’s knockout duck,"Steven Gerrard hailed a “faultless” Rangers performance as an impressive 1-0 victory at Braga on Wednesday booked their place in the last 16 of the Europa League, winning 4-2 on aggregate.

Gerrard has been critical of his side in recent weeks as they have fallen 12 points behind Celtic at the top of the Scottish Premiership.

But the former Liverpool captain was bursting with pride as Ryan Kent scored the only goal just after the hour mark in northern Portugal and the visitors should have scored many more.

“Super proud of the players. To a man tonight they were outstanding. I thought they were faultless, certainly out of possession,” said Gerrard.

“This is no fluke. This has come from sheer hard graft.”

Rangers were without top scorer Alfredo Morelos through suspension and the absence of the Colombian could have proved costly as they missed a host of big chances before the break.

Kent has been criticised for his lack of impact when Rangers have most needed their £7 million signing most of late.

However, the former Liverpool winger produced a big goal when he had too much pace for the Braga defence to latch onto a long ball before firing low into the far corner.

Rangers’ first win in a European knockout tie for nine years means they will be in the hat for the last-16 draw today.

“We knew there was an opportunity,” added Gerrard. “We need to enjoy tonight. We’ll be really proud when the draw is made.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/rangers-break-europe---s-knockout-duck.html
218,28-2-20,Eight minute collapse,"City score twice before Ramos sees Red in awful night for record champions

Kevin De Bruyne orchestrated a dramatic Manchester City comeback on Wednesday as they stunned Real Madrid 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu to put one foot in the Champions League quarter-finals.

Madrid looked on course to edge a cagey contest after Isco’s smart finish early in the second half, but De Bruyne teed up Gabriel Jesus in the 78th minute and then tucked away a penalty five minutes later.

A pulsating finish saw Sergio Ramos sent off for preventing Jesus from going clear and Madrid’s captain will now be banned for the second leg at the Etihad Stadium on March 17.

City’s two away goals will make them heavy favourites to go through, even if manager Pep Guardiola was quick to discourage complacency.

“It’s still not over,” he said. “If there is one team that can overcome this it is this club (Real Madrid) with their experience and their history.”

“We know the situation,” said Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane. “We have to go there and win.”

Madrid have now won only one of their last five games, with the Clasico against Barcelona in La Liga to come on Sunday.

“We are on a bad run but we have to get ourselves out of it,” said Zidane. “Sunday is a chance to change.”

Strikers on bench

Guardiola sprung a surprise by picking De Bruyne up front and leaving Raheem Sterling, Sergio Aguero and Fernandinho all on the bench.

“We played without a proper striker because of the way they defend,” said Guardiola.

“They are so aggressive down the middle and when that happens you have to make the pitch wide.”

His gamble paid off handsomely, even if Nicolas Otamendi made the mistake that led to Isco’s opener while an injury to Aymeric Laporte meant Fernandinho had to be introduced midway through the first half.

Laporte must now be doubtful for Sunday’s League Cup final against Aston Villa.

Ramos red

City enjoyed their best spell after the break. Casemiro carelessly conceded possession and De Bruyne tore away, feeding Mahrez, who cut in and curled wide. Jesus drove another shot at Courtois.

Zidane considered a change and Gareth Bale was warming up when Madrid took the lead. Otamendi failed to control a Rodri pass and Vinicius broke, with Kyle Walker and Fernandinho rushing to meet him.

They left Isco free behind them and Vinicius picked him out, giving the Spaniard a simple finish.

The hosts smelt an opportunity for a second as Dani Carvajal weaved through and Ramos’s volley was deflected over by Fernandino.

Bale came on for Madrid and Sterling for City. Shortly after, De Bruyne’s clipped cross was too high for Ramos at the back post and Jesus’s header beat a weak right hand from Courtois to equalise.

Five minutes later, City completed the turnaround when Carvajal slid in late on Sterling and De Bruyne made no mistake from the spot.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/eight-minute-collapse-2020-02-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/eight-minute-collapse.html
219,28-2-20,Women's T20 WC: India look to iron out batting woes against SL in final group game,"A semifinal berth secured, the unbeaten Indian women's cricket team would look to address some of its batting issues in the final Group A match against a deflated Sri Lanka in the ICC T20 World Cup here on Saturday.

The Indians are on a roll, having easily sealed their semifinal berth with wins over defending champions Australia, Bangladesh and New Zealand. The Lankans, on the other hand, are out of the semifinal race following two losses so far.

While India beat hosts Australia by 17 runs in the tournament opener, they defeated Bangladesh by 18 runs before eking out a narrow four-run victory over the White Ferns on Thursday.

And come Saturday, the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side would look to end its group engagements on a high when it takes on the islanders.

But the Indians definitely have a few things to worry about, especially their below-par show with the bat, going into the business end of the tournament.

In all the previous three outings, India failed to put on big scores on the board. They managed just 132 runs against Australia, 142 against Bangladesh and 133 vs New Zealand.

India's unpredictable middle-order has repeatedly squandered good starts to eventually settle for low scores.

In all the three matches, the bowling unit came to India's rescue and the bailed the side out.

Heavily reliant on the brilliance of a 16-year-old Shafali Verma, the Indian middle-order has cut a sorry figure so far and it's time senior pros like Harmanpreet and Veda Krishnamurthy step up and take the responsibility.

Opener Smriti Mandhana too has failed to join the party so far.

Verma has been impressive at the top registering scores of 29, 39 and 46 for a total of 114 from three games. But it's high time she converts the starts into big scores.

Skipper Harmanpreet has rued the inability of her batters to capitalise on good starts and cautioned them against making ""silly mistakes"" in the knock-out rounds.

""It's a great feeling when your team performs day in day out. Still we made the same mistakes after a good first 10 overs, we got a good start but couldn't carry the momentum,"" Kaur had said.

""We can't make silly mistakes with harder games coming up. Shafali (Verma) is giving us good starts, her initial runs are crucial for us,"" she added.

The Indian bowling, however, has been phenomenal in the tournament so far and played a vital role in their smooth entry into the last-four round.

Leg-spinner Poonam Yadav has been the star performer for India, picking up eight wickets so far, including match-winning effort of 4 for 19 against Australia.

She has been complimented well by the likes of Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Deepti Sharma and pacer Shikha Pandey.

Young Shafali was adjudged the player of the match for scoring a 34-ball 46 and the 16-year-old was elated with her performance.

""Feeling good, very happy with the performance, want to continue doing this. I waited for the loose balls and converted those,"" said Shafali.

Teams (from):

India: Harmanpreet Kaur (Captain), Taniya Bhatia, Harleen Deol, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Richa Ghosh, Veda Krishnamurthy, Smriti Mandhana, Shikha Pandey, Poonam Yadav, Arundhati Reddy, Jemimah Rodrigues, Shafali Verma, Deepti Sharma, Pooja Vastrakar, Radha Yadav.

Top seed Nadal eased into the semi-finals with his best performance of the week as he continues to jackhammer his way through the men's singles draw at the hardcourt event in Acapulco, Mexico.

The Spaniard finished the night with 25 winners to 11 unforced errors, and saved all eight break points he faced.

""The match has been much tougher than what the result said. I think it was a beautiful match to see,"" Nadal said.

""It was a good match against a tough opponent. I think he's going to have a very good tennis career."" Next up for Nadal is Grigor Dimitrov, who ousted third seed Stan Wawrinka 6-4, 6-4 earlier in the day.

Nadal boosted his record to 18-2 overall at this event by winning in straight sets over Kwon, who kept the games close but didn't have much to show for it in the final scoreline.

Dimitrov, 28, improved to 7-4 this season and is through to his first semi-final of the year.

The Bulgarian will need to end another losing skid if he wants to reach the final in Acapulco because Nadal leads their career meetings by a whopping 12-1.

""Dimitrov finished last year much better than how he had played the rest of that year. He started to play some good tennis and is showing it here, winning some very good matches,"" Nadal said.

The BJP's remarks came a day after the Congress leaders, led by Sonia Gandhi, met President Ram Nath Kovind and submitted a memorandum demanding resignation of Union Home Minister Amit Shah for ""abdication of duty"" during the communal violence in northeast Delhi. She had also reminded the Centre for its 'rajdharma' and protecting the people from all faiths in the country.

Addressing a press conference at the party office, BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said Shah was very proactive from the very first day of the violence to stop it.

Asked about controversial remarks made by the BJP leaders like Kapil Mishra and Pravesh Verma, Prasad said the party doesn't approve such statements.

""Sonia Gandhi, please don't preach us 'rajdharma'; your record is full of twists and turns,"" Prasad said, while adding that NPR was started by the Congress-led regime.

""If Congress does something, it is good. But if we do the same thing, they provoke the people. What type of rajdharma is this?"" he asked.

Referring to the Congress chief's remarks of ""fight to finish"" at a rally in Ramlila Maidan last year, Prasad asked whether such remarks do not constitute provocation.

The Union minister alleged that the Congress could stoop to any level for ""vote-bank"" politics, adding that it should act responsibly for maintaining peace and harmony in country.

He accused the Congress of changing its stand on granting citizenship to persecuted minorities in the neighbouring countries.

225,28-2-20,Govt shirks raj dharma: Opp; Cong stoked riots: Javadekar,"Sonia-led delegation calls on Prez, seeks Shah’s resignation

After fire and smoke, gun shots and shouts for help in the riot-hit North-east Delhi gave way to an eerie silence, an all-out political war erupted over the violence on Thursday. While the Congress charged Home Minister Amit Shah of with “abdication of duty”, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar accused top Congress leaders of making inflammatory speeches to provoke communal violence.

The NCP alleging that “Gujarat model” has been replicated in Delhi, and called for Shah’s resignation. Left parties wrote to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal assuring him of their help in efforts to bring peace and communal harmony and blamed the Centre for its ineffective Delhi Police.

Sonia-led a delegation of Congress leaders to President Ram Nath Kovind, called for the resignation of Amit Shah and reminded the Centre of its “raj dharma”.

Questioning Shah’s role, Sonia asked where he was as the violence spread across north-east Delhi. “What was he preoccupied with since last Sunday that he was unable, apparently, to give his attention to these grave events? For that matter, the Delhi Chief Minister, and the newly elected Delhi Government were also completely missing from the scene.

“There was clearly a shocking and, in this day and age, unpardonable failure of intelligence agencies leading up to these heart-breaking events. Was there any information provided which could have helped prevent escalation of violence or was it not acted upon by the Home Ministry?” she asked.

The delegation included former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Ahmed Patel, P Chidambaram, KC Venugopal, Mallikarjuna Kharge, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Anand Sharma, AK Antony, Kumari Selja and Randeep Surjewala.

The BJP hit back, accused the Congress and the AAP of “politicising” the riots in the national Capital and claimed that attempts to instigate violence had been made for two months after the Congress president gave the call for ‘aar yaa par’ (fight to the finish) in December last year.

Addressing a Press conference at the party office, Javadekar asked why other political parties were silent on the attack on the policemen and on the death of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma. “In such a situation, the duty of all political parties should be to consolidate peace,” he said.

Taking on the AAP which governs Delhi, Javadekar said that its MLAs should have worked for peace, but Kejriwal identified riot victims by religion in the Assembly. He alleged that attempts to instigate violence had been made for the last two months since Sonia Gandhi gave the call for ‘fight to the finish’ at a rally.

Javadekar said the BJP was working to restore peace and condemned the Congress and the AAP for doing politics over the violence that claimed 34 lives in north-east Delhi and left over 200 injured. He asserted that peace was restored in two days due to Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s effective handling. He said the Congress’s demand for Shah’s resignation was “petty politics.”

Manmohan Singh, in his remarks to the media, said the Congress leaders conveyed to the president that what had happened in the last four days in the national Capital was a matter of deep concern and national shame.

Rahul also said it was a “shameful indictment” of the Central Government, the Home Ministry and the Home Minister himself, that the Delhi High Court had to step in (on Wednesday).

Brinda Karat, Member, Politburo of the CPI(M) said her party has started a house to house campaign with an appeal to shun violence. “We request you (Arvind Kejriwal) to urgently convene an all-party meeting in Delhi to decide how we can unitedly ensure communal harmony and peace in the Capital,” said Karat.

Maharashtra Minister and NCP national spokesperson Nawab Malik also demanded a probe into whether the Home Minister could not handle the situation in the national Capital or he had allegedly given instructions to the police to not respond quickly to the situation. He also pitched for resignation of another Union Minister, Anurag Thakur, and Delhi BJP leader Kapil Mishra for allegedly making provocative speeches.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/govt-shirks-raj-dharma--opp--cong-stoked-riots--javadekar-2020-02-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/govt-shirks-raj-dharma--opp--cong-stoked-riots--javadekar.html
226,28-2-20,Slugfest over judge’s transfer,"Opp cries foul; Govt says rule followed after SC Collegium recommended transfer on Feb 12

The Government’s decision to shift Delhi High Court judge Justice S Muralidhar, hours after he slammed the police for not registering a case against three BJP leaders for their alleged hate speeches, has triggered a major row.

While the Congress said the “midnight” notification was “shameful”, the Centre accused the Opposition party of politicising a “routine” shift on the February 12 recommendation of the Supreme Court collegium.

The Opposition has flagged “timing” of the decision as its main concern and also reminded the Centre that it sat on Supreme Court’s collegium recommendation for months when it did not suit its interests.

The Union Law Ministry on Wednesday issued three separate notifications for the transfer of Justice Muralidhar and two other judges — Justice Ranjit Vasantrao More of the Bombay High Court and Justice Ravi Vijay Kumar Malimath of the Karnataka High Court. Justice Muralidhar was transferred to the Punjab & Haryana High Court.

The notifications said President Ram Nath Kovind approved the transfers after consulting the Chief Justice of India.

The Supreme Court Collegium, in a meeting on February 12, had recommended transfer of Justice Muralidhar to Punjab and Haryana High Court.

Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Justice Muralidhar was transferred on the recommendation of the Supreme Court Collegium and accused the Opposition party of politicising a routine transfer.

He added that a “well-settled process” was followed in the transfer.

At the BJP party briefing, senior leader and Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said the transfer was in line with the recommendation of the Collegium. The recommendation was made on February 12.

The Congress alleged that the transfer of Justice Muralidhar was aimed at saving some BJP leaders in the Delhi violence case and exposed the Government’s “intimidation and vendetta politics” against the judiciary.

Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra accused the Government of making attempts to “muzzle” justice and “break people’s faith in an upright judiciary”.

“The midnight transfer of Justice Muralidhar isn’t shocking given the current dispensation, but it is certainly sad and shameful,” she tweeted.

Taking a dig at the Government over what he called Muralidhar’s sudden transfer, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Remembering the brave Judge Loya, who wasn’t transferred.”

Special CBI judge BH Loya, who was hearing the high-profile Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case, died in alleged mysterious circumstances on December 1, 2014.

At a Press conference on the issue of Justice Muralidhar’s transfer, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged that the BJP Government was “waging a battle of revenge” against the judiciary. He called the transfer a classic case of “hit-and-run injustice” by the Government.

The judge who reminded the Government of its ‘raj dharma’ and initiated and directed action against the BJP leaders making inflammatory statements was transferred overnight from the Delhi High Court, he said.

Hitting back at the Congress over the allegations, Law Minister Prasad said, “By politicising a routine transfer, the Congress has yet again displayed its scant regard for the judiciary.”

“Transfer of Hon’ble Justice Muralidhar was done pursuant to the recommendation dated February 12 of the Supreme Court collegium headed by Chief Justice of India,” Prasad said in a series of tweets.

Referring to a tweet by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on the death of Judge Loya, the Union Minister said the Loya judgment had been well-settled by the Supreme Court.

Meanwhile, the Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms (CJAR) said the transfer has nothing to do with “public interest” and everything to do with “punishing” an honest and courageous judicial officer for simply carrying out his constitutional duties.

CJAR said it knows that Justice Muralidhar’s transfer was recommended by the Supreme Court Collegium on February 12 but the rushed manner in which the notification has been issued by the Union Government cannot be ignored.

The fact that the notification for Justice Muralidhar’s transfer was issued in the evening after he held the Delhi Police and the Central Government accountable for the Delhi riots tells the true nature of his transfer, the CJAR claimed.

CJAR claimed that judges have been given reasonable time in transfer orders, but Justice Muralidhar’s was with immediate effect. This highlights the “punitive nature” of this move, it said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/slugfest-over-judge---s-transfer-2020-02-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/slugfest-over-judge---s-transfer.html
227,28-2-20,"CBSE Class X, XII exams on Feb 28, 29 in NE Delhi cancelled","The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has postponed Class X and XII examinations scheduled for February 28 and 29 in the violence-hit North-east Delhi and parts of East Delhi, officials said.

The exam postponement announcement by the CBSE came for the third time this week due to communal violence in North-east Delhi over the amended citizenship law which has claimed 38 lives.

“In view of a request received from the Delhi Government and to avoid inconvenience to students, staff and parents, the exams scheduled for February 28 and 29 in North-east Delhi and other affected areas stand cancelled. The next date for the affected students will be notified shortly,” CBSE Secretary Anurag Tripathi said.

“All exams in all centres across Delhi will be conducted as per original schedule from March 2 onwards,” he said.

The board announced that it will conduct fresh exams for students who have not been able to appear for the papers in other parts of the national capital due to the violence.

It has also sought details of the students who failed to appear for exams due to the prevailing situation in the city.

“We have asked school principals to send the details to regional offices concerned of the CBSE of all such students of class 10, 12 who have missed out on the exams so far in Delhi, due to these difficult conditions. To reduce the stress on students, the board will conduct fresh exams for them. The next date of exam for the affected students will be notified shortly,” he said.

“The board has maintained regular contact with the principals of all schools, especially in the affected areas, and it has been brought to the notice that some students residing in the affected areas have not been able to appear in exams outside the affected areas due to the situation prevailing in the city,” Tripathi added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/cbse-class-x--xii-exams-on-feb-28--29-in-ne-delhi-cancelled.html
228,28-2-20,"India temporarily suspends visa on arrival for Japanese, S Korean nationals amid coronavirus fears","India has temporarily suspended visa on arrival services for nationals of Japan and South Korea in view of the surge in the number of coronavirus cases in the two countries, the Indian embassy here said on Friday.

The development comes a day after India evacuated 119 Indians and 5 foreigners who were on board the coronavirus-hit cruise ship, Diamond Princess, moored off the Japanese coast.

Out of the 3,711 people on board the ship, over 700 people tested positive for the disease. Elsewhere in the country, over 160 people have been found to be infected with the disease.

With COVID-19 cases surpassing 2,000, South Korea has become the biggest cluster to have the infections outside China. A total of 13 people have died of the virus in the country.

According to an AFP report, more than 90 per cent of the new cases were in Daegu city, the epicentre of the outbreak in South Korea, and the neighbouring North Gyeongsang province.

""In view of the recent outbreak of COVID-19, VISA ON ARRIVAL which was available only for nationals of Japan and South Korea has been temporarily suspended,"" the Indian embassy tweeted.

""Regular visas continue to be processed and may be applied for,"" it said.

Earlier, India had on February 2 suspended e-visa facility for Chinese travellers and foreigners residing in China following surge in the number of COVID-19 cases in the country.

Further tightening the visa rules, India on February 4 cancelled the existing visas for Chinese and foreigners who had visited the country in the last two weeks.

The novel coronavirus emerged in early December and traced to a market in Hubei's capital Wuhan that sold wild animals.

229,28-2-20,"People who eat less fruit, vegetable more prone to anxiety","People who have low fruit and vegetable intakes have a higher likelihood of being diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, say researchers.

The study, published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, found that those who consumed less than three sources of fruits and vegetables daily, there was at least at 24 per cent higher odds of anxiety disorder diagnosis.

""This may also partly explain the findings associated with body composition measures. As levels of total body fat increased beyond 36 per cent, the likelihood of anxiety disorder was increased by more than 70 per cent,"" said co-author Jose Mora-Almanza, a Mitacs Globalink Intern who worked with the study at Kwantlen Polytechnic University in Canada.

According to the researchers, increased body fat may be linked to greater inflammation. Emerging research suggests that some anxiety disorders can be linked to inflammation.

""Our findings are in keeping with previous research which has also indicated that women are more vulnerable to anxiety disorders than men,"" said study co-author Karen Kobayashi.

The study team analysed data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging which included 26,991 men and women between the ages of 45 and 85. Other factors associated with anxiety disorders among mid-age and older Canadians

In addition to diet and body composition measures, the prevalence of anxiety disorders also differed by gender, marital status, income, immigrant status and several health issues.

One in nine women had an anxiety disorder compared to one in fifteen men, the study said.

The prevalence of anxiety disorders among those who had always been single (13.9 per cent) was much higher than among those who were living with a partner (7.8 per cent).

Approximately one in five respondents with household incomes under $20,000 per year had anxiety disorders, more than double the prevalence of their richer peers.

""We were not surprised to find that those in poverty had such a high prevalence of anxiety disorders; struggling to afford basics such as food and housing causes relentless stress and is inherently anxiety inducing,"" said study co-author Hongmei Tong, Assistant Professor at MacEwan University in Canada.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/people-who-eat-less-fruit--vegetable-more-prone-to-anxiety-2020-02-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/people-who-eat-less-fruit--vegetable-more-prone-to-anxiety.html
230,28-2-20,Facebook nixes developers conference due to coronavirus,"Facebook on Thursday cancelled its annual F8 developers conference, the biggest annual event for the US tech giant, over fears about the possible spread of the novel coronavirus.

The gathering in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose -- which had been set for early May -- typically draws thousands of software makers from around the world who collaborate with the tech giant on its platform.

""In light of the growing concerns around COVID-19, we've made the difficult decision to cancel the in-person component of F8 this year, in order to prioritise the health and safety of our developer partners, employees and everyone who helps put F8 on,"" Facebook said.

Face-to-face interaction at the conference center in San Jose will be replaced with presentations streamed online.

F8 sessions and demonstrations usually span its ""family"" of offerings including the main social network, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and virtual reality unit Oculus.

""This was a tough call to make -- F8 is an incredibly important event for Facebook and it's one of our favourite ways to celebrate all of you from around the world,"" director of platform partnerships Konstantinos Papamiltiadis said in a message to developers.

""We explored other ways to keep the in-person part of F8, but it's important to us to host an inclusive event and it didn't feel right to have F8 without our international developers in attendance.""

The World Health Organisation declared Thursday that the new coronavirus epidemic was at a ""decisive point"" as countries across the globe battled to contain the deadly outbreak.

Alarm is growing as China is no longer the only breeding ground for COVID-19, with other countries including South Korea and Italy becoming hotbeds of infection, raising fears of a pandemic.

The virus has already killed more than 2,700 people, mostly in China -- where it first emerged in December -- and infected more than 81,000 in over 45 countries.

US public health officials confirmed a coronavirus case in Northern California, the first of unknown origin out of about 60 cases, and have told Americans to be ready to cancel mass gatherings and work from home.

The epidemic has prompted warnings of a financial impact from tech giants including Apple and Microsoft.

Both Facebook and Microsoft said Thursday they were withdrawing from the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco set for March.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/facebook-nixes-developers-conference-due-to-coronavirus-2020-02-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/facebook-nixes-developers-conference-due-to-coronavirus.html
231,28-2-20,Experts question delayed action as death toll in China's coronavirus climbs to over 2780,"Forty four more people have died of the novel coronavirus in China, taking the death toll in the outbreak to 2,788, Chinese health officials said on Friday, amid growing criticism from experts and the public that the epidemic would have been less severe if the authorities acted when the first confirmed case was reported in December.

Among the deaths reported on Thursday, 41 were from the epicentre Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, two in Beijing and one in Xinjiang, the National Health Commission said in its daily report.

A total of 44 new deaths and 327 confirmed cases were reported on Thursday from all over China, far lower than the earlier days, it said.

The overall confirmed cases in the mainland have reached 78,824 by the end of Thursday. In all, 2,788 people have died of the disease so far, it said.

As virulence of the disease slowed, criticism of Chinese officials' attempts to hide the outbreak in its early stage was highlighted by the official media on Thursday in a rare public criticism of the system of secrecy in governance.

The outbreak first surfaced in December last year until it became severe by middle of January, becoming a full-fledged epidemic causing massive devastation in the country, a report highlighting the shortcomings was published by the state-run Global Times on Thursday.

While China's massive response in trying to localise the virus to Hubei province with strong measure like locking over 18 cities including Wuhan with over 50 million people came for praise from the World Health Organisation (WHO), criticism is also growing at home over why it was not nipped in the bud.

The situation should have been better if the control measures were taken earlier Zhong Nanshan, said a leading epidemiologist who was also among those in the expert groups dispatched by the central government to the epicentre Wuhan.

Under the scanner is China's famous top down approach under the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) with little power to local officials.

Several top-down authorities, constantly shifting blame on each other for mishandling the outbreak earlier, have now been engulfed in a public opinion crisis, with people calling for an improved decision-making process in the country's healthcare system, the media report said.

Zhong said three major coronavirus-related epidemics in the 21st century - SARS, MERS and COVID-19 - had offered a lesson that countries should act quickly to prevent them from spreading further.

""The epidemic would have been much less severe if we took strict control measures in early December, even early January,"" Zhong said told the media on Thursday.

""We estimated that numbers of patients would surge to more than 100,000 if we took measures [such as city lockdown] after January 25,"" he said.

Missing the window of opportunity has become a major regret amid the COVID-19 outbreak not only for the veteran medical adviser, but also for many frontline doctors and officials inside the central and regional centres for disease control and prevention (CDC), the report said.

A more timely response to the outbreak as soon as the virus had been detected would have led to a different outcome, given the highly contagious disease has caused more than 78,824 infections nationwide and death of 2,788 in China.

""We have to take immediate action as soon as we detect the virus. This is a lesson we must learn,"" Zhong said.

In China, the CDC system is just a ""technical department"" with limited standing when he mentioned the shortcomings exposed amid the outbreak, he noted, adding that the CDC should be given more authority and its importance should be further highlighted.

It is urgent to figure out how the CDC could play a bigger role in public health matters or have ""a bigger say"" in alerting the Chinese people about potential epidemic risks and sending out warnings instead of only focusing on doing research or publishing papers in medical journals.

After the SARS outbreak from 2002 to 2003 that caused over 5,000 infections and killed 349 nationwide, China set up a top-down direct reporting system on infectious diseases and critical public health events, with reportedly USD 104 million, with the aim of reporting and examining any epidemic quickly after receiving information about the confirmed and suspected patients at hospitals.

But it appears to have failed in raising alarm about coronavirus.

The first confirmed case of then ""unknown pneumonia"" occurred on December 8 in Wuhan. The first result of a pathogen sample, collected from a 65-year-old male, proved that the ""unknown pneumonia"" discovered in the city was caused by a coronavirus, which is 80 per cent similar to the SARS virus, the Global Times report said.

Shortly after, Li Wenliang, a local doctor in Wuhan considered the ""whistle-blower"" of the looming crisis, shared the information about the ""SARS-like coronavirus"" found in Wuhan hospitals on social media, which became the first warning from the healthcare system to the public in a non-official capacity.

Li who was silenced by local police with a stern warning not to spread rumours died of the virus, becoming the 10th medical staffer killed in combating the virus. Officials said over 3000 medical staff have been infected with the virus.

From the first confirmed case in Wuhan to the official warning about human-to-human transmissions of COVID-19, it took over a month before vigorous measures were adopted, the daily's report said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/experts-question-delayed-action-as-death-toll-in-china-s-coronavirus-climbs-to-over-2780-2020-02-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/experts-question-delayed-action-as-death-toll-in-china-s-coronavirus-climbs-to-over-2780.html

Most shops were closed with their shutters bearing marks of the violence that it had witnessed over the last few days and people chose to stay indoors. Some of the residents in Chand Bagh and Jaffrabad were seen on Thursday cleaning the roads which were littered with stones and sticks.

On Thursday, the Delhi Police transferred the riots probe to the Crime Branch and formed two Special Investigation Teams (SITs). “The situation in the North-east is normal right now and no untoward incident has been reported today.

238,28-2-20,"38 deaths so far, 250 severely injured","Scene in hospitals distressing, many wait for post-mortem

The death toll in the North-east Delhi communal riots reached 38 on Thursday with over 250 severely injured receiving treatment, said senior officials.

“Over 215 riot victims have been brought to our hospital and treated since February 24. However, at present only 51 patients are admitted. The condition of almost all patients, except one, is stable,” said Sunil Kumar, GTB Hospital Medical Superintendent.

People injured over anti-CAA violence are being treated in three hospitals — GTB, LNJP, and Jag Pravesh Chand hospital. According to hospital authorities, 34 deaths have been reported from GTB, and three from LNJP, and one from Jag Pravesh Chand hospital.

GTB Hospital authorities said most of the people were brought with very serious injuries. “At least 25 patients were brought dead and nine succumbed to injuries. Many of them were critically injured with their skulls smashed and beaten “brutally” by kind of an iron rod,” a senior doctor of GTB hospital said.

Family members were seen running from pillar to post, enquiring about their loved ones from hospital authorities. Some of them claimed that neither police nor the hospital authorities are telling them exactly when the post-mortem will be conducted.

Kehkasha Begum, a resident of Maujpur, said her husband got injured when he was coming back to home after work.

“Many people suddenly surfaced in our area and started destroying properties. We were frightened after witnessing such a horror in our surroundings. My husband was beaten mercilessly and had a serious head injury. I request to all to stop it now. People from all the community are suffering,” she said.

Amit Gupta, 24, a resident of Mustafabad started crying while explaining the horror he faced. “No one slept peacefully that night after two groups went on rampage. We kept calling all our relatives and friends and asked them to stay inside. My one of the friends is admitted after sustaining head injury. He went outside that day and never returned back. I accompanied his parents here. Doctors are saying his condition is stable,” he said.

Relatives, including the mother of 22-year-old Shahbaz (25), who has been missing since February 25, are waiting anxiously outside the mortuary at GTB Hospital since morning to know if their son is even alive.

“Around 2 pm, he had gone to Karawal Nagar for treatment. He had suffered injury in his eyes while he was doing some welding work. When I called him around 3 pm, his phone was found to be switched off,” his inconsolable mother said.

Shahbaz and his family live in Loni and worked in a welding shop in the area. A relative said they have been going from one hospital to another since February 25 to know his whereabouts. “We have been here since morning and still we haven’t received any information about Shahbaz,” she said.

Thirty-five-year-old Musharraf’s family has been at the mortuary in GTB for the last two days.

“I have been narrating the stories of what happened with my husband to everyone out here but no one is telling us when the post-mortem will be finally conducted,” his wife said.

239,28-2-20,Assange's UK extradition hearing paused until May,"A British judge on Thursday paused Julian Assange's extradition hearing following four days of intense legal wrangling over Washington's request for the WikiLeaks founder to stand trial there on espionage charges.

Judge Vanessa Baraitser, who will ultimately rule on the controversial case, ordered the legal teams for the 48-year-old Australian and the US government to reconvene for brief case management hearings in March and April.

The full extradition hearing is then set to resume for three weeks in mid-May, when witnesses will be called and cross-examined, with an eventual ruling expected by August at the latest.

The judge refused a request Thursday by Assange's lawyers to let him sit with his defence team, and not in the secure glass-walled dock area of the courtroom, when the hearing resumes.

The one-time hacker has repeatedly stood up and interrupted this week's proceedings to complain about being unable to hear the arguments or confer confidentially with his lawyers.

""I'm not able to guide them,"" Assange said Thursday, in his latest courtroom outburst -- which Baraitser has repeatedly advised him against making.

Arguing the current set-up could impinge on Assange's right to a fair hearing, defence lawyer Mark Summers invited the judge to ""permit him confidential, discreet access to his lawyers"" by letting him sit alongside them.

""Someone can be in custody in this room without being in that glass cabin,"" he said.

But Baraitser refused the application, arguing various ""sensible, proportionate measures"" -- such as Assange passing notes to his team and requesting regular breaks -- would ensure he could participate.

""It's quite apparent to me... That you've had no difficulty at all attracting the attention of your legal team,"" she said.

Assange faces charges under the US Espionage Act for the 2010 release of a trove of secret files detailing aspects of US military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as a single computer hacking charge.

He spent much of the past decade holed up in Ecuador's London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden to face allegations of rape and sexual assault -- since dropped -- that he and his supporters argue were politically motivated.

His extradition hearing inside Woolwich Crown Court, next to the high-security Belmarsh prison where Assange is being held, began on Monday.

Making the US government case, lawyer James Lewis accused the WikiLeaks founder of risking the lives of intelligence sources by publishing the classified US government documents.

He also detailed the US claims that Assange helped US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to steal the documents before recklessly releasing them.

In response, lawyers for Assange argued the charges were ""political"", and that his extradition would violate international law and numerous treaties.

They also accused the United States of ""boldly and blatantly"" misstating facts about his conduct, calling some of their claims ""lies, lies and more lies"".

A ruling against Assange could see him jailed for 175 years if convicted on all 17 US Espionage Act charges and the hacking count.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/assange-s-uk-extradition-hearing-paused-until-may-2020-02-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/assange-s-uk-extradition-hearing-paused-until-may.html

242,28-2-20,How can your claim on 'Mr India' be more than mine: Javed Akhtar to Shekhar Kapu,"Wading into the ongoing tussle over the reboot of cult classic ""Mr India"", veteran lyricist-writer Javed Akhtar on Friday said director Shekhar Kapur can't ignore his work as the writer by solely taking the credit for the film.

The announcement that ""Mr India"" will be remade in the form of a trilogy, to be directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, hasn't gone down well with the makers of the original.

Last week, actor Sonam Kapoor Ahuja had said it was ""disrespectful"" that the architects of the the 1987 blockbuster -- director Kapur and her father, actor Anil Kapoor -- hadn't been consulted for the remake. Kapur had also expressed his displeasure over the project.

The film, written by Salim Khan and Akhtar, featured Anil Kapoor as Mr India and late Sridevi as a journalist, with veteran actor Amrish Puri playing the iconic villain Mogambo.

Further criticising the new trilogy, Kapur on Thursday wondered how can a director's creative rights over his film be overlooked.

""The argument on a remake of #MrIndia is not that no one took permission from me or even bothered to tell me. The question is. If you are remaking a feature film, based on a director's very successful work, does the director have no creative rights over what he/she created?""

To this, Akhtar replied that he had contributed immensely to the making of the film, the credit of which doesn't completely belong to Kapur.

""Shekhar saheb the story, the situations, the scenes, the characters, the dialogue, the lyrics, even the title, none of these were yours. I gave it all to you. Yes you execute it very well but how can your claim on the film be more than mine. It wasn't your idea. It wasn't your dream,"" the writer tweeted on Friday.

243,28-2-20,SRK should make DDLJ2: Gauri on Trump mentioning film in speech,"Superstar Shah Rukh Khan should make a sequel of his 1995 blockbuster ""Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge"", his wife Gauri Khan feels.

Gauri's contention came in the wake of US President Donald Trump mentioning DDLJ in his speech while addressing the packed crowd at Motera Stadium in Ahmedabad on his recent India visit. He spoke of DDLJ as one of the 'classic films' that the Indian film industry has given to the world, leaving SRK fans in a frenzy.

Asked how it feels when one of the most influential leaders in the world acknowledges her husband's film, Gauri said with a grin: ""May be he (Shah Rukh Khan) should make part two of DDLJ. That's the next plan and I think he will do that. I am going to tell (DDLJ director-producer) Aditya Chopra to make part two, so every president and prime minister who enters India should discuss that.""

Gauri, who is a successful interior designer, then revealed a secret about SRK. The Bollywood superstar could be an architect if he had not joined films, she revealed.

""He does not get impressed by me but he himself loves design. I always say that if he was not an actor, he would be an architect -- 100 per cent! He loves designs and follows designs. He loves modern and contemporary design. I recently designed a table and he gave me full marks. I got an A-plus, so that was big win for me. I was super-excited because he knows what good design is, not because it's me. He would reject if I didn't deliver on time. I recently designed his room in my house and he loved it, so that's a big win for me and I am quite excited about it,"" said Gauri.

Does SRK give her suggestions on interior designing? ""Now, he should stop working in movies and start designing projects!"" Gauri replied with a laugh, adding: ""May be one day that will happen, but not yet.""

244,28-2-20,Facebook sues data analytics firm for harvesting users' data,"Stung by the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook has filed a federal lawsuit in California court against New Jersey-based data analytics firm OneAudience for secretly harvesting its users' data.

According to the lawsuit, OneAudience improperly accessed and collected user data from Facebook and other social media companies by paying App developers to install a malicious Software Development Kit (SDK) in their apps.

""After a user installed one of these apps on their device, the malicious SDK enabled OneAudience to collect information about the user from their device and their Facebook, Google, or Twitter accounts, in instances where the user logged into the app using those accounts,"" read the lawsuit.

Security researchers first flagged OneAudience's behaviour to Facebook as part of its data abuse bounty programme.

Facebook, and other affected companies, then took enforcement measures against OneAudience.

""Facebook's measures included disabling apps, sending the company a cease and desist letter, and requesting their participation in an audit, as required by our policies. OneAudience declined to cooperate,"" said Jessica Romero, Director of Platform Enforcement and Litigation.

""This is the latest in our efforts to protect people and increase accountability of those who abuse the technology industry and users,"" she added.

In November last year, Facebook and Twitter admitted that data of hundreds of users was improperly accessed by some third-party apps on Google Play Store as they logged into those apps.

Security researchers discovered that the One Audience and Mobiburn software development kits (SDK) provided access to users' data, including email addresses, usernames, and recent tweets, on both the platforms.

Twitter and Facebook said they will notify those whose information was likely shared through apps.

Facebook has sued several third-party platforms in the recent past for scrapping users' data, including Israeli surveillance vendor NSO Group that sells malicious software Pegasus to government agencies.

""Through these lawsuits, we will continue sending a message to people trying to abuse our services that Facebook is serious about enforcing our policies, including requiring developers to cooperate with us during an investigation, and advance the state of the law when it comes to data misuse and privacy,"" said the company.

247,28-2-20,Trump's trip demonstrates value US places on ties with India: Pompeo,"President Donald Trump's just-concluded maiden official visit to India demonstrates the value Washington places on its ties with New Delhi, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said, underlining the shared interests and traditions that unite the world's two biggest democracies.

President Trump and his family visited India from February 24 to 25 at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Trump was accompanied by top brass of his administration, including National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien.

During his stay, the US President addressed a massive rally in Ahmedabad along with Modi, visited Agra and held official meetings in New Delhi.

Trump described the US' relationship with India now as ""extraordinary"" and said a lot of progress was made in the bilateral ties during his maiden official visit to the ""incredible country"".

Trump's ""first official trip to India this week demonstrates the value the US places on the US-India partnership,"" Pompeo said in a tweet on Thursday.

""Democratic traditions unite us, shared interests bond us, and under the President's leadership our partnership has and will only grow stronger,"" Pompeo said as he re-tweeted the White House post with Trump's remarks.

""As we deepen our partnership with India, we remember that our two countries have always been united by shared traditions of democracy and constitutions that protect freedom, individual rights, and the rule of law,"" Trump said in the White House post that also had four pictures of his meetings with Prime Minister Modi.

In a series of tweets, Acting Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Alice G Wells said that excellent progress was made during the presidential visit to India.

""Excellent progress made this week in US India partnership,"" she said.

Trump's trip to India advanced the shared goals and paved the way for further cooperation in key areas such as energy, defence, people-to-people ties and Indo-Pacific coordination, Wells said.

""We made great strides to advance US-India energy partnership, including taking steps to develop India's strategic petroleum"" and providing USD 600 million in US International Development Finance Corporation investment to develop solar and wind energy, she added.

""We look forward to continued engagement with our great American suppliers of energy products, including"" Westing House Nuclear and ""our Indian partners for big deals that will power US-India relationship into the new decade and beyond. Private sector partnerships make our economies stronger"", Wells said.

As the president announced, the US concluded over USD 3 billions in defence sales to provide America's finest military helicopters to the Indian armed forces.

""We're proud to be India's premier defense partner. Together, we defend our sovereignty and protect a free and open Indo Pacific region for both our peoples,"" Wells said.

People-to-people ties between the two countries were stronger than ever, she asserted.

""Our Congressional representatives and Parliamentarians will hold an exchange visit for 1st time ever in April. We're working together to support human spaceflight and eager to welcome more Indian higher ed students to the US,"" Wells said.

The US president was feted at the world's largest cricket stadium in the ""Namaste Trump"" event in Ahmedabad and was cheered by tens of thousands of people.

""We were treated very, very well and we really enjoyed it. A lot of tremendous progress was made in terms of relationship -- our relationship with India is extraordinary right now,"" Trump said.

248,28-2-20,33 Turkish soldiers killed in Syria's Idlib,"At least 33 Turkish soldiers were killed as violence escalates in Syria's Idlib province after an air strike blamed on Damascus, with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg condemning ""indiscriminate"" attacks by the Assad regime and Russia.

Dozens more soldiers were injured and taken to Turkey for treatment, Rahmi Dogan, governor of Turkish Hatay -- bordering Syria -- said Friday.

The heavy losses in northwestern Idlib come after weeks of growing tensions between rebel supporter Ankara and Damascus ally Moscow.

Stoltenberg ""urged all parties to de-escalate this dangerous situation and avoid further worsening of the horrendous humanitarian situation in the region"", his spokesman said Friday.

In a phone call with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, the NATO secretary general ""condemned the continued indiscriminate air strikes by the Syrian regime and its backer Russia in Idlib province"", according to the spokesman.

Turkey has urged the Syrian regime to withdraw from Turkish observation posts in Idlib, while Moscow has accused Ankara of aiding ""terrorists"" in Syria.

Under a 2018 deal with Russia meant to bring calm to Idlib, Turkey has 12 observation posts in the region -- but several have come under fire from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hastily convened an emergency meeting in Ankara after the Idlib attack.

Erdogan's top press aide, Fahrettin Altun, said Turkey's military retaliated against all known positions of the regime after the air strike.

In a statement, Altun called on the international community to fulfil its responsibilities to end the violence in Idlib and the regime's ""crimes against humanity"".

The latest attack means 53 Turkish security personnel have been killed in the province this month.

There was a flurry of diplomatic activity as Turkey's presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin spoke with US national security advisor, Robert O'Brien, state news agency Anadolu reported without giving detail.

Jihadists and Turkish-backed rebels on Thursday re-entered Saraqeb, a key Idlib crossroads town they had lost earlier in February, reversing one of the main gains of the government's devastating offensive.

The counteroffensive could, however, be short-lived as Russian-backed Syrian troops continued to chip away at other parts of the rebel bastion, capturing 20 localities.

Seven civilians, including three children, were killed in regime and Russian bombardment of Idlib, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, adding to more than 400 such deaths since December.

The UN Security Council, where Moscow has systematically vetoed truce initiatives, met again Thursday amid growing concern Idlib is witnessing the nine-year-old war's worst humanitarian emergency.

State news agency SANA acknowledged there were ""fierce clashes"" between the army and ""terrorist groups on the Saraqeb front"".

An AFP correspondent accompanied the rebels into Saraqeb, where he found a ghost town of bombed out buildings.

The counterattack temporarily reverses one of the key gains of the government since its offensive against the country's last rebel enclave in December.

The cash-strapped government had been keen to fully secure the M5, a highway that connects Syria's four main cities and passes through Saraqeb.

The Syrian Observatory said the air strikes were carried out by Assad government ally Russia, heavily criticised by the West for the high civilian death toll from its bombing campaign.

State media accused the ""terrorists"" of launching car bombings and other suicide attacks against government forces attempting to retake the town.

It said the army had inflicted heavy losses on the attackers, despite the military support it said they had received from Turkey.

Some 950,0000 civilians have fled the government offensive, raising fears in Ankara of a new influx of refugees.

Turkey already hosts the world's largest number of Syrian refugees -- around 3.6 million people -- placing an increasingly unpopular burden on public services.

The country's ruling party spokesman Omer Celik told CNN Turk broadcaster Friday Ankara was not in a position to ""hold"" refugees any longer and called on the European Union to do more.

More than half a million of those displaced since December are children, tens of thousands of whom are sleeping rough in northern Syria's harsh winter.

The Turkish president vowed Wednesday Ankara would not take the ""smallest step back"" in the standoff with Damascus and Moscow over Idlib.

Erdogan warned the Syrian government to ""stop its attacks as soon as possible"" and to pull back by the end of the month.

The UN has repeatedly warned the fighting in Idlib could potentially create the most serious humanitarian crisis since the civil war's start in 2011.

Nine out of 15 members of the Security Council on Wednesday urged Secretary General Antonio Guterres to step up his involvement in efforts to restore peace in Idlib.

More than 90 per cent of the new cases were in Daegu -- the city at the epicentre of the outbreak in South Korea -- and the neighbouring North Gyeongsang province, it added, with no further deaths keeping the toll at 13.

South Korea's total is expected to increase further after checks began on more than 2,10,000 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a secretive entity often accused of being a cult that is linked to around half of the country's cases.

Guterres has expressed sadness over the casualties following the protests in Delhi, and called for maximum restraint and for violence to be avoided, the UN chief's spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Thursday.

""The Secretary-General has been following the situation in India and... Concerning the violence closely and is saddened by the reports of deaths that we've seen over the past few days in New Delhi and again reiterates, as he's done in other places, his calls for maximum restraint and for violence to be avoided,"" Dujarric said.

Communal clashes broke out in northeast Delhi after violence between anti- and pro-Citizenship (Amendment) Act groups spiralled out of control. Frenzied mobs torched houses, shops, vehicles, a petrol pump and pelted stones at local residents and police personnel.

Ensuring faster treatment to riot-affected people amid violence in Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday announced that medical treatment to injured will be free in private hospitals under Delhi Government’s “Farishte scheme”.

253,28-2-20,Justin Bieber surprises his superfan,"Pop star Justin Bieber surprised a superfan, Lynsey Mickolas, 10 years after serenading her with the song ""One less lonely girl"" on stage.

It was back in 2010 that the two met during a concert.

The singer surprised Mickolas once more during a special moment in the finale on his YouTube docuseries ""Seasons"", reports dailymail.co.uk.

While Mickolas recalled her unforgettable Bieber moment, the singer prepped for another special performance.

Mickolas, now a forensic chemist living in Virginia, spoke about her August 31, 2010 night at Madison Square Garden.

Years after, it seemed unreal for the fan who told cameras: ""To be honest, I don't remember everything from that night because everything just happened so quickly and it was so overwhelming.""

""Allison (Bieber's manager) just brings me backstage. She was like, 'You're going to be his 'One less lonely girl' and I was like, 'What?'""

All the while, Bieber is preparing to meet her again.

Despite being used to the spotlight, the singer told cameras: ""I'm nervous. I don't know. It's, like, the opposite thing to do. Like, why am I nervous? … She has no idea I'm here.""

Then he interrupted her interview.

The fan was sharing her opinion on Bieber's last album ""Purpose"".

Creeping up behind his fan, the singer said: ""Honestly, the 'Purpose' album was really good. But, like, 'One less lonely girl' is definitely up there.""

""Did you say, 'Once a Belieber, always a Belieber?'"" he went on while a shocked Mickolas turned around to agree.

255,28-2-20,'Bumper Hour': Indian batting's test against New Zealand's short ball tactic,"Their pride bruised and technique exposed in adverse conditions, India's famed batting line-up will face its hour of reckoning against a New Zealand pace attack, threatening to be relentless with its short ball tactic in the second Test starting Saturday.

The ignominy of a three-day defeat in a World Test Championship encounter has certainly jolted a batting line-up that prides itself in performing in tough conditions.

And none other than coach Ravi Shastri is first to agree.

""A shake up like this is good as it opens your mindset. When you are on the road all the time and have not tasted defeat, it can close your mindset,"" Shastri was forthright in his admission that complacency had crept in somewhere.

Come Saturday, the Virat Kohlis, Cheteshwar Pujaras and Ajinkya Rahanes will face an even tougher test on a green top at the Hagley Oval where the Black Caps have won all but one Test.

With the peerless practitioner of the short-ball tactic Neil Wagner joining Tim Southee, Trent Boult and Kyle Jamieson in aiming for the rib cage from round the wicket, there will be more probing questions on offer during the next five days.

One good news for India was that Prithvi Shaw was back in the nets with an extensive session under watchful eyes of the coach and some valuable tips from the skipper.

""Prithvi is ready to go,"" the coach cleared the air on the opener's fitness.

What the Indian team would want is one among Aninkya Rahane, Hanuma Vihari and Cheteshwar Pujara to show positive intent as their identical defensive game is bound to put too much pressure on skipper Kohli.

The visitors, in all likelihood, will have one change in the playing XI from the last Test with Ravichandran Ashwin likely to lose his spot to Ravindra Jadeja.

While Shastri said that a call will be taken tomorrow on Jadeja and Ashwin, he gave enough hints that Saurashtra all-rounder has his nose ahead.

""You look at the conditions and also check how much a spinner would bowl. Ashwin is a world-class bowler but I guess he would be disappointed with his batting,"" Shastri's answer was a giveaway.

For New Zealand, it could be an all-pace attack considering that Ajaz Patel, the specialist left arm spinner, had precious little to do at the Basin Reserve.

With Wagner getting his place back, the team management would find it difficult to bench Jamieson who won Man of the Match award on Test debut.

""It's a good kind of worry to have for Kane,"" senior pacer Trent Boult said when asked who among Jamieson and Patel would feature in the playing XI.

The green pitch will be hard, even bouncy with good carry, according to the curator and that's exactly what Boult wants.

""From a bowling perspective, it's exciting (to see the pitch). I hope it stays that way. With cloud cover and a surface like this, seam and swing will be on offer,"" Boult feels.

For the Indian team, it's not only about batting as Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami's underwhelming show at the Basin has also been a cause of concern. Their length was awry and failure to get the tail-enders quickly stuck out like a sore thumb.

Bumrah, in particular, has had an indifferent tour and this is the first time in his four year international career where he is experiencing a bad patch.

But his coach is very confident that a ""five for or six-for"" is just around the corner.

Teams:

New Zealand (12): Kane Williamson (captain), Tom Blundell, Tom Latham, Henry Nicholls, Ross Taylor, Colin de Grandhomme, BJ Watling (wk), Kyle Jamieson, Tim Southee, Trent Boult, Neil Wagner, Ajaz Patel

India (12): Virat Kohli (captain), Mayank Agarwal, Prithvi Shaw, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Hanuma Vihari, Rishabh Pant (wk), Ishant Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Shubman Gill.

256,28-2-20,"Shaw is fit and ready to go, confirms Shastri","Young opener Prithvi Shaw has recovered from a foot injury and is ""ready to go"" in the second and final Test against New Zealand starting here on Saturday, India head coach Ravi Shastri has said.

Shaw missed Thursday's training session due to swelling on his left foot, increasing the Indian team management's worries ahead of the second Test.

But the good news for India was that Shaw was back in the nets on Friday with an extensive session under the watchful eyes of Shastri and got some valuable tips from skipper Virat Kohli.

""Prithvi is ready to go,"" Shastri said, clearing the air on the opener's fitness.

Shaw had a poor outing in the first Test in Wellington, getting dismissed cheaply in both the innings.

Tim Southee got him for 16 with an unplayable delivery in the first innings. He also found Trent Boult's short ball difficult to negotiate when he was on 14 in the second essay.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shaw-is-fit-and-ready-to-go--confirms-shastri-2020-02-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/shaw-is-fit-and-ready-to-go--confirms-shastri.html
257,28-2-20,"Ishant down with pain in right ankle, doubtful starter for second Test","The Indian team's worries ahead of the second Test against New Zealand increased after senior-most pacer Ishant Sharma skipped Friday's practice session due to pain in his right ankle, making him a doubtful starter for the game.

Ishant came for practice but apparently felt discomfort after which he was taken for precautionary scan of his right ankle.

The reports are awaited and if Ishant is ruled unfit, then either Umesh Yadav or Navdeep Saini will take his place. Umesh looks a more likely candidate at the moment because of his experience of 45 Tests.

Ishant, who was the best Indian bowler on view with figures of 5/68 in 22.2 overs against New Zealand in Wellington, joined the team before the series after recovering sufficiently from a grade three tear on his right ankle sustained during a Ranji Trophy game against Vidarbha.

He was expected to be out for six weeks but apparently made a ""miraculous recovery"" at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) under physio Ashish Kaushik.

Ishant looked in good rhythm despite battling fatigue and jet lag as he arrived in Wellington from Bengaluru barely 72 hours before the start of the first Test.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ishant-down-with-pain-in-right-ankle--doubtful-starter-for-second-test-2020-02-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/ishant-down-with-pain-in-right-ankle--doubtful-starter-for-second-test.html
