Capt Amarinder, at the same, has asked the DGP to withdraw personnel from his security as well as from other ministers and others for deployment in the field. “The need for more personnel in the field is felt as more than 41,000 cops, out of the nearly 80,000 strong police force, is on the roads for almost two weeks now due to state's fight against coronavirus. About 7,500 cops are guarding various VIPs in the state,” said the Government spokesperson.

Expressing concern about the welfare and morale of thousands of police personnel, who had been performing field duties without rest or relief, over the past several days, the Chief Minister had directed mobilization of maximum police force through withdrawal from security duties.

The DGP said that further withdrawals would be made based on evaluation of the threat scenario, which was in progress, and through graded reduction.

More security persons from district force and Armed Battalions will be withdrawn and organized into reserves, he said, adding that extensive mobilization of the force had been planned and will be undertaken in a phased manner.

The DGP said that due care was being taken to deploy the police personnel in their home districts as far as possible.

Gupta said that a total of 107 FIRs were registered on Tuesday for violation of curfew or home quarantine restrictions and 132 persons were arrested. The police personnel on duty have strict instructions to enforce the restrictions in a sensitive manner, he said adding that the police teams across districts also continued with the relief operations, reaching out to the needy and poor with rations and other essentials.

The Ministry of Home Affairs took the action amid its ongoing efforts to identify the contacts of over 9,000 identified Tabligi Jamaat workers who have been to the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in Delhi's Nizamuddin area, prompting authorities to intensify efforts to trace them since they may be carrying the virus and potentially infecting others.

8,01-4-20,"This too, shall pass","A blizzard that lasted 45 days, depleting rations for the soldiers and the remains of a colleague in the same tent. This is what it means to be isolated in the Siachen Glacier

Sometimes one wonders whether it is even real or has a Robin Cook medical thriller come to life? What used to be in the pages of a novel has now become a part of our lives, with medical teams walking around in protective suits, huge isolation wards covered in miles of plastic, people dying in huge numbers, sanitisers being sprayed everywhere. It’s like a bad dream. And what of the economic impact of the Coronavirus outbreak on the world? Suddenly, there are no flights, trains or buses. The malls and market places are closed, so are other places of entertainment. It is the same story with educational institutions and amid the nationwide lockdown all one can see are deserted roads and service lanes, social distancing and the accompanying silence. Though these are necessary measures to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus. Ultimately, at the personal level, it means one thing and that is isolation.

The present situation takes me back to the year 1992. I was a young Major, just out from the Defence Services Staff College and instead of going on a staff appointment as is generally the policy after the course, I went back to my battalion, as it was going for a tenure in the Siachen glacier. I was to command a Company in the glacier in one of the most challenging picquets. The altitude was around 19,000 feet and recorded temperature around minus 45°C, with a wind chill effect going to around minus 65 °C. The picquet was on top of an ice wall and due to various factors, it was impossible for helicopters to come there. This, therefore, led to a big challenge, that of getting our daily survival rations from the closest helipad.

It was the month of February and a few days after taking over from the relieving Unit, the weather got nasty. Once the weather packs up there, it is a completely white-out condition. Visibility becomes so limited that if you stretch your hand, you can’t see your fingers. The snow blizzards are so strong that if you are not well grounded, you can just be blown off. Under such conditions, movement from one place to another means certain death. Therefore, it’s total isolation.

The challenge was further accentuated because the poor weather conditions continued for a long period, nearly 45 days. With no movement of men possible, rations started diminishing steadily and I had to severely restrict our meals so that we could last longer. We came down to one meal a day which consisted of only one or two tablespoons of rice and nothing else.

Our survival depended entirely on kerosene oil because, not only was it required for cooking, we needed it most for melting blue ice into water, without which we would have got completely dehydrated. The stocks of kerosene oil and other items were at a critical stage which would last only a few days, even with rationing. And nobody could predict when the weather would clear up.

At this stage, another tragedy befell us, when one of our colleagues, a Sepoy, attained martyrdom, falling to one of the extreme high-altitude complications. With the weather still nasty, we could not even send his mortal remains down to the Base Camp. Hence, his remains were kept with us in our tent.

Now, you can imagine the situation — blizzard outside, no movement possible, rations down to a bare minimum, the mortal remains of our colleague with us in the tent and most importantly, we were completely cut off not only from the battalion at Base Camp but also from our families and loved ones. In those days, we had no mobile phones or SAT phones to stay connected with our families or entertain ourselves to while long hours of boredome away. We knew that if anything happened to us, nobody could help because it was just not physically possible to do that. And we still had about two months more of our scheduled tenure to complete. We, therefore, had to be at our mental and physical best.

Can there be any greater form of isolation than what we went through in 1992? However, we overcame all challenges and came out successful. At the end of our tenure, my men and I de-inducted without another casualty.

So, what kept us going?

As I look back, first, it was our will to overcome all challenges. We knew the gravity of the situation but never let it affect us adversely. It only strengthened our will-power and our camaraderie grew as our difficulties increased.

Second, our strong belief that our organisation was firmly with us. I used to talk to my Commanding Officer once a day (who was in the Battalion headquarters at the Base) and we both knew that, physically, it was impossible to help us in that situation. But his reassurances were enough for me and my men to know that whenever it would be possible, they would do anything to help us.

Third was planning for the eventuality. Though I never expected the situation to turn out the way it did, I did expect disruptions due to the weather. Accordingly, we had prepared mentally and I had controlled the rations. It was because of this planning that we could last out with our “one-tablespoon rice meal a day.”

Fourth, resolute leadership. Personal example had to be set by doing exactly what everyone else was expected to do, including having the same rations, irrespective of rank. Also, such extreme conditions needed certain precautions, otherwise, within hours one could lose a limb or one’s life. One such example was that after you went out (even to relieve yourself, even if for a few seconds), it was mandatory to wash your feet in warm water on coming back. Not doing so would result in frost-bite. I observed the initial signs of frost-bite on one soldier who was not adhering to the directions. When I noticed his lackadaisical attitude on the second day, I had to literally kick him. It saved his limb and life in the end.

Lastly, one had to find inner peace. Once a day we would collectively pray and sing hymns — out of tune, rustic but from the heart. My lifeline was my Walkman and a cassette of Anup Jalota’s bhajans. The batteries of the Walkman were the most precious and I used to keep them in the inner pocket of my down-feather jacket which we used to wear 24x7. The body temperature kept the batteries alive, otherwise within hours they would have got discharged in such weather conditions. There is one thing I still have to do — to thank Anup Jalota for my life.

All the soldiers of my Company have since retired but even now, these brave soldiers enquire about my welfare over a phone call and that makes my day.

Old soldiers are supposed to “fade away.” I was happy doing that after retirement — participating in some voluntary events and diligently listening to my wife. However, today, the country is facing an extraordinary situation and I thought I must share my story with my countrymen/women, especially in relation to isolation.

All the factors that made us come out successful from our tenure in the glacier, exist in our country today. Our strong will-power, which we have displayed many times under different circumstances and during wars, exemplary leadership and the organising capability of our country and our deep spiritual understanding, irrespective of whichever religion or faith we follow.

The isolation that we will face now is much simpler as compared to what we experienced in the glacier. Today, with so many facilities available, this is an opportunity to spend quality time with family, to read, to catch up on various hobbies, to contemplate and to meditate.

We also need to care about those affected by the virus and their families, within the permitted rules. We need not hug them physically but can show them our sympathy in any feasible manner so that we can share their trauma.

As I understand, the challenge is not going to end soon and therefore, we have to bank entirely on our capabilities to see us through — our example will be followed by the world.

As the situation improves, which, with our engaged commitment I’m certain it will, we, of course, need to look inwards. There could be many, but I would like to focus on two aspects — first, nature versus virtual world and second, “The world has enough for everyone’s need but not enough for everyone’s greed.”

Does that sound familiar? It is going to be a longish battle.....and we will win.

9,01-4-20,Out-of-the-box solutions needed,"The current crisis has somewhat highlighted the need to incorporate edutech within the mainstream education system

In a desperate bid to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, Governments across the world have taken many drastic steps. Several countries, including India, have opted for a complete lockdown, mandating the closure of schools, offices and universities alike. In India, even prior to the countrywide lockdown, several State Governments had issued notifications for the closure of universities to prevent the spread of the virus among students. As all the universities and colleges across the country are closed, a significant question arises regarding the continuation of education. A large number of students are being affected in the midst of the semester with uncertainty about the time of re-opening of these institutions of higher education.

However, it is essential to minimise educational disruptions as the impact of the same is long-lasting. Difficult times like these require innovative solutions. Even the Central Government has acknowledged the same and issued a “COVID-19 Solution Challenge” wherein people have been asked to share technology-driven resolutions for the problems thrown up by the outbreak. Thousands of firms across the country are also adopting technology to enable their staff to work from home. A similar approach has been taken by schools and universities, which are using technology to facilitate the learning process of the students from the safety and comfort of their homes/hostels.

While institutions like Delhi University, Jamia Millia Islamia and the Indian Institute of Mass Communication are taking classes online and also making study material available to students on a weekly basis to maintain continuity in the learning process, some universities are trying to conduct online classes and to replace in-class assessments with online ones. Others, like the Amity University have also shifted the entire post-graduate curriculum online while others are using micro groups on WhatsApp and e-mails to send materials to the students. Many universities including the OP Jindal Global University have made the remote access of their e-resources available, thereby allowing their students to undertake research from home. Several other universities are also under the process of developing mechanisms to offer remote learning opportunities, alternative assessments and extensions.

Despite the initiatives being undertaken by the universities to promote online classes, there are several issues which need immediate attention. The success rate of conducting such classes is contingent on openness to new technology and the availability of infrastructure across the country. Online classes require persistent connectivity which may also be an area of concern. Furthermore, not all courses can be taught completely online and subjects involving practical pedagogy may involve fieldwork which cannot be completed at home. Furthermore, apps and tools such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom have experienced outage across Europe due to an increased number of users.

Technology has the potential to completely alter the education sector. According to a report by KPMG, the Indian online education industry will grow from 1.6 million users in 2016 to 9.6 million users by 2021. The importance of the online education industry has grown multifold in the past few months and innovative education solutions are the need of the hour. However, online education and edutech in India are still not a part of the mainstream education system for the most part. It is necessary to introduce capital and investments in this sector to integrate edutech with mainstream education.

In the recent years, esteemed universities like Harvard, Stanford, Yale and Oxford have been providing online courses accessible all over the world through platforms such as EdX, Coursera and Udemy. Similarly, in India, the Department of Higher Education has undertaken the National Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technology to leverage the potential of ICT in providing the best information accessible to all learners in the country, free of cost. Under this mission, initiatives such as the National Online Education Platform SWAYAM and the National Digital Library have been developed. SWAYAM offers interactive online courses for students, which are prepared by the best teachers in the country and are available, free of cost to any learner. The National Digital Library, on the other hand, is designed to hold content of any language and provides interface support for leading Indian languages. The access to SWAYAM and other Digital Initiatives has tripled in the last one week.

It is in adverse times like these, the mettle of a nation is tested. The Indian Government should be applauded for its hard work in keepings its citizens safe. However, once the situation is under control, the focus must be shifted to develop overall infrastructural capacities to facilitate edutech.

The digital initiatives, which were always considered secondary to the traditional education systems, are now at least being considered as an alternative. The current crisis has somewhat highlighted the need to incorporate edutech within the mainstream education system.

10,01-4-20,Time for the Govt and the Opp to work unitedly,"The Opposition is within its rights to ask questions about the Government’s readiness and the Government, too, is duty-bound to remain accountable. Both should keep aside their political agenda as the priority is dealing with the pandemic

Is the Opposition supporting the Narendra Modi Government’s efforts to contain the Coronavirus pandemic in the country? Is the Government doing enough?

One should not raise eyebrows if the Opposition parties in the country do not praise the Union Government’s efforts though they are forced to give support reluctantly. Even in the United States (US) despite the pandemic outbreak and the Government’s efforts to combat it, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has accused President Donald Trump of “playing politics” with the virus outbreak to which the latter responded by calling her “incompetent.” The Speaker hit back saying, “Lives are at stake. This is not a time for name-calling or playing politics.” What both said applies to Indian politicians also.

While Prime Minister Modi has shown his leadership qualities by persuading the people to observe a one-day “Janta (people) curfew” and has successfully taken it forward by putting the entire country under a 21-day official lockdown, the Opposition thinks that the Government is not doing enough.

This was evident during the curtailed Parliament session when the Opposition raised questions on the Government’s tackling of the pandemic. In fact, even running the session became difficult as the Opposition wanted it to be curtailed in view of the outbreak and the social distancing that the Government was advocating for the public. The Opposition accused the Modi Government of ignoring the threat that the Coronavirus posed to the health of the Members of Parliament and running the House in order to install a BJP Government in Madhya Pradesh.

How has the Congress, the main Opposition party dealt with the issue? While the party has been careful to avoid any antagonistic public posture at a time when the nation faces a war- like situation, it has stressed certain key issues. Though delayed, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi wrote to Prime Minister Modi, pledging her party’s support to the national lockdown, adding that she also had certain suggestions.

In her letter, Gandhi had urged the Centre to consider announcing sector-wise relief packages, including tax breaks, interest subvention, deferment of liability, extra measures for migrant labourers and the unorganised sector workers.

Sonia has also asked the Congress chief ministers to gear up for the situation and the Congress has activated its All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretaries, Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) presidents, legislature party leaders and heads of frontal organisations to help people.

Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, who was critical Modi’s way of handling the pandemic, on March 28 pledged his personal support to the Prime Minister in a letter but also appealed for a nuanced approach. He urged the PM to come up with a safety net for the poor and a road map with a time-frame.

Congress leaders, who spoke in a shriller voice earlier, now speak in a muted tone. They are saying, “We are with you but…!” Within hours of Rahul Gandhi declaring his support, party spokesman Abhishek Manu Singhvi came out with a scathing criticism of the lockdown and the plight of about one crore migrant workers. “You have heightened the nerves of the people of this nation because of your unpreparedness,” he said. It is the same with other Opposition leaders, be it Mamata Banerjee, Pinarayi Vijayan, Sitaram Yechuri, Mayawati or D Raja. The BJP, however, has geared up its machinery along with the full support of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

What is heartening is that the State Governments and the Centre are working in tandem in tackling the pandemic. Cooperation between the Centre and the States fortunately continues at the official level and health is one such area where States have never withheld their cooperation. Interestingly, it is the regional parties and leaders who have taken the lead in the fight against the Coronavirus. Most non–BJP ruled States supported the “Janta curfew.” Chief Ministers like Naveen Patnaik, KC Rao, Jagan Mohan Reddy, E Palaniswami and Arvind Kejriwal have responded positively to Modi’s initiatives. These regional satraps have come up with their own relief measures. While, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced a Rs 200-crore fund to tackle the disease, Kerala’s Vijayan has announced a Rs 2,000 crore financial aid plan. At the State level, too, the Opposition parties in their respective regions have offered to work with the Government, except for a few States like Tamil Nadu.

All this goes to show that the collective political will that is needed to deal with a critical stage in the transmission of the virus, is by and large there in the country. India is facing an unprecedented challenge, which affects each State, each economic sector, each business and the health of each family. What do the people of India want? They are looking to a genuine leadership both from the Government and the Opposition. The Opposition, too, has the responsibility to come up with policy options and the Government must also listen to it. Together, they should be able to cope with the unprecedented pandemic. Both should not fail the people at a time like this. Indeed the Opposition is within its rights to ask questions about the Government’s readiness and its response and the Government, too, is duty-bound to remain accountable. Both should keep aside their political agenda as the priority is dealing with the pandemic. Therefore the response should be reflected in political unity.

11,01-4-20,Hope in Kerala model,"It was because of organised testing that Kerala, a State with one of the best healthcare infrastructure, could effectively treat the patients infected with Coronavirus

In Kerala, god’s own lush green country, it is as real as it can be. Some students belonging to this State, studying in Hyderabad, were stranded at the Karnataka-Kerala border last week. They wanted to come back to their State but were stuck and in dire straits. One of them google “searched” for Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s number. This was at 1 am, post midnight. This student was desperate and was just trying her luck. The phone rang and guess who received the call? The Chief Minister himself. It is reported that Vijayan told the student not to worry (don’t worry child…) and that he would find a solution. In moments, she got the number of the top administrative functionaries in Wayanad and when they reached the slated spot, another official was waiting for the students with a vehicle to transport them safely back to their homes. Once they reached their destinations, the girl student called the Chief Minister back to thank him. Vijayan said that he was happy that they had reached safely and asked them to quarantine themselves.

Real-time stories, bordering on myths, have been circulating about Vijayan and his no-nonsense, simple and hard-working Health Minister, KK Shailja, the “teacher” who has openly said that her actions are determined by the advice of experts and scientists and practical and long-term solutions. The manner in which the issue of migrants and visitors, both inside and outside the State, has been addressed reflects just this. Thousands of Keralites work abroad, especially in the Gulf, and the State is a tourist hub with foreigners enjoying its dense green picturesque landscapes, its endless backwaters and safe scenic towns as also its vast coastal regions and sunny beaches.

As tens and thousands of migrant workers and the poor thronged the highways in Delhi and its neighbourhood, mostly heading towards Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the 21-day lockdown announced by Prime Minister Modi has all but collapsed in the capital and the Hindi heartland. There are now genuine fears that these workers, having travelled in congested spaces, without any healthcare safety, often hungry and penniless, might lead to a major medical crisis in the rural hinterland, which apparently has remained insulated from the epidemic/pandemic.

This would be disastrous and lead to a total failure of the laxman rekha drawn by the Prime Minister in his 8 pm television address to the nation or his doctrine of “stay at home” to maintain “physical/social” distancing in a bid to stop the pandemic from entering Stage-III and, thus, become viral and fatal. This would also jeopardise the efforts of States like Kerala and West Bengal, which have countered the crisis with effective, all-round social security, healthcare and administrative measures.

So how did Kerala tackle the migration crisis? First, much before the country took notice, as early as in March, it had put up health desks at airports to screen passengers coming from abroad. Foreigners cooperated, no one was harassed. Testing and quarantine became a must even as hospitals and isolation centres were kept ready. Even while doctors and nurses and other hospital staff were

given all the facilities at Government hospitals, private ones were sounded off by the district administration to be ready for patients and that, too, free of cost.

If one person tested positive, all his/her contacts were tested, too. All domestic travellers were asked to follow self-quarantine, which they dutifully followed. Concerted counselling over the phone and through inter-personal contact was given to people under isolation or those undergoing treatment. Indeed, it was because of organised testing that Kerala, a State with one of the best healthcare infrastructure, could effectively treat the patients infected with the virus. As their numbers grew, they were quickly identified, given treatment and quarantined. None like Bollywood actor Kanika Kapoor hid their travel history either in Kerala or in West Bengal.

All entry points for railways and buses were thoroughly checked. This was an arduous task but medical teams and volunteers went from compartment to compartment checking passengers and testing them. All those travellers taking a bus went through a similar process. All of this was done with immense dignity, patience and efficiency and as fast as it could be done.

There are around 5,000 fully-equipped shelters in Kerala, which are now catering to around two lakh migrant workers. Not a single labour has been allowed to move out. They all seem to be content to stay at their new “homes.” Significantly, the Government prefers to term them “guest workers,” giving them the due dignity and respect they deserve.

Rations for three months have been provided. Their shelters are clean and sanitised. There is running water, soap, sanitisers and proper sanitation systems. Medical centres and counselling are available 24X7. Volunteers and State officials are always at hand. No wonder, the “guest workers” are happy and grateful. Apart from other measures, one of the most significant steps taken by the State Government is to announce social security schemes and financial package for them. The following steps are significant:

A special package of `20,000 crore has been announced to overcome the COVID-19 threat. (Compare this with the `15,000 crore package announced by the Prime Minister for the entire country). The financial package includes `1,320 crore to disburse two-months welfare pension in advance; `1,000 to families not eligible for other social welfare pensions; `100 crore for free foodgrains to families in need; `50 crore for subsidised meals at `20 and a `500 crore health package. Loans worth `2,000 crore will be made available through the Kudumbashree scheme, a highly successful project accessible to the remotest region. A sum of `2,000 crore has been earmarked for employment guarantee programmes. Further, all arrears will be cleared by the State Government by April, amounting to `14,000 crore. Cinema hall owners have been given an entertainment tax reprieve.

The food issue was nipped in the bud with 1,000 food centres, restaurants and hotels offering free food to those in need and community kitchens were operational everywhere. Door-to-door food, too, was distributed. Significantly, as the Chief Minister reiterated in one of his candid press conferences (unlike the one held by Prime Minister) where he took all questions by the media and explained the finest details of the relief operations undertaken by his Government, those who are embarrassed or shy to ask for food, too, have been provided with the “secret” phone numbers. Food and other amenities will be delivered to them and they need not disclose their identity. This is truly democratic governance where the citizen is given the utmost dignity by the Government.

Free prepaid recharge has been provided to those under observation. The students’ wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has been manufacturing sanitisers and distributing them to the public. Civil society and women’s groups have been roped in to provide relief. District administrations are working with ward and local level representatives, including the panchayats. Hence, even in a centralised system, the process of implementation is totally decentralised, easily accessible and efficient.

The current mission is to create a huge volunteer force. Former doctors have been asked to join the healthcare system again. Be it healthcare or drastic measures taken during natural catastrophes like massive floods or even during the spread of Nipah virus, the people of Kerala and its Government have galvanised resources, communities, religious institutions, the youth, women and students repeatedly and successively to collectively combat the crisis at the most invisible grassroots terrain. That is why, yet again, the State seems to be on a strong and solid footing, even as the virus seeks to damage and ravage the world.

12,01-4-20,Costly human error,"Nizamuddin shrine turns Delhi into a COVID-19 cluster. The Govt must ban congregations altogether, monitor markets

Just when we were reading about Patient 31 in South Korea, who had infected thousands by interacting at a church congregation and sparked a swirling spiral of COVID-19 cases in that nation in just a couple of weeks, we have a super-spreader, actually spreaders, in Delhi. What is most worrying is that there could be many Patient 31s, not one, and as they moved to different parts of the country, they have carried the virus even to distant Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Faith is meant to give us courage, wisdom and hope and not lead us to irresponsible destruction in the time of a global pestilence. Faith is about the sincerity of prayer and creating hope, not a mindless pursuit of rituals codified by humans. Most significantly, no supreme being would reward human error. So ignoring all social distancing rules to avoid the Coronavirus, hundreds of pilgrims had been staying at Nizamuddin’s 100-year-old mosque complex, which has a six-floor dormitory, since a two-day gathering of the Tablighi Jamaat from March 13 to March 15. Some 280 were foreigners and had not been quarantined. The gathering, which featured sermons, was attended by Tablighi members from Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Nepal, Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan and Saudi Arabia. Members had also come from hotspots like England and France. Not only that, some of the top missionaries from Indonesia, with which we share easier visa rules, entered the country on a tourist visa, avoiding disclosure on the purpose or nature of their visit. Many of those who attended then travelled to other parts of the country, making contact-tracing an almost impossible job as they had bled into communities, families and society in general. For example, the Srinagar preacher, who died last week, had visited the Deoband seminary in Uttar Pradesh and on his return to Kashmir, held multiple gatherings. More than 100 people from Kashmir attended the gathering and a massive exercise is on to track them down. Some pilgrims who attended died in Hyderabad. To be fair to the police, they had information about a congregation on March 24, when around 1,200 people were inside the mosque complex, and had escorted them to the airport the following day. But on March 26, two days into the national lockdown, people started gathering at the mosque again without informing. When the police found out, already 2,000 people had assembled inside.

Of course, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has a tough job containing the entire Nizamuddin cluster, a rather crowded area of Delhi. For starters, he ordered a police case against the mosque administration over gross negligence. One shudders to think not how many are out there but how many they met and greeted. This costly human error means that the Government should crack down on all faith-based and any social congregations with an iron hand and maintain a strict vigil at all such potential convergence zones, social or religious, with military precision. This should include markets, too, given the overcrowding at Mangalore today. Massive surveillance and community testing along the lines of what South Korea carried out will now take place at Nizamuddin. In South Korea, they had tested all church members for the virus. So, even though the number of cases rose after the tests, it did manage to slow the rate of new cases. We may have identified the Nizamuddin cluster but what of the many returnees who have met people socially and in their families, blissfully unaware of being vectors and carriers? Despite more than 1,000 active cases and signs of local transmission, the Government claims there has been no community spread in the country. But it is no rocket science to understand that given India’s population density, this has happened already. Undoubtedly, the rising toll and confirmed cases on the tracker every day are causing large scale fear and panic. So what India needs now is an effective communication strategy like in South Korea and Japan, one which should say why the figures are climbing because of more testing and why protocols need to be followed to save lives. We must understand that we need test kits, protective gear and apparatus on a large scale to counter the monster that has swamped us. With economy in the doldrums, layoffs, State Governments halving salaries and the Centre expected to roll out welfare measures for mass treatment and care, we are already up to the gills. We have to ride the arc with patience and by doing the right thing. For God won’t forgive us either for doing the wrong one. Faith leaders should be used to propagate this message instead.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/costly-human-error-2020-04-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/costly-human-error.html
13,01-4-20,A year later,"Many international sporting bodies were in denial about the impact of the Corona epidemic; they have finally woken up

As the viral scourge of Coronavirus swept across the world, national, provincial and local Governments found themselves scrambling to deal with the spread of the deadly infection. However, sporting authorities — from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) — were found with their heads buried in the sand, refusing to accept the impact of the virus on their schedules. While the BCCI relented and postponed the Indian Premier League (IPL) season to mid-April, though it is yet to call off the tournament, the IOC alongside the Tokyo Games organising committee and the Japanese Government persisted with the notion that the games would not be delayed until last week. It was the infection of some athletes at a qualifying tournament in London and the outcry that followed that forced the IOC’s hand. Now, the sporting body and the Japanese Government have announced a year’s delay of the Summer Olympics, which would start July 23, 2021.

While we are living in times, where it is impossible to forecast what will happen by July 2021, one can hope that a cure for the condition is found. Hopefully, a preventive vaccine as well. The postponement of the Games is tragic for athletes, many of whom have spent virtually every waking minute of their lives ever since the flame was extinguished at Rio De Janeiro preparing for the games in Japan. The health and safety of these athletes and the thousands of officials, volunteers and spectators is the overriding concern. This must be at the top of authorities concerned. So a year’s delay gives the authorities enough wiggle room to plan for almost every contingency. The Olympics might be delayed by a year, but it increasingly seems that the BCCI will very shortly have to call off the IPL. Football leagues in Europe will have to plan around how to crown their champions. There is talk of games being played in closed door environment but playing any contact sport would be irresponsible right now. Many fans, particularly of Liverpool Football Club, might be mighty disappointed but the fairest solution right now would be to declare all leagues for all spring and summer sports in 2020 null and void. That may not be fair to clubs like Liverpool but a uniform solution will have to be found as conditions in Europe and the US are not conducive to sports being played at the current time. Thankfully, there are a lot of classic sporting moments available online and some great sports movies and documentaries available to stream in the meantime. Athletes might be disappointed, particularly Indian athletes, who expected to do well in Tokyo, but this is as good a time as any to prepare even harder to win glory next summer, if not this one.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-year-later-2020-04-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/a-year-later.html
14,01-4-20,"CM Yogi stresses on effective lockdown, increased patrolling","Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ordered that to effectively control the spread of coronavirus, the lockdown be strictly enforced and if needed, police patrolling be increased.

The directive was issued during a meeting of 11 COVID officers held at the chief minister’s 5 Kalidas Marg official residence here on Tuesday.

“Migrant workers coming to the state from other states should be put in quarantine. It is the responsibility of local administration to look after them. No one should be seen moving on roads. If required, the administration should increase police patrolling and stop people from going from one place to another,” Yogi said.

The chief minister further said that shelter homes be set up across the state for these migrants workers.

“If required, schools and community buildings should be made shelter homes and these people should be sent there for quarantine. Social distancing should be ensured and people should be asked to wash hands regularly,” the chief minister said.

Yogi also suggested that teams of Health department should regularly visit these people in shelter homes for thermal scanning of all individuals.

“A senior health officer should be deployed in each district to co-ordinate with the chief medical officer and report about the people put in quarantine,” he said.

The chief minister asked the chief secretary to ensure availability of personal protection equipment (PPE) and N-95 masks. The chief secretary was also asked to ensure the quality of these masks and PPE and also the supply chain so that there was no scarcity of the safety products.

“If need be, take the help of retired PMHS doctors and doctors of Army Medical Corps,” he suggested.

As the distribution of ration through public distribution system (PDS) was to start from Tuesday, Yogi said that nodal officers be appointed to monitor the distribution of foodgrains through the PDS shops.

“Sanitisers should be used at the PDS centres and social distancing should be ensured. In urban areas, shopkeepers should display rate list and it should be strictly adhered to,” he said.

The chief minister complimented the Varanasi district magistrate and district police chief who went around the city as common men and booked several shopkeepers selling food articles at higher prices.

“It is the responsibility of district officials to ensure that people get foodgrains at price not higher than the maximum retail price and the black-marketeers should be arrested,” he said.

Yogi also asked officials to strengthen the working of community kitchen and that similar kitchens be set up in every district.

Chief Secretary RK Tiwari said that fooding and lodging problems of the people from UP who were staying in Kerala, Haryana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka had been solved.

Agriculture Production Commissioner Alok Sinha said that an App was being developed to ensure effective distribution of food prepared by different agencies.

Industrial Development Commissioner Alok Tandon informed the chief minister that sufficient amount of wheat had been made available to flour mills and financial help had been extended to construction workers.

Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi said that FIRs had been lodged against 46 people under Essential Commodities Act.

Additional Chief Secretary (Finance) Sanjiv Kumar Mittal informed the chief minister that under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, handicapped and destitute women were being extended financial help.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-yogi-stresses-on-effective-lockdown--increased-patrolling.html

In a letter sent to the chief minister on Tuesday, Lallu said that normal life had been affected due to issues arising from coronavirus.

“The chief minister had announced some time back that farmers who had been affected by rains and hailstorms would be given compensation. They are still waiting for the compensation. The rest of their crops are ready in the fields. Since they do not have money, a compensation will be a big relief to them. Hence, compensation be immediately transferred to their accounts,” Lallu said in the letter.

The letter further stated that in the present situation, farmers, common man and small shopkeepers were suffering very much. “In such a situation, they are facing difficulties in paying power bills.

“Coronavirus is a pandemic and people around the world have been affected by it. It is the duty of every citizen to behave responsibly to prevent the spread of the virus. Those who have left the country should inform the respective governments about their health also,” the Maulana Khalid Rashid said in a statement issued in Lucknow on Tuesday.

Tablighi Jamaat or society for spreading faith is an Islamic missionary organisation with a global footprint. Maulana Rashid said that the sole aim of the Tablighi Jamaat was to spread love and harmony in society.

“Nizamuddin in Delhi is the headquarters of this organisation and people from across the globe come to it to attend religious congregation. The outbreak of coronavirus has created an unfortunate situation and hence everyone has to cooperate to prevent its spread and affirm commitment to the country and society,” he added.

In Uttar Pradesh, a total of 157 persons from 19 districts had participated in this congregation in the third week of March.

Meanwhile, the Lucknow police on Tuesday raided `Darul Islam, the office of Jamat-e-Islami in Aminabad area. Though Tablighi Jamaat, an offshoot of Deobandi movement, claims to be a non-political outfit, it has close links with Jamat-e-Islami.

Seven more Bangladeshi nationals were found to be staying at a mosque near Indian Institute of Management on Sitapur road and 10 Bangladeshi nationals were found staying at a mosque in Pallia village in Kakori. All these foreign nationals had valid visas.

He said that if the government needed help, his party workers would work voluntarily.

In a statement issued in Lucknow on Tuesday, Akhilesh said that such incidents were most unfortunate as most legislators and SP cadre were working hard to provide relief to the poor and migrant workers.

“The 21-day lockdown to control the coronavirus spread has rendered life miserable for these poor people,” he said.

The SP chief said that while taking forward the tradition of samajwadis of helping each and every individual, party workers and supporters should help those who were stranded with food, medicine, treatment and shelter in whatever manner possible.

Akhilesh also said that the government should identify bodies of those unfortunate people who died while returning to their homes and they be sent to their homes and their families be given compensation of Rs 25 lakh.

“The BJP brass is fond of cursing development works done during Samajwadi Party regime. The infrastructure like Dial 100, Awadh Shilpgram created during SP rule have come to the rescue of the present dispensation in this hour of crisis. Despite this, the BJP’s tirade against the Samajwadi Party continues unabated,” the SP chief said.

Akhilesh said that the relief work done by UP government was “peanuts” as the 21-day lockdown had hugely impacted workers of the unorganised sector and they were on the verge of starvation.

“The government should step up relief efforts. I also appeal to the people to sincerely follow lockdown to control the pandemic,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sp-workers-being-stopped--from-corona-relief-work---alleges-akhilesh.html

34,01-4-20,"Spat between SDPO, BDO in Palamu over labourers","SDPO Lesliganj Anoop Baraik and BDO Panki P Murmu were in for hot talk quite briefly over the issue of labourers that came to Panki by bus on Monday from Bihar’s Sasaram.

Sources said a bus load of labourers numbering 40 came down to Panki from Bihar’s Sasaram and the bus driver just dumped them 7 kilometers away from Panki police station at Taal area.

The labourers were hungry and haggard. About 7 or 8 were to go to Hazaribag and Dhanbad. Sources said the situation was tough for both police and civil officials.

The MHA order that there would be neither crossing of border nor any movement in thick numbers of people in street was too high on the minds of the police and civil officials.

SDPO Lesliganj Anoop Baraik had a very honest intention said sources when he wanted all these labourers who came from Bihar’s Sasaram to Panki to have first their medical screening, quarantine, food, water rest and all these to come through the BDO P Murmu.

Baraik said, “I and my OC Panki police station wanted BDO Murmu to take swift initiatives and actions for these labourers but it was not coming the way it should have come. The BDO was shrugging off his responsibilities.”

Baraik said no medical screening was made available by the BDO and the labourers just took liberty of it in their own way.

Baraik agreed that this callous indifference and apathy of the BDO made him to remind this BDO as to how to work in situation like this as he ( BDO) looked quite ignorant of the MHA’s strict order in this regard.

He said he asked the BDO to spare chowkidars to do the ground work but the BDO on the other hand had had his own way to explain things which was not in conformity to the protocol that has been set up to control coronavirus.

The BDO’s version could not be taken as despite several attempts. DC Palamu Shantanu Kumar Agrahari when told of this that BDO Panki is not taking calls of the Pioneer said, “I will look into it. Our prime task now is to defeat coronavirus. We all are concentrating on how to combat it.”

The DC further said, “If this is the issue between two individuals or two then in time like this when there is national disaster these two should learn to work together.”

SP Palamu Ajay Linda said, “Our priority is to ensure that labourers who have come over here follow standard health protocol for everyone’s benefit and welfare and in this backdrop there is no room for any side to have any puffed face.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/spat-between-sdpo--bdo-in-palamu-over-labourers.html

53,01-4-20,Isolation wards set up in jails amid COVID-19 panic,"With the entry of COVID-19 in Jharkhand, the jail authorities here have started keeping new inmates and inmates complaining of cough and cold in separate isolation wards, especially set up to prevent the spread of the lethal virus in jails, officials from Home Department said on Tuesday.

Jharkhand has a total of 29 jails – seven central jails, 15 district jails, six sub jails and one open jail. All the jails across the State are being regularly sanitized, jail authorities said. Besides, every inmate is santised before entering the jail, they added.

As many as 18,274 prisoners have been locked in these jails across the State. Out of them, 12,484 are under trial and 5,790 are convicts, jail authorities said. A majority of the convicts in the jail, around 3000, have been sentenced to imprisonment of more than seven years, they added.

Since the lockdown, only two new prisoners have entered the jails in Jharkhand – one in Hazaribag and one in Ranchi, sources said. These inmates will be kept in the isolation wards of the two jails for at least 14 days, they added.

“We are regularly assessing the situation arising out of the outbreak of Coronavirus and decisions will be taken accordingly,” said IG Prisons Shashi Ranjan.

Earlier this month, it was decided in a meeting of Jharkhand State Legal Services Authority (JHALSA) that all jail officials entering the jail should also be santised. Jail authorities were also asked to take precautionary measures to keep themselves safe amid the Coronavirus outbreak.

The Jharkhand chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA) has claimed that the state may witness an explosion of cases due to the allegedly poor screening process in place. “We may witness an explosion, a blast of cases here,” said Dr. Pradip Kumar, President of IMA Jharkhand.

In case, any inmate of a jail gets infected, the infection may easily get passed on to other inmates and also to jail authorities, sources said.

61,01-4-20,Residents accuse police of sitting on complaints,"After scores of people were suspected to be infected with deadly coronavirus in Nizamuddin area, the residents of Nizamuddin West on Tuesday accused the civil and police administrations of not heeding to their repeated complaints about a large number of people who had converged at the Tablighi Jamaat Markaz amid the coronavirus outbreak.

Of the 2,000-odd people, including foreigners, who gathered at the Islamic religious centre earlier this month, 24 have tested positive for COVID-19, according to officials. The Delhi Government later said that 441 persons taken away from Nizamuddin have symptoms of Coronavirus.

The residents complained that the police are yet to act strict in the area and a large number of people could be seen roaming around without a reason. “Time and again, we brought to the notice of the administration and the police that a large number of people gather at the markaz regularly, but they did not pay attention to it,” said a local resident.

“People are still roaming around without a reason. On Monday, I saw a group of around 20-25 men playing cricket in the Nizamuddin Basti area,” he said.

Sheikh Mohammad Umar, the secretary of Nizamuddin West Resident Welfare Association, claimed that the RWA had brought the issue to the notice of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate concerned, local police and South Delhi Municipal Corporation, but “nothing happened”.

Umar said despite writing several letters to the police and the administration, “no security has been provided to the colony, which shares its boundary with the markaz”.

Congress leader and former municipal councilor of the area Farhad Suri, however, said the congregation took place before the government announced the lockdown. “How can you allow 300 foreigners enter India when the entire world is reeling under the coronavirus outbreak? It is the responsibility of the central government to stop them,” he said. A resident of Nizamuddin West said despite knowing that people from all over the world gather there, the administration did not issue any advisory.

“There is nothing the government could have done about it. It happened way before the Delhi government issued any advisory or they started screening passengers at the airports,” another resident said.

“What they could have done is that before announcing the lockdown, the people inside the markaz could have been evacuated,” he said.

Markaz Nizamuddin, which is the international headquarters of Tabilghi Jamaat for close to 100 years, in a statement said when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the “Janata Curfew” on March 22, they discontinued the ongoing programme immediately, but a large number of people were stuck in the premises due to the closure of railway services on March 21.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/residents-accuse-police-of-sitting-on-complaints.html

Over 2,000 delegates attended the congregation from March 1-15. Several visitors from Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Kyrgyzstan and Indonesia had also gathered at Nizamuddin Markaz mosque located in thickly populated area at an event organised by Tableeghi Jamaat.

“Several of them were told to go back to their native places and were subsequently dropped at Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport. Most of them managed to dodge police and returned back to the area and now they cited the lockdown being the reason for not going back,” said a source.

Meanwhile, the Markaz in a statement said it has not violated any provision of law and offered its premises for setting up a quarantine facility.

The statement referred to the directive of the Delhi government to take legal action against the Markaz administration. “During this entire episode, Markaz Nizamuddin never violated any provision of law, and always tried to act with compassion and reason towards the visitors who came to Delhi from different states. It did not let them violate the medical guidelines by thronging ISBTs or roaming on streets,” the statement said.

“Visitors/guests/devotees/worshippers from across the globe throng the place for pre-scheduled programmes and all the programmes are decided a year in advance in order to facilitate visitors from far-off places to plan their participation,” it stated.

The statement further stated that when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the Janata Curfew on March 22, the ongoing programme was discontinued immediately, but a large number of people were stuck in the premises due to the closure of railway services on March 21.

“Before the Janta Curfew could be lifted at 9 pm, the Delhi Chief Minister announced lockdown of Delhi beginning at 6 am on March 23 till March 31, thereby further diminishing any chances of these visitors availing road transport for their journey back home,"" the statement said.

The statement said around 1,500 people left the Markaz on March 23 by availing whatever transport was available.

On the evening of March 23, the Prime Minister announced a nationwide 21-day lockdown, the statement said, adding there was no option for Markaz Nizamuddin but to accommodate the stranded visitors with prescribed medical precautions.

On March 24, a notice was issued by SHO of the Hazrat Nizamuddin police station seeking closure of Markaz premises. The Markaz responded to the notice the same day by stating that around 1,000 visitors belonging to different states and nationalities were present in Markaz while 1,500 had left.

“It had also requested the SDM of the area to issue vehicle passes so that the remaining people could be sent back to their native places outside of Delhi,” the statement further stated.

Residents of the area accused the administration and police of not heeding their complaints about a large number of people converging at the Markaz amid the coronavirus outbreak.

70,01-4-20,Viewing Ramayana a balm to corona pains,"I watched the first episode of the re-televised ‘Ramayana’. Not because I am a religious bigot or that the threat of COVID-19 compelled me to seek divine refuge in self-quarantined habitat but more so because of academic interest.

I had watched a few episodes in the 1980s; but on my childish mind, a hazy imprint of the essence of the Ramayana could take place. But it did leave within me an uneasy quest to churn the ancient tales to know myself, my role in the society and the very purpose of my existence.

To my satisfaction, I did follow the instructions that King Dasharatha gave to his sons to follow in the ashram. But what about the respect we showed to our gurus? Did I have the same devotion for my teachers as the students in ancient India had? I admit the immensity was far too less. I drew solace that even after more than 2,500 years since the days of Ramayana, I was carrying the legacy of my ancient culture.

When all the four brothers went to their mothers to seek alms, after the Upnayana ceremony, tears rolled down mother Kaushalaya’s eyes to see her prince beg. I was touched by the humility, which the act of begging would develop in the students. Ego, the biggest huddle in the process of acquiring knowledge, would never be left to raise its head in a student besides teaching them the indebtedness to the society.ss

Today students beg at the altar of the multinationals for lucrative packages or more precisely sell themselves to the corporate giants, so why won’t they be faithful to them? What role has the society played in their upbringing? They think their knowledge has earned them a good percentage of marks, their parents’ money has helped them to get admission in a good coaching center and their perseverance has enabled them to crack competitive examinations and provided them a seat in premier colleges and the degree from there earns them a highly-paid job. Where does society figure? Then why should they think about it? Or to be more precise, their mind has never been trained to think about the society.

If ever away from their books, during Durga Puja or Holi or Diwali, it was just like an entertaining game of India-Pakistan cricket match or a fun time. Unless their mind is emptied of their syllabus, examinations, competitions, these students cannot grow in the society. They will grow in their classrooms and study rooms with their focus fixed on the eyes of Arjuna’s fish. Isn’t the ancient culture of those who invented SARS-COV-2 virus, to mint money, as philanthropic as ours?

While these thoughts raced in my mind, Guru Vashista appeared on my TV screen leading his four new disciples to his ashram. Now, I can never dare to compare myself with him, though we both are in the same profession. I started searching in me the lacunae which stopped me from comparing myself with the ideal teacher in the Ramayana. Guruji had explained to the ‘Dashratputras’ that first they are the disciples of Brahma. It means students might consider their teacher as God but it is indelibly written in the mind of the guru that the Almighty is the greatest guru.

He is a tool to make the students realise His omnipotent presence. There was a sense of adoption of the students and a sincere feeling to treat them as His own children. The love, care and concern of the guru and the ‘gurumata’ was reflected by the students with the same sincerity, intensity and immensity as they received. Somehow in the present time of professionalism, the words are deftly chosen, voice is pleasantly mellowed down, smile is also presented in a warm and welcoming way, but the soul is missing.

The society is facing the repercussion. Human, the only beings on this earth with wisdom and emotions: the last creation of the Almighty, who might have been sent on this earth by the Creator, to make this place a blissful one, where all the species would live happily together, is helpless. The Creator would have thought that man will find a solution to any problem which might emerge due to interaction of the lower- order species and keep the earth intact, has deeply pained Him. It’s high time we looked into our collars if we are thoughtful about ourselves and our posterity. We have to urgently and immensely overhaul the system in which our young ones are being raised. Too much emphasis on material gains and too quick a success will threaten our very existence on this planet. The sanitiser needs to be applied in our classrooms and a complete hand wash to our existing syllabus and the education system.

71,01-4-20,NOCCI facilities to be used for 1K-bed Covid hospital,"Acting on the suggestion of former Baleswar MP RK Jena to utilise the vacant space available with the NOCCI Infra for creating another 1,000-bed arrangement to accommodate corona patients, the district administration began working on war footing to meet the eventualities.

Jena had suggested mainly on two issues: One, utilise the facility available with the NOCCI Infra and make arrangement of about 1,000 beds and two, prepare a master roll for the retired doctors and paramedics who are residents of Baleswar and the nursing students who are still under training, so that they can be called in a short notice and their service may be utilised.

“In this crisis hour nothing can be predicted. There may be a spurt in incidence of Covid 19. We might require even the suspected cases to be admitted. We don’t have enough facilities in the DHH. Hence, three days ago I suggested the district Collector to utilise the NOCCI infra facilities where there are enough toilets and facilities of AC too. Besides I urged the Collector to prepare a roll of all retired doctors and paramedics and the nursing students of Baleswar who could be called in within a short notice period to meet the exigencies,” said Jena.

“The NOCCI Infra, an establishment of over Rs 100 crore, was built with 95 per cent Government contribution, 5 per cent industries stake. So for the public cause this facility can be utilised,” he reiterated.

District project manager Anil Mohanty , who attended the phone of CDMO, said, “ The work for creating another temporary establishment is under progress. We have already placed 200 beds in the NOCCI hall. Furthermore, we are procuring beds from the SC, ST hostels .”

Additional District Magistrate Sambit Nayak said, “Since NOCCI is well-equipped, 200 beds have been placed in the hall to meet the demand if required.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/nocci-facilities-to-be-used-for-1k-bed-covid-hospital.html

Delhi's Nizamuddin area has been identified as one of the hotspots of COVID-19 in India after several people tested positive for the virus in the past few days. More than 2,000 delegates from countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Nizamuddin West from March 13-15.

At least 24 people who were at the headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat have been diagnosed with COVID-19, prompting the authorities to cordon off the area and increase testing. Tagging a Delhi Government order which prohibited assembly of over 200 people, Atishi sought strong action against the administrators of the Nizamuddin Markaz (centre).

""Strong action should be taken against the administrators of the Nizamuddin Markaz who organised a 3-day religious gathering, with 1000s of people from March 13-15, when Delhi government orders had expressly forbidden gatherings or more than 200 persons on 13th March itself,"" the Kalkaji MLA said in a tweet.

""Moreover, notification by Delhi government on March 12 stated that anyone with a travel history from COVID-19 affected countries have to self-isolate, then why did the administrators of the Markaz not ensure isolation of residents coming from those countries?"" she said in another tweet.

Atishi also targeted the Delhi Police, asking why no action was taken by it. ""What action did Delhi Police take against the large religious gathering at the Nizamuddin Markaz from March 13-15, when there were orders from Delhi Govt prohibiting gatherings of more than 200 people? Strong action needs to be taken by MHA against concerned police officers,"" she said.

The civic body also carried out a massive sanitation drive around flats at Bakkarwala. The decision to sanitise the area came after a sudden outbreak and detection of multiple coronavirus cases at the Delhi-based headquarters of Tablighi Jamaat in Nizamuddin came in light that was attended by thousands of followers including J&K, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and the Andaman and Nicobar islands.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has already asked the Delhi Police to register an FIR against the maulana of the Markaz.

87,01-4-20,COVID-19 lockdown dents air pollution level,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared coronavirus as a pandemic. One positive result which comes to notice is decline in green house gas emissions and air pollution due to worldwide efforts to control COVID-19.

Factories have been closed and flights have been canceled. Quarantine and social isolation has also reduced public transport. Satellite measures show drastic fall of nitrogen dioxide in the troposphere worldwide.

According to NASA, nitrogen dioxide level across eastern and central China have been 10-30 percent lower than normal. Italy has also recorded significant falls in nitrogen dioxide. We will get pollution-free air of course for some period which will save many lives.

Agriculture could also get a boost because pollution stunts plant growth.

Statistical report shows that 9 percent of global death is due to air pollution. The WHO estimates that every year 7 million people die globally due to air pollution which is cause of several diseases including asthma, bronchitis, lung and heart diseases, pneumonia etc.

Air pollution is also the main reason behind the decrease in number of birds in cities. At present because of reduced pollution, an increase in number birds in the Indian cities is observed.

Particulate Matter (PM) is also formed in the atmosphere, as a secondary pollutant from gases such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Atmospheric reactions that involve nitrogen oxides and VOCs lead to the formation of tropospheric ozone, a well-known air pollutant. For Delhites, breathing the air was like smoking 50 cigarettes in a day during last winter. Air quality index in most of the cities including Delhi is observed to be improved.

Vehicles contribute 40 percent of air pollution. Daily consumption of petrol in India is 3,660,000 barrels which is equal to 581,940,000 liter. Road transport is the sole contributor to emissions of nitrogen oxides in cities worldwide. A multitude of air contaminants of varying toxicity comes from road transport. These contaminants originate from the tailpipes of vehicles with internal combustion engines, from other vehicle components (such as brake and clutch linings and pads, tyres and fuel tanks), and from road-surface wear and treatment materials.

Road traffic can be labelled the most important source for some pollutants of great concern, such as nitrogen oxides, benzene and carbon monoxide. Air pollution levels drop as entire country stays indoors. In this context it is recommended that observations of lockdown throughout the county will be able to reduce carbon footprint, hence control air pollution as well as deadly corona.

89,01-4-20,Health dept appoints 201 new medical officers,"Amid the threat posed by the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), the medical, health and family welfare department of Uttarakhand has got a boost by the induction of 201 medical officers in its ranks.

On Tuesday, the State administration made appointments of these doctors in the hospitals of the State. The additional secretary health, Yugal Kishore Pant said that the new MOs have been asked to join the hospitals immediately. He said that the State administration would ensure that these MOs don’t face any problems in joining due to the lock-down enforced in the State.

The Uttarakhand Medical Services Selection Board (UMSSB) had recently conducted interviews for 314 posts of MOs for the health department. More than 800 candidates had applied for these posts and 646 had appeared in the interviews. However the board could not find candidates for the reserved categories due to which 113 posts remained vacant. The Chairman of the UMSSB, Dr D S Rawat said that 68 posts of Scheduled Castes (SC), one post of Scheduled Tribe (ST), 36 posts of Other Backward Castes (OBC), five posts of Divyang , three of Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) remained vacant due to non availability of the candidates.

Interestingly 228 posts out of 314 were for candidates of reserved categories while for general categories only 86 posts were available.

The non-availability of candidates of reserved categories remains one of the biggest impediments in recruitment of doctors for the health services of Uttarakhand. In the recruitment drive held in the year 2018, the UMSSB could recruit only 481 doctors out of 712 posts it advertised. However these 201 new MOs once inducted into the state health department would infuse a new lease of life in the health services.

The selected MO would be inducted in the pay scale of 56100- 177500 (level 10) of state health services. The data of the state health department reveals that many as 679 posts of medical officers are vacant in the state health services which have a sanctioned strength of 2735.

A closer look on the data shows that only 1522 regular doctors are working in the health services of Uttarakhand.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/health-dept-appoints-201-new-medical-officers.html

91,01-4-20,COVID-19 enters J’khand; Malaysian woman tests +ve,"A 22-year-old Malaysian woman – one of the 17 foreign nationals apprehended from a Mosque in Hindpiri on Monday – has tested positive for COVID-19, officials from the Health Department said on Tuesday. This woman, police said, had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in New Delhi – a religious gathering that is now said to be the ‘hotspot’ of coronavirus in the national Capital.

“All the 17 foreign nationals rescued from the mosque in Hindpiri had attended the Tablighi Jamaat. While one of them has tested positive, some test reports are awaited,” said Ranchi Superintendent of Police Saurav. By now, police here have apprehended 28 foreign nationals – 17 from a mosque in Hindpiri and 11 from a mosque in Bundu – since the nationwide lockdown was imposed.

According to sources in the police department, at least 46 residents of Ranchi had attended the Tablighi Jamaat, and the police are tracing them. The religious event held in the first week of March saw participation of several hundred people, including preachers from Indonesia, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia – countries that were already suffering from a COVID-19 outbreak back then, news reports said on Tuesday.

At least nine Indians who attended the religious congregation have reportedly died of the viral infection so far. Six of them were from Telangana, and one each from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Jammu & Kashmir, a leading English daily reported on Tuesday.

The Malaysian woman, who tested positive on Tuesday, had come to Ranchi from New Delhi on March 17 by Rajdhani Express. After reaching Ranchi, she directly went to the mosque on Nala Road of Hindpiri – a busy locality off Mahatma Gandhi Road. Ranchi Senior Superintendent of Police Anish Gupta said, “Police personnel have been deployed at Hindpiri and people of the area have been asked to stay indoors. People who came in contact with the woman who tested positive should get themselves tested.”

Jharkhand, so far, was among the few States that did not witness a single case of coronavirus while many developed States like Maharashtra and Karnataka were facing a tough time curtailing the spread of the virus and providing health facilities to the ones infected.

However, the entry of the virus in the tribal State has run the alarm bells for the health machinery here, and shifted the focus to the other aspect of the pandemic – providing treatment to the infected persons, said Government sources. By now, the entire focus of the State was in spreading awareness and preventing the entry of the virus here.

Ranchi Deputy Commissioner Rai Mahimapat Ray on Tuesday requested the residents of the State capital to not pay attention to rumours. “The first positive case of COVID-19 was reported in Ranchi on Tuesday. Please do not pay attention to rumours. I request all of you to stay at home and take all preventive measures,” he said in a video released soon after the news about the first positive case went viral on social media.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/covid-19-enters-j---khand--malaysian-woman-tests--ve.html

109,01-4-20,Unprecedented: 5L Govt staff ‘retire from home’ in lockdown,"Unprecedented in its own unique way, the ongoing countrywide lockdown on Tuesday witnessed at least five lakh Government employees retiring from their years-long service confined within the four walls of their homes itself, sans any formal farewell in their respective departments which is a norm in usual circumstances.

The Department of Personnel and Training issued directions that irrespective of Government servants either working at home roster wise or working from office, those retiring on the last day of month (March 31) will ""retire from home"".

""In view of unprecedented situation arising out of the country wide lockdown declared by the Government consequent to the outbreak of COVID 19, it is clarified that the Central Government employees who are attaining the age of supperannuation on March 31, 2020 in terms of Fundamental Rule 56 and due to retire shall retire on March 31, 2020 irrespective of whether they are working from home or office,"" said the DoPT circular.

The Centre’s move seems to have been replicated by other State Governments too as at least eight of them confirmed that they also have allowed their superannuating employees to retire from home during the lockdown period. Tamil Nadu was an exception though with the State Government giving a two-month extension to doctors and nurses retiring on March 31.

Every month-end Government offices bid farewell to their retiring employees during the second half of the last day of months. ""This is perhaps unprecedented in independent India that employees will retire from home. The last day of months are emotionally filled for Government departments and employees as few of their three decades old colleagues will step off office. All of them celebrate this day and in some cases they also take out processions from office till the residence of the retiree. There will be no party time this time,"" said a DoPT source.

The official said the documents pertaining to financial disbursements and settlement will be done in due course and they will be intimated. The official explained that there are an estimated 2.20 crore central and state Government employees and that on an average 30 percent of the strengths retire annually which means five lakh average monthly of all class, groups and category.

On the day when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the country wide lockdown, the DoPT issued directives for Government employees on preventive measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 to remain in force till April 14.

“Heads of Department may ensure that 50 percent of Group B and C employees are required to attend office every day, and the remaining 50 per cent staff should be instructed to work from home. All HoDs are advised to draft a weekly roster of duty for Group B and C staff and ask them to attend office on alternate weeks,” said the order.

A top IAS (requesting anonymity), who retired serving a State Government, on Tuesday said indeed the retirement day brings both joy and anxiety. ""What can we do? But certainly feeling unhappy as I will not be able to celebrate the day with my colleagues with whom I spent half of our life.

111,01-4-20,Issue notification on deferment of EMIs for 3 months: Cong to Centre,"The Congress on Tuesday urged the Centre to increase coronavirus testing in the country and also issue a notification on deferment of EMI payment of loans during the lockdown period.

Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari further urged the government to make arrangements for procurement and storage of Rabi crop that is to be harvested in the next 15 days.

Referring to the religious congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area which left several people affected by the virus, he said at party's Press conference, addressed through video conferencing, that this is not the time for a blamegame.

""We request the finance minister to ensure that the RBI circular regarding EMIs (being deferred for three months) should be issued widely and that interest subvention arrangement should be made for the interest on the deferred EMI payments,"" he said.

Referring to lakhs of migrant labourers trying to reach their native places traversing long distances by foot, the Congress leader said, ""We request the government to make arrangements and ensure that those on the streets, desperately trying to get home should be helped in getting home safely.""

Calling upon the government to allow more testing to find out coronavirus positive cases, Tewari said something needs to be done to increase testing and ensure that India does not enter the community transmission stage of the disease.

Only four companies are currently manufacturing testing equipment in the country, while the government has given permission to 17 more firms, but not before they get FDA and European Union approval, he said.

It is not easy to get FDA or EU approval in the current scenario and hence ""we request the government to come up with a plan to get the maximum number of testing kits without compromising with the quality and make the same available across India"", the Congress leader said.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued an advisory and they are also emphasising on the need for conducting more tests, Tewari noted, adding that the only antidote to spread of COVID-19 is more testing.

India currently is the lowest tested nation in the world. COVID-19 is progressing towards phase three or community transmission and the only way to deal with it in a better manner is to conduct as many tests as possible, he said.

Tewari said, India''s ratio for coronavirus testing is the lowest at 32 for every 10 lakh people while in the UK it is 921 for every 10 lakh people and the USA it is 2,600 for every 10 lakh people.

Highlighting the problem of procurement that the Rabi crop producing states might be facing in the next few days, the Congress leader said 152.7 million tonnes of crop is expected to come in the market, which are currently shut due to the lockdown.

He feared the country would be faced by a big problem in the next 15 days on harvesting and storage of Rabi crop.

""We demand that the prime minister and the food minister to talk to state governments on how to make arrangement of harvesting and storage of Rabi crop,"" Tewari said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/issue-notification-on-deferment-of-emis-for-3-months--cong-to-centre.html
112,01-4-20,"With 82 fresh cases, Maha positive count at 302","In a record jump in the number of Covid-19 infected cases in Maharashtra, as many as 82 persons tested positive for the pandemic on Tuesday taking the total number of cases in the State to 302, even as Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to undertake surveillance on a war-footing for fresh cases in the metropolis.

Of the fresh infected cases, Mumbai accounted for a maximum of 59 cases, while 13 positive cases were reported from the city suburbs. Pune, Ahmednagar and Buldhana recorded five, three and two cases respectively.

Following the fresh cases, the total number of infected cases in Mumbai has risen to an alarming 151, followed by 48 cases in Pune, 36 cases in Thane and other districts surrounding Mumbai, 25 cases in Sangli, 16 cases in Nagpur, eight cases in Ahmednagar, four cases in Yavatmal, three cases in Buldhana, two cases each in Satara and Kolhapur and one case in Aurangabad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Jalgaon, Nashik and one case from Gujarat tested positive in Mumbai.

According to a medical bulletin released in the evening by the Public Health Department of the Maharashtra government, there are currently 23 Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-authorised laboratories – comprising 10 belonging to Government and 13 private ones – that are undertaking Covid-19 tests in the state.

As many as 406 persons have newly been admitted to various hospitals in the state. Since January 18, 6331 people have been hospitalized in various isolation wards across the state owing to them developing symptoms such as fever, cold, cough etc. Out of the total admissions, 5780 laboratory samples were negative and 302 have been tested positive for coronavirus until today,” the medical bulletin said.

“As many as 19,161 people are home quarantined in the state, while 1224 people are in institutional quarantine centres,” the bulletin said.

As many as 39 persons, who had earlier tested positive for Covid-19 but recovered later, had been discharged from various hospitals till Tuesday.

“As many as 23,913 people are home quarantined in the state, while 1234 people are in institutional quarantine centres. As a preventive measure, the state government has set up quarantine centres in all the district hospitals in the state,” the bulletin said.

In a related development, the chief minister directed the BMC to undertake door-to-door surveillance in each of the 227 civic wards in the metropolis to ascertain if there any fresh Covid-19 cases.

Interacting with the Assistant Municipal Commissioners and ward officer in various parts of Mumbai, Uddhav said: “Considering that the population is dense in Mumbai compared with other districts in the state, there is likelihood of increased spread of Coronavirus in the metropolis. Hence it is essential for the BMC to undertake surveillance of the pandemic on a war-footing. It is only through door-to-door surveillance that the BMC will be able to take measures to arrest the spread of the pandemic”.

The chief minister said that after the detection of a Coronavirus case, the entire Worli’s Koliwada locality had been declared as the pandemic-affected areas. “We will have to undertake similar measures in other affected areas in the metropolis”.

Uddhav lamented that in order to reduce inconvenience to the citizens, the state government had ordered that the shops of essential commodities be kept open for all 24 hours. “But the people are taking advantage of the situation and are leaving their homes on a shopping spree. If this continues, we will have no alternative but to stop to this facility to let citizens purchase essential commodities at any time of the time of day and night,” the chief minister said.

Meanwhile, the BMC has decided to requisition rooms in private buildings, lodges, hotels and ships. An order issued by Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi stated that “the Assistant Commissioners of Wards are authorised to requisition the empty residential buildings, lodges, hotels, dharmashalas, clubs, gymkhanas, exhibition centres, colleges, hostels, dormitories, cruise, ships, marriage halls, banquet halls with immediate effect”.

In the Mumbai metropolitan region the unsold housing inventory is close to 2.10 lakh units and that of Mumbai around 1 lakh units.

Parseshi said that the high-risk and low risk people who came in contact with positive Covid-19 patients in some particular buildings/areas/localities were living in very small houses. Besides, the localities being dense, they are using sanitation facilities and are vulnerable to get infected. Hence, they need to be shifted from such places urgently to avoid spread of virus.

“Many places in possession of private parties are lying vacant because of India lockdown,” he said, as he directed that the Assistant Commissioners can use these vacant rooms for quarantining persons who had come in contact with Covid -19 patients.

According to the order, the Assistant Commissioners will provide for food and basic arrangements in these quarantining places. Separate orders for payment to owners and food arrangements would be issued, the Municipal Commissioner said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/with-82-fresh-cases--maha-positive-count-at-302.html
113,01-4-20,"Over 3,000 prisoners freed in Bengal to negate threat","Over 3,000 undertrials and convicted prisoners have been freed by the West Bengal Government to prevent the spread of the coronavirus infection, a senior Minister said on Tuesday.

The decision came following a Supreme Court directive and unrest among jailbirds in various correctional homes (as prisons are called in Bengal) after the coronavirus outbreak in the state.

""On Monday, 3,076 inmates from 60 correctional homes were released. Due to the ongoing lockdown in the country, the freed jailbirds are being driven to their respective homes by the correctional home administration by following all norms of hygiene and social distancing,"" state Correctional Services Minister Ujjal Biswas told IANS.

The released prisoners included 2,059 undertrials who have been granted interim bail. Besides, 1,017 convicts have also been set free on a three-month parole.

Biswas said the decision was taken in view of the near impossible task of following the social distancing norms with so many prisoners lodged in correctional homes, which now house around 2,000 prisoners.

The minister said the prisoners were being taken home in separate vehicles meant for each of the districts considering the present situation related to COVID 19.

""All prisoners will be dropped off within the next four-five days,"" he said.

At least four prisoners had died and a number of police personnel sustained injuries on March 21-22 at the Dum Dum Central Jail after angry correctional home inmates indulged in arson and attacked security forces protesting against the bar on meeting family members and the increasing number of pending cases due to the temporary closure of courts owing to the coronavirus scare.

Demanding that they be released forthwith for their safety, the undertials had brickbatted the jail guards and tried to demolish the prison walls in order to escape.

The police resorted to lobbing tear gas shells, and opened fire after the situation worsened.

""We had then taken a decision to release the convicts on parole. The undertrials were aggrieved and became violent demanding they be released,"" Biswas said.

With the correctional homes now less crowded, authorities are taking all measures to ensure strict compliance of hygiene and social distancing norms on the part of the prisoners and the jail staff.

""There is now adequate number of hand sanitisers and masks in the correctional homes. In fact, the prisoners had been drafted in making masks and manufacturing hand santisiers considering their vast requirement in the state.

""The violent agitation has, however, hampered these activities,"" he said.

Biswas said that a number of convicts have donated money to the Chief Minister's relief fund from the money they are paid as daily wages.

""For instance, a group of convicts in Midnapore Central Correctional Home has donated Rs 50,000-Rs 60,000,"" he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/over-3-000-prisoners-freed-in-bengal-to-negate-threat.html

116,01-4-20,Bengal sends over 1L people to isolation,"While Bengal reported its third death on Tuesday the State sent more than one lakh people to home quarantine amid fear of rising corona cases, Health Department sources said.

In what was denounced by the doctors as a ""regretful consequence of irresponsible conduct of citizens"" despite all-out efforts made by the Mamata Banerjee Government to insulate the State from corona infection the administration had to send more than a lakh people to compulsory home isolation in the past 24 hours.

This pushed the number of total home quarantine cases to 150,391. On Monday the corresponding figure was 47,091 cases.

“All these people have been asked to remain isolated in their houses,” a senior Government official said questioning the sense of responsibility and alertness among citizens many of who have been taking the lockdown as vacation.

“While some of the quarantined people were in contact with some infected person under treatment others have a travel history and yet others have shown signs of suspected Corona infection,” the official maintained.

The Home Ministry sources also said that there could be about 73 people from Bengal who had returned from the Tableeghi Jamaat in Delhi’s Hazrat Nizamuddin and the administration was trying to locate them.

A new hotspot of Corona outbreak the Tabligh-e-Jamaat congregation organized from March 13-15 was attended by 3,000 delegates, including scholars from countries severely affected by the Corona outbreak. The congregation has reportedly infected dozens of people in Delhi and elsewhere.

The lone death was reported in a Howrah hospital where a middle-aged woman succumbed to the disease sources said adding the State had in the past 24 hours reported four new cases of infection taking the total number of Corona cases up from 22 to 26.

Out of the four one is a middle-aged fast food seller from Belghoria in North 24 Parganas in the northern suburbs of Kolkata and has no travel history, sources said adding though his rerlative had travelled in from Mumbai. The patient is known to be in a critical condition and has been put on ventilation. A second case was reported from Daspur in West Midnapore district.

Another case was reported from a South Kolkata hospital where a functionary of a social services organization was found to be infected. Officials said he might have contacted the disease while distributing relief among a target group.

Meanwhile, providing relief to the municipal tax payers the Kolkata Municipal Corporation has extended the date of depositing property tax for the fourth and final quarter of the year 2019-2020.

Mayor Firhad Hakim said “those who were required to pay the tax byMarch 31 will now have to pay it by the end of June.

117,01-4-20,Boost immune system to fight corona: Prof Hegde,"While the whole world is worried over the havoc being caused by COVID 19 virus and the disease by name corona, there is an Indian medical doctor who had prophesied about this disease way back in 2006. Prof B M Hegde, a leading cardiologist and former chancellor of Manipal University had written that a disease like this would strike the world with vengeance and claim millions of lives.

Prof Hegde had warned about this medical phenomenon in his path-breaking book “What Doctors Don’t Get to Study in Medical School” which he authored in 2006 and was published with a foreword by Rustum Roy, renowned scientist.

Speaking to The Pioneer over telephone from Mangalore on Tuesday, Prof Hegde pointed out that the world is yet to find out a cure for influenza (the common cold) and the solution lies in the Indian system of knowledge. “The best solution to fight corona is to strengthen our immune system. Our immune system will function at its best when we are happy. Fear weakens the immune system. Ignorance is the root cause of fear. So let us not worry about this enigma ,” he said.

He wrote in the 2006 book that the variants of influenza have symptoms of runny nose, headache of varying severity, body aches and pains, high fever, with or without pneumonia presenting as cough and breathlessness with scanty sputum. “In severe cases signs of respiratory failure set in rapidly and might end up with bleeding and disseminated intravascular coagulation and multi-organ failure. Bleeding is more common in those with gastric type of flu. Those who present with gastric flu will have severe loss of appetite, diarrhea, vomiting and even bleeding per rectum and occasionally hematemesis,” wrote Prof Hegde. (Page 387)

Dr B Madhu, one of the leading physicians in Kerala, said that these are the true symptoms of Corona virus infected persons. But what shocked even a seasoned physician like Dr Madhu was the prophesy made by Prof Hegde in the next paragraphs in which he has given an account of his encounter with the 1968 influenza pandemic in Britain. “In the last 400 years , there were 12 pandemics, roughly three per century. We had three in the last century. Spanish flu of 1918where there were a total of 640 million clinical attacks, 50 per cent of the then population of 1.2 billion with 12.5 per cent case fatality ratio with 80 million dead,” wrote Prof Hegde. Comparing the present (2006) with the previous pandemics caused by different variants, he had warned that if the past trends persist in 2006, ‘we should expect total deaths of 2-3 billion what with the population now at 6.6 billion’. But what he wrote next has shaken the world now. In 2006 itself he had scientifically prophesized that the next pandemic could throw all our systems out of gear. “The worst would be that all our hospitals , put together will not be able to cater to even 10 per cent of patients. This virus spreads even without contact with patients. Their coughing into the air will disseminate the virus in the atmosphere. Touching a patient, his clothes, or even shaking hands and staying in the vicinity could all spread the disease. Door knobs and counter tops can harbor the virus for days. Medical care workers are at great risk, Crowding and slum swelling could increase the incidence and case fatality. Society will have to take the responsibility of looking after the sick in the eventuality of hospitals getting clogged,” wrote Prof Hegde.

Almost 15 years later, Prof Hegde is cynical about the search for a vaccine by medical researchers. “They toiled hard from 1949 to 1999 in the Cold Research Laboratory in London for a vaccine to counter our common cold and spent billions of pound sterling. Their biggest contribution was that they told the world that they couldn’t find out a medicine for common cold and hence they were winding up the research. But they told the world that the Indian wisdom of eating spices when you have cold is the best result that can happen.

A research by Harvard Medical school has shown that fresh ginger, garlic, pepper, onion and a combination of honey are the most anti-viral agent known to mankind,” said Prof Hegde while speaking about the claims and counter claims by corona researchers

Dr Madhu is of the view that the findings by Prof Hegde is the result of a kind of sixth sense developed by one’s deep insight into the world of medical science.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/boost-immune-system-to-fight-corona--prof-hegde.html

119,01-4-20,Rabi crops to be affected for want of farm workers,"With Rabi crops' harvesting likely to pick up in the coming days, the mass exodus of agricultural labourers due to the spread of coronarvius outbreak and the subsequent lockdown have left farmers worried and clueless across the country.

It's not just in Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and Telangana that the farmers are worried due to the exodus of migrant labourers, those in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh too are a concerned lot. These States heavily depend on the migrant labour force for harvesting, loading and unloading of their produce for transportation. Moreover, farmers from Bihar and eastern UP, who depended on the mechanical combine harvesters owned by their Punjab and Haryana counterparts, are also stuck in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat, which harvest their wheat earlier than the northern States.

According to farmers, the wheat harvest is expected to begin from the first week of April in Punjab, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Haryana while in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Bihar, it started after Holi.

Farmers are currently about to harvest —if they haven’t already — wheat, mustard, chana (chickpea), matar (field pea), potato, onion, garlic, zeera (cumin seed), coriander, fennel, red chilli, grapes, and other seasonal fruits and vegetables.

According to Yudhvir Singh of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, the nationwide lockdown and mass exodus of farm labourers have disrupted the harvest season in Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh. Most of the agricultural workers in Haryana and Punjab come from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and will not be there for this harvesting season. Those who went to home for holi have not returned. The rabi crops are ready for harvest but there is no labourers,"" Singh added. Amardeep Singh, a farmer from Pandher Kalan village in Amritsar said that he called his labourers to return but they are reluctant.

""The wheat crop is ready to harvest. But there are no labours. Farmers having large farms are taking care of their labourers and those workers stay put. But most of the farmers can’t afford to do it,” said Singh. The real issue at this juncture was completing the harvesting of wheat and mustard. It is also estimated that about eight lakh migrant workers are there in Punjab in agriculture.

Farmers in Haryana are also facing a similar situation due to exodus of farm labourers. It is estimated that three to four lakh farm labourers in the State are from UP and Bihar. “My crop will be ready for harvesting in next 9-10 days, if the weather is clear. But I am nervous about how I will harvest it,” said Karnal's Jagtap Bhatti, who has sown wheat in 20 acres .",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/rabi-crops-to-be-affected-for-want-of-farm-workers.html

CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said even if global economies and other sectors of the Indian economy bounce back sooner than expected, Indian traders are likely to pay a higher price and the strenuous ramifications will reverberate for a much longer time than expected.

“I just think that all teams must get equal opportunities in the championship even if matches are rescheduled,” he said during a video conference with the media on Tuesday.

“Whenever cricket resumes all teams should get equal opportunity in the ICC World Test Championship to try to play in the final. The tournament can be extended beyond 2021,” he said.

According to the original schedule, the inaugural competition runs from 2019-2021.

Misbah also said that if teams didn’t get equal opportunity to play in the championship, results would not be fair.

The ICC has indicated that it would talk to member boards to find a solution to the matches of the championship which will be hit by the pandemic and one option which will be discussed would be awarding points for cancelled matches.

“The tournament should be extended that is my view. That is the only way we can find and end the event in a balanced way. Matches can be rescheduled if the event is extended,” he said.

After the Test against Bangladesh, Pakistan’s next assignment of C’ship is a Test series in England in July.

Misbah said since that series was very important, he had already asked all the players who are in isolation to keep working on their fitness and also study the strengths and weaknesses of the England team.

“I have been in touch with most of the players including centrally contracted players…even trainer is in touch with them…we are giving them and sending them plans according to their equipment at home to remain in shape as a team.

“I want the physical condition of players to be what is required in Test whenever cricket resumes,” he said.

135,01-4-20,"Need to build manufacturing base for PPE, ventilators: Niti CEO","Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant on Wednesday said there is a need to build a manufacturing base for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and ventilators not only for the Covid-19 outbreak but for the future as well.

Kant, who heads the empowered group on coordinating with private sector NGOs and international organisations for the Covid-19 pandemic, was chairing the second meeting with representatives of industry.

""There is a need to build a manufacturing base for PPEs & ventilators not only for #COVID19 response but for the future as well, in line with our objective of accelerating the #MakeInIndia resolve,"" the Niti Aayog said in a tweet quoting Kant.

The group headed by Kant is one of the 11 empowered groups of officers constituted by Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla for planning and ensuring implementation of Covid-19 response activities.

Kant brought to notice of the Empowered Committee 6 for Covid-19 that augmenting supply of oxygen is the need of the hour and will be key, hand in hand with manufacturing ventilators during this period, it added.

CII Director General Chandrajit Bannerjee updated the committee on the various Covid-19 response measures being taken, including healthcare product augmentation, policy inputs, relief and information dissemination taken up by industry body CII and its affiliated industry leaders.

Chairman and Managing Director of Medanta - The Medicity, Naresh Trehan informed the committee on the important safety protocols and features required in ventilators for efficient management of Covid -19 patients, it added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/need-to-build-manufacturing-base-for-ppe--ventilators--niti-ceo-2020-04-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/need-to-build-manufacturing-base-for-ppe--ventilators--niti-ceo.html
136,01-4-20,China’s vaccine for virus may be tested abroad,"China, which is developing a vaccine for the deadly novel coronavirus, plans to conduct additional trials in other countries seriously hit by the pandemic if the ongoing trial in the country’s virus epicentre Wuhan proves it is safe and effective, a Chinese researcher said.

The first stage clinical trial for the vaccine was started in Wuhan on March 16 after authorities approved. It has been proceeding smoothly, and its results will be published in April, said Chen Wei, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.

The vaccine will also be tried on foreigners based in China, Chen said.

Wuhan, the capital of China’s Hubei province, bore the brunt of the virus outbreak for over two months and currently the city of 11 million is returning to normal after the virus cases abated in recent days.

“If the initial results prove the vaccine is safe and produces (desired) effects, we will continue to test its effectiveness overseas through international cooperation if the global epidemic continues to spread,” Chen was quoted as saying by the state-run China Daily on Tuesday.

In this way, the vaccine may be used in other hard-hit countries as soon as possible to bolster their efforts to control the pandemic, said Chen, who is also a researcher at the Academy of Military Sciences.

Many countries have shown interest in the vaccine, Chen said, adding that she and her team members are willing to cooperate with their international counterparts in the development of vaccines for the highly infectious disease.

Before putting the vaccine in trials in other countries, domestic trials may include foreigners living in China, she said. “A vaccine may be the most effective solution to ending the global COVID-19 epidemic,” she said.

It is still not known when the vaccine will gain approval for use, as it must be proved safe and effective first, Chen said, but she is confident in its early availability for use.

Following the outbreak of COVID-19, many other Chinese institutes are also stepping up efforts to develop vaccines for the disease.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/china---s-vaccine-for-virus-may-be-tested-abroad.html
137,01-4-20,"Coronavirus found in sputum, faeces of patients with -ve COVID-19 pharyngeal swabs","Chinese doctors have found the novel coronavirus in the sputum and faecal samples of some patients with negative pharyngeal swabs for COVID-19. The study, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, found that some patients had positive, real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results for SARS-CoV-2 in the sputum or faeces after the pharyngeal swabs became negative.

Pharyngeal swabs are widely used to determine the appropriateness for a patient’s discharge from the hospital and whether isolation continues to be required, said researchers from the Capital Medical University in China.

These findings raise concerns over whether patients with negative pharyngeal swabs are truly virus-free or if sampling of additional body sites might be needed.

The clinicians retrospectively identified a convenience sample of patients admitted to Beijing Ditan Hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and paired RT-PCR testing of pharyngeal swabs with either sputum or faeces.

Among 133 patients admitted with COVID-19 from January 20 to February 27, 2020, the researchers identified 22 with an initial or follow-up positive sputum or faecal samples paired with a follow-up negative pharyngeal sample.

RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV2 of sputum and faeces was seen up to 39 and

13 days, respectively, after the obtained pharyngeal samples were negative.

The researchers caution that the study was not carried out in a systematic fashion with sampling of all patients in a protocolised manner, and it is not known whether these positive sputum or faecal results indicate that the patient could still be infectious to others.

However, the findings are potentially important because they suggest that more study is needed in this area, the researchers said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/coronavirus-found-in-sputum--faeces-of-patients-with--ve-covid-19-pharyngeal-swabs.html
138,01-4-20,Aussie drinkers told to limit daily booze buying,"Hard-drinking Australians were told on Tuesday to limit themselves to buying just 12 bottles of wine and two cases of beer a day as a coronavirus lockdown saw panic buying of alcohol.

Major retailers agreed to enforce new rules limiting individual purchases as Australians went on a booze-buying spree amid a shutdown of non-essential services — including pubs and bars. “It was clear that uncertainty on the impact of supply... Caused some people to purchase differently,” Retail Drinks chief executive Julie Ryan said in a statement launching the restrictions.

Australian social media has been awash with video and pictures of shoppers loading supermarket trolleys with alcohol in the face of lockdowns that could last weeks. According to the World Health Organisation, Australians aged over 15 consume an average 12.6 litres of alcohol a year — second only to the Czech Republic.

Restrictions come as data from Commonwealth Bank — one of country’s biggest financial institutions — showed spending on alcohol at bottle shops jumped 86% last week as drinkers migrated from bars to backyards. “These temporary measures will ensure that all consumers can continue to access their favourite drinks when they decide to make a purchase,” Ryan said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/aussie-drinkers-told-to-limit-daily-booze-buying.html

140,01-4-20,US extends Iran nuclear cooperation sanctions waivers,"The Trump administration on Monday renewed several waivers on US Sanctions against Iran, allowing Russian, European and Chinese companies to continue to work on Iran’s civilian nuclear facilities without drawing American penalties.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo signed off on the waiver extensions but couched the decision as one that continues restrictions on Iran’s atomic work. “Iran’s continued expansion of nuclear activities is unacceptable.

The regime’s nuclear extortion is among the greatest threats to international peace and security,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement. Current and former officials familiar with the matter said Pompeo had opposed extending the waivers, which are among the few remaining components of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that the administration has not canceled. However, the officials said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had prevailed in an internal debate on the subject last week by arguing that the coronavirus pandemic made eliminating the waivers unpalatable at a time when the administration is being criticised for refusing to ease sanctions to deal with the outbreak.

The officials were not authorised to publicly discuss the decision and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Last week, the administration slapped new sanctions on 20 Iranian people and companies for supporting Shia militia in Iraq held responsible for attacks on bases where US Forces are located. At the same time, however, it extended another sanctions waiver to allow energy-starved Iraq to keep importing Iranian power.

President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018 and has steadily reimposed US sanctions on Iran that had been eased or lifted under its terms. The so-called “civilian-nuclear cooperation” waivers allow foreign companies to do work at some of Iran’s declared nuclear sites without becoming subject to US sanctions.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us-extends-iran-nuclear-cooperation-sanctions-waivers.html

Asia stocks picked up the baton from a rally on Monday that saw all three of Wall Street’s main indices jump more than three per cent. That carried through to Europe, where gains averaged more than one per cent in midday trading. But as the open of trade approached in New York, European gains stocks bobbed in and out of positive territory.

Meanwhile, Wall Street opened lower, with the Dow giving up 0.5 per cent in the first minutes of trading. The dollar was higher, while the euro came under pressure from data showing inflation in the eurozone fell in March on a slump in energy prices caused by the coronavirus outbreak. “China provided Western investors with a light at the end of the tunnel,” said Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex trading group. China’s manufacturing sector saw surprise growth in March, having been mauled in February as the country went into lockdown to tackle the virus. China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index, a key gauge of factory activity, jumped to 52.0 from a record low 35.7 the month before. Anything above 50 is considered growth.

In the current financial year 2019-20, the actual disinvestment mop-up has come in at Rs 50,298.64 crore. In the Revised Estimates (RE), the government had estimated the disinvestment proceeds at Rs 65,000 crore, thus a shortfall of around Rs 14,700 crore.

In the Budget 2019-20, disinvestment revenue was pegged at Rs 1.05 lakh crore. However, in the RE, the projection was lowered substantially to Rs 65,000 crore.

In the current financial year, the Government has raised Rs 11,500 crore by way of strategic disinvestment of THDC and NEEPCO to state-owned power utility NTPC. Also, Kamarajar Port was sold for Rs 2,383 crore to Chennai Port Trust.

In the financial year 2015-16, the Government had realised Rs 23,996.80 crore from CPSE disinvestment, lower than the Budget target of Rs 69,500 crore and RE of Rs 25,312 crore.

In the financial year 2016-17, the Government had missed the budgeted disinvestment target. While the Budget had pegged target at Rs 56,500 crore, the Government was able to mop up Rs 46,247 crore.

144,01-4-20,"Sensex rallies 1,028 pts","Equity indices notched up smart gains on the last day of 2019-20 on Tuesday, but ended deep in the red for the fiscal as the global coronavirus pandemic triggered record-shattering selloffs in March.

The 30-share BSE Sensex traded in the positive zone throughout the session, ending 1,028.17 points or 3.62 per cent higher at 29,468.49 on across-the-board buying.

Similarly, the NSE Nifty rose 316.65 points, or 3.82 per cent, to close at 8,597.75. During the financial year 2019-20, the Sensex plunged 9,204.42 points or 23.80 per cent, while the Nifty sank 3,026.15 points or 26.03 per cent.

Both the benchmarks posted their biggest ever one-day falls in March, in tandem with other global markets, as investors fled risky assets amid the Covid-19 outbreak.

ITC was the top gainer in the Sensex pack on Tuesday, rallying 7.84 per cent, followed by index heavyweight Reliance Industries, ONGC, Tata Steel, Tech Mahindra, Sun Pharma and SBI.

Only four index components closed with losses — IndusInd Bank (14.68 per cent), Maruti (1.23 per cent), Bajaj Finance (1.17 per cent) and Titan (1.13 per cent).

According to traders, domestic investors turned positive amid rebound in global peers as most Asian benchmarks ended higher on recovery in China’s manufacturing during March as authorities relaxed anti-disease controls and allowed factories to reopen.

China’s manufacturing PMI rose to 52 in March from a record-low of 35.7 in February. “Mirroring positive global market, Indian markets also reacted positively on the last day of the financial year. Almost all sectoral indices were up and volatility index was also down by 10 per cent.

“Chinese economic data... Improved and helped the global momentum, especially in Metals, Pharma and FMCG. FII selling also slowed down over the last two days, although that may not be sustainable. The performance of global market will be the key driver for Indian market in the near-term,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) turned net sellers in the capital market, as they offloaded equity shares worth Rs 3,044.94 crore on Tuesday, according to provisional exchange data.

According to S Hariharan, Head - Sales Trading, Emkay Global Financial Services: For the month of April, macro risk appetite driven by news flow around potential peaking of fresh COVID-19 cases would be the key driving force for foreign flows, while domestic funds continue to use the correction to increase equities allocation in dynamic asset allocation funds.

On the global front, bourses in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul were in the red, while those in Shanghai were trading on a positive note. Benchmark exchanges on Wall Street too ended with losses in overnight trade.

149,01-4-20,Worldwide lockdown hardens as Spain sees deadliest day,"Tightened lockdowns across the planet saw nearly half of humanity told to stay at home in a bid to stem the spiralling coronavirus pandemic, as Spain recorded its deadliest day on Tuesday and the United States braced for the full impact of the disease.

The US death toll from the coronavirus climbed past 3,500, eclipsing China’s official count, as New York’s mammoth convention center started taking patients to ease the burden on the city’s overwhelmed health system and the tennis centre where the US Open is held was being turned into a hospital.

Elsewhere around the world, hard-hit Italy reported that the infection rate appears to be leveling off and new cases could start declining, but that the crisis is far from over. Spain, too, struggled to fend off the collapse of its hospital system. Vladimir Putin’s Russia moved to crack down on quarantine violations and “fake news” about the outbreak. And China edged closer to normal as stores in the epicenter city of Wuhan began reopening.

Worldwide, more than 8,00,000 people have been infected and over 40,000 people have died, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. Italy and Spain accounted for half the deaths, while the US had around 3,550 by midday, eclipsing China’s official toll of about 3,300.

New York was the nation’s deadliest hot spot, with about 1,550 deaths statewide, the majority of them in New York City.

A Navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds that docked in New York on Monday was expected to begin accepting non-coronavirus patients on Tuesday. A 1,000-bed emergency hospital set up at the Javits Convention Center began taking patients Monday night. And the Billie Jean King USTA National Tennis Center was being transformed into a hospital.

The crisis became personal for the governor with word that his brother was infected. Chris Cuomo tweeted that he suffered fever, chills and shortness of breath but will continue broadcasting from his basement.

On Monday, the governor pleaded for help from volunteer medical workers, and close to 80,000 former nurses, doctors and other professionals were already said to be stepping forward.

New York City sought to bring in 250 out-of-town ambulances and 500 paramedics and emergency medical technicians to help its swamped EMS system. The city’s ambulances are responding to about 6,000 calls a day, or 50% more than average, authorities said. Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said a five-day stretch last week was the busiest in the history of the city’s EMS operation.

Figures on deaths and infections around the world are supplied by government health authorities and compiled by Johns Hopkins. But the figures are regarded with skepticism by public health experts because of different counting practices, a lack of testing in places, the numerous mild cases that have been missed, and perhaps government efforts to downplay the severity of the crisis.

For example, Italy’s emergency coordinator, Domenico Arcuri, acknowledged that officials don’t have a handle on how many people outside of hospitals are contracting the virus and how many of those are dying at home or in nursing homes.

Still, there was a glimmer of hope in Italy: Dr Silvio Brusaferro, the head of Italy’s national institutes of health, said that three weeks into a national lockdown, the hardest-hit country in Europe is seeing the rate of new infections level off.

“The curve suggests we are at the plateau,” he said. “We have to confirm it, because arriving at the plateau doesn’t mean we have conquered the peak and we’re done. It means now we should start to see the decline if we continue to place maximum attention on what we do every day.”

With the country’s health care system buckling under the pressure, an intensive care field hospital, built in just 10 days, was unveiled at the Milan fairgrounds.

“We made a promise and we kept it,” said the head of the project, former civil protection chief Guido Bertolaso, who ended up catching the virus while on the job and had to work from his hospital bed.

In Russia, lawmakers approved harsher punishments, including prison of several years, for violating quarantine rules and spreading misinformation. The chief doctor at Moscow’s top hospital for coronavirus patients said he tested positive for the virus, a week after shaking hands with Putin.

Spain reported more than 840 new deaths, pushing the death toll above 8,000 and forcing Madrid to open a second temporary morgue after an ice rink pressed into service last week became overwhelmed.

Dozens of hotels across Spain have been turned into recovery rooms for patients in less-serious condition, and authorities are building field hospitals in sports centers, libraries and exhibition halls.

A 12-year-old girl became the youngest person to die in Belgium, though it was not disclosed whether she suffered from any underlying condition.

In Florida, the Holland America cruise line pleaded with state officials to let two ships dock and carry off the sick and the dead. But Gov. Ron Santis said on Fox News: “We cannot afford to have people who are not even Floridians dumped into South Florida using up those valuable resources.”

Dozens on one of the ships have reported flu-like symptoms, and four people have died.

For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause severe symptoms like pneumonia.

China on Tuesday reported just one new death from the coronavirus and 48 new cases, claiming that all new infections came from overseas. In Wuhan, people were ready to “revenge shop” as the Chinese city that was once at the center of the outbreak reopened.

Still, Dr Takeshi Kasai, the World Health Organisation’s regional director for the Western Pacific, cautioned, however, that the risk in Asia and the Pacific “will not go away as long as the pandemic continues.”

“This is going to be a long-term battle and we cannot let down our guard,” Kasai said. “We need every country to keep responding according to their local situation.”

In Serbia, Hungary and other nations, concerns were rising that populist leaders were using the situation to seize more power and silence critics.

Executive MBA is aptly suited for professionals who have at least a few years of managerial experience. It gives them an opportunity to upskill, reskill or cross-skill for further career advancement. However, the duration of Executive MBA ranges from one to two years, which means that you have to allocate dedicated time and efforts along with a considerable amount of money. It’s only natural that you want to find out whether doing an Executive MBA yield expected results in terms of return on your investment and career growth.

So, before you enrol yourself in an Executive MBA programme, ask yourself these questions to arrive at the right decision.

Why should I do an Executive MBA?

List down the benefits you are expecting from this programme. You may want to acquire new skills to make a career switch to another company, get a promotion, diversify your professional interests or seek offshore employment. It is important that you chart out your career goals for the next 8-12 years so that you can determine whether an Executive MBA will fulfil your future professional aspirations and skills/qualifications required for that.

Will I be able to devote time and money after enrolling in an Executive MBA?

The course fee of Executive MBA can cost you anywhere between Rs 40,000 and Rs 10-Rs 15 lakh, depending on the institute, duration of the programme (one to two years) and whether it is part-time/full-time/online or correspondence. You can either quit your current job or continue working to pursue an Executive MBA as per your personal and professional circumstances. You need to figure out whether you can afford the cost of the programme and allocate the required time and efforts to complete it.

Which institute should I choose?

The choice of an institute shouldn’t be driven by the cheapest fee factor. You should consider comparing the institutes on the following parameters:

Reputation and affiliation of the institute

Number of years since the institute was established or offering the programme, also the track record of the institute.

Quality of faculty

Course structure — whether it covers the subjects and specialisation you are looking at

Duration of the course

Placement record and average salary — if you are planning a job change

What is the quality of the candidates?

An Executive MBA programme may require you to spend time with fellow participants in the class or group projects. It also gives you an opportunity to gain a diverse perspective and grow your professional network. You can check the institute’s alumni network, interact with existing students or talk to other aspirants applying in the same institute to understand whether you will be able to fit into the crowd.

What is the ROI?

This is a crucial question to analyse the financial aspect of the program. The entire cost of the program should be worth the value you are expecting. Apart from the fee of the course, you should also consider commuting, accommodation, study material, meals, student loan and any other expenses applicable in your case. Ideally, you should be able to cover the total cost within a year or two after completion of the course.

Evaluate these questions thoroughly, get some advice from people you trust and find out information from the institute to arrive at the right decision.

155,01-4-20,Adaptation is key,"Education is undergoing a sea change due to technological advancement and Internet penetration, paving way for blended learning, says AMOL ARORA

The use of the Internet and other technologies in imparting education has exploded in the recent years. With digitisation making its way into the education sector, blended learning has found its space in the classrooms, and is on its way to become the new norm. Blended learning, also known as hybrid learning, is nothing but a union of online and face-to-face instructions for better learning outcomes.

It is a combination of classroom-based learning and web-based content. Online resources, together with in-person instructions create a more personalised learning environment for students. The prevalence of digital and social media in our lives has made blended learning more of a necessity than an upcoming trend. It is a flexible concept that empowers both students and facilitators, and should be adapted in every school.

Blended teaching methodologies offer students a wider perspective and an enhanced learning experience that goes beyond what face-to-face or online modes can do alone. There are different ways in which online and face-to-face instructions are combined:

Rotation model

Here the instructor plans as to how and when students rotate between different learning modalities (at least one being online) within a course or subject. There are four Rotation sub-models:

Station rotation model: This model is common for elementary classes where teachers are familiar with rotating between learning stations. Here, students rotate through fixed schedules, with at least one of the stations being an online learning station.

Lab rotation model: Here, school computer labs are utilised in a new way by the teachers, where students are allowed to rotate from station to station on a fixed schedule.

Flipped classroom model: In this model, traditional roles are switched as students are introduced to online content at home, while they revise and practice it in school in the presence of their teacher and peers.

Individual rotation model: Here the instructor or a software algorithm set individual schedules for every student and they rotate to planned activities on different stations based on their playlist.

Flex-Model

Here, online learning is the driving factor behind student learning, even if students are occasionally directed towards offline activities. Resources are made available for students to move on a fluid schedule across learning modalities. Majority of the learning takes place in the school campus where teachers can be contacted for help and provide individual tutoring and face-to-face support.

A la Carte ModeL

Students decide for themselves, if they want to supplement their regular courses with online offerings at other institutions.

REMOTE model

Here, students’ main focus is on finishing online coursework. They don’t interact with teacher face-to-face on a daily basis, but only at the beginning or the conclusion of an online course.

Things to be kept in mind while implementing blended learning

There is no standard approach to it: We need to decide on how our blend looks like. What all face-to-face components are substituted with online instructions widely varies depending upon course instructional goals, teacher experience, teaching style, learner characteristics, developmental level, and resources available online.

You need a good chunk of time to switch to hybrid: Redesigning a traditional course into a hybrid one takes time - sometimes up to 6 months. It takes time and commitment to merge the blended learning processes in the existing courses effectively and to achieve the goals of the course with appropriate teaching methods.

Just start small and keep it simple: New learning technologies, for example podcasting, internet-based audio and video communication, e-portfolios, web-annotation and social networking tools including blogs, websites and wikis are creating new blending potentials. Out of these many possible learning technologies available, teachers need to choose wisely to come up with their personalised blended course.

Give students time to grasp the hybrid concept: It is important for teachers to communicate their intentions behind the approach at the onset of the academic term. Students need to be made aware of the technologies in use, their responsibility for personal learning as well as time management requirements.

Some of the key challenges of teaching in a blended format from the faculty perspective are the time commitment, lack of support for course redesign, difficulty in acquiring new teaching and technology skills, and the risk factors associated with this type of course. Blended learning will not fulfill its promise of improved learning unless teachers are encouraged to re-think and redesign courses that offer students varied and better learning experiences than those offered by either online or classroom teaching alone.

Despite all the above challenges, blended learning has increased rapidly, driven by evidence of its advantages over either online or classroom teaching. There is enough evidence to suggest the enormous potential blended learning has - all that is required is the adequate professional development of the teachers. Opportunities need to be provided to the teachers to incorporate online learning components into their classrooms. Institutions and teachers together can make the most of the opportunities presented by blended learning.

156,01-4-20,‘There’s need to embrace technology’,"In order to keep up with changing times, it is necessary to get rid of the hindrances that impact education, says UTTARA SINGH

All of us know the importance of education and its role in transforming our lives. The education sector has undergone a major catharsis in the last decade, thanks to technology that made its way into the sector and deeply impacted it. Undoubtedly, the Government and institutions have been making untiring efforts to reform the existing education model; however, there are still several issues, the nation is grappling with, which is hindering the sector from realisng its huge potential. These are the issues that need immediate addressal. Key areas of improvement:

Rote learning

We have come a long way with time, however, we still have not been able to detach ourselves from rote learning and focus on conceptual learning. Many schools are leading and changing the system at their level but only a small population has access to it and not everybody can afford the education they are offering.

Therefore, it becomes important for the government to take the onus of responsibility to introduce and implement effective strategies and eradicate rote learning from the schools at all levels.

The Government should come forward and encourage schools to introduce conceptual learning which avoids rote learning. This will not only help students to understand the concepts in a better way but will also help them to apply them effectively.

Introduction of technology

In today’s time, refraining from technology means going against the wind! In this renaissance of technology, the education system cannot afford to function in silos. Our education system must whole-heartedly embrace technology and pass it on to students as their future relies on it. Students must be taught about technology right from the early years of their education so that they do not face any problems in the future. Moreover, they should be taught to use it wisely and cautiously.

Evaluation system

In the present education system, marks still play a crucial role in assessing a student’s ability and deciding their future. The pressure of obtaining good marks often leaves the students burdened and makes them underperform.

Instead of evaluating a student’s knowledge by a three-hour exam, more impetus should be given to communication skills, leadership skills, classroom participation, projects and extra-curricular activities.

A healthy mix of subjects

We all grew up hearing that the sharpest minds opt for Science and Humanities was considered second best. Students should be given the option of choosing subjects that interest them. A more liberal mix of subjects should be encouraged so as to enable students to have an exposure to a variety of curriculum.

Better training of educators

With new technology seeping into the education system and with different kinds of students with different interests and talents, there is an impelling need for all the teachers to receive the best of educational and technology training. This is a core area that needs attention. Training that is continuous and comprehensive must be provided to teachers.

Personalise education

All students are unique in their own ways and inherit different talents. They might have different levels of comprehension which need to be addressed differently. To equip teachers to pay attention to every student and understand their abilities, schools must utilise technology like AI and chatbots that can assist.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---there---s-need-to-embrace-technology----2020-04-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/---there---s-need-to-embrace-technology---.html
157,01-4-20,Study shows middle-age COVID-19 mortality risk,"Middle-aged people, and not just the elderly, have a dramatically higher risk of dying or developing serious illness from COVID-19, new research from Britain showed on Tuesday. The findings came in a new comprehensive analysis of virus cases in mainland China.

Researchers from Britain analysed more than 3,600 confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as data from hundreds of passengers repatriated from the outbreak city of Wuhan.

They found that age was a key determining factor in serious infections, with nearly one in five over-80s requiring hospitalisation, compared to around 1 per cent among people under 30.

Taking into account estimates of the number of cases that may not have been clinically confirmed — that is, mild or asymptomatic infections —the data showed the hospitalisation rate of patients in their 50s was 8.2 per cent.

The study, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, estimated that the mortality rate from confirmed COVID-19 cases in mainland China was 1.38 per cent.

If unconfirmed cases were taken into account, the death rate dropped to 0.66 per cent. The authors of the research said that while this was significantly lower than previous estimates, COVID-19 is still several times deadlier than previous pandemic viruses, such as H1N1.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/study-shows-middle-age-covid-19-mortality-risk.html

The announcement followed a second round of virtual talks after G20 leaders pledged a “united front” last week and said they were injecting USD 5 trillion into the global economy to head off a feared deep recession.

159,01-4-20,5 things we still don’t know about the virus,"Despite extensive study by doctors and scientists across the world since the new coronavirus first appeared in China three months ago, much about the scourge is still unclear. Here are five key questions that remain unanswered about the virus officially known as SARS-CoV-2 that leads to COVID-19.

One of the biggest mysteries is why the virus produces few or no symptoms in around 80 percent of people, according to the World Health Organization, yet in others it can lead to fatal pneumonia. “Findings from February indicated that the clinical spectrum of this disease can be very heterogeneous,” said Professor Leo Poon from the School of Public Health at Hong Kong University.

During the peak of the epidemic in China, he and a team from the University of Nanchang compared those with mild and severe forms of the illness.

Their study, published in the British journal The Lancet, found that those hardest hit were “significantly older” and that the concentration of the virus in the nose and throat was around 60 times higher than those lightly affected. The question remains whether this result can be explained by the subjects’ less reactive immune systems because of their age or whether they were simply more exposed to the virus. Research on the measles virus has shown that the gravity of the illness is related to the level of exposure. Experts do not yet know whether this is the same for COVID-19.

Coronavirus is known to spread through physical contact and through droplets dispersed when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

But can it also hang in the air like the virus that causes the seasonal flu? One US study published in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that the new coronavirus can survive in air particles in a laboratory for three hours.

But scientists do not know if the disease can still be transmitted at that stage.

“We don’t know if the virus can hang around for a long time in the air or on inert surfaces,” Professor Karine Lacombe, head of infectious diseases at Saint Antoine Hospital in Paris, told AFP. “We know we can find the virus, but we do not know if the virus is infectious.”

Apart from the few countries that have used aggressive testing, like South Korea and Germany, global figures on the number of people carrying the virus are sketchy. The British Government estimated that on March 17, 55,000 people there had the virus when less than 2,000 had officially tested positive.

A precise understanding of the spread of the epidemic is vital to isolating and treating those infected as well as developing a profile of those who can build up immunity to it. This will be possible once a new generation of blood tests are developed that are capable of tracing the immune reaction to SARS-CoV-2. Will COVID-19 be halted with the arrival of warm spring and summer weather in the northern hemisphere? Experts say this is possible, but not certain. Respiratory viruses like the flu are more stable in cold and dry weather, which is why they spread more rapidly in winter.

Hong Kong researchers found that the SARS virus of 2002-03 in Asia — closely related to the new coronavirus — survived best when humidity and temperatures were low. But a recent study by the Harvard Medical School in the United States warned that “changes in weather alone (with an increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the northern hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to declines in COVID-19 cases without the implementation of extensive public health interventions.”

Children have been relatively spared by COVID-19 than adults, and those infected have been less sick. Chinese research published in the review Nature showed that none of the 10 children with COVID-19 that they followed became terribly ill, with symptoms limited to sore throats, a cough and a mild fever.

Researchers also found that children living with people sick with the virus were two to three times less likely to catch it than adults. The same was true of the SARS virus in 2002-03. “There are lots of things that we do not know, which should lead us to approach this with a lot of humility,” warned Professor Lacombe.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/5-things-we-still-don---t-know-about-the-virus.html
160,01-4-20,Italy mourns its virus dead at end of fateful month,"Italy marked a minute of silence and flew flags at half mast on Tuesday to mourn the 11,591 people who have died from the coronavirus pandemic that has dramatically altered life in the Mediterranean country.

The nation of 60 million people has recorded nearly a third of all fatalities caused by COVID-19 across the world.

The day of mourning marks a month in which Italy saw more deaths from a single disaster than at any time since World War II.

It was first detected in Italy near the northern financial hub Milan in late February before spreading and overwhelming hospitals with critically ill patients.

Italy now has nearly 4,000 people receiving intensive care treatment for COVID-19.

The virus “is an injury that hurt the whole country,” Rome mayor Virginia Raggi said after a priest read a prayer for the dead and the nation observed a minute’s silence.

“Together, we will get through this,” she said at a ceremony held outside Rome’s city hall. Vatican City also flew its yellow-and-white flags at half mast in solidarity. The Italian Government imposed an unprecedented lockdown three weeks ago to help stem the spread of a virus that has now officially infected more than 100,000 people in the country.

The financial cost of the forced shutdown of almost all businesses threatens to send Italy’s economy — the European Union’s third largest last year — into its deepest recession in decades.

On Monday, the government decided to extend the shutdown until at least mid-April. Stores and restaurants are not expected to start opening until at least May and no official is willing to predict when life might return to the way it was just a month ago.

Italy’s Confindustria big business lobby said it expected the country’s total output to shrink by six percent if the pandemic does not ease by the end of May. It said each additional week after that would chop another 0.75 per cent off Italy’s gross domestic product.

Big businesses around the northern city of Bergamo where the death rates are some of the highest in the world sound anxious about their long-term prospects.

“Saying ‘close everything’ may be right, but it is not sustainable forever,” the lobby’s Bergamo branch president Stefano Scaglia told the Il Fatto Quotidiano newspaper.

Rome’s mayor stressed on Tuesday that it was imperative for everyone “to stay at home to save us all”.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/italy-mourns-its-virus-dead-at-end-of-fateful-month.html
161,01-4-20,Wuhan’s favorite noodles are back as virus-hit city recovers,"The reappearance of Wuhan’s favorite breakfast noodles is a tasty sign that life is slowly getting back to normal in the Chinese city at the epicenter of the global cornavirus outbreak. Zhou Guoqiong still isn’t allowed to serve customers inside her shop as part of social distancing rules that are some of the strictest in the world.

But the steady stream of customers who leave with bags of “reganmian,” or “hot dry noodles,” smothered in peanut sauce, testifies to a powerful desire to enjoy the familiar again after months of lockdown since the virus was first detected in December. The favorite snack, usually sold from carts or in small restaurants, is as much a trademark of Wuhan as deep-dish pizza is for Chicago or spaghetti is for Rome.

“I’m happy as long as there is business,” Zhou said. Five days since they reopened, she and her husband now sell several hundred bags of noodles every day, less than before the outbreak but more than enough to keep them busy.

Earlier in the lockdown, Zhou said she would receive messages from customers complaining about how long they hadn’t had their noodles, deepening her anxiety after the city was closed off on Jan. 23 and its hospitals were overwhelmed with patients. In all, the city has recorded 2,548 deaths from virus and more than 50,000 cases.

Despite radically falling numbers of infections, Wuhan and the rest of China aren’t out of the woods yet, as officials repeatedly point out.

It’s still stressful to control imported cases and prevent a resurgence of indigenous cases, and the demand for related medical supplies also remains high,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a daily briefing on Tuesday.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/wuhan---s-favorite-noodles-are-back-as-virus-hit-city-recovers.html
162,01-4-20,Stay productive,"Almost all of us are working from home but some may be facing challenges. NEHA BAJAJ shares tips to maximise and make most of their time

Before COVID-19 hit us work from home sounded pretty rosy, however now that we are confined and forced to work from home a majority of people feel otherwise and miss human interaction, having lunch with colleagues, going on smoke breaks, the harmless gossip and more.

Having said that, working from home can be extremely productive if you follow some basics. You will of course have to keep in mind that the situation now is very different from what it was when we would take work from home a month ago. A large number of people are now also managing their house chores since the helpers are also home and many have to cook, clean and take care of their babies while continuing to work and adding value to their clients. We all face certain challenges while working from home nevertheless, there are certain tips you can follow to maximise and make the most of your time.

The most common challenges faced by professionals while working from home include:

Easy distractions: When working from home, generally people take things too lightly and get distracted by other things going on in the house, this is usually due to lack of structure and planning and most importantly because your home is not an office.

Lack of motivation: While working from home alone, you may get the luxury to work in your pyjamas but not having your co-workers around can get quite dull. Hence, one can lose motivation which will, in turn, impact overall productivity and quality of work.

Lag in internal communication: Having a clear communication channel is extremely important while working from home. In the office, you can simply reach out to anyone as they are physically present in your vicinity. Whereas while working from home it is imperative that internal communication and planning must remain clear to avoid any conflicts.

No proper work environment: Not having your work-station and office set-up will definitely create a bit of havoc in your minds. It becomes unsettling when you have to work in an unprofessional environment.

Here are some easy doable tips and tricks to work from home efficiently and effectively:

Designated workspace: Create a designated workspace and utilise the space daily to bring stability in your routine. The workspace should preferably be a desk with a chair, ideally the dining table works like a charm. Keep your set-up ready as you would on your office desk. Keep the desk clean and arrange it with a diary and a pen and other necessary stationery items you may need, but do not clutter.

Work with a schedule: Before starting your work for the day, arrange your thoughts and make a detailed schedule, say a task list of sorts, of what all has to be done, priority wise. Effective time management can play a vital role in increasing your productivity, and you must also inform your family members of your timeline, so you are not disturbed in between tasks.

Stay in constant touch with your team: Your colleagues may not be able to reach out to you with the ease of just a shout out. So, you must assure them that you are just a phone call away and you are available for any assistance they require. Make it a point to call them at regular intervals but do not hover either, create a group chat and keep the conversation alive there. In the technologically advanced world, you must use all the available tools to stay connected with your teams. Constant communication will keep your team motivated and their morale high.

Take short breaks: Take a break of a few minutes after every two hours to stretch, do some chores and break the monotony. If you need to make a call that doesn't need you to stay in front of your computer then take a walk while talking on the phone it can be refreshing. Stretching and resting your eyes is advisable even in a regular work environment since it helps you relax.

Indulge in fun activities with your colleagues: Everybody starts missing the office culture and their co-workers after a point. So, it can be a good idea to initiate some fun activities to indulge in fun online games or doing an informal video chat. This time can actually be used as a good bonding exercise too, have people talk to each other and get to know them better.

We need to try finding a silver lining and an opportunity in every situation, these are testing times across sectors, it’s imperative to maintain personal and mental health and at the same time continue delivery on the work front. Following the above steps will simply bring a structure to your work schedule and help increase your productivity.

Even though it’s possible to convince most of the parents that computer science or programming should be a required subject, a major problem is that only one out of every four schools even offers it. One of the most frequently occurring reasons quoted by the higher authorities of schools for not offering Coding as a major subject is that there isn’t enough time in the day — they are completely focused on core subjects which are measured by standardised tests.

Coding is like a learning language, it is easier to attain fluency at a young age. To equip the future generation with the skills that would prepare them for the jobs of tomorrow, institutes should place special emphasis on the power of coding and demand for the subject to be a part of schools and institutions as early as Grade 1. It is necessary to incorporate coding into the study curriculum and to impart coding knowledge in more innovative ways using different tech-based mind games that enhance a kid's personality.

Students can develop early affinity for coding, and can further dive into the concepts they learn in class by participating in after-school coding clubs that help build the essential skills. The benefits of coding are not just restricted to creating software and websites. Before students start working with software, they learn computational thinking skills and methods, which is the ability to approach a problem in a systematised and logical way. The storytelling aspect of coding can also benefit students' written and oral communication skills. In coding, there is a logical beginning, middle and end to the program, just like a narrative arc that describes a story's full progression. These skills can benefit students' written and speech skills.

Coding should be considered as a foundational subject in an individual’s life, because not only does it give students the skills needed to enter the growing field of technology, but more importantly it teaches them foundational skills such as problem solving and analytical thinking that will serve them well in all aspects of their lives. The other skills that come with computer programming help kids to develop new ways of thinking and foster problem-solving techniques that can produce greater results in other areas. Computational thinking allows preschoolers to grasp concepts like algorithm, recursion and heuristic.

Over the years, coding has progressed from a mere hobby to a critical career skill. It can make an individual’s resume stand out. Teaching children to code at a young age helps them develop elemental skills that will benefit them in whatever career they choose. When it comes to scope and versatility of this subject, it opens up new areas of remunerative career opportunities and ultimately makes one more flexible in this rapidly-shifting digital economy.

164,01-4-20,mindIT,"A world without education is like a bird without wings. Mankind has made significant developments over the years. Food clothing and shelter have always been considered as the basic needs of a human being but what is also essential to be a good human being and create a better society is- Education. But unfortunately, many people especially children from around the world are still deprived of basic education.

According to the report published by National Sample Survey Office — 32 million Indian children (aged 06-13 years) have never attended any school and the majority of them belong to the socially disadvantaged class. The word education carries a broader meaning in itself; it is not only about gaining knowledge of a particular subject but much more than that. Education is an important tool for every child as it enables them to know about their rights and duties. It expands the vision and helps them to develop a perspective of everything.

To build a better society and world education is considered as an important aspect. However, a nation’s development depends a lot on its citizens and especially children. Children are the pillar of the nation and therefore, it is very important to prepare them well for future challenges. Education is the basic right of every child and it should be the duty of every parent to ensure that their child is getting proper education. The primary objective of education is to bring knowledge and awareness among the children and it should be used as a tool for the self-development and overall development of the child i.e. social, cultural, cognitive, emotional and physical development.

Education is the fundamental right of each and every child and therefore, it should be accessible to every child without any barriers. Education helps to develop the thought process and gain worldwide information. Not only that, but education also teaches one to respect others and to treat everyone in a good way. It has the power to improve the personality of a human being by making him brave, confident and smart. Besides, education contributes to a secure future and to live a wealthy and prosperous life one must get educated.

Basic and quality education begins from home and this is the first step of making the society and world a better place by inculcating good knowledge and values in the child. In the initial stage, a child learns a lot of things from their parents. Later on, they should be enrolled in a good primary school where they can acquire more knowledge and education. We live in a fast-paced competitive world and to be able to survive in this competitive world, education is an essential weapon. The Government has also made various schemes for underprivileged children and free education is one of them. Different awareness campaigns are also being organised from time to time to make people aware of the importance of education, as a country’s progress totally depends on its citizens.

Providing education to the children of every section of society is extremely important because education will help the child to differentiate between the right and the wrong. It will allow them to know about their basic rights and duties towards self, family and, society. Moreover, education will help them to become self-independent and build a positive reputation in the society. We often believe that education is only about providing bookish knowledge to the children but the area is too vast. It is more than acquiring knowledge of a certain subject. Education helps to build opinions ofour own and have different viewpoints of things in life. An educated person is truly a gem for the society as they can further transfer their knowledge to the needy ones.

Education can act as a strong medium to transform a child’s life by helping them overcome poverty which can ultimately lead to a healthy and better life. Children are the backbone of any country and thus no child should be deprived of basic education. It is imperative in every sphere of life and it is the foundation of a successful future.

165,01-4-20,Hima writes to Rijiju for access to outdoor training,"Confined to their hostel rooms at NIS Patiala amid the coronavirus-forced lockdown, some athletes, led by Hima Das, have requested the sports ministry to allow them to train outdoors within campus, which is out of bounds for outsiders right now.

Deputy chief national athletics coach Radhakrishnan Nair, who is supporting the move, said that the Hima-led campers at the National Institute of Sports (NIS) are expecting a reply from the ministry in a day or two.

“Hima and some other athletes have written to the Sports Minister that they be allowed to train one or two hours a day in small groups at different times so that they can also practice social distancing while training at the same time,” Nair said from Patiala.

“They have asked Rijiju that they be sent home if no training is allowed.

“The ministry will not allow them to go back home but this outdoor training idea is feasible. We will know about it in a day or two,” he added.

Nair said he and other coaches have supported the idea as there is no risk of any camper contracting the dreaded coronavirus as nobody is coming in and going out of the facility.

“We have 41 athletes at NIS and the track and field area is just 50m from the hostels. We can have small groups say eight athletes each and only one group will train at a time for one or two hours.

“All the athletes of a group will not do running or throwing together, one will run alone and finish it and then another will run after him. This way we can practice social distancing and be safe,” the top athletics coach said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/hima-writes-to-rijiju-for-access-to-outdoor-training.html
166,01-4-20,Proteas set deadlines for tours,"The South African team will require six weeks of preparation before embarking on any tours, Cricket South Africa’s acting director of cricket, Graeme Smith, said on Tuesday.

With South Africa in official lockdown until April 16, Smith said in a video media conference that the players needed to take responsibility for maintaining their fitness while at home but would also need to work on cricket skills as a group before touring.

“We have to review the situation every week,” he said, “but we estimate we would need around six weeks before any tour.”

South Africa are due to tour Sri Lanka in early June for three one-day internationals and three T20Is.

Smith’s timetable would appear to make the tour unlikely to happen. It would mean a lifting of travel bans as well as the current lockdown ending as scheduled for the tour to take place.

South Africa’s next engagement is a Test and T20 tour of the West Indies, scheduled to start on July 15, which would require a return to normal activity in South Africa by the end of May.

Former Test captain Smith seems set to be appointed to a permanent role.

“We are in final negotiations and hope to make an announcement next week,” said acting chief executive Jacques Faul.

Faul said it was impossible to estimate when normal cricket activities would resume but said CSA had budgeted for and had the capacity to pay nationally-contracted and franchise players through the 2020/21 season.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/proteas-set-deadlines-for-tours.html
167,01-4-20,Smith not lone option for Test captaincy,"Australias Test skipper Tim Paine isn’t getting any younger at 35, but the captain has made it clear that former skipper Steve Smith isn’t the only guy in fray to take over when the wicket-keeper calls it a day.

“We’ve got a number of guys to choose from who can put their hand up. There’s Steve Smith, who’s done it before, or the people who are developing underneath like a Travis Head or an Alex Carey — Marnus Labuschagne and Pat Cummins are other ones.

“We’re starting to build some real depth so that when my time’s up we’ve got a number of options,” Paine told reporters.

168,01-4-20,"Smith, Warner presence will give Aus edge: Paine on India series","The experience of 15,000 Test runs between Steve Smith and David Warner will certainly give Australian batting unit a formidable look when they take on India in a four-match series at the end of the year, feels skipper Tim Paine.

Under Paine, Australia for the first time in 71 years lost a home Test series against India 1-2 in the 2018-19 bilateral contest. However, Smith and Warner were then in the midst of their ball-tampering suspension and the team was in a transition phase.

“This is a different team, no doubt their team will be slightly different as well, but it’s two high quality teams, a really anticipated series purely because of the quality of cricket, not for what’s happened before. India and Australia as a rivalry, it’s a series a bit like the Ashes that we all look forward to,” Paine was quoted as saying by Cricbuzz.

Not only the seasoned duo but the extremely talented Marnus Labuschagne also adds the necessary depth that the batting unit didn’t have last time around.

“I think you put in 15,000 Test runs with two guys alone, Steve Smith and David Warner, Marnus Labuschagne’s come on in leaps and bounds and he’s now a top three or four batsman in the world himself.

“You put that amount of runs into a cricket side, last time we didn’t have ... We know how good India’s bowling line-up is and last time we just weren’t quite good enough if we’re totally honest against that attack, whereas this time I think we’ll be a different kettle of fish. We’ve got three of the best batsmen in the world in our top six,” the captain said.

Matthew Wade playing purely as a batsman also is an advantage, opined Paine, who will continue to keep wickets. “Matthew Wade back firing adds a real toughness to it, Travis Head improved a lot since he played India last time. So I think it’s going to be an exciting series, there’s no doubt about it.

“The batting line-ups on show are going to be as good as you will see, it’s going to be exciting for fans and it’s going to be who handles (the pressure), we know the conditions over here are going to offer the quicks something and I think it’s going to be awesome to watch, so I can’t wait to play in it,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/smith--warner-presence-will-give-aus-edge--paine-on-india-series.html
169,01-4-20,The Test motivates Root for Ashes,"England Test captain Joe Root has said watching the first few episodes of a documentary about the Australian cricket team has been a “motivator” ahead of the 2021/22 Ashes Down Under.

The Test charts Australia’s progress from the low of the 2018 ball-tampering scandal in South Africa through to the high of retaining the Ashes in a drawn series in England last year after the hosts and eventual champions beat them in the World Cup semi-finals.

The largely well-received documentary has also been accused of being a public relations exercise given Cricket Australia had editorial control.

But with cricket suspended worldwide because of the coronavirus pandemic, Root decided to take a look.

“I’ve only got to the start of the World Cup, so we’ll see how the rest of it unfolds,” he told reporters in a conference call on Monday.

Root, while acknowledging the importance of the World Test Championship, made clear an Ashes series in Australia remains the acid test for an England cricketer.

Under his leadership, England were beaten 4-0 in the 2017/18 Ashes.

But Root said the threat posed by the likes of fast bowler Mark Wood, man-of-the match in the fourth Test victory against South Africa, added an X-factor to England’s attack.

“We’ve seen in South Africa that has played a part, it has found us a way to take 20 wickets in foreign conditions.”

Turning to top-order rising stars Dom Sibley & Ollie Pope, Root added: “If we can keep putting experience into a number of the young batters as well, give them game time, then we’re starting to build a team that has confidence, experience, is ready and hardened for the challenges Australia will throw at us.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/the-test-motivates-root-for-ashes.html
170,01-4-20,"No IPL, no salary concerns for franchises","No play, no pay. This could well be the fate of players, who have signed up for this year’s IPL, which has been postponed and seems unlikely to go ahead unless BCCI figures an alternate window.

“The system of IPL payments is that 15 per cent is paid a week before the tournament starts. 65 per cent more is paid during the tournament. The remaining 20 percent is paid within a stipulated time after the tournament ends,” a senior official of an IPL franchise said.

“The BCCI has specific guidelines. Obviously, no player will be paid as of now,” he added.

Another franchise official clarified that salaries of players are not insured for a pandemic.

“We will not get any money from insurance company as pandemic is not covered in the clause. Each franchise has salary overheads ranging between Rs 75 to 85 crore. How can we pay if there’s no action,”e even though they understand that the parent body stands to lose close to Rs 3000 crore.

“It’s not just the Dhonis and the Kohlis who will be affected. Surely they would feel the pinch but for many first-timers, the Rs 20, 40 or 60 lakh is serious life-changing money after all the hard work. Hope BCCI has a plan in place,” he said.

BCCI treasurer Arun Dhumal, however, said that at present, there hasn’t been any discussion about pay cuts.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/no-ipl--no-salary-concerns-for-franchises.html
171,01-4-20,IPL in Oct-Nov if T20 WC is postponed,"With the coronavirus outbreak bringing the world to a standstill, sporting events across the world have either been postponed or cancelled and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is now looking at the October-November window to host the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL). But the move can only be possible if the ICC decides to postpone the mens T20 World Cup that is to be held later in the year.

Speaking about the possibility, a BCCI official said that while there have been talks with regards to hosting the IPL in the October-November window, it will only be possible if the World T20 to be played in Australia from October 18 to November 15 is postponed.

“At present, there is a lockdown of borders and while Australia has said it is a potential six-month lockdown, things can change with an improvement in the scenario. UK could follow the same pattern considering the spread of the pandemic. We are still to understand what the Indian government will decide with regards to closing the international borders. In such a scenario, the only window that looks safe is the October-November one. But again, that collides with the T20 World Cup.

“So, if the ICC does go ahead and decides to postpone the T20 World Cup due to the current scenario, only then we can look at the October-November window because even if a six-month border closedown is ordered by every country from say now, it ends by the start of October. But again, for that, the spread of the coronavirus needs to be stopped and things must come under human control. In short, there will have to be a lot of maths,” the official said.

“Again, it would be the last step for the ICC to push the T20 World Cup from 2020 to 2022 because there is no window in 2021. So, at the moment, it is all a bit too far-fetched to be honest. But yes, the October-November window has been spoken about for the IPL, but a lot of external factors need to fall into place for that to become a reality.”

However an ICC official made it clear that the T20 World Cup is still on as planned and there have been no talks of a postponement. “There have been no talks of any postponement to the World T20 that is to be held in October and November this year,” the official said.

Cricket Australia chief Kevin Roberts had earlier said that he was hoping that the T20 World Cup could be played as per schedule in normal circumstances.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ipl-in-oct-nov-if-t20-wc-is-postponed-2020-04-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ipl-in-oct-nov-if-t20-wc-is-postponed.html

There was a clamour for freezing the world rankings with Indian shuttlers Saina Nehwal, B Sai Praneeth, Parupalli Kashyap and H S Prannoy leading the way in expressing their concerns.

“The Badminton World Federation (BWF) can announce it will freeze World Rankings and World Junior Rankings until further notice. The freezing of rankings will be backdated to Week 12, which is the week following the last international tournament that was played — the YONEX All England Open 2020,” BWF said in a release.

“The ranking lists issued on 17 March 2020 will serve as a basis for entry and seeding into the next international tournaments — although it is difficult to say at this stage when this may be.”

Shuttlers in the singles competition have to be inside top-16 of world rankings to qualify for the Olympics. The cut-off for doubles is also top-16.

The BWF had suspended all tournaments post the All England Championships until April 12 due to the pandemic and said due to the current scenario the next set of tournaments will also be suspended.

Many international stars, including Saina and Kashyap, had suggested that the qualification period for the Tokyo Olympics be extended in light of tournaments getting cancelled.

A decision is expected soon by tournament officials about whether or not they can stage the classic event at the All England Club as planned starting June 29, postpone it or cancel it outright due to the coronavirus pandemic.

""We're hoping that they're going to be somewhat optimistic about playing the event this year,"" Isner told ESPN on Tuesday.

""I'd love to hear some optimism from them.""

But with tournament timing crucial due to grass condition and weather, Isner has already started to ponder a year without Wimbledon.

""We may have to come to grips with the fact that we may not be playing Wimbledon this year,"" Isner said.

""It's going to be a tough pill to swallow.""

Isner, the top-rated US player at 21st in the ATP rankings, defeated Frenchman Nicolas Mahut after more than 11 hours of playing time spread over three days in the epic first-round affair, taking the marathon fifth set 70-68.

""Wimbledon sort of has to be played this (same) time of year,"" Isner said.

180,01-4-20,Chopper scam: SC asks Christian Michel to move Delhi HC for interim bail,"The Supreme Court Wednesday asked Christian Michel James, an accused in the AgustaWestland VVIP Chopper scam, to seek interim bail from the Delhi High Court in the case.

Michel, lodged in Tihar jail, has moved the top court seeking interim bail citing coronavirus scare inside the prison and cited its recent order on granting bail to undertrial prisoners to decongest prisons in view of the pandemic.

A bench comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah, in a hearing conducted through video conferencing, asked the accused to seek bail from the high court first.

Lawyer Aljo K Joseph, appearing for the accused, said that the bench without expressing its views on the merits, asked Michel to seek bail from the high court.

Michel, alleged middleman arrested in connection with the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam cases filed by the CBI and the ED, had earlier moved the Delhi High Court seeking interim bail citing risk of contracting coronavirus in the Tihar Jail.

He then moved the apex court seeking the same relief saying that the high court has been unable to accord hearing on his interim bail plea.

Michel, 59, has claimed that his health condition was critical and incompatible with the current prison status, especially to cope with the risk of contracting the COVID-19 infection which could have a lethal effect on him as he is already suffering from serious pathologies.

“The agedness and a pre-existing ill state of health will make the applicant's (Michel) body more susceptible to the said infection than any other ordinary prisoner with a normal health condition,"" Michel has said in its plea.

The regular bail plea of Michel, who was arrested in 2018 and is in judicial custody since January 5, 2019, is also pending before the high court where the CBI and the ED have contended that he should not be granted the relief as he has a nexus with influential people and can influence witnesses.

He has been denied bail in both the matters by the trial court. He has approached the high court against the lower court's decision.

The special CBI court had denied him the relief, saying there was no sufficient ground to grant bail.

Michel, extradited from Dubai, was arrested by the ED on December 22, 2018.

On January 5 last year, he was sent to judicial custody in the ED case. He is also lodged in judicial custody in another case registered by the CBI in connection with the scam.

Michel is among the three alleged middlemen being probed in the cases filed by the ED and the CBI. The other two are Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/chopper-scam--sc-asks-christian-michel-to-move-delhi-hc-for-interim-bail-2020-04-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/chopper-scam--sc-asks-christian-michel-to-move-delhi-hc-for-interim-bail.html

184,01-4-20,India scrambles to trace Nizamuddin contacts,"States step up search as most of new cases had attended Tablighi event; all 6 who died of Covid in Telangana on Wednesday too had taken part in jamaat

A massive exercise is underway to identify and track hundreds of people who attended a Tablighi Jamaat conference in Nizamuddin, Delhi, this month and may have spread the coronavirus infection far and wide.

The Governments in various States have issued orders to trace all possible contacts these delegates may have made after their return from the Nizamuddin event and thus extending the chain of infections in the country.

As the States have established teams to locate the new chain of Tablighi contacts, 45 members of this religious organisation have been traced to Karnataka.

One of the 45 attendees from Karnataka who visited Nizamuddin Markaz mosque in early March died of COVID-19, according to the State Health Minister B Sriramulu.

“A religious ceremony was held at the Nizamuddin mosque in New Delhi on March 10, which was attended by 45 people from Karnataka. One of them was a man who died in Sira (Tumakuru),” tweeted Sriramulu.

“The pilgrim from Sira was a sexagenarian who passed away on Friday, he was Karnataka’s third COVID-19 death,” said the State Minister.

“We’ve quarantined 54 people, eight in Bidar. One person was found positive in Bidar and we’ve quarantined him. There are people who attended Jamaat from almost all districts,” said Karnataka Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai.

Also, Governments in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are finding imprints of Nizamuddin event in their States with numbers of suspects turning much larger than in Karnataka.

The Andhra Pradesh Government has managed to locate 369 people from the State. With most of the COVID-19 persons in Andhra Pradesh turning out to be the participants or a contact of a participant of the congregation held between March 15 and 17, the Government has intensified efforts to quarantine them.

According to a statement issued by the State Government, people who tested positive in Andhra Pradesh, two are from Anantapur district, 8 from Prakasam, 5 from Guntur and 1 from Krishna with 369 persons being suspects and all of them are said to have attended the Nizamuddin meet.

“17 COVID-19 positive cases have been detected since 9 pm Monday, taking the total positive cases in the State to 40. Most of these people are those who had attended religious meeting in Delhi or are the contacts of those who attended,” said Director of Andhra Health & Family Welfare.

Telengana reported six deaths of COVID-19 on Wednesday. All of them had attended the religious congregation in Nizamuddin.

The Government is looking for their subsequent community contacts.

Andhra, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu Governments have asked their police and health administrations to make all out efforts to trace out all those who had attended the Jamaat meeting in Delhi and appealed to people to report themselves to authorities for quarantine.

Cutting short his visit to the districts with maximum number of COVID-19 patients, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday returned to the State capital to hold an urgent meeting with senior officials, in view of reports that several people from the State attended the religious event in Nizamuddin area which has emerged as one of the biggest hotspots of the disease.

He was scheduled to visit Meerut and Agra besides Ghaziabad to review the situation. The CM will hold meeting with senior officials later in the day, the spokesman said. The State Police has already screened a large number of people in the State suspected to have come in contact with those who attended the Jamaat in Delhi in mid-March.

Jammu & Kashmir where “many of these people returned” is already on alert. The district administration in all ten districts has fanned out teams to trace those who might not have disclosed their travel history or contact history with the Tablighis.

It is understood that the list of those who attended the Jamaat event in Nizamuddin from J & K is in good number but many of them are not in quarantine yet and the administration and police are making efforts to identity, trace and isolate, authorities said.

Sources said the Government has prepared a 50 page list of people from J&K who attended the congregation or came in contact with those. Efforts are being made to identify these people and isolate them.

District Magistrates in different districts of Kashmir have issued a warning on Tuesday evening to those who have entered the Valley after March 1 and have not so far revealed their travel history to the authorities.

The order issued by district magistrates said all those who entered the Valley after March 1 with travel history abroad, outside the Valley or association with members of the Tablighi groups are given the last chance to report to the authorities within two days failing which they could face imprisonment under the provisions of the disaster management act, 2005.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-scrambles-to-trace-nizamuddin-contacts-2020-04-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/india-scrambles-to-trace-nizamuddin-contacts.html
185,01-4-20,Tablighis flouted tourist visa: MHA,"281 foreigners to be blacklisted

The Union Government on Tuesday said as many as 2,100 foreigners visited India for Tablighi activities since January 1 and it was taking steps to blacklist the 281 foreign nationals, who attended Tablighi Jamaat event in Nizamuddin violating the travel rules.

The Ministry said the State Police will examine visas of all these foreign Tablighi Jamaat workers and take action in case of violation of visa conditions.

Many of these foreign religious preachers who arrived on tourist visas, indulged in missionary activities in contravention of the visa norms.

“As per policy guidelines of Indian Visa issued by the Government of India, preaching religious ideologies, making speeches in religious places, distribution of audio-visual display/ pamphlets pertaining to religious ideologies is not allowed,” an official said adding, a Group of Ministers (GoM) also discussed the situation arising out of COVID-19 spread amongst the Tabligh members post the congregation here.

Of the 1,830 persons who attended the congregation, the biggest participation (501) came from Tamil Nadu, followed by Assam (216), Uttar Pradesh (156), Maharashtra (109) and Madhya Pradesh (107) and they are being traced to be quarantined.

In a statement, the Home Ministry said while approximately 824 of them, as on March 21, were dispersed in different parts of the country for missionary work, 216 of them were staying at Nizamuddin Markaz, where several of them tested COVID-19 positive.

It is estimated that from January 1 onwards, approximately 2,100 foreigners had visited India for Tabligh activities, the statement said.

Tablighi workers, both foreigners and Indians, indulge in preaching tours across the country throughout the year.

Various nationals, particularly from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Nepal, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Kyrgyzstan come for Tabligh activities.

All such foreign nationals normally report their arrival at Tabligh Markaz at Banglewali Mosque in Hazrat Nizamuddin, the statement said.

From here, they are detailed for Chilla activities to different parts of the country.

Chilla activities in all States are coordinated by district coordinators in different districts, who, in turn, in some States are supervised by ‘State Amirs’.

“As on March 21, there were about 1,746 people staying in Hazrat Nizamuddin Markaz. Of these, 216 were foreigners and 1530 were Indians.

“Additionally, about 824 foreigners had been, as on March 21, doing Chilla activities in various parts of the country,” it said.

The statement said the Government is committed to identify, isolate and quarantine COVID-19 positive Tabligh Jamaat (TJ) workers in India post their congregation in Nizamuddin, Delhi.

The Union Home Ministry shared details of TJ workers in India with all States on March 21 after COVID-19 positive cases surfaced in Telangana, it said.

“So far, 1,339 Tabligh Jamaat workers have been shifted to Narela, Sultanpuri and Bakkarwala quarantine facilities as well as to hospitals,” the statement said.

The Ministry said the State Police will examine visas of all these foreign TJ workers and take further action in case of violation of visa conditions.

The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) shared details of foreign and Indian Tabhlig Jamaat (TJ) workers in India with all States on March 21, 2020, after COVID-19 positive cases among these workers surfaced in Telangana.

Apart from advisory to the States to identify, isolate and quarantine TJ workers who might be COVID-19 positive, the Home Ministry also issued instructions to the Chief Secretaries and Directors Generals of Police of all States as well as Commissioner of Police, Delhi. The advisories were reiterated by the Director of Intelligence Bureau to all State police chiefs on March 28 and 29.

Meanwhile, TJ workers staying in the Markaz in Nizamuddin, Delhi, were also persuaded for medical screening by State authorities and police. By March 29, nearly 162 TJ workers were medically screened and shifted to quarantine facilities. So far, 1,339 Tabligh Jamaat workers have been shifted to Narela, Sultanpuri and Bakkarwala quarantine facilities as well as to LNJP, RGSS, GTB, DDU Hospitals and AllMS, Jhajjar. Rest of them are being medically screened for COVID-19 infections.

Usually, all the foreign nationals visiting India as a part of Tabligh team come on the strength of tourist visa. MHA had already issued guidelines that they should not indulge in missionary work on tourist visa. State Police would be examining categories of visas of all these foreign TJ workers and take further action in case of violation of visa conditions.

Tabligh Jamaat Headquarter (Markaz) is located in Nizamuddin, Delhi. Devout Muslims from across the country and also from foreign countries visit the Markaz for religious purpose. Some also move out in groups to different parts of the country for Tabligh activities. This is a continuous process throughout the year.

Details of these 824 foreigners had been shared on March 21 with the State Police for identifying them, getting them medically screened and quarantining them. On March 28, State police were advised to collect the names of Indian Tabligh Jamaat workers from the local coordinators, locate them on the ground, get them medically screened and quarantine them.

So far, about 2137 such persons have been identified in different States. They are being medically examined and quarantined. This process is still on and more such people would be identified and located, the Government said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tablighis-flouted-tourist-visa--mha-2020-04-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/tablighis-flouted-tourist-visa--mha.html
186,01-4-20,Jamaat organiser booked for endangering lives,"Kejriwal calls congregation a criminal act

The preacher, who led the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi and others, have been booked for violating the Government orders and exposing many to the threat of coronavirus.

The Delhi Police said it has registered a First Information Report (FIR) against Maulana Saad and other members of Tablighi Jamaat under the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897 and relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code for violation of Government directions in wake of coronavirus outbreak.

Earlier, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal described the congregation at Markaz Talbighi Jamaat at Hazarat Nizamuddin a criminal act. Kejriwal wrote to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal to file an FIR against the organisers.

The CM said 1,107 people who attended religious congregation in Nizamudddin Markaz have been quarantined. “Out of 97 cases of coronavirus in the city, 24 were those who took part in the congregation earlier this month,” said Kejriwal.

Meanwhile, locals blamed authorities for not acting on complaints against gathering at Markaz despite the authorities being informed about it.

Over 3,000 people had gathered between March 1 and 18 at Markaz mosque.

Kejriwal slammed the organisers of the religious gathering saying it was “highly irresponsible” on their part to hold such an event at a time when thousands have died in other countries due to the pandemic.

Kejriwal said any lapse in performance of the officers related to the Nizamuddin case will not be tolerated and strict action will be initiated. He also stressed that there was no community transmission of coronavirus yet in Delhi and the situation is under control.

However, the residents of Nizamuddin on Tuesday accused the civil and police administrations of not heeding their complaints about a large number of people converging at the Tablighi Jamaat Markaz amid the coronavirus outbreak.

""Time and again, we brought to the notice of the administration and police that a large number of people gather at the Markaz regularly, but they did not pay attention to it,"" said a local resident.

Sheikh Mohammad Umar, the secretary of Nizamuddin West Resident Welfare Association, claimed that the RWA had brought the issue to the notice of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate concerned, local police and South Delhi Municipal Corporation, but ""nothing happened"".

The Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain also said around 24 people, who took part in a religious congregation in Nizamuddin earlier this month, have tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

""People have been shifted to various places. Many who attended this congregation have been quarantined while around 335 people have been admitted to hospitals,"" said Jain.

He said screening of all those who participated in the event is being conducted by the Government.

Markaz Nizamuddin, which is the international headquarters of Tablighi Jamaat for close to 100 years, in a statement said when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the ""Janata Curfew"" on March 22, they discontinued the ongoing programme immediately, but a large number of people were stuck in the premises due to the closure of railway services on March 21.

Meanwhile, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) carried out mass exercise to disinfect Nizamuddin area. The civic body deployed 40 of its staff with shoulder mounted knapsacks pumps, jetting machine to disinfect the area. Also, sodium hypochlorite solution was also sprayed in the area twice a day, he said. Besides this, 50 safai saniks and four auto tippers were also deployed to maintain proper sanitation.

The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) on Tuesday has converted 240 EWS (Economic Weaker Section) flats at Bakkarwala into isolation ward for people suspected of coronavirus infection at a mosque in Nizamuddin.

The Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddun in South east Delhi was a ticking bomb for Covid-19. Delhi Police top brass ordered the scanning of Jamaat after it had received an advisory from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).

The advisory contained warning about the movement of some 2,000 foreign nationals and some of them having Covid-19 positive symptoms touring the hinterland.

Top placed sources said security agencies were alarmed after they noticed movement of around 800 foreigners who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddun.

These foreigners are suspected to be infected with deadly Covid-19 and had fanned across the country to spread the disease.

The Delhi Police and intelligence officials were alarmed to find that most of them had already left Delhi on March 21, three days before the national lockdown announced by Modi.

Security agencies had reasons to believe that foreigners having affiliation with Tablighi Jamaat were involved in a sinister conspiracy to spread the deadly virus among Indians.

On Tuesday, the Delhi Police teams detained over a dozen foreign nationals who were hiding in a mosque in Zakir Nagar.

They were taken for medical examination and are being kept under the watch, sources said. There is a strong possibility of some members of Tablighi Jamaat in Nizamuddin, who ""have come to the congregation, were Covid 19 careers"".

Information provided by the immigration authorities has confirmed the arrival of over 2000 foreigners into India on tourist visa since January and they had attended Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddin, sources added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/jamaat-organiser-booked-for-endangering-lives-2020-04-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/jamaat-organiser-booked-for-endangering-lives.html

The 37-year-old is gearing up for her second Olympics, postponed to 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Wednesday, she was speaking on the subject ""Making of a Champion"" for Sports Authority of India's facebook live session for athletes, who are mostly confined to their homes or hostel rooms right now amid a national lockdown to contain the pandemic.

Mary Kom said she doesn't have any secret recipe to share for the stupendous success she has achieved.

""I don't have any mantras for success. Just work hard and be honest to what you are doing, that's all. Ups and downs are always there but you should not lose focus on your dreams,"" said the trailblazing boxer, who was rechristened the 'Magnificent Mary' by her sport's world governing body.

""My boxing journey was not easy. To reach national, international and Olympic level is not easy. But if you have the will, and want to achieve in life, you can,"" she added.

""My early life was very difficult. Coming from a poor family, it was so difficult. I can't explain the hardships. I don't want to even remember it.""

Mary Kom is also a Rajya Sabha MP and was recently wrongly accused, in some sections of media, of violating the quarantine protocol after returning from the Asian olympic Qualifiers in Jordan early last month.

She was under no obligation to be in compulsory quarantine at that time and attended a breakfast hosted by President Ram Nath Kovind while being on voluntary isolation, leading to a furore.

The COVID-19 pandemic has become way more severe since then and has caused more than 40,000 deaths globally. In India, the number of cases has crossed 1100 and the death toll has gone past 40.

The veteran sportsperson advised everyone to stay at home to combat the crisis.

""It is not easy for us human beings to stay at home. But that is the best option we have. Staying fit at this time is a good way to fight the virus,"" she said.

""We should not be selfish and think that 'I am healthy, I won't get it'. We should care for others,"" she added.

The fierce competitor in her can't wait for the crisis to be over so that she can resume normal training.

""When all this is brought under control, we will get back to training in big way,"" she said.

""I am trying my level best for an Olympic gold but I am incomplete without your blessings. Pray for me,"" she added.

Karnataka Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai had last night said about 300 people from the state had attended the religious congregation of Tablighi Jamaat and efforts were on to identify and quarantine them.

Stating that those who attended the congregation, including few foreign nationals have traveled to various parts of the country after it was over, Bommai in a release issued on Tuesday night said it is found that several of them have been affected by COVID-19, and 6 people had died in Telangana, while one each in Andaman and Nicobar.

""A 60-year old man from Sira in Tamukuru district of Karnataka who died last week and was positive for infection, had also attended the congregation,"" he said adding according to reports at least 62 foreign nationals have traveled to Karnataka.

While 12 of them have traveled back, the remaining 50 of them still here have been quarantined and are undergoing tests, he added.

According to information, at least 300 people from different parts the state had attended the congregation at Nizamuddin, Bommai said, orders have been issued to quarantine all of them.

""This is a serious development, the Home Ministry was thoroughly investigating into it, a state level special team will be formed to keep a watch on them,"" he added.

However, earlier on Tuesday, Additional Chief Secretary-Health and Family Welfare Department Jawaid Akhtar had said the government has so far identified 78 people from the state who were ""associated"" with Tablighi Jamaat and has quarantined them.

""We are not sure whether all of them attended the congregation held earlier this month, but as they might have come in contact with those who attended in one way or the other, they have been put under government quarantine,"" Akhtar had told reporters.

With many of them claiming that they have completed 14 days of quarantine already, we have also decided to put them for COVID-19 test, he had said adding that the 78 persons include some foreign nationals.

The state health department has also appealed to any person who has attended Tablighi Jamaat Congregation to contact 080-29711171 Arogya Sayavaani (health helpline).",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/300-people-from-karnataka-attended-nizamuddin-jamaat--minister-2020-04-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/300-people-from-karnataka-attended-nizamuddin-jamaat--minister.html

194,01-4-20,"30% migrants may be corona +ve, so halted: Centre to SC","In an alarming revelation, the Centre on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that it feared that every 3 or 10 migrants moving from cities to rural areas could be infected with coronavirus.

In an affidavit filed in the apex court, the Centre also said it would not allow migrant workers to return to their States since it is risky for them and for the people in the villages.

On its part, the court asked the Centre to prevent migration of people due to coronavirus and set up within 24 hours a portal for providing real time information on the pandemic to counter the panic being spread through fake news.

“Panic will destroy more lives than the virus”, the top court said and asked the Centre to get trained counsellors and community leaders of all faiths to calm down the migrants, who are kept in shelter homes across India.

A Bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and L Nageswara Rao, which took up two PILs on the issue of migration through video-conferencing, asked the Centre to look into the letter petitions filed by Kerala MP from Kasaragod constituency Rajmohan Unnithan and one filed by an MP from West Bengal on the issues related to coronavirus.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said migration of people cannot be allowed at this juncture as this would enable the spread of coronavirus.

Referring to the last census, Mehta said there were about 4.14 crore persons who had migrated for work but backward migration is now happening due to coronavirus fears. He said the entire country was required to be locked so that people don’t mix.

“We are trying to ensure that no migration is permitted. It would be risky for them and for the village populations. So far, rural India is unaffected by coronavirus but there is possibility of three of 10 moving from cities to rural areas carrying the virus,” he said.

Mehta said advisory has been issued to the States regarding complete prohibition of inter-State migration and as per the central control room, around 6,63,000 persons have been provided shelter so far.

He said that over 22,88,000 persons are being provided food as these are needy persons, migrants and daily wagers who have reached somewhere but have been stopped and kept in shelters.

The Bench adjourned the hearing on the PILs to April 7, asking the Centre to ensure that duties of managing the shelter homes are entrusted to volunteers and not to the police and there should not be any use of force or intimidation.

It asked the Centre to prevent migration of people and take care of their needs of food, shelter, nourishment and medical aid.

The Centre told the apex court that the suggestion by a petitioner to sprinkle water and chemicals on migrants to sanitise them does not work scientifically and is not the right way.

The top court, which refused to restrain High Courts from taking up the issue of migrants, said they may monitor the issue more closely.

It, however, asked the Centre to tell Government lawyers to inform High Courts about the orders passed by the apex court.

The Bench, initially observed, “We will be passing an order that the portal for information will be set up in 24 hours. You will have to ensure that all those whose migration you have stopped are taken care of in terms of food, shelter, nourishment and medical aid. You will also follow up on those who you have identified as cases of COVID-19 and quarantined”.

Mehta told the court that Government would shortly implement a system where panic of migrant workers would be addressed and they would also be offered counselling.

“When will you set up the centres? Where are the counsellors coming from? Where will you get them from? Where will you send them?” the Bench asked, adding, “This is not a definite statement”.

Mehta said trained counsellors of the district mental health programmes would be sent to which the Bench said, “There are 620 districts in India. How many counsellors do they have in total?”

“We want to impress upon you that the panic will destroy more lives than the virus. You need counsellors,” the Bench said, adding, “You can have ‘’Bhajan, Kirtan, Namaz’’ or whatever but you have to give strength to the people.”

Mehta said the authorities would mobilise religious leaders to counsel the migrants in shelters so that they could stay calm and added, “I am making a statement here that within 24 hours, we will mobilise trained counsellors and religious leaders”.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/30--migrants-may-be-corona--ve--so-halted--centre-to-sc-2020-04-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/30--migrants-may-be-corona--ve--so-halted--centre-to-sc.html
195,01-4-20,The Society' actor Olivia Nikkanen tests positive for coronavirus,"Actor Olivia Nikkanen, best known for her roles on shows ""The Society"" and ""Supergirl"", says she has tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

196,01-4-20,"China lockdown may have blocked 700,000 virus cases: researchers","China's decision to lock down the city of Wuhan, ground zero for the global COVID-19 pandemic, may have prevented more than 700,000 new cases by delaying the spread of the virus, researchers said Tuesday.

Drastic Chinese control measures in the first 50 days of the epidemic bought other cities across the country valuable time to prepare and install their own restrictions, according to the paper by researchers in China, the United States and the UK, published in the journal Science.

By day 50 of the epidemic -- February 19 -- there were 30,000 confirmed cases in China, said Oxford fellow Christopher Dye, one of the paper's authors.

""Our analysis suggests that without the Wuhan travel ban and the national emergency response there would have been more than 700,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases outside of Wuhan by that date,"" he was quoted as saying in a press release.

""China's control measures appear to have worked by successfully breaking the chain of transmission -- preventing contact between infectious and susceptible people.""

The researchers used a combination of case reports, public health information and mobile phone location tracking to investigate the spread of the virus.

The phone tracking provided a ""fascinating"" new stream of data, said another of the report's authors, Penn State biology professor Ottar Bjornstad.

The time period they studied encompassed China's biggest holiday, the Lunar New Year.

The researchers ""were able to compare patterns of travel into and out of Wuhan during the outbreak with cell phone data from two previous spring festivals,"" Bjornstad said.

""The analysis revealed an extraordinary reduction in movement following the travel ban of January 23, 2020. Based on this data, we could also calculate the likely reduction in Wuhan-associated cases in other cities across China.""

The Wuhan shutdown delayed the arrival of the virus in other cities, their model showed, giving them time to prepare by banning public gatherings and closing entertainment venues, among other measures.

Nearly half of humanity has now been told to stay home to curb the spread of the virus, and lockdowns are rapidly becoming normalized.

But when Beijing first shut down Wuhan more than two months ago, the decision was seen as a dramatic escalation in the fight against infection.

With the restrictions in the city slowly being lifted and life inching closer to normal, the question for China -- and other countries around the globe -- is what will happen once movement resumes.

""We are acutely aware that resident or imported infections could lead to a resurgence of transmission,"" said another of the report's authors, Huaiyu Tian, an associate professor of epidemiology at Beijing Normal University.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-lockdown-may-have-blocked-700-000-virus-cases--researchers-2020-04-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-lockdown-may-have-blocked-700-000-virus-cases--researchers.html

198,01-4-20,"COVID-19 death toll crosses 1,000 in New York City","More than 1,000 people have died in the New York City alone from COVID-19 as the authorities struggled to procure enough medical equipment to cope with the rising coronavirus cases and warned that the it is approaching the toughest weeks of this crisis.

According to the official data, the total number of COVID-19 cases in the City was 41,771 and 1,096 people died of the disease as of March 31.

At least 8,400 people are hospitalized and of those, at least 1,888 are in the ICU.

New York State, the epicenter of pandemic in the US, had on Sunday passed the grim milestone of more than 1,000 deaths due to the novel coronavirus, with Governor Andrew Cuomo warning that thousands of people might die before the crisis ends.

New York State now has 75,000 coronavirus cases and 1,550 people have died of the disease, an increase of 332 deaths within 24 hours.

We're approaching the toughest weeks of this crisis, and our City is rising to the challenge, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Tuesday.

We are increasing hospital capacity at breakneck speed to ensure that every person in need of care will get it no questions asked, he said.

State and City officials have been struggling to procure enough medical equipment and supplies and even healthcare personnel to deal with the rapidly growing coronavirus cases.

As hospitals across the state operate at more than full capacity, temporary hospital facilities are being constructed at various locations across the city, from Central Park to convention centres to the site of the US Open tennis tournament.

The mayor announced that a new temporary hospital facility will be set up at the Billie Jean King Tennis Center in Flushing Meadow, Queens, the home of the US Open.

The facility will treat COVID non-ICU patients beginning next Tuesday and will reach its full capacity of 350 patients over the next three weeks.

These additional beds will help relieve some of the current need at Elmhurst Hospital.

NYC Health and Hospitals, which operates the public hospitals and clinics in New York City, has now added 1,000 contract nurses to support the existing staff system.

To support the continued surge of patients, Health + Hospitals will also add an additional 1,000 nurses in the coming weeks.

The City has also asked the federal government to supply 1,000 nurses, 3,000 respiratory therapists, and 150 doctors to support the hospital staff.

It has also put out a call to oral surgeons, plastic surgeons, and veterinarians to donate ventilators that are currently not in use.

To date, a total of 3,056,000 face masks, 3,287,880 N95 masks, 65,470 gowns, and 1,305,940 surgical gloves to hospitals have been distributed across the City.

Cuomo, addressing his daily press briefing on the COVID19 pandemic, said that a new hospital network Central Coordinating Team will help facilitate a more coordinated and strategic approach among the state's healthcare system in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cuomo, whose brother and CNN anchor Chris Cuomo tested positive for the virus, said that states have to prepare to deal with the apex, when the number of COVID-19 cases will peak.

And the main battle is at the apex. We're still going up the mountain. The apex of the curve and then we come down the other side of the mountain. We are planning now for the battle at the top of the mountain, he said, adding that the state is getting a staffing plan ready and stockpiling equipment.

We're gathering equipment that we don't need today because today is not the day of the battle. The battle is when we hit the apex, depending on who you believe, 14 days to 30 days from today,"" he said.

Voicing concern that states and cities in the US do not have enough supplies, Cuomo said there is need to pool all supplies.

We also talked again at length about ventilators which everybody knows is a key piece of equipment, identifying all the ventilators in the state, who has them, who has them in a stockpile, who ordered them, who expects them to come in and we'll have one stockpile of ventilators that we can distribute for everyone who needs them.

""We also talked about splitting of ventilators because that's a technology that does exist. It's been used before. It's not ideal. You take one ventilator and it's used for two patients, he said.

Cuomo had earlier said that states across the US are fighting amongst themselves to source essential medical supplies as coronavirus cases in the country surge daily and ironically enough most entities are looking to source their materials from China.

200,01-4-20,"China reveals 1,541 asymptomatic COVID-19 cases amid concerns of second wave of infections","For the first time since the COVID-19 outbreak, China on Wednesday revealed the presence of 1,541 asymptomatic cases carrying the deadly novel coronavirus, raising concerns of a second wave of infections amid the relaxation of stringent measures in the country initiated to contain the deadly disease.

Asymptomatic coronavirus cases are those who carry the virus but do not show any symptoms and can cause sporadic clusters of infections.

In a surprise announcement on Tuesday, China's National Health Commission (NHC) said it would begin to release the data of asymptomatic patients.

A total of 1,541 asymptomatic patients infected with COVID-19 have been put under medical observation in China by the end of Monday, including 205 imported cases, state-run Xinhua news agency quoted the NHC in a statement.

Besides the asymptomatic cases, there are reports of 35 new imported cases and one domestic infection, NHC said on Wednesday.

The total number of imported cases has risen to 806, it said.

Seven more people have died of the disease, taking the total number to 3,312.

As of Tuesday, a total of 81,554 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 had been reported on the Chinese mainland.

The announcement about asymptomatic cases came as the other countries are including asymptomatic cases in their number of confirmed cases for their potential to infect others.

Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported that the data suggested that by the end of February, more than 43,000 people in mainland China had tested positive for the coronavirus but had no immediate symptoms.

They were not included in the official tally of the confirmed cases.

There is no official explanation why these cases have not been included earlier.

Starting on Wednesday, China will publish the number and conditions of asymptomatic people due to heightened concerns over the risks posed by these stealth virus carriers, who were excluded from the official tally of confirmed cases, Chang Jile, head of NHC's disease control bureau, said on Tuesday.

Both asymptomatic cases and their close contacts will be quarantined in centralised facilities for 14 days. These patients won't be released until they test negative for the virus twice, he added.

""The Commission has always attached great importance to asymptomatic infections and taken strict measures to cope with such cases and their close contacts,"" he said.

The decline of coronavirus cases even in its epicentres in Hubei province and its capital Wuhan prompted China to relax its lockdown permitting people to travel out.

China, which has banned new arrivals of foreigners to minimise imported cases, is limping back to normal with most of the factories and businesses humming with activity.

While releasing the figures of the asymptomatic cases, the NHC said a previous study showed that the viral load in samples from asymptomatic infected patients is not much different from that of confirmed cases.

The symptom-free individuals infected with COVID-19 may lead to further spreading of the disease, but the infectivity of asymptomatic cases is still unclear, the NHC statement said.

Some experts believe that without coughing or sneezing, asymptomatic infections may be less infectious, it said.

Unconfirmed reports also said that China plans to do large scale serological testing of its population to detect the presence of antibodies against a microorganism.

A serologic test can determine whether a person has been exposed to a particular microorganism.

As China steps up screening and quarantine of symptom-free patients, health authorities are also rushing to take samples in areas severely affected by the virus for epidemiologic research on asymptomatic cases in a bid to improve its overall disease control measures, Chang said.

""Monitoring data has shown that some asymptomatic people have caused second-generation transmission among their close contacts, and they have set off a small number of clusters of infections,"" Chang said.

While the domestic coronavirus epidemic has abated due to aggressive containment measures, public appeals for releasing more information on asymptomatic people and tightening control over them have been running high, China Daily reported.

During a meeting on Monday, the central leading group for epidemic control headed by Premier Li Keqiang also emphasised the monitoring and managing of asymptomatic infections and their close contacts.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-reveals-1-541-asymptomatic-covid-19-cases-amid-concerns-of-second-wave-of-infections-2020-04-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-reveals-1-541-asymptomatic-covid-19-cases-amid-concerns-of-second-wave-of-infections.html

The island nation has recorded only one death due to the novel coronavirus. A 65-year-old diabetic man who died on Sunday had contracted the virus from Lanka's second COVID 19 patient who was in contact with a group of Italian tourists.

Another 21 COVID-19 infected patients were reported in Sri Lanka on Tuesday, the highest single-day increase so far, increasing the total number of cases to 143, the Health Ministry said on Wednesday.

A total of 173 more people are under observation at National Institute of Infectious Diseases (IDH).

Meanwhile, the country continues to remain under curfew and a restriction remained imposed on foreign arrivals.

Indefinite curfew will continue in Colombo, Gampaha, Kaluthra, Puttalam, Jaffna and Kandy, while for other regions, the ban was lifted for eight hours -- from 6:00 AM to 2:00 PM -- on Monday.

The areas have been placed under a strict curfew with deliveries of essentials to households. In order to prevent public movements.

Over 7,000 people have been arrested for curfew violations, police said.

Health officials said Sri Lanka is reaching its critical phase of the COVID-19 with the advent of April.

""The next two weeks will be crucial,"" Jayaruwan Bandara of the Medical Research Institute said.

""Sri Lanka is showing the same pattern of spike as was seen in other countries like Italy, Spain and US. So please stay indoors. This will be the only way to prevent this from being spread,"" Bandara said.

Travelling to and from all districts is completely prohibited except for the purpose of providing essential services.

The ban on foreign arrivals has been extended till April 7 to contain the spread of the virus.

The Commissioner General of Prisons said some 1,460 prisoners will be released in view of the coronavirus threat.

Those inmates will be released who are serving jail terms for failing to fulfil bail conditions, he said.

Meanwhile, the Central Bank has announced setting up of a refinancing facility which includes a debt moratorium and a working capital loan for the COVID-19 hit businesses and individuals. Small and Medium Enterprises are to benefit under the scheme.

According to the estimates by the Johns Hopkins University, there are more than 850,500 confirmed coronavirus cases in the world, and over 41,000 deaths.

202,01-4-20,"Highest day spike, cases cross 1,600","India entered the second week of the nationwide lockdown, recording the highest single-day spike of 266 fresh cases of coronavirus during the last 24 hours. By Wednesday evening, the number of positive cases rose to 1,617 and death count stood at 40, according to figures received from States.

However, the Health Ministry website, which was last updated on Tuesday 9 pm, confirmed only1,397 cases. On Monday, India had reported 92 new coronavirus cases and four deaths.

Six people from Telangana who attended a religious congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area died due to the coronavirus. “The lockdown, social distancing is to ensure that people remain where they are. There is no need to panic because of the lockdown”: Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said at a press briefing here.

He said that to contain the spread, the focus of the Government directly shifts to contract-tracing as soon as a case is reported in an area.

The Union Health Ministry official said that the hotspots of Covid-19 in India increased even as the number of cases spike across the nation. “Where ever a case is reported, it’s a hotspot for us,” he said when asked how many hotspots have been identified so far where the Government is focusing its containment strategy.

While the Union Health Ministry has maintained the virus is still in the local transmission stage in India and yet to move to the community transmission phase maintained that it was not the time to find faults but to take action.

“With respect to the Nizamuddin area, we all need to understand and appreciate that this is not the time to do fault finding. What is important for us is to take action as per our containment process in whatever areas we find a case,” Agarwal said.

Twenty-four people, who took part in a religious congregation in Nizamuddin West earlier this month, have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. He said screening of all those who participated in the event is being conducted by the Government.

Agarwal said there was lack of support in some locations and information was not being passed on or being passed on late which led to this high number of cases in a single day. He warned that a lapse by a single person can cause grave damage by resulting in multiple transmissions and emphasised that the fight against Covid-19 is a collective exercise and everybody should cooperate in following the guidelines and maintaining social distancing.

With 24 more cases, Delhi is also fast witnessing sharp surge in the coronavirus cases as also Kerala and Maharashtra.

Jaishankar spoke to Pompeo over phone on Tuesday. This is the second call between the two leaders in recent weeks after the coronavirus outbreak.

Earlier on March 14, the two top diplomats discussed ways in which India and the US could cooperate to address this global challenge.

The issue also figured in the talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump during the latter's trip to India in February.

Our close cooperation is imperative to combat the coronavirus, including strengthening global pharmaceutical and health care manufacturing and supply chains, Pompeo said in a tweet after the phone call between the two leaders.

The number of those infected by the deadly disease surged to 164,000 and fatalities crossed 3,100 in the US.

In India, there are over 1,400 infections and at least 45 deaths due to the disease.

According Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre, over 850,000 people globally have contracted the disease, while over 42,000 people have died of it.

According to State Department Spokesperson Morgan Ortagus, the Secretary of State highlighted the importance of continued close cooperation between the US, India and other close partners and allies to combat this international crisis.

He also reiterated the US' unwavering commitment to work with India to advance peace, prosperity and security in the Indo-Pacific and around the globe, the spokesperson said in a readout of the call.

205,01-4-20,India welcomes President Ghani's decision to initiate intra-Afghan talks,"India on Wednesday welcomed Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's decision to form a team for intra-Afghan negotiation, hoping that the ""positive step"" would help in freeing the war-ravaged country from the scourge of ""externally sponsored"" terrorism.

The announcement by Ghani on formation of the team for intra-Afghan dialogue came weeks after the US inked a historic peace deal with the Taliban, effectively drawing curtains to Washington's 18-year war in Afghanistan since 2001.

""India welcomes the announcement by the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan about formation of a team for intra- Afghan negotiations,"" the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.

India also called upon all sections of the political spectrum in Afghanistan to work together to meet the aspirations of all people in that country including those from the minority community for a prosperous and safe future.

""India has consistently supported an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled process for enduring peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan,"" the MEA said.

""In this context, we view the formation of the team as a positive step which would lead to a peaceful and stable future for Afghanistan free from the scourge of externally sponsored terrorism,"" the MEA said.

There has been global concerns over Pakistan's support to Taliban and other terror groups operating in Afghanistan.

Days before inking of the peace deal between the US and Taliban, India conveyed to the Trump administration that pressure on Pakistan to crack down on terror networks operating from its soil must be kept up though Islamabad's cooperation for peace in Afghanistan is crucial.

The deal, inked on February 29, allows for the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan. The US has lost over 2,400 soldiers in Afghanistan since late 2001. India has been a key stakeholder in the peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan.

India has been supporting a national peace and reconciliation process which is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan controlled.

India has also been maintaining that care should be taken to ensure that any such process does not lead to any ""ungoverned spaces"" where terrorists and their proxies can relocate.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-welcomes-president-ghani-s-decision-to-initiate-intra-afghan-talks-2020-04-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/india-welcomes-president-ghani-s-decision-to-initiate-intra-afghan-talks.html
206,01-4-20,Housing insecurity may increase kidney disease risk,"Housing insecurity -- high housing costs or unsafe living conditions that prevent self-care and threaten independence -- may have negative effects on kidney health, warn researchers.

In the study, published in the journal Kidney360, the researchers found that housing insecurity was linked with a higher risk of developing albuminuria, a sign of kidney disease.

""Housing insecurity is increasing across America. Here we show that housing insecurity may be affecting the health of Americans, and it potentially increases the risk for subsequent development of kidney disease,"" said study lead author Tessa K Novick from University of Texas in the US.

Previous studies have indicated that housing insecurity may contribute to delayed healthcare visits and may compromise individuals' health.

To examine its potential relationship to the risk of developing kidney disease, the research team analysed data on black and white community-dwelling adults between the ages of 30 and 64 years from 13 neighbourhoods in both low and high socioeconomic strata in Baltimore City, Maryland.

The individuals were participating in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the 'Life Span Study'.

Among 1,262 participants, 405 (32 per cent) reported housing insecurity.

After a median follow-up of 3.5 years, 16 per cent of participants experienced rapid kidney function decline and seven per cent developed albuminuria (excess albumin in the urine, which is a sign of kidney disease).

After adjusting for demographic and clinical factors, housing insecurity was associated with a 3.2-fold higher odds of albuminuria, but it was not associated with rapid kidney function decline, the study said.

""Longer follow up and additional studies using larger cohorts are needed to further evaluate the impact of housing insecurity on rapid kidney function decline and reduced glomerular filtration rate,"" Novick added.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/housing-insecurity-may-increase-kidney-disease-risk-2020-04-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/housing-insecurity-may-increase-kidney-disease-risk.html
207,01-4-20,"US headed for 'tough', 'painful' two weeks: Trump","The US is headed for a ""tough two weeks"", President Donald Trump has warned, advising people to be prepared for the ""hard days"" ahead, as the country fights the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic that the White House projects could claim one to two lakh lives during the next fortnight.

Trump's remarks came as Deborah Bix, a member of White House Task Force on coronavirus, based on a model from actual data from the ground, said the death toll in the US could be between 100,000 to 200,000, with the strict implementation of the existing mitigation measures including social distancing till April 30.

If no steps were to be taken, the death toll could range between 1.5 million and 2.2 million, Brix said on a day when the confirmed number of coronavirus infections in the US, according to the Worldometer website, skyrocketed to over 188,000, adding more than 24,000 new cases in a single day and the fatalities rose to 3,867.

""I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead,"" Trump told reporters on Tuesday at a briefing which has now become his daily coronavirus press conference at the White House for more than 10 days.

""We're going to go through a very tough two weeks and then, hopefully, as the experts are predicting, as I think a lot of us are predicting after having studied it so hard, we are going to start seeing some real light at the end of the tunnel. But this is going to be a very painful, very, very, very painful two weeks,"" Trump said.

In this grim scenario, where the daily death toll keeps on jumping at an unprecedented rate, and more than 250 million of the American population has been forced to stay inside their homes, the president asked his countrymen to be positive and cooperate in this war against the invisible army of coronavirus.

""I want to give people hope. I'm a cheerleader for the country,"" said Trump who is the seeking his re-election in the November presidential elections.

Campaigning has come to a standstill and it is unlikely to revive in the next few months. The social distancing measures now have been extended for another 30 days till April 30. The country is expected to face the peak in coronavirus around middle of April.

""We're going through the worst thing that the country has probably ever seen. Look, we had - the Civil War, we lost 600,000 people, right? Here's a thing, had we not done anything, we would have lost many times that. But we did something, so it's going to be, hopefully, way under that,"" he said.

""But you know, we lose more here potentially than you lose in world wars as a country. So there's nothing positive, there's nothing great about it, I want to get people in this country hope. I think it's very important,"" Trump said.

The United States is in the midst of a great national trial, Trump said.

This is ""unlike any we have ever faced before you all see it, you see it probably better than most. We are at war with a deadly virus,"" he said.

""Success in this fight will require the full absolute measure of our collective strength, love, and devotion. Very important. Each of us has the power through our own choices and actions to save American lives and rescue the most vulnerable among us; that is why we really have to do what we all know is right,"" he said.

""Every citizen is being called upon to make sacrifices. Every business is being asked to fulfil its patriotic duty. Every community is making fundamental changes to how we live, work and interact each and every day, and I wouldn't be surprised to see this going on long into the future when this virus is gone and defeated,"" the president said.

So far, New York alone accounts for 75,795 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 15,50 deaths. As compared, China from where it all started in November-December time frame had 81,518 cases and 33,05 deaths.

In addition to New York, till Tuesday nine States had reported more than 5,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus. The States being New Jersey, California, Michigan, Florida, Massachusetts, Illinois, Washington, Louisiana and Pennsylvania. Sixteen other States had more than 1,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus.

While the deadly disease has spread like a wildfire from coast to coast, more than 100 deaths have been reported in at least eight States of New Jersey, California, Michigan, Washington, Louisiana, Georgia, and Illinois. New York tops the list with more than 15,50 deaths.

Members of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus asserted that they were pulling out all resources to bring down the projected number of fatalities.

""Our hope is to get that down as far as we possibly can. The modelling that Dr Birx showed predicts that number that you saw. We don't accept that number, that that's what's going to be. We're going to be doing everything we can to get it even significantly below that,"" said Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director and a member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus.

""This is the thing that we need to anticipate, but that doesn't mean that that's what we're going to accept. We want to do much, much better than that,"" he told reporters in response to a question.

Officials in Pakistan are scrambling to contain the disease by appealing to the public to remain inside homes and go out only in cases of emergencies. But there was little impact on the masses and in several cities, people were seen roaming out while security officials were trying to convince them to go back to their places.

He has already announced Rs 1,200 billion package to deal with the economic challenges posed by the coronavirus crisis.

The CHZ spans over Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, Telangana and meteorological sub-divisions of Madhya Maharashtra, Marathwada and coastal Andhra Pradesh.

This in turn suggests that slightly above normal frequency of heat wave conditions likely in the core HW zone during the season.

According to IMD, a heat wave is recorded when the maximum temperature is 4-5 degrees Celsius above normal in regions where the normal maximum temperature is more than 40 degrees; and 5-6 degrees above normal where the normal maximum temperature is less that 40 degrees. A heat wave is also declared when the actual maximum temperature remains above 45 degrees Celsius at any place irrespective of its normal maximum temperature.

During this year’s summer, the average minimum would be over 1 degree Celsius from normal. Warmer nights have been forecast over Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Odisha, Jharkhand and some parts of central India during the next three months.

According to the latest weather model inputs, the El Nino Southern Oscillation condition continues to remain in neutral phase and it shall continue to remain so, till the end of June, stated the seasonal forecast.

Whenever there is El Nino condition - that is abnormal warming observed along the equatorial Pacific Ocean - the global temperatures are high. This warming also interferes with rainfall during the Indian southwest monsoon.

According to the IMD study, five States which include Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Meghalaya and Nagaland have shown significant decreasing trends in southwest monsoon rainfall during the recent 30 years period (1989-2018) while the other States do not show any significant changes in southwest monsoon rainfall during the same period. ""The maximum monsoon seasonal rainfall is reported over Goa State with 2878.0 mm followed by 2702.4 mm over Meghalaya. Similarly, the lowest monsoon rainfall of 311.7 mm is reported over Tamil Nadu followed by 414.2 mm over Rajasthan. Over major states of central India, the mean rainfall ranges from 800 mm to 1400 mm."" it said.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hotter-summer-to-clip-corona---s-wings-2020-04-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/hotter-summer-to-clip-corona---s-wings.html

Among various projects, he has Ekta's film ""KTina"" in his kitty. The film stars Disha Patani in the central role.

""It's about a Punjabi girl who is really into astrology. It's her love story,"" Akshay told IANS.

In the past, he did Ekta's web series ""The Test Case"" and ""Hum Tum And Them"". Since she is a popular name in the world of television, would he like to take up a TV show backed by her?

""Sure. Why not? If Ekta feels that I am fit for a TV show that she is producing, then why not? The only thing is that the way TV shows work in India is...they are all daily soaps. So it's a longer commitment. It takes a whole year and I like to do multiple projects in a year. That would be the only catch,"" said the ""Pizza"" actor.

After making his Bollywood debut with ""Isi Life Mein"" in 2010, he has managed to be on different platforms. Asked if he had planned his career that way, the ""Gurgaon"" actor said: ""I had planned my career to be an actor. I wanted to be an actor irrespective of the medium. I started acting when I was 16 or 17 in theatre. Then I got my first film.""

But his career didn't take off the way he wanted it to.

""As soon as 'Isi Life Mein' released, I didn't get immediate work,"" he said.

He didn't give up and continued to grab all the opportunities that came his way, without thinking of the medium.

""Acting for camera is a different craft. To get that right, I tried to be in front of camera as many times as possible. I did a lot of short films. Whoever would give me any project to act, I would go and act,"" said Akshay.

""Most of the time, I wasn't even paid for it. That was in the early part of my career. But it didn't matter to me whether I was getting paid or not. It was unfortunate because Mumbai is an expensive city but that wasn't my priority,"" he said.
