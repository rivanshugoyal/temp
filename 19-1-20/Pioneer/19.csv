0,19-1-20,And the trend continues...,"If the past fortnight was any indication we can predict rather confidently that this year may well be as turbulent as the previous one. Looking back, in 2019, we saw economies in turmoil, polities in turmoil, and countries in turmoil. BBC commented that 2019 was the year in which popular protests hit almost all continents except Antarctica. From Hong Kong to Paris, Beirut to Delhi, there was fury on the streets for some reason or the other. In France it was over Pension Reforms, in Iraq over their country’s future, in India over the Citizenship Act. Bolivia, Sudan, France, US, everywhere people were on the boil. What about 2020? The trend continues. Is human patience wearing out or is it that the powers-that-be are taking people for granted. Whatever, but peace is gradually eluding humanity. In management jargon, there is a term to explain this phenomenon. It is said that the Zone of Acceptance of people is shrinking. Zone of Acceptance describes the area of human mind where commands or dictates are tolerated. If a command or dictate falls there it is accepted. This zone is gradually shrinking and thus the likelihood of acceptance of commands or dictates is decreasing. Whether it is actually happening or not or whether such a zone exists at all may not be ascertained very scientifically but inferences can certainly be drawn by taking cues from the events that are unfolding. Dissent and distrust is certainly on the rise and people are not willing to take things lying down. Interestingly, another contradictory tendency is also discernible. More and more people in positions of power are wont to assert their views authoritatively. It is this phenomenon that is intriguing. Whether aversion to authority is on the rise because of authoritarianism or the other way round, but there is undoubtedly a growing discontent among the masses across the globe. There is some kind of a distrust that is engulfing the human mind. A President is elected in Algeria and protestors take to streets. A Prime Minister is not accepted in Lebanon because people believe he is a member of the ruling elite. The French President propose new retirement benefit formula and people take to streets. The Iraqis are wary of some kind of an Iranian interference in what they think is an attempt to decide their country. A law is passed in the Indian Parliament and there is wide spread protest against that. Hong Kong seems to be on the boil continuously. What is going on? And what is going wrong? Long back Austrian psychologist Alfred Adler founded the school of individual psychology and stressed the importance of diffusion of power. He was of the view that power is a great motivator and people have the craving of power. With time, this need for power is getting accentuated and there is growing tendency to power equalise. Though power always was a higher order need of humans, the information age has acted as a strong catalyst. With access to information the individual now starts questioning the authority more aggressively. And he wants to equalise. What makes the other guy more superior to him, he wonders. And the resultant response is his disdain for the other guy. There was a time when few talked and most listened. But the times have changed. Everyone is talking and no one is listening. The New Year, then, seems no different.

1,19-1-20,Govt must let Shaheen Bagh protest peter out,"Till a month ago, and despite having lived in the national Capital for decades, I had no idea where Shaheen Bagh was. Even now I have only the haziest of idea where it is situated. Yet, legend has it that Shaheen Bagh is the epicentre of a mass revolt that will unseat Narendra Modi, banish Amit Shah to Ahmedabad and restore the “idea of India” to its Nehruvian purity. Shaheen Bagh, it is claimed, is the Indian version of Tahrir Square.

The activists are totally mesmerised by the blockade. Some spent Christmas in the outdoor cold, others ushered in the New Year singing the national anthem and yet others have identified their favourite verandah overlooking the dharna where radical tourists can observe the slow death of Hindu India. Protest always generated poetry; at Shaheen Bagh it is generating shairi and the accompanying wah, wah.

The protests are ostensibly against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the clause in invisible ink that says Muslims will be disenfranchised and even turfed out of Hindu India. The protesters have convinced themselves that Amit Shah is hell bent on creating an apartheid regime in India and that Muslims have no alternative but to protest and, if needed, die fighting for their citizenship. As the days have rolled by, the language has become increasingly inflammatory. It started off as a protest against a legislation approved by Parliament; it soon escalated into chants of azadi from an overbearing police; by New Year, the K-word had begun to creep in surreptitiously; and today there is an invocation of Intifada. At this rate, the J-word is not far behind.

Shaheen Bagh has had its cheerleaders. They have come in three categories.

First, there are the activist journalists who believe (sometimes even with hysterical sincerity) that media freedom went into ICU sometime in May 2014 and that it is their divine mission to put life into this living corpse. Their reports are gushy enough to put Mills & Boon to shame and they feel they are ushering in the Inquilab that so eluded Urdu scriptwriters.

Second, there are the quasi-academics and professional agitators who have finally recovered from the depression of May 2019 when they firmly believed that Modi would meet his end at the hands of the Indian voter. They are the publicists for Shaheen Bagh, portraying it as a people’s uprising against an authoritarian regime. The dress of the protesters from the TV footage may tell its own story but the publicists don’t believe that there is any percentage in dissecting the crowds any further. People must be left to think that it is a pure coincidence that the protests are happening in the heart of ghettos, where police action would lead to reinforcements and violent retaliation. People must be left to think that it is a people’s protest and not a Muslim protest. They must be charmed into thinking that it is a democratic protest against an iniquitous law rather than a motivated assault on a government that has stolen a potent weapon from the Muslim community — its political veto. Shaheen Bagh is about trying to reclaim political relevance with women being thrust in the frontline because they are more acceptable and deserving of sympathy than bearded mullahs in their role as community leaders.

Finally there are the radically motivated students playing the role of a self-appointed vanguard of a revolution aimed at ousting an elected government. Their revolutionary zeal is understandable, as is their appreciation of song and poetry. Their choice of partners in struggle — ranging from discredited politicians and professional student leaders to upholders of medievalist dogma — can also be condoned as their coalition dharma. However, what is absolutely unpardonable is the lengths the student agitators have gone to make universities high voltage zones of intellectual intolerance. This isn’t a phenomenon that prevails in all the institutions of higher education. The centres of excellence specialising in the sciences, engineering, technology, medicine and management have coupled their understandable interest in political controversies with an open mind. This is not the case with the ‘elite’ universities that also have a liberal arts focus. These have become isolated outposts of a mindset that most of India cannot identify with. Left unchecked, it may even provoke a town-gown schism that isn’t good for either society or education.

By the way, an incidental outcome of this stir is that Aligarh Muslim University, which at the centre of the movement for Pakistan in the 1940s, has now chosen to redeem itself by aggressively flaunting its commitment to an expansive Indian-ness. The shift should be welcomed and made non-negotiable. The national flag must fly at all times at AMU and the national anthem should be made obligatory.

As of this week the stir at Shaheen Bagh is at a crossroads. The empowered women participants want to go on until CAA is repealed or the police takes action and invite global outrage. However, the politicised activists who have ridden piggyback on the Shaheen Bagh protests feel that a backlash is brewing and that this could have a small bearing on the Delhi Assembly elections which they want Arvind Kejriwal to win handsomely. I think the government should do nothing draconian, just allow the protests to peter out. The Muslim women in Shaheen Bagh were pawns in a bigger political game and it is best that game is played out at the appropriate level. The mythology of glorious dissent will be deflated in the natural course.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/govt-must-let-shaheen-bagh-protest-peter-out.html

9,19-1-20,Rally against GUTSL irregularities held in Brahmapur,"The Bharatiya Bikash Parishad organised a anti-corruption rally against some high-level officials of Ganjam district here on Saturday.

A large number of people, including social workers and senior citizens, led by Parishad State president Surendra Panigrahi holding anti-corruption placards moved to the RDC office where they submitted a comprehensive memorandum, addressed to the Governor and the Chief Minister. The Parishad also submitted a copy of the memorandum by Post to the President, the Central Vigilance Commission and the Chief Justice of India for necessary action.

Among others, the Parishad demanded investigations into the gross irregularities and corrupt practices of the Ganjam Urban Transport Services Limited (GUTSL), informed Panigrahi.

If the Government fails to conduct an impartial investigation, the Parishad would intensify agitation, said Panigrahi.

The BeMC and its three adjoining NACs had received Government grants to systematically develop communication infrastructure in the region. To implement the projects, the local authorities incorporated a public limited company, “Ganjam Urban Transport Services Limited (GUTSL)”, in 2013. The company was vested with the then district Collector, SP and a band of OAS officers who grossly misused their official power as reflected in the audit report, the memorandum claimed.

The memorandum mentioned names of eight officers who, among others, then were actively involved in the matter. Quoting the extract of the audit report, the memorandum mentioned, “such an act of corruption may be viewed seriously in the light of the several dictums of the Apex Court which described such corrupt practices by misusing the official power as issue of utmost vitality and in view of this the matter needs an impartial probe to unfold the truth.”

The memorandum also demanded to include the present district Collector in probing the matter as he is not handling the matter diligently to curb out the corrupt practice.

During FY 2014-15, the company run the vehicles and earned revenue of Rs 2.48 crore against Rs 2.97 crore spent towards fuel and employees. In FY 2015-16, the company purchased 38 buses at Rs 20 lakh per bus and the operational loss of each bus was Rs 6.68 lakh in the same year.

20,19-1-20,‘Gender-based inequality at its peak in State’,"The Government must take action to eliminate discriminations against women and to prevent gender-based violence against them, said women rights activists at a workshop held on Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) here on Saturday.

The workshop was organised by the Odisha Shramajeebee Manch and the Mahila Shramajeebee Manch, Odisha, which work towards socioeconomic and political empowerment of people, especially of tribals, Dalits and women.

“Orthodox and brutish male-dominated family systems, and the tradition of patriarchal inheritance have shored up the idea that women are mere ‘possessions’. All forms of violence against women must be stopped and collective actions to abate this are a need of the hour,” said Shanti Bhoi, president, Mahila Shramajeebi Manch.

She said Odisha contributes to about 3.0 per cent of India’s population but, with 94.5 cases of crime against women per lakh people, it contributed to 5.6 per cent of all crimes against women in 2017. It ranks as the second-worst State on this front as per the National Crime Record Bureau report, 2017.

Inequality, in a gender lens, is undoubtedly a daunting challenge.

The National Family Health Survey (NFHS 4) data shows a grim picture. Between 2012 and 2018, the incidence of rape cases in Odisha increased from 7.2 per lakh women to 9.7 per lakh women. In the six years, 2,921 women have been killed for dowry-related issues in the State.

The data further disclosed that the female literacy rate in the State is 67.4 per cent. By the time girls turn 15, their school attendance drops to 63 per cent. Therefore, the State Government must prioritise efforts to ensure an equitable and a rightful place for girls and women, said Bhoi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---gender-based-inequality-at-its-peak-in-state---.html

29,19-1-20,Youth cadres demand change of PCC chief,"During the visit of AICC general secretary and Odisha-in-charge Jitendra Singh to Sambalpur on Wednesday, Congress youth cadres were seen holding banners welcoming Singh but demanding the change of the OPCC president.

Singh had visited the district along with AICC secretary Mastan Ali, OPCC president Niranjan Patnaik, Balangir MLA Narasingha Mishra and Kantabanji MLA Santosh Singh Saluja and others to tell party workers about the anti-people policies of the Union Government and to seek their opinion on the revival of the party in west Odisha.

A meeting was conducted under the chairmanship of Sambalpur district president Aswini Guru where district presidents, secretaries, former MLAs and MPs, MLA and MP candidates of the last election and district level leaders of Sambalpur, Balangir, Subarnapur, Deogarh and Bargarh participated.

After the fall of BJD-BJP alliance in 2009 election, the Congress regained Bargarh, Kalahandi and Sundergarh Lok Sabha seats. However, it could not retain these seats in 2014 and 2019 elections. Defection of the then Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly Bhupinder Singh before 2014 polls, the Congress weakened in the western Odisha. Later, untimely death of Bijepur Congress MLA Subal Sahoo and subsequent joining of his wife in the BJD further weakened the party further. Further, quitting of MLA Naba Das, former Chief Minister Hemanda Biswal’s daughter Sunita and former MLA Sadhu Nepak caused disaster to the party in western Odisha.

The party lost all Lok Sabha seats to the BJP and most of the Assembly seats to the BJD, excepting Kantabanji, Khariar, Balangir and Rajgangpur seats.

In this backdrop, visit of the high power central team to the district was significant. It is not easy to recover but asking for feedback from caders was a right step for recovery. Singh, Patnaik and others met the district teams separately and sought their opinions.

Many workers reportedly demanded the resignation of the leaders who were in charge of the last general elections. They demanded that the youth should be allowed to lead party organisations at all levels.

The demand for the change of the PCC leadership was obvious as the region suffered terrible electoral loss. At the State-level, a section is also demanding the change of PCC guard. Few days ago, the national youth wing president had also snubbed the PCC president for interfering in the State structure. The OPCC president had rightly submitted his resignation after the 2019 poll disaster but it has not been accepted by the AICC. While analysts opine that a change of guard in the Odisha Congress is required as the BJP did so recently, it depends on the AICC to take a decision in this regard.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/youth-cadres-demand-change-of-pcc-chief.html
30,19-1-20,SC norms on good samaritans not followed in Baleswar,"Although the State Government has formulated a policy in 2018, acting on the direction of the Supreme Court for the protection of rescuers (Good Samaritans) pertaining to road accidents, yet in Baleswar district the outcome is dismal solely due to lack of awareness of such policy.

It may be noted Baleswar is in 7th place on the number of road accident cases in the State.

The guidelines of the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways have to be followed by hospitals, police and all other authorities for the protection of the Good Samaritans by maintaining perfect sync.

A Good Samaritan is one who makes a phone call to the police to give information about any accident injury or death. He shall be allowed to leave by the concerned police official(s) and no further questions shall be asked if he or she does not desire to be witness in the matter. The Good Samaritan after taking the road accident victim to the hospital may, if he or she so desires, leave his or her address with contact number, email address, if any, for the purpose of reward or trial in a standard format prescribed by the State Health and Family Welfare Department.

Disciplinary action shall be initiated by the Government against the concerned public officials who force or intimidate a Good Samaritan or a by-stander for revealing his or her name or personal details.

Further, the policy says , the Good Samaritan or the bystander shall be suitably rewarded or compensated to encourage other citizens to come forward and help the road accident victims by admitting them in hospitals.

Traffic officer-in-charge, Baleswar Prasant Ransingh said that in the district none has been given cash incentive so far ever since the policy was enacted in the State, solely due to lack of awareness and noncooperation of the hospitals.

“ The forms issued by the RTO are available in all hospitals, including PHCs and CHCs. The forms have to be filled in three copies ( carbon) by the attending doctor. One copy for office, another would be given to the individual who ferried the accident victim to the place and the last one would be sent to the RTO. The cash would be disbursed by the RTO to the individual ( Good Samaritan) after verification. As the hospitals are not following the SOP, the result is nil,” said Ransingh.

“ The hospitals would be asked through the CDMO to fill the forms and send to the RTO henceforth,” said Additional District Magistrate Sambit Nayak.

The figure shows there is a steady rise of road accidents in Baleswar. While in 2016, the figure of fatal cases was 198 including 119 in 2019, the figure shot up to 247 including 105 on NH and 76 on SH.

In 2017 and 2018, the numbers of road accident deaths in the district are 230 and 228 respectively, official sources said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sc-norms-on-good-samaritans-not-followed-in-baleswar.html

34,19-1-20,Crime against women increases in Haryana,"Data of National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) and Haryana State Commission for Women (HSCW) suggests that crime against women has increased in Haryana this year in comparison to previous two years, triggering concern.

Opposition parties, including Congress and Indian National Lok Dal have slammed the State Government over increasing crimes against women in the State. Referring to NCRB reports, the opposition leaders said that the Haryana has stood at third ranks in crime against women across the country.

The NCRB data shows that year by year, crimes against women in Haryana are increasing rapidly. Citing NCRB data, a Congress leader said that 9511 cases of crime against women were registered. This means about 26 cases of crimes were committed daily. This increased to 9839 in the year 2016 while 11,370 in 2017. However, the recently released figures of the year 2018 by NCRB reveal that in the year 2018, crimes against women have increased by 26 percent as compared to the year 2017.

In 2018, there were 14,326 crimes against women which is an average of 39 crimes against women were committed each day. “If we talk about rape cases, according to the NCRB data, 1099 rape cases were reported in the year 2017. While the number of rape cases increased by more than 17 percent in the year 2018 compared to the year 2017. The rape cases increased to 1296 in the year 2018, they added.

Understanding the gravity of the latest data and to know and evaluate the actual status of the execution of centre and State Government sponsored schemes being operated for the safety, security and welfare of the women and children, the Haryana State Commission for Women has decided to conduct 10-day- long inspection drive from January 20 at Working Women Centres (WWCs), One Stop Centres (OSCs), Mahila Ashram, Safe Houses, Women Police Stations (WPSs) and other centres set up for Women across the State.

As per reports received from the Haryana State Commission for Women, the Commission received seven complaints of gang rape from various parts of the State. Seven complaints of gang rape include one such report received from Gurugram while two from Ambala; two from Kurukshetra; one from Bhiwani and one from Hissar.

As many as 99 rape cases from April 15 to December 15 which include 10 in Hisar, 13 in Panipat, nine in Mewat, seven in Bhiwani, six in Sirsa, seven in Karnal, five each in Sonipat, Yamuna Nagar and Mahendragarh. Seven complaints of gang rape have been reported which include two each in Ambala and Kurukshetra and one each in Gurugram, Bhiwani and Hisar. Moreover, the Commission had received around 150 complaints of sexual harassment of Women at work place from various parts of the State over the last six months.

Commission chairperson Pratibha Suman said that to provide fool-proof security and welfare for women, the central and state government have set up above centres in the State.

The State government has set up around 15 Women Working Centres and 15 Mahila Ashram to facilitate the women of the State. One Stop Centres which is also known as ‘Sakhi’ is an ambitious project of the Union government under the Nirbhaya Fund for providing police, medical and legal help to women victims.

""OSCs have been opened in almost all the districts of the State. This centre resolves any issue related to distress and violence against women. It also provides integrated services and facilities at a single point, saving the victims from unnecessary harassment and delay caused by hassles involved"", she said, adding this centre specifically deals with issues involving crime against women and minors, including rape, molestation, domestic violence, child marriage, child abuse, sexual assault, kidnapping and dowry complaints. These centres have own staff and infrastructure.

The Commission Chairperson said that women affected by violence are provided services like police assistance, medical aid, psycho-socio counseling, legal aid and temporary stay for five days under one roof in one stop centres set up across the State. These centres not only provide legal and medical aid, but also counsel the victim till woman recovers fully and fit for rehabilitation. It has board, lodging and food facility with adequate security. The victim has no need to go anywhere, even the police station, for resolution.She further said that the Women Police Stations have been formed in each district of the State to ensure safety of women and instill among them a sense of security and confidence.

Sources in the Commission, however, said that State’s one-stop centre for women ‘Sakhi’ is facing shortage of staff, basic infrastructure, causing problems to victims of sexual assault, dowry and domestic violence. At many Women Police Stations, the number of women staff has not been deployed. At some place male police officers has been made in-charge of Women Police Station while at few places, SI or inspector has been given additional charge.

Under such circumstances, they could not focus on dealing the cases related women effectively.

The Commission Chairperson said that to know the actual state of these centres, team members led by Commission member would conduct surprise inspections during ten days of inspection drive across the State. After inspection, reports will be sent to the State Government for further action, she said, adding the team has been formed at Commission level and this exercise would be completed within ten days.

35,19-1-20,"War of words between dissident Bajwa, Captain","A fresh war of word broke out between Congress MP Partap Singh Bajwa and Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday on State Advocate General Atul Nanda.

While Bajwa sought the immediate sacking of Punjab Advocate General for allegedly failing to defend the interests of the State ""effectively"" in courts, Capt Amarinder trashed the demand as illogical and irrational asked Partap Bajwa to “keep out of my Government’s business, of which you are totally ignorant.”

In a missive to Capt Amarinder, the Rajya Sabha MP said Nanda's appointment as the Advocate General was due to his proximity to the chief minister.

""Nepotism is against the interests of the State and the appointment of Atul Nanda as Advocate General, Punjab is a perfect example of the same, as his appointment had been solely guided by his proximity to you,"" Bajwa said.

He said the ""incompetence of Nanda to defend the interests of the State effectively is reflected in the repeated failures he faced in the courts"" in various cases, including those related to drug menace, mining, environment protection and sacrilege. Bajwa urged the Chief Minister to sack Nanda immediately and appoint a ""competent person"" in his place.

Taking strong exception to Bajwa’s open letter, listing out the alleged failures of the AG, the Chief Minister termed it a sign of the former Punjab Congress Chief’s desperation to grab political limelight. “I have full faith in the AG,” said Capt Amarinder.

“You are neither competent nor equipped to judge Atul Nanda’s competency, and have no business commenting or interfering on matters of which you have absolutely no knowledge,” said the Chief Minister to Bajwa, reacting sharply to the latter’s letter filled with “baseless allegations” against the AG.

Bajwa had posted his Rs open letter’ on his Twitter handle on Friday afternoon, listing out seven instances in which he alleged that the AG had failed to protect Punjab’s interest. It was noteworthy, said Capt Amarinder, that Atul Nanda had not even represented the Punjab Government in six of these cases, thus exposing the extent of Bajwa’s lack of awareness and clearly indicating that he had a personal axe to grind against the AG.

Dubbing Bajwa’s recent spate of attacks on him (the Chief Minister) and his Government as totally senseless and politically motivated, Capt Amarinder said the MP’s behaviour was becoming increasingly ridiculous. “Unless he (Bajwa) has a good explanation for such behaviour, which is clearly detrimental to the interests of his own party, one might even think he is working for the Opposition in Punjab,” said the Chief Minister.

Captain Amarinder asked Bajwa to stop giving opinions on issues that do not concern him and, instead, to focus on nurturing his constituency in the Rajya Sabha, in his own interest.

Punjab ministers had on January 14 sought disciplinary action against Bajwa for raising a ""banner of revolt"" against Capt Amarinder.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/war-of-words-between-dissident-bajwa--captain.html

Calling the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ""inherently discriminatory"", the Punjab Assembly on Friday adopted a resolution seeking its immediate repeal and Chief Minister Amarinder Singh announced that his government would approach the Supreme Court against it, the second state after Kerala to do so.

Jain, who is a member of the national executive committee of the BJP, said India is a Union of States which has adopted a federal structure demarcating the powers between the Centre and the States.

No one can try to infringe upon the powers of the other, may it be the Centre or the State, he said in a statement here.

""This resolution is in utter violation of Article 257 of the Constitution of India, which imposes an obligation on the state governments to ensure compliance with the laws made by Parliament and also gives power to the Government of India to issue directions to any state for this purpose.""

He said that enacting a law on citizenship is within the competence and prerogative of the Parliament of India as per Article 11 as well as entry 17 in the ''Union List'' in Schedule 7 of the Constitution.

""The resolution adopted by the Punjab Assembly attempts to infringe upon the right of Parliament to enact law on the issue and is also an attempt to usurp the powers which are vested not in the states but in the Union of India"", he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-leader-asks-punjab-governor-to-take-legal-action-against-govt-for-anti-caa-resolution.html

39,19-1-20,"BJP, JCC (J) leaders indulged in bootlegging: Cong","State Congress on Saturday alleged that opposition BJP and JCC (J) leaders were indulged in bootlegging in the state.

Congress’s state general secretary Shailesh Nitin Trivedi in a statement alleged that on the one hand the opposition BJP and JCC (J) are demanding prohibition while on the other the illegal trafficking of liquor business was going on in the state under their patronage.

Dual character of these political parties have actually come to fore after BJP district treasurer, Baloda Bazaar was nabbed in this connection, Trivedi said. A JCC (J) MLA Pramod Sharma made attempt to get release of Anil Gupta from the police station, he added.

Notably, some vehicle bearing logo of Chhattisgarh State Power Distribution Company Limited (CSPDCL) were trapped by the state police but actually these vehicles do not belong to CSPDCL, but its owner was one Anil Gupta, and these vehicles were hired by the power company for electrical works in Baloda Bazar region.

Gupta is said to be a BJP leader and action against him was being taken by the state police as well as the CSPDCL.

Taking cognizance of vehicles hired by it being used in smuggling of illicit liquor, the state-run power company the other day cancelled the contract of the vehicle and blacklisted the contractor.

According to investigation it was found that the vehicles Tata Pick-up bearing registration number CG 22 H-4367 and Tiuvi Mahendra bearing registration number CG 22 G-7457 were seized for illegal transportation of liquor under Pandaria Kukadur police station of Kabirdham District.

Action was taken on the case of the vehicles being used for illegal transportation of liquor from Madhya Pradesh two days ago. The vehicles were hired for works in the Sub Division office of Chhattisgarh State Power Distribution Company, Baloda Bazar.

A CSPDCL official informed that by canceling the contract of these vehicles, the safety deposit was confiscated and the recommendation was made to blacklist the vehicle owner.

According to CSPDCL probe these vehicles were taken from electrical office on January 14, 2020 for conveyance and repair work. The very next day i.e. on 15 January, the vehicle was caught by the police while transporting illegal liquor. At that time these vehicles were not being used for any work of the power company. These vehicles were fitted with stickers of the Chhattisgarh State Power Company, which created the confusion that liquor is being smuggled into the electricity department's vehicles.

Amid a section of media reported involvement of CSPDCL officials in illegal trafficking of liquor, the company officials claimed that they found that no employees of the power company were in the vehicles.

According to station house in-charge of Kukadur, the vehicles and employees engaged in the liquor smuggling have no connection with the power company.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp--jcc--j--leaders-indulged-in-bootlegging--cong.html

Uttarakhand at present has nine Ministers including CM Rawat and out of them six are Cabinet Ministers while two are Ministers of State.

The council of Ministers at present is skewed in favour of Garhwal with five Ministers and CM Rawat himself belonging to this region while three ministers belong to Kumaon region.

Cold weather: docs advise caution

The number of patients suffering from cold-related problems has increased with mercury continuing to hit low due to rains and snowfall in Uttarakhand.

The number of children affected by cold condition has also increased and the paediatricians are advising that the parents should ensure that their children remain indoors during morning and night, take fresh nutritious food and drink warm water.

The reason for children being susceptible to infections is due to their low immunity arising out of the fact that they have low fat deposition in their body.

The children tend to catch infections in the school. Doctors suggest that to prevent cold from spreading, the parents should advise their children to wash their hands regularly.

Like children, the elderly too are exposed to variety of problems in winters.

One of the chief tormentors of senior citizens is hypothermia. Due to less body fat the elderly fall prey to hypothermia when they are exposed to cold weather.

52,19-1-20,Opposition instilling fear among minorities: BJP,"State BJP Spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo today said that the Congress and other Opposition parties are creating confusion among the minorities about the Citizenship Amendment Act. He said that this is the new form of appeasement politics of the Congress. Minorities should understand that there is nothing against them in this amendment.

The amendment of the Citizenship Amendment Act 2019 only adds to the clause (B) of sub-section (1) of section 2 that any person if he comes from Hindu, Buddhist, Jain Parsi, and Christian community and if he If arrived in India from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan on or before 1 December 2014, it would not be considered as an illegal intruder in India, he said.

Pratul said that in the new section 6B of the amendment, it has been added that after the coming into effect of the Citizenship Amendment Act 2019, if any legal proceedings are going on against such a person, then the Central government will not take further action. Pratul said that the Congress and the opposition parties have acted to incite violence in the north-eastern states, saying that with the implementation of this amendment, the indigenous people would be harmed. However, Section 6B(4) clearely states that it shall not apply in the tribal areas of Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura. It shall also not be applicable in those areas where the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution is in force.

Pratul said that when the NDA government led by Narendra Modi started taking decisions in the national interest, then the politics of the opposition has been severed. The opposition is tricking people by doing politics of fear and appeasement.

Pratul said that NRC is another issue and when it is implemented in the whole country, it will give the right to minorities living in India. Through NRC, Bangladeshi infiltrators will be identified who are killing the rights of India's minorities. The bulk of minority welfare schemes by the government are currently being used by these Bangladeshi infiltrators.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/opposition-instilling-fear-among-minorities--bjp.html

The party will organise events across the State on days of national importance to “protect” the Constitution of India.

JPCC Spokesperson Alok Dubey said that the economic crisis has brought the country's GDP to the brink of recession. “Unemployment levels are highest in the last century, agrarian crisis, suicides of growing farmers, closure of large scale industrial units with increasing prices of all essential commodities and food items including petroleum products, cooking gas, layoffs in industrial units made the lives of people more miserable,” he said.

“Instead of providing relief to the people on these issues, the BJP has worked on a dangerous course of intensifying communal polarisation and attacking the democratic rights and Constitutional guarantees of millions. CAA, NRC and NPR is a package, which is against the Constitutional, specifically targeting the poor, Dalits, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and linguistic and religious minorities. In this regard, through a resolution passed in a meeting held under the chairmanship of the Congress President of the like-minded Opposition parties, it has been decided to protect the Indian Constitution peacefully under various programmes on days of national importance,” he said.

Dubey further said that on the directions of AICC General Secretary KC Venugopal and JPCC president Rameshwar Oraon district Congress offices and JPCC headquarters will organise programmes on three important days January 23 and 30. The programmes will be organised on January 23 (Birth Anniversary of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose), January 26 (Republic Day) and January 30 (Death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi).

The Congress leader said, “It is our ultimate duty to protect the values enshrined in the Constitution. During the programmes we will take oath to read the Constitution and protect it. The programmes should shed light on the fundamental principles laid down in our Constitution and how the present policies of the BJP are threatened.”

“Mahatma Gandhi made a conscious choice to explore non-violent options to advance India's struggle for independence. As his ideology of the killer is taking hold in our politics, it is very important to highlight and fight Gandhiji's values. On January 30, Gandhiji's messages will be highlighted by organising unity conference and prayer ceremony to advance Mahatma Gandhi's non-violence and communal harmony at the State Congress Headquarters, District Headquarters,” he said.

JPCC executive president Keshav Mahto Kamlesh, Spkesperson Lal Kishore Nath Shahdeo, Rajesh Gupta and Tausif were also present on the occasion.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-to-counter-bjp---s-pro-caa-campaign.html

While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in its ongoing awareness campaign in favour of the NRC and CAA, is inviting national leaders to address meetings in nooks and corners of the State, protestors – primarily religious organizations and student bodies – are staging protests against the recently passed laws in different cities.

On Saturday, BJP held a major awareness programme in tribal-dominated Khunti district and apprised the residents of the district about the alleged efforts of opposition parties to misguide people about NRC and CAA. On the other hand, thousands of protestors gathered at Bariatu in Ranchi and raised slogans against the Centre’s alleged ploy of religious discrimination in garb of NRC and CAA. “The Government has shown its true colour. The CAA is not only unconstitutional but also a threat to the democratic and secular structure of the country,” said Mohammad Tabrez Ansari, one of the protestors at Bariatu on Saturday.

Ranchi has witnessed several peaceful protests against CAA and NRC since the results of the 2019 Assembly elections were out. Several members of the Muslim community and student organizations took out protest rallies on Mahatma Gandhi Road in the first week of January and raised concern over the implementation of the controversial law.

“The Muslims are now fighting for existence in India. CAA and NRC, when put together, clearly show the intentions of the Government and prove that the policies brought by the Government are ways to sideline and marginalize one particular community,” said Md Shahid, a businessman from Daily Market.

To counter the impact of the protests and spread awareness about NRC and CAA, BJP launched a statewide campaign here last month. As a part of the campaign, BJP leaders are visiting different parts of the State and clearing the misconceptions about the laws. On January 13, the BJP took out rallies across the State and also formed a human chain in favour of the NRC and CAA.

Meanwhile, the All India Students Federation (AISF) and other student unions are also planning to invite Kanhaiya Kumar and Umar Khalid for addressing rallies in the State against CAA and alleged atrocities on protesting students in different universities across the country, especially the national capital.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/caa-critics--supporters-lock-horns-in-state.html
55,19-1-20,Country under shadow of conspiracy: Sahay,"Former Union Minister Subodh Kant Sahay has said that today the country is going through a period of crisis and the matter of concern is that conspiracy is taking place at many levels. Against NRC-CAA, women from every city of the country are spending nights in chilly conditions on the streets, but as promised the Prime Minister has remained silent.

Sahay quoted media reports saying that the police officer Devinder Singh told his boss IG that ‘Sir this is the game plan, you do not spoil the game’ and this is shocking.

Sahay wants to know from the Modi government what the game plan that Devinder Singh was disclosing is. Who is the master mind behind him and who the people for whom Devinder Singh was working?

Sahay appealed to Narendra Modi that he should talk to the media on such a serious subject. Sahay said, “Modi ji sometimes talks in philosophical style and his photographs come in the media, I will request him to read George Santayana book ‘The Sense of Beauty’.

“Why, when, and how beauty appears, what conditions an object must fulfill to be beautiful, what elements of our nature makes us sensible of beauty, and what the relation is between the Constitution of the object and the excitement of our susceptibility,” he said.

Sahay said that he wonders when Modi ji will be serious on serious matters of the country.

“I agree with Rahul Gandhi, who said, ‘The NIA is headed by another Modi- Y.K. who investigated the Gujarat riot & Haren Pandya assassination. In Y.K.'s care, the case is as good as dead,” he said.

Sahay said, ""There are extremely troubling questions, and the silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and national security adviser Ajit Doval is conspicuous. I demand a fair, independent investigation that snuffs out any scope for suspicions"" and monitoring by a fast track court.”

“The NIA's track record doesn't inspire confidence. NIA chief Y.C. Modi is the same person who probed the Gujarat riot and Haren Pandya's case. The objectively of the NIA has been in doubt in the recent past: they investigated the (terror) cases (against) Pragya Singh Thakur and Aseemanand,"" he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/country-under-shadow-of-conspiracy--sahay.html

57,19-1-20,"Bandhu, Pradeep in catch-22 situation","Two of three Jharkhand Vikas Morcha-Prajatantrik (JVM-P) Legislators, Pradeep Yadav and Bandhu Tirkey, have been left out of the newly-formed executive committee of the party – a move that political gurus see as an effort to deprive the duo of a concrete position of negotiation if at all the committee decides in favour of a merger with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

While Yadav has been a close aide of JVM-P Supremo Babulal Marandi since the formation of the party, Tirkey has been a recent inclusion in the party’s list of prominent leaders. However, political experts say that both the leaders are stuck in a catch-22 situation as the speculations about JVM-P’s merger with BJP have gained momentum.

“The executive committee may decide to merge with BJP and even go on to take away the membership of the party from the two legislators if they protest the committee’s decision. It is quite clear that Bandhu Tirkey and Pradeep Yadav are stuck in a helpless position,” said political analyst VP Sharan.

If the party decides to cancel the membership of Tirkey or Yadav, the Speaker of the Assembly will get to decide if they can continue as legislators or not, say political experts. “If JVM-P merges with the BJP, they (Tirkey and Yadav) will be left with fewer options. They may either support the party’s decision or end up losing their legislatorship,” said Pankaj Prasun, Director of Central Institute of Political Research and Analysis (CIPRA), New Delhi.

While the political fraternity here is busy speculating the fallout of the merger, Tirkey and Yadav have remained tight-lipped about it. Tirkey – a firebrand tribal leader, who has served as a minister in the past – has always been one of the staunchest critics of the BJP. Last week, he told media persons that he will never join the BJP. “Water and fire can never be friends,” he said, metaphorically presenting his equation with the BJP.

Meanwhile, Pradeep Yadav on Saturday said that he was unaware of any merger plans of his party with the BJP, and had only read about it in the news. “I don’t think it is wise to answer hypothetical questions about merger of the party. There is nothing in pen and paper. Nobody has spoken to me about it,” he said.

JVM-P chief and Jharkhand’s first Chief Minister Babulal Marandi turned incommunicado for at least a week earlier this month and went on a vacation. Speculations were rife that he might announce the merger of the party after his return to Ranchi. However, he is yet to make any official announcements regarding the merger. Meanwhile, some BJP leaders have been vocal about the talks between Marandi and the BJP’s senior leadership about the merger.

JVM-P, which was the only party to field candidates in all the 81 Assembly constituencies during the recently held polls, managed to win only three constituencies – Dhanwar, Mandar and Poreyahat. JVM-P’s former General Secretary Pradeep Yadav – now the Legislative Party Leader of JVM-P – won from Poreyahat, while former Minister Bandhu Tirkey won from Mandar on a JVM-P ticket. Marandi won from Dhanwar.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bandhu--pradeep-in-catch-22-situation.html

Her visit has come as a big shot in the arm of the ABVP cadres here.

The Governor in her speech asked the youths to be energetic. She said they must bubble with energy and zeal. The youths must have innovative ideas. She punctuated her advice to youths with references to Swami Vivekanand.

The Governor said if unity is not there, division is set to occur. She asked the youths to be working for unity and purity. On huge population of youths in India she quoted 2011 census report which claimed 65 per cent of the population to be of youth and hence she asked the youths to make the best of time.

The Governor did not touch the raw issue of other universities of the country facing turmoil but said back here in Jharkhand she has been successful in putting the schedules of admission, examination and results of the State universities on the right track which was very delayed by even two years.

She thanked VCs, officials, teachers and non teaching staff for this achievement of session in order. Before her speech K K Mishra a veteran ABVP thinker who asked the youths to remember the two dark phases of India the big divide and the Emergency.

The national general secretary of ABVP Nidhi Tripathy in fact walked with more clapping as she spoke much on all JNU from where she said is doing her PhD and then she passed on to squatting at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi which she described as money backed quoting a video clip only to get more forward to take a dig at designer journalists, Bollywood actor who do not know CAA but poke nose into it.

To Nidhi Tripathy ABVP is ‘Desh Drohiyon Ka Kaal’ (a death knell for traitors) and wanted ABVP cadres to be up and doing.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/youth-must-have-innovative-ideas--guv.html
61,19-1-20,Pollution board slaps fine on DVC,"Jharkhand Pollution Control Board slapped a fine of about Rs 5 Crore which will be accessed later on Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) for not following the guidelines of The National Green Tribunal (NGT) and polluting Damodar River due to discharge of furnace oil by Chandrapura Thermal Power Station unit (CTPS) on 13 October 2019, official sources informed.

On Friday DVC deposited Rs 1 Crore as fine for violating of NGT guidelines and for polluting Damodar River, informed RL Bakshi, Member Secretary of State Pollution Control Board.

“Rest fine amount would be accessed first and later will be deposited by the company after the inquiry of NGT or Central Pollution Board team,” said PK Mukhopadhyay Member Secretary, DVC.

About 5,400 liters of furnace oil spilled into the Damodar River from the CTPS on 13 October 2019, it took the authorities two days to wake up to the disaster.By then, the oil had travelled about 150 km downstream up to the Barakar River (in West Bengal).

About five million people in the area affected drank contaminated water. Several water treatment plants across Bokaro, Dhanbad and in West Bengal chocked due to oil in the river water. It also hits water supply (for three-four days) in those areas too, informed Praveen Kumar Singh, state convener of Damodar Bachao Andolan.

Saryu Roy the President of Damodar Bachao Andolan said, a continuous agitation is being organized against the factories located on the banks of Damodar, which dumped polluted water in Damodar. As a result, the water of Damodar River was almost clear. However, Damodar water has become contaminated and toxic due to the negligence of Chandrapura Thermal Power officials on 12 October’s mid-night.“The fine of sum of Rs 1 Crore to the company is not sufficient. The negligence of the company created huge loss to human beings also puts life of aquatic animals in danger.

62,19-1-20,JSERC asks Tata Steel to increase power tariff only from April 1,"Chairperson of the Jharkhand State Electricity Regulatory Commission (JSERC), Arbind Prasad, has said that Tata Steel power tariff can be hiked from April 1, 2020.

He was chairing a public hearing at Tube Maker’s Club on the power tariff hike petition filed by Tata Steel for its distribution area (Jamshedpur town) to meet its annual revenue requirement (ARR) for the fiscal 2019-20.

“We think that there is no point in raising the power rate at the moment as only few months are left for the new financial year. I would ask the Tata Steel to raise the hike from April 1, 2020,” the chairperson said.

Tata Steel Utilities and Infrastructure Services Limited (formerly Jusco) power division general manager, VP Singh had requested the commission that it was necessary to raise the hike this fiscal itself as otherwise it would lead to further increase in revenue gap.

Significantly, Tata Steel having nearly 50,000 consumers and supplying electricity in its command areas (employees) and also nearby urban slums had proposed for a 2 per cent hike in domestic and commercial tariff.

The commission chairperson, Arbind Prasad after hearing the views of consumers both in favour and against the tariff hike said that quality of power supply by Tata Steel is very good and even the power tariff is not much. However, it should focus on strengthening supply and distribution so that there is no power waste and reduce revenue gap.

The commission chairperson was however surprised at the mismatch in the figures filed in the power tariff petition of the Tata Steel in which it showed that it charged Rs 600 crore in the last five years from Tata Power (supplying power to Tata Steel) while it paid Rs 300-crore only to state government and asked Tata Steel to submit a fresh list removing the anomaly.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jserc-asks-tata-steel-to-increase-power-tariff-only-from-april-1.html
63,19-1-20,Palamu police seizes flash drive of Maoists,"The seizure of 8 GB memory chip of CPI Maoist by Palamu police appears to be much larger, much bigger and much important than the seizure of any number of weapon or the Maoists.

SP In-charge Palamu Ashwani K Sinha held a press briefing today in Daltonganj where he said, “This 8 GB memory chip is most vital most sensitive and most secret and hence I will not be making much revelation as to what is stored in it.”

Sinha said, “All that I can say at this moment is that this 8 GB memory chip is the be all of the Maoists.”

He however agreed that Maoists are looking for space and time on Bihar and Jharkhand axis too but hastened to admit that there is any revival or resurgence of Maoist.

Sinha said the Maoists had taken all care to reach this memory chip in right hand as 3 couriers were pressed in for it which itself suggests as to what strategic importance this chip was for the Maoists and now to what extent police will make the best use of this chip to contain curb and destroy the strategies and planning of the Maoist.

A police source said, “The seizure of this memory chip is far weightier than the bundles of naxal literatures that we often seize.”

Reminded that opening of the chip is to be done only under the permission of the court to which this police source said court’s permission is to be obtained for it as it is now vital evidence against the 3 booked for this memory chip.

SDPO Chhaterpur Shambhu K Singh and his team did this job too precisely and meticulously which police source said ‘will help Jharkhand police in the long run in many ways’ as this memory chip is the most satanic record of the Maoists.

Asked that this memory chip is to be viewed only after obtaining the permission of the court then how come right now it is so seen as the store house of all the devilry of the Maoists the police source said the 3 jailed had spilled most of the beans about this memory chip.

The 3 who were jailed today are Akhilesh, Ajay and Mithilesh where Akhilesh is the brother of the dreaded Vinay ji alias Murad ji who holds the rank of secretary in Bihar Jharkhand Special Area Committee said Sinha.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/palamu-police-seizes-flash-drive-of-maoists.html

70,19-1-20,Engineer with begging bowl on Bada Danda,"It is as stunning as amazing to see an engineer sitting with a begging bowl on the Bada Danda (Grand Road) to meet his daily need.

Although his qualification is yet to be verified, the person claiming to be pass-out from the Central Institute Plastic Engineering and Technology (CIPET) was found on Bada Danda near Marchikot Square.

But it is still a mystery as to what prompted such a qualified person to choose the way of alms seeking than a high salarised job. However, the person has revealed to have served in Milton Company in Bombay for a couple of years before quitting and choosing a footpath to meet his daily living.

After some incidents, which he did not elaborate to have happy in the multinational company, he quit the job and finding no way of survival due to death of his parents, he chose to begging, he said.

The person was identified as one Girija Shankar Mishra of Niladri Bihar in Bhubaneswar. He said his parents were dead and his father was a Deputy Superintendent of Police. He has also brothers and sisters who are living in Bhubaneswar, said Mishra.

The matter came to the fore when police interrogated Mishra on the charge of a scuffle with a rickshaw puller. Mishra allegedly injured the rickshaw-puller following money theft charge slapped against him from another beggar, who was sitting near the Collector’s office. After an FIR was lodged by Mishra in English at the Town PS, his qualification came to light.

Mishra said he had passed diploma in plastic engineering in 1991 from Bhubaneswar CIPET and he had crossed the age limit to join a job. He is happy with begging on the holy Bada Danda.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/engineer-with-begging-bowl-on-bada-danda.html

Issues relating to progress in the Smart City Mission, drainage problems in Bhubaneswar, performance in Swachh Bharat Mission in 114 ULBs and the progress of PMAY (Urban) were discussed.

The committee members visited some sites here on Friday and conducted a review meeting at Puri on the second day on Saturday. The committee made some recommendations to the Government.

While Sarangi said there is not master plan for Bhubaneswar for combating the drainage problem and proposed for a comprehensive plan for linking 10 natural drains with the Gangua river, Chairman Pal directed the State Government to prepare a master plan as early as possible.

The committee appreciated the Micro Composting Centres being done but expressed concern over the poor sanitary conditions in Bhubaneswar and other ULBs. In Swachh Bharat, Odisha is the third worst performer, Bihar and Jammu & Kashmir being below it. Only two of the 114 ULBs are open defecation-free. While 40 per cent of the population in Bhubaneswar lives in slums, 80 per cent of the slum households resort to open defecation. The State Government needs to work on it very seriously, said the team.

The panel observed that the progress under the PMAY( Urban) is very tardy. Currently, there is a demand of 5.02 lakh dwelling units in the State, of which Bhubaneswar may require 1 lakh. Only 1.15 dwelling units have been sanctioned so far and only around 68,000 had been grounded. The committee asked the State Government to expedite the work in this regard. All these recommendations would be submitted to the Parliament, said Pal.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/parliamentary-panel-team-reviews-ulb-dev-projects.html

74,19-1-20,CAA: BJP on the offensive,"Facing opposition onslaught against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in Uttar Pradesh has gone on the offensive, taking the bull by horns.

The BJP has planned six big rallies, one each in the six mandals of the party, this month to clear doubts over the CAA and mobilise support for it.

The first such rally was held at Sampurnanand Sanskrit University sports ground in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constituency Varanasi on Saturday and it was addressed by Union minister Smriti Irani along with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya and BJP state chief Swatantra Dev Singh.

The ruling party has already launched a door-to-door campaign to spread awareness among the people about CAA and to dispel misinformation and confusion.

In each rally, the BJP is expecting a crowd of over one lakh and senior national leaders are expected to attend them.

On Sunday, a similar rally will be held at Maharana Pratap Inter College grounds in Gorakhpur where Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and BJP state chief Swatantra Dev Singh will be the main speakers.

However, the biggest rally will be held in Lucknow on January 21, where BJP chief and Union Home Minister Amit Shah will be the main speaker along with UP’s chief minister, deputy chief minister and other leaders.

On January 22, there will be two rallies, one in Kanpur and the other in Meerut. The Kanpur rally will be held at commercial ground where Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar along with the chief minister and other ministers will address the gathering. In Meerut, the rally will be held at Madhokunj Shatabdi Nagar where Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and BJP state chief Swatantra Dev Singh will be the chief speakers.

The last rally will be held at Kothi Meena Bazaar grounds in Agra on January 23, where BJP national working president JP Nadda and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath along with other senior leaders will address the gathering.

Besides the pro-CAA rallies, Yogi Adityanath is also slated to join the Ganga Yatra from January 27 for five days along with other UP ministers and BJP leaders.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/caa--bjp-on--the-offensive.html
75,19-1-20,"UP Guv, CM to flag off Ganga Yatra on Jan 27","Governor Anandiben Patel and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will flag off the five-day Ganga Yatra on January 27.

The Ganga Yatra, being taken out by the state government, will cover 1,025 kilometres of the river’s course through 26 districts.

“The Ganga Yatra aims to promote continuous flow of the river, its purity and cleanliness and boost economic activities by connecting with ‘Arth Ganga’ campaign. The Ganga is not only a symbol of faith but also aids the country’s development and prosperity,” Yogi had recently said while reviewing the progress of Namami Gange project for cleaning river Ganga.

Departments that have a prominent role in the campaign are Urban Development, Rural Development, Panchayati Raj, Home, Transport, Horticulture, Agriculture, Forest and Environment, Information, Tourism, Culture, Education and Health. Jal Shakti department is the nodal department for the Ganga Yatra.

During the yatra, various departments will sensitise people living on the riverbanks on how to keep the Ganga clean — pollution-free, polythene-free — and let it flow unhindered.

One of the Ganga Yatras would start from Bijnor and end at Kanpur, while the other would start from Ballia and culminate at Kanpur.

Several Union and state ministers and lawmakers (MPs, MLAs and MLCs) will participate in the campaign.

Some sources claimed that Union Home Minister Amit Shah is likely to be present on the concluding day.

Yogi had earlier said, “UP will be the first state to take out this kind of Ganga Yatra. We will carry out the works so well that it becomes an inspiration to all states through which the Ganga flows. Also, we will make a plan for creating a multi-modal terminal between Haldia (West Bengal) and Varanasi for commerce and economics.”

While the government has dubbed it as a Ganga awareness programme, it would also be an outreach to mark Yogi’s third year in office and witness both UP and Union ministers holding interactions with people and highlighting the achievements of the state government.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-guv--cm-to-flag-off--ganga-yatra-on-jan-27.html
76,19-1-20,Yogi’s ex-aide joins SP Akhilesh says BJP’s days numbered,"Former chief of Hindu Yuva Vahini and once a protégé of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Sunil Singh joined the Samajwadi Party in the presence of party chief Akhilesh Yadav and patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav at the SP office in Lucknow on Saturday.

Besides, some Bahujan Samaj Party leaders also joined the SP on Saturday.

Singh had met Akhilesh Yadav a week ago and decided to join the party along with his supporters.

Singh along with some others were expelled from HYV, formed by Yogi Adityanath in 2002, on charges of indiscipline in 2017. He had then formed a splinter outfit and declared himself as its national president.

Welcoming Singh and others into the SP fold, Akhilesh said, “The days of Yogi government are numbered and the countdown has already begun. This BJP government has slapped cases against opposition leaders for protesting against its policies.”

“The Bharatiya Janata Party is only promoting communalism and creating a Hindu-Muslim divide. I am happy that HYV workers are with the SP now and they will expose the true face of the BJP,” Akhilesh said.

After joining the SP, Singh said, “The BJP has deceived the people of the state, from farmers to common man to youth and everyone is feeling cheated today. It is high time we get rid of the BJP and its misrule in the state. The people of Uttar Pradesh and especially the youths still have confidence in the young and able leadership of Akhilesh Yadav and I along with all office-bearers (of my outfit across the state) have joined Samajwadi Party.”

On the occasion, Mulayam Singh Yadav termed the youth as the future of the SP and said that farmers, youth and traders had to be strengthened to make India a developed country.

Singh’s shift of loyalty assumes significance as the HYV was founded to promote ‘Hindutva and nationalism’ and it played a significant role in shaping Yogi Adityanath’s political rise in UP.

But signs of strains were noticed when some ambitious HYV members sought to contest Assembly polls, a demand rejected by the BJP, triggering massive resentment within the outfit.

Singh was removed from the HYV in January, 2017 ahead of the UP Assembly elections after he threatened to field HYV candidates against BJP nominees to protest the denial of tickets.

In March, 2017, Yogi Adityanath became the chief minister and within a year, the HYV split as the conflict between the duo intensified and Singh formed Hindu Yuva Vahini (Bharat) along with several other HYV rebels.

Singh was also slapped with National Security Act (NSA) in 2018 and jailed for his alleged involvement in violence in Gorakhpur.

It was from this point that Singh’s proximity to Samajwadi Party started growing. Singh wanted to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Gorakhpur as a candidate of Hindustan Nirman Dal launched by Pravin Togadia (former Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader), but his candidature was rejected by the returning officer of Gorakhpur on technical ground during scrutiny.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/yogi---s-ex-aide-joins-sp--akhilesh-says-bjp---s-days-numbered.html

Addressing a function where several leaders of other parties joined the SP at party’s state office in Lucknow on Saturday, Yadav attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party without taking names and said that now for some politics meant dividing society on religion, caste and creed basis.

“You will have to fight against the evil forces that are dividing society and only the SP can do this as it is a party of youths,” he said.

The SP patriarch further said that the world was undergoing changes and the trend was underway in India also.

“My views on this are appreciated by all parliamentarians in the Lok Sabha and even by the BJP members,” he said.

The presence of Mulayam Singh Yadav at the function organised by Akhilesh Yadav reaffirmed the widely held belief that the SP patriarch has put his weight behind his son and discarded his brother Shivpal Singh Yadav, who floated a new political outfit after being ousted from the party by Akhilesh in 2016.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/country-needs-a-youthful--party-like-sp--mulayam.html
78,19-1-20,Women take part in anti-CAA protest,"Muslim women in large numbers participated in an indefinite protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Act at the historical Hussainabad Clock Tower in Old City area of Lucknow.

The protest has been organised on the lines of Shaheen Bagh in Delhi and Roshan Bagh in Prayagraj.

The protesters are demanding withdrawal of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, National Population Register and National Register of Citizens.

On Saturday, women protesters waving the national flag and holding placards, raised slogan of Bharat Mata Ki Jai. The protest started after Friday prayers and by the evening, the number of protesters swelled.

Police were deployed to prevent any untoward incident and the protesters were prevented from lighting bonfires.

On Friday night, the protesters switched on the flashlight of their mobile phones and chanted Ram Prasad Bismil’s poem ‘Sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab humare dil mein hai, dekhna hai kitna zor bazue qatil mein hain’ (The desire for revolution is in our hearts, let us see how much strength is in the arms of the enemy) and inquilab zindabad.

Children held charts and placards that read ‘Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Isai, aapas mein sab bhai bhai’ (Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians are all brothers) and ‘No to citizenship based on religion’.

Speaking to the media on Saturday, an activist and student union leader Pooja Shukla said that the protest started around 12 noon with just a handful of men and women. She said as the numbers swelled, police were deployed after which the women asked the men to leave as they did not want any confrontation.

‘’At midnight, all lights were switched off. Public toilets in the area were locked. But through the night, people kept coming with blankets and food and offered us their toilets to use. We spent the night holding candles. You will find people of different political ideologies here. This is a people’s movement and a new leadership will emerge,’’ she said.

The protesters felt that the CAA had been brought to “attack” Muslim religious sentiments and the National Register of Citizens would again bring the people to queues.

‘’This law is an attempt to break the age-old cordial relations between Hindus and Muslims,’’ they claimed.

Meanwhile, UP Shia Central Waqf Board Chairman Wasim Rizvi alleged that Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawwad was behind the protest as he had rewarded the protesters handsomely.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/women-take-part-in--anti-caa-protest.html

88,19-1-20,The cloth of the Mother Goddess,"Themed around Devi, Mata Ni Pachedi is an 800 year old art form that the Chitara community is preserving in Gujarat, writes Sayali Goyal

Kirit bhai had a glint in his eyes as he spoke about his works being displayed at a museum in Japan. He had a dream, and he had his art. With the spirit of a true artist, it was Kirit bhai’s vision that made him stand out. About a 10-minute drive from the centre of Ahmedabad, the Chitara family stays in a humble village that is preserving the art and craft of Mata ni Pachedi, also known as Kalamkari of Gujarat. This is an art form that first emerged about 800 years ago when the Vaghri hunter community, excluded from the social system and prevented from entering temples of the Devi, started painting the goddesses on a sacred cloth that would be hung behind temples and worshipped. Through hand-painted drawings, they would share narratives from Hindu mythology and Indian folklore. Kirit bhai is an artist belonging to the 9th generation of this family. He shares there are some artists from the community in Pakistan too, as after the Partition, a part of Gujarat had been merged with Pakistan — specifically an area to the south of Karachi.

Meeting Kirit bhai happened as a happy accident, an unplanned mini-adventure, where I didn’t know what to expect. It was only the night before that I got to know about them and decided to visit them. Kirit bhai walked me through the lanes that led to his open-air workshop. The space didn’t seem to belong to the city. Layers of white fabric were laid on a bed that was used as a surface to paint. Rays of light highlighted the painted fabrics. Further, the layers of paint had given distinct textures to these underclothes, as if the white fabric was a soul carrying imprints of colour from all the figures that covered it. It was that hour when warm sunlight seeps through the misty cold of a January morning. Symbols of faith adorned the pink choona walls, and a cloth, used by the artists to clean their hands, was art on its own, perfectly imperfect. A few women from his family were working on a piece that depicted the Devi in a warfield. The mustards and reds of the natural dye gave the space a warm ambience, and merged into the colour of the brick walls.

I felt drawn to capture the soul of this place and the craft, and very importantly, the craftsman. His enthusiastic entrepreneurial spirit set him apart from many artists I’ve met before who are self-assured and seem to lack a vision for taking their art forward, and his honesty grounded him. He exuded a passion to take this little-known art form to an international arena. He shared his thoughts and feelings about his art without holding back , and these reflected his sense of pride and ownership. With an open heart, he invited me to his house and introduced me to his family. Over a cup of chai, we spent the afternoon conversing about this craft and its people. Soon the walls between us were brought down, and it was became an interaction between two storytellers, two creatives. I was happy he and his family treated me as an equal, and could trust me enough to feel at home with me.

Kirit bhai’s father had collaborated with institutions, brands and companies before. However, the artist had not received due credit from these collaborators, and this was something that bothered Kirit bhai. How important is validation for an artist? He wanted to put himself out in the world and show up as the face of this little-known art-form. A lot of questions came up for me at this point. What was the future of crafts? What was the true meaning of preserving crafts? Was it restricted to the tangible material and technique only, or was it equally important to include the stories and sentiments of a community and place? In this context, the craft becomes a tool that represents a community.

Kirit bhai also wanted to work with traditional methods and innovate them into wearable art, a thought fuelled by his aspirations for appreciation, recognition and remuneration. He had worked on a project to marry a Japanese kimono with this technique and had also received commissions to make scarves for a museum. He wanted more spaces like this to open up and revitalise this craft that he held so dear.

A craft also brings together a community. I sensed active and equal participation by the women in the family. Kirit bhai’s wife is an artist in her own right, and has a say in this art. I got the feeling that women were treated as equal collaborators in the practice of mata ni pachedi. Was it merely coincidental that throughout my journey of exploring crafts from the east to the west across India, I was meeting strong, resilient, creative women, and that this craft celebrated the Devi, a woman who was both feminine and the embodiment of Shakti? I spent a lot of time looking at the women artists working on this craft. I could not take my eyes off them. Kirit bhai’s wife, with her green eyes and golden skin, had a subtle external beauty; but I was drawn in more by her serene, luminous aura. As she worked, she seemed to have found her flow as an artist, that space we crave when we become one with our work and the sense of time dissolves. As I looked at the women painting, I thought to myself how for me it had been a year of Devis, where time and again I had come across independent, authentic and resilient feminine voices that had express themselves boldly through art. It felt like a celebration of womanhood, a restoration of equilibrium in today’s world of unbalanced energies. I was looking forward to meeting more of these women on my journey.

In Kirit bhai’s family, there are 20 artists who draw daily to create works that are commissioned by private collectors, galleries and some craft organisations. Sometimes it takes weeks or even months to complete a piece, thus making it quite expensive to produce and a challenge to sell for a fair price as well. Kirit bhai explains that the demand of the market and the fast-moving modern world used to immediate gratification have seduced many artists away from hand-painting and natural dyes; they use chemical colours and pre-carved blocks to make similar drawings. But, even with competition from these cheaper adaptations in the market, his family has chosen to be ethical and loyal to the art and continue to hand draw using natural dyes only.

He feels that Devi herself has given them this blessing to keep working with authenticity and take the true lineage ahead. It is the belief of his family that the Devi came in his grandfather’s dreams and encouraged him to start practicing this art form as a way to worship her.

I wanted to know more about the process and see a piece come alive in front of my eyes. Kirit bhai explained that red and black were colours most typically used to paint the mata ni pachedi. The artist holds a bamboo stick dipped in alum and mador (natural colour to achieve deep red) and begins to draw the picture from a mythical scene, for example Draupadi speaking to Arjuna from the Mahabharata. The artist follows their instinct on the cloth and slowly the piece comes into being. Apart from the central tale, little motifs are drawn and such smaller elements gradually fill in the empty spaces.

The Kalam (the bamboo stick pen) is dipped in natural ink and refilled from time to time. The piece of fabric is then boiled in water with mordants, that help it realise its true colours. Like the climax of a film, the piece that looked blackish is now reddish.

I feel strongly that the artist brings a little bit of themselves to every piece of art they create, and the art embodies the emotions of the artist as well. I saw a drawing started by Kirit bhai’s sister being completed by him. It was a seamless collaboration between two equals, brother and sister. This piece that has been worked on by different family members had a little piece of all of them. As I watched the painting come alive, I got a strong and palpable sense of community and collaboration through practice of an art-form that was visibly weaving these artists close together as a community.

One innovative piece really stood out for me. This was a wedding scene — that of Shiv and Parvati — and the use of indigo made it stand out from the ocean of reds and blacks.

For me, the human connection surrounding the art emerged larger than the art itself. After this encounter, I felt that the stories of artists needed to be shared parallely with the story of the emergence and practice of the art form, as that could be a way to preserve the tradition along with the craft. I came away with a desire to find ways to restore the inequilibrium in their world — the existing inequilibrium that does not duly acknowledge, appreciate and justly remunerate their art. I came away with the intention to consciously encourage fair trade through education and through bringing down the middlemen. One way of doing this was simply by buying from them, meeting them, encouraging them and sharing about them. Also, I felt that actually talking to artists and letting an artist know his worth — actually vocalising it — would help immensely.

Kirit bhai drew me a Devi with a sword and encouraged me to contribute my bit to it. I didn’t know what to do, and ended up by writing my name on it. This was something powerful I was taking back, a spirit of this Devi who held a sword, who represented strength but also was a mother — the mother goddess — and feminine. This was a precious moment and a memento I could frame, almost like a blessing, a reminder

93,19-1-20,"day after BJP announced poll list, party’s workers protest in many wards","A day after the BJP announced candidates on 57 Delhi Assembly seats, protests were held by party workers in many constituencies on Saturday with one group from Delhi Cantt demonstrating outside party working president JP Nadda's residence demanding ticket for their leader.

The party, which is yet to announce candidates for 13 seats including Delhi Cantt, played down the protests, saying it is a ""natural reaction"" and asserted that its leaders and workers will fight the election unitedly.

The remaining candidates of the BJP and its alliance partner Siromani Akali Dal are expected to be announced on Sunday. Nomination for February 8 polls will close on January 21.

Protests were held by by some party workers from Model Town and Gandhi Nagar constituencies where BJP has fielded former AAP MLAs Kapil Mishra and Anil Bajpai respectively. Workers from Gandhi Nagar assembled at Delhi BJP office. Supporters of a ticket contender in Rithala constituency also met party leaders registering their protest over denial of ticket to their leader.

Convener of Delhi BJP's media committee for Assembly elections Ashok Goyal said that the protests were ""immediate"" reaction, but the party leaders were pacifying the disgruntled workers and leaders.

""They are part of the family and such reaction is natural after ticket distribution. The BJP is a disciplined party and everyone is united to work for party's victory in the elections,"" Goyal said.

94,19-1-20,2 AAP MLAs quit party after ticket denial,"In a setback to the AAP, two of its MLAs quit the party after they were denied ticket for the February 8 Delhi Assembly election with one of them joining the Congress on Saturday.

An Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader said the resignations of Dwarka MLA Adarsh Shastri and Hari Nagar MLA Jagdeep Singh was ""unfortunate but expected"".

While Shastri joined the Congress on Saturday, Singh said he was in talks with the Shiromani Akali Dal, an ally of the BJP.

Shastri, who was among the 15 members of the outgoing Assembly not fielded by the AAP this time, alleged that the party was ""selling"" tickets and accused Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of acting in an autocratic manner.

Shastri alleged that the AAP pretended to be an honest party and ""made bus tickets free for women but are charging Rs 10 crore for an Assembly seat ticket"".

Countering Shastri's allegations, another AAP leader said that when tickets are denied, people make such claims.

""Does that mean when he previously contested from the AAP, he bought the ticket. The ticket distribution was strictly made on the basis of the performance of the MLAs which was closely scrutinised. All those MLAs whose performance was found to be not

up to the mark were dropped,"" he said.

In the Dwarka seat, the AAP replaced Shastri, the grandson of former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, by Vinay Kumar Mishra, Congress leader Mahabal Mishra's son who joined the party from Congress just a day before the candidates' list was released.

Singh was replaced by former Congress councillor Rajkumari Dhillon who had joined the party with Mishra.

Singh said he was disappointed with the party for denying him a ticket and nominating Dhillon. ""Even during the Lok Sabha election, I raised my objection over alliance with the Congress and now they have brought in five people from Congress who are directly or indirectly associated with (anti-Sikh riots convict) Sajjan Kumar,"" he said.

Earlier, AAP's Badarpur MLA N D Sharma, who quit the party earlier this month protesting against induction of Congress leaders into the party fold, had alleged that the party was selling tickets.

Sharma too was dropped and AAP fielded Ram Singh Netaji, who joined the party from Congress, from the Badarpur seat. According to sources, Sharma is in talks to join the Bahujan Samaj Party.

Shastri also said that he was upset with the party as it had not talked about the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and NRC which triggered nation-wide protests.

""I told him (Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal) you are the only CM who had not talked about CAA and NRC. He did not even go to meet the students at JNU and Jamia Millia Islamia,"" he said.

""I left a high ranked post in a MNC where I earned in crores, under attraction of Kejriwal's talks of honesty and Janlokpal. But, I am disillusioned now with AAP and Kejriwal's dishonest politics,"" Shastri alleged in a press conference.

Kejriwal had earlier said he hoped that the party MLAs who were dropped would not leave the ""Aam Aadmi party family"".

Responding to a question that other parties might try to poach the sitting legislators, the AAP national convenor said that he hopes they will stay with the party.

""All parties will try it. But they (sitting MLAs) are our family. I hope they will remain with us,"" Kejriwal told reporters.

Senior party leader Sanjay Singh said the party is looking to give important responsibilities to all those MLAs who have been dropped.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/2-aap-mlas-quit-party-after-ticket-denial.html

96,19-1-20,Of Devas and asuras,"The ancients bards who wrote Puranas are to be blamed for the enigmatic concept of Indian gods, writes Dr Asha Goswami, as she refers to the ethological studies

The ethological study of Krishna era from the epic Mahabharata reveals that the Aryan settlers in India were confronted with the aborigines of our country whom they called Asuras or Rakshasa implying demons. The ancient scriptures very often refer to the conflicts which took place between both of them. Those days the region of Uttarakuru used to be known as the home land of the Devas implying Gods. Some identify this region as some land situated in northern Asia. Some trace it as upper hilly region near Tibet and occupants of that region as the Devas. These inhabitants were humans, but due to their superior qualities and special skills /acts were treated as Devas.

It appears that they were in reality the ancient Indian Aryans who were conferred with the citizenship of the upper regions of Tibet due to their extraordinary qualities such as valour, stature as well as beauty and were also conferred with the title of Devas, the shining ones.

Both Mahabharata and Ramayana refer to such persons living in India as aryavarta, who due to their practice of certain tapas were granted the citizenship of Deva Loka that is, Uttarakuru. So, the Devas of Krishna era signify the inhabitants of Uttarakuru land those days.

Different categories of Devas are also referred to as Sidhhas, Saadhyas, Vidhyadharas, Yakshas, Bhutas and the Gandharvas. Amongst these, there were different groups headed by different leaders. For instance, the Bhutas were headed by Mahadeva Shiva as their leader and had their homeland near present day Bhutan. It is also learnt that the Pandavas were descendants of Devas known as Dharma, Vayu, Indra and Ashwin. While, The Kauravas belonged to the Aryan clan.

This explains the mystery of Kaurava’s hatred for the Pandavas. Despite being in the know of this ethnological strata of Krishna era, when the later bards of the Puranas had to compile their works, they did not pay attention to differentiate the Devas who were in fact the aborigines of Uttarakuru (region above Tibet) from the Devas signifying the divine powers who were invoked and prayed since the ancient period of the Vedas. Consequently, they mixed the narratives of the so called Devas in their Puranas with the characteristics, features of the ancient vedic gods of India. This resulted in the confused versions and enigmatic concept of Indian gods.

Let us take the example of ancient Indian vedic, Rudra or Shiva, who was only symbolic divine representation of benign and terrific aspect of the sun. They mixed up Rudra with the Deva with the same name. This Deva was the aborigine of Uttarakuru. He belonged to the Bhuta clan of Devas and was also called by the same title/name of Rudra-Shiva. The characteristics of both were inter-mixed into one personae and it yielded a completely enigmatic concept of the ancient god Shiva, who was earlier, only symbolised as supreme divine power.

Now, Shiva is a god endowed with traits of another personae who as Mahadeva rules over all the other gods; whose appearance is also completely different. Like an aborigine of hills, He is of fair complexion; has braided hair; holds bow; thunderbolt and shafts; is fond of music and dance and archery; makes the river Ganges flow; confers blessings on all the seekers ; cures and heals the sick with his choicest medicines (the trait which belongs to the ancient vedic Rudra-Shiva god).

As Trayambak, who in ancient times represented Sun, Moon, and Fire, is now held as the supreme god whose third eye assigns him with the powers of omnipresence. His pashupati title brings him closer to the Uttarakura aborigine deva, presents him as a caretaker of the cattle. His consort Uma-Parvati and carrier ox, both relate him with the aborigine of hilly regions in the vicinity of the Himalayas. His personae trait as an ascetic with braided hair; serpents as adornments; being in unclad form, points to his connect with the hilly aborigine of similar name. All this is in fact a parable symbol employed in the text to signify the ideology that ‘god manifests as an ascetic for seeking devotees’ love and devotion’. Thus, being in stark crude form, he symbolises the same stark primordial state of the god as creator.

Before we proceed to traverse the basic concept of Asuras, who were none other than the opposites of Devas, let us review the ethnological strata of ancient period in India.Those days, the main clans living around in India constituted of Devas, Aryas, and Asuras. Each of these three clans were also divided into subtribes and they were constantly fighting each other off. The Asuras were the ancients among these tribes, also elder amongst all. Next to them were the Devas who were younger to the Asuras, and less sophisticated, materialistic and scientific. Also, the Devas were overpowered by the Asuras in more than one way. Then, the last were the Aryans who were least advanced as compared to the above cited two elder clans.

The Asuras had one sub division in the form of Rakshasas. The Mahabharata gives clue to the fact that the Devas were intelligent and more cultured and vegetarian and were extremely weak as compared to the Asuras. They were often under the attack by the Asuras or the Rakshas. Here, it may be stated that in ancient times, the aborigines of Uttarakuru were called the Devas; and the denizens of farther upper regions of Uttarakuru were known as the Asuras or the Rakshas, hence narratives relating the character traits of such Devas must not be mixed with the accounts of the ancient indian Devas mentioned in the vedas.

Finally, it be ascertained that the Devas and Asuras during Krishna Era, signified only two classes of tribes who had occupied certain parts of upper regions above Tibet in the Himalayas. The Asuras used to live in the upper farther regions, which were known as Asur Loka.

97,19-1-20,Will Trump’s trial be an endgame?,"Republicans enjoy a 53-47 majority in the US Senate so the outcome of the testy trial would end in the final acquittal and exoneration of President Donald Trump. However, even after he is absolved and emerges blameless, he will be shaken by the ferment in the Capitol Hill

The American Constitution clearly lays down and ekes out the conditionality under which the American President can be impeached by the House of Representatives and the US Senate in tandem with the idiom of the alleged unsavory work by the US President as a breach of trust. Still, if we delve inside the historicity of impeachment in the United States of America, we shall reach an evaluation that only the path-breaking and iconoclast Presidents in the history of White House have faced allegations in the nation’s political firmament.

Article 1, Section 2 of the US Constitution delineates clearly that, the US House of Representatives will have the sole power of impeachment with the Senate being the final deciding authority by a two- thirds majority to try the impeachment of the President. Nancy Pelosi in the House of Representatives has emphatically declared that no one is above the law and declared the impeachment proceedings to be initiated against President Donald Trump.

Al Jazeera reports about the onerous political theme of impish process of impeachment that “Pelosi, a Democrat, had earlier resisted calls to begin impeachment proceedings, urging restraint as House committees aggressively investigated Trump, a Republican, through subpoenas of witnesses and documents. But following allegations that Trump pressured the leader of Ukraine to investigate the family of former Vice President Joe Biden, who is vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, pressure from inside the Democratic caucus for an impeachment enquiry mounted”. But, what commoners need to comprehend is that the America First proclamation and the clarion call of the Conservatives did have its WASP ring heard in the 2016 elections and might as well work the way of the present President in 2020, if, the political and electoral issues are arranged in a specifically schematic matter.

The debates in the Philadelphia convention in 1787 categorically implicated any civil officer found guilty of bribery, treason, misdemeanour and high crimes. Still, the pertinent poser which can be counted in is the theme that whether the Democratic outfit with a left liberal bias is misusing its pelf and political station of being the quintessential opposition in the American House of Representatives by targeting the President. Though the House of Representatives might have implicated President Trump, the May Day still lies with the Senatorial courtesy which is numerically dominated by the Republicans.

The Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, has contended and informed the hoi polloi that the Senate is not busy anyways now and the trial of impeachment will be the first order of business for the American Senate. A media house further informs, “Other than Trump, only two other US Presidents have ever been successfully impeached and in neither instance was the president removed from office. Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868 in the tumultuous aftermath of the American Civil War; and Bill Clinton in 1998 for issues including his relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.”

Al Jazzera further informs the author and the audience, “The House Judiciary Committee in 1974 voted to recommend impeachment accusing another President Richard Nixon of planning to obstruct an investigation in the Watergate scandal. Before the full House could vote on impeachment, Nixon became the only US President ever to resign.” Thus, it can be advanced in a surefooted manner as a pertinent factoid, that, only two American Presidents have been removed from office after the impeachment proceedings have been initiated in the American temple of Vox Populi. Who was more damaged then the Monica Lewinsky case scenario which President Bill Clinton had to undergo with its attendant ignominy. Thus the matrix infested political firmament of the impeachment process has to subsist with the Fien de siècle of the US’ political culture that a true blue American President has to be removed through the judicious prism of misdemeanors. Still, no direct evidence exists that President Trump’s office colluded with President Zelensky of Ukraine which had become the liberal bias and a kind of a brick bat to beat the American incumbent with. But it needs not be forgotten that criminal charges cannot be brought up against the running the US President and only once the President has been removed then only the onerous criminal charges can be brought against the American President, which will the standard and rote process in the context of President Trump too.

Still, the seemingly embattled President Trump’s holiday break has been spoiled by House Democrat Nancy Pelosi as the unpredictable but strongly stylish American President has fought back with his stereotypical bluster in a series of Christmas tweets. One of the prominent and seething tweets is of the order of the following on December 25: “Why should Crazy Nancy Pelosi, just because she has a slight majority in the House, be allowed to impeach the President of the United States? Got ZERO Republican votes, there was no crime, the call with Ukraine was perfect, with ‘no pressure.’ She said it must be “bipartisan...”. This is what the CNBC portals inform us in the context of the acrid and scathing responses of the American President. But, it might be early days if the House Democrats intend to witness a grovelling face saving exercise by the White House establishment as part of the consequences of the impending trial in the US Senate. President Trump’s followers and adherents will do well to highlight and bamboozle the Public narrative of this event being bereft of “any palpable crime.” President Trump has demanded an immediate trial and over the top of it, he has blamed the Democrat party of being tardy in not providing due process to the targeted, “most powerful man on the face of Planet Earth”.

Republicans enjoy a 53-47 majority in the US Senate so the outcome of a slated and testy trial would end in the final acquittal and exoneration of President Donald Trump. Can the American President emerge out unscathed, untainted and vindicated in the aftermath of the humiliating defeat in the House of Representatives? He will be absolved and emerge blameless but shaken by the ferment in the Capitol Hill. The country is divided over opinions and not policies and that fact will be amply tested and made crystal clear by the electorate and the American people in January, 2020. If President Trump were to get impeached in the trial then it would be the task of Vice President Mike Pence to be the acting man in the White House till the American electorate decide. On the Christmas day, apart from the snow avalanche the cold chill of the House of Representatives development seemed to have hit the American President. President Trump erupted in a series of frenzied tweets shutting out “the glee quotient” from the conservative war horses, but only as a transit theme before the Senate will exonerate the flamboyant US President. Still, the Presidency is definitively embattled. Earlier it was perceived that the currant dissensions in the Democratic party establishment might facilitate a safe exit for President Trump. But, his bumptiousness seemed to have not been as fortunate as the US House of Representatives voted finally to impeach the White House man and facilitate the trial in the heady portals of the US Senate.

98,19-1-20,Soleimani’s killing: A new chapter in US-Iran enmity,"Soleimani’s death is an immense loss for Iran, but the way Iranians have supported their beleaguered leadership, it seems their grit and determination will keep the anti-US spirit high in the country.

January 3 will be marked as a watershed moment in the Iran-US relations in the competing narratives between the “justifiable extra-judicial killings” to save American interests around the world and the America’s illegal bid to undermine the sovereignty of an independent state. The assassination of Iran’s top military commander Major General Qassem Soleimani, along with Deputy Chief of Iraq’s Hashd al-Shabi Abdul Mahdi al-Muhandes and others, in a missile attack fired by an American drone has escalated tension between Iran and the US.

Soleimani was a top military strategist of Quds Brigade of Iran’s elite Pasdaran-e Enghelab-e Eslami or Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), which is responsible for countering threats emanating from beyond the Iranian territory. Also he was one of the trusted aides of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. He was the standard bearer of what Iran calls “Axis of resistance”.

By showing his chivalry in the Iran-Iraq war, what Iranians called it Jung-e Tahmili or Imposed War, he rose from the rank of an ordinary soldier to the chief of Quds. In the Shia imagination of jehad and shahadat (resistance and martyrdom), he held an unprecedented charisma in public sphere as he is hailed as “Living Martyr”. The US could not have imagined his popularity until his funeral which saw a sea of mourners.

It appears that the killing of Soleimani is part of US move to bring Iran to its knees. And there are fears that the US might use other tactics, like activating sleeper cells of anti-regime elements in Iran, to create disturbance. However, it won’t be a cakewalk for the US after the Iraq Parliament passed a resolution to oust the US military from the country. Besides, Iraq’s most popular Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr has demanded withdrawal of US troops from the Iraqi territory. He announced the reactivation of his Mahdi Army militia.

Trump’s reckless move

The Trump administration is going through an uncertainty in domestic politics in the wake of impeachment proceedings. It seems Trump, one of the most unpredictable Presidents of the US, ordered the killing of Soleimani, a top military strategist of Quds of Iran’s elite Pasdaran-e Enghelab-e Eslami or Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), to divert attention from domestic issues.

As the Congress started the impeachment process, Trump has lost some credibility among the Americans. To distract the attention fixated on the impeachment, the US has taken belligerent stance against Iran giving no room for diplomacy. Moreover, Americans have a history of double standards in the region. Trump’s withdrawal from Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear treaty shows another level of betrayal.

The US has a history of invasion, occupation and sabotage. The killing of Soleimani and Muhandes is a clear violation of international law and a sheer act of aggression against an independent and sovereign country. Such extra-judicial killing augments the Iranians’ bitterness towards Pax Americana and their slogan ‘Marg bar Amreeka’ (Death to America).

Iran’s resilience is unmatched

During my recent visit to Tehran, Isfahan and Qom, I saw Iranians have an aversion to any kind of hegemony. The country is flourishing despite harsh international economic sanctions. Though it was a heavy blow to Iran’s security establishment, the Iranians are well-versed in dealing with such crisis.

Their perseverance is unmatched as their top leadership was eliminated during the initial days of the revolution. Despite all odds, Iranians have successfully taken out their country from the jaws of catastrophe. In forty years, the Iranians have learnt the craft how to overcome these hardships and the attempts to bully Iran result into emboldening the resistance against Western hegemony.

The missile attacks on Ain al-Assad US base in Iraq shows Iranian determination and capabilities that it will fight back if it is being bullied by any foreign forces.

Saviour of Iraq & Syria from ISIS terror

The West Asian region has been a flashpoint since the discovery of oil resources. The greed of US and other Western powers for exploiting oil has created mess in the region. Since 2003 when George W Bush invaded Iraq surpassing the will of international community, Iraq has been in turmoil. In a surprise move when ISIS attacked Iraq and Syria with the tacit understanding with the US and Israel and Saudi Arabia and diminished the borders created after Sykes-Picot agreement, it was Soleimani who came to the rescue of both the countries.

He was the main architect who nipped the ISIS terror in the bud and did not let it raise its tentacles. Without involvement of Iran in the counter-offensive, it would have been impossible to wipe out ISIS threat.

Recently Iranian Foreign Minister Jawad Zarif rightly said at Raisina Dialogue meet in New Delhi that there are two entities who are celebrating the assassination of Soleimani, Trump and Daesh (ISIS). He was alleging that US and Israel are deliberately involved in raising ISIS to create mayhem in the region and to give sustenance to its large military industrial complex.

Regional implication: What next?

The moot question is how Iran will respond to this void created by Soleimani’s departure. He was the main architect of Iran’s foreign and military policy in the wider West Asia, particularly in the Levant and the Fertile Crescent region. He enjoyed special relationships with many non-state actors who were resisting the US and Israeli hegemony in the region. He was a key figure in the region and held considerable influence in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine. In Iraq, he had been instrumental in forming the Popular Mobilistaion Forces (PMF) which cut their teeth against Daesh.

In Syria, he pulled out President Bashar al-Assad from the brink of collapse. The terrorist groups such as al-Nusra Front were funded and armed by regional and international powers. He also had warm rapport with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran’s key ally, and Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) in occupied Palestine.

Soleimani was highly pragmatic and knew how to deal with the situation in adversities.

He was the man who had upset the US hegemony in the region. His absence will be felt deeply in Iran. Soleimani’s death is an immense loss for Iran, but Iranians’ grit and determination is likely to keep the anti-US spirit high in the country.

99,19-1-20,Raut dares Savarkar opponents to stay in Cellular jail,"For the second time in a week, Shiv Sena leader and spokesperson Sanjay Raut on Saturday put his foot in his mouth by saying that all those opposing Bharat Ratna for Vinayak Damodar Savarkar should be lodged in Andaman’s cellular jail, a statement that the Opposition BJP latched onto quickly and said that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi “is the first person to be sent to Andaman Jail”.

From being the face of Shiv Sena who played a key role in the formation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Government in Maharashtra, Raut is proving to be an embarrassment for his party through his statements, which are resulting in strains in relations between the ruling Sena and Congress.

After his much-discussed “late Indira Gandhi met underworld don Karim Lala” controversy, Raut gave another issue on a platter to the Opposition BJP. No wonder that Shiv Sena leader Aditya Thackeray quickly distanced from the Sena from its own spokesperson’s latest statement, by saying it was better not concentrate on history but to focus on issues of the present.

Earlier, alluding former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan’s statement opposing conferment of Bharat Ratna to Veer Sarvarkar, Raut said: “Prithviraj Chavan is a Congress leader from Maharashtra. The decision to confer Bharat Ratna is taken by the Centre and the Home Ministry. Even the Shiv Sena has long been insisting that Savarkar with Bharat Ratna. If someone is opposing it, it is their right to have a contrary view.”

“But, Prithviraj Chavan knows that the kind of sacrifice and struggle put in by Veer Savarkar for the country. As part of 50 years of life imprisonment handed to him, Savarkar spent 14 long years of their lives in Andaman Jail. It was unusual event. Those opposing Bharat Ratna to Veer Savarkar — they may be anybody and they may belong to any political party and have any political ideology — should be lodged for two days in the same cell at Andaman Jail where Savarkar stayed. Then, they will realise the kind of sacrifice that Savarkar had made for the country,” Raut said.

Seeking to cash in on Raut’s statement tom drive a wedge between the Shiv Sena and Congress, BJP’s former minister and senior leader Vinod Tawde said: “If Sanjay Raut wants to anyone to send anyone cellular jail in Andaman for opposing Bharat Ratna, Rahul Gandhi is the first person who should be sent to the Andaman jail. Do State leaders like Balasaheb Thorat, Ashok Chavan and Prithviraj Chavan agree with Raut’s statement?”

Tawade said that Raut appeared to have lost his balance over the denial ministerial berth to his younger brother Sunil Raut in the Uddhav Thackeray Cabinet.

Another BJP leader Kirit Somaiya said that through his statement, Raut had targeted the Congress. “The interpretation of Raut’s is that Rahul Gandhi should be sent to Andaman prision”.

Realising that the Opposing BJP might exploit Raut’s statement to create strains in the relations between his party and its alliance partner in the MCA Congress, Aditya Thackeray said: “I do not know in what capacity that Raut has made this statement. I am told he has already given a clarification. I do not think there should be controversies over anything. The matter of bestowing Bharat Ratna posthumously is in the hands of the BJP. It can give it”

“At this juncture there is no need to discuss the past. We have discussed enough about the history. I would like to tell everyone that we should not talk much about history. We respect everyone.

Let us discuss current issues like unemployment, marked slide in GDP, economic crisis and the fact that not much is happening in this country. Let us bring back peace and prosperity in the country. All I can say is that let us learn from history and move forward,” Aditya said.

Former chief minister and senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis took a swipe at Aditya Thackeray for his “we should not speak much about history now” statement.

“SwatantryaVeer Savarkar is not just a person but a thought! ...& thought can never be mere history but our present & future too!,” Fadnavis tweeted.

This is the second time in a week when Raut has landed in a difficult situation vis-a-vis the Congress. Early this week, Raut had created flutter by claiming that late Indira Gandhi used to meet Underworld don Karim Lala in yesteryears.

In Wednesday’s public interview held in Pune on Wednesday evening, Raut had said: “There was a time when Dawood Ibrahim, Chhota Shakeel, Sharad Shetty would decide who will be Mumbai’s police commissioner and who will sit in Mantralaya (state secretariat). When Haji Mastan came to Mantralaya, the entire secretariat would come down to see him. Indira Gandhi used to meet Karim Lala in Pydhonie (in south Mumbai).

Like in the latest instance, Aditya Thackeray had intervened and clarified “Raut has already clarified that whatever he said was in a different context. Late Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray had a lot of respect for Indira Gandhi. Hence, no Shiv Sainik will speak ill-about late Mrs Gandhi. Raut’s intentions are clean”.

Notwithstanding efforts by the BJP to exploit statements by Raut to create fissures between the Shiv Sena and Congress, the latest Andaman controversy will have no bearing on the stability of the MVA Government. Aditya, who had met Rahul Gandhi in the national capital early this week, enjoys a good rapport with the Congress’ former president.

Though there is speculation in the state political circles that Raut is upset with his brother Sunil Raut being denied a ministerial berth in the State Cabinet and as a result, he is speaking out of turn and the Congress is being seen as a target of statement.

Those who have known Raut from his early journalist days vouch for the fact that he is well-informed, articulate and aggressive, but at times he is given to making flippant remarks. “He is not doing anything intentionally. But, he —through his statements — is giving opportunity to the Opposition to twist and turn his statements to bring strain in the relations between the Sena and Congresss,” a senior Sena leader said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/raut-dares-savarkar-opponents-to-stay-in-cellular-jail.html
100,19-1-20,Bandh at Shirdi on Sunday but Saibaba temple to remain open,"Locals have called for a shut-down at the temple town of Shirdi in Maharashtra on Sunday over a controversy over the birthplace of Saibaba, the 19th century spiritual figure.

However, the famous Saibaba temple in the town will remain open, its trustees said on Saturday. The temple attracts lakhs of devotees from all over India every year.

Controversy erupted after Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray announced a grant of `100 crore for development of facilities at

“Sai janmasthan” (birthplace) at Pathri in Parbhani district. Pathri is considered to be the birthplace of Saibaba by some devotees.

But residents of Shirdi claimed that the exact birthplace of the famed saint was not known. Deepak Mugalikar, chief executive officer of the Shree Saibaba Sansthan Trust at Shirdi, said the temple will remain open despite the bandh call. Local BJP MLA Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said he supported the call for shut-down given by the local people.

101,19-1-20,3 Union Mins arrive at Jammu to kick start outreach programme on Art 370 nullification,"Three Union Ministers on Saturday reached here to kick-start a week-long massive awareness of the Centre to apprise people of the potential benefits of the revocation of Jammu & Kashmir’s special status after nullification of Article 370, officials said.

The ministers — Arjun Meghwal, Ashwini Choubey and Jitendra Singh — were scheduled to reach here in the morning but their flight could not land here due to “poor visibility” due to fog and was diverted to Srinagar, they said.

After waiting for several hours in Srinagar, the ministers finally reached Jammu this evening to launch the awareness programme under which a total of 36 Union ministers will visit different parts of the Union territory to interact with people during the next six days.

As part of the programme, the 36 ministers are visiting J&K this week to participate in 60 public interactions at various places in the Union territory,” Principal Secretary to the J&K government Rohit Kansal told reporters here.

Kansal, who is also the government spokesperson, said the visiting ministers would interact with people and speak to them on the theme of development.

He said the administration has decided to ensure 100 percent coverage for the eligible J&K residents to 55 beneficiaries oriented schemes in the Union territory.

“In addition, the focus will be on rapid infrastructure development, the implementation of the Prime Ministers Development Package (PMDP), flagship schemes, iconic projects, good governance, rule of law, equal opportunities to all, rapid industrial growth with employment and rapid economic growth in all sectors of the economy with a special focus on income enhancement for all,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/3-union-mins-arrive-at-jammu-to-kick-start-outreach-programme-on-art-370-nullification.html
102,19-1-20,10 children die of mysterious disease in Udhampur,"At least 10 children have died of a mysterious disease and six others taken ill in Udhampur district of Jammu & Kashmir, prompting the Centre to deploy a team of medical experts to join the probe to ascertain the cause of deaths, a senior officer said on Saturday.

The children’s death entailing complaints of fever, vomiting and low urine output were reported from different villages of Ramnagar block of the district over the past fortnight, he said. “Our survey of the affected area revealed 10 children died of the mysterious disease in an area of 40-kilometre radius in Ramnagar block. The symptoms of the disease include fever and vomiting followed by renal problem,” Udhampur’s Chief Medical Officer K C Dogra told PTI.

He said six other children, all below the age of four, are still undergoing treatment at different hospitals — three in PGI Chandigarh, two at SMGS Hospital Jammu and one in Ludhiana (Punjab).

“Various teams of doctors from Jammu, Udhampur and the Ramnagar block level are camping in the affected area and we are trying to ascertain the cause of the disease,” Dogra said.

An official spokesman said a central team of experts, deployed by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, would soon visit Jammu & Kashmir to investigate the children’s death due to unknown etiology, being reported from the Ramnagar block of Udhampur district.

“The team will assist J&K Health Department in ascertaining the cause of deaths and instituting requisite public health measures. The team, upon completion of their activities, will submit a report to Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,” the spokesman said.

He said the visiting team comprises Specialist (Pediatrics) Sumit Mehndiratta of New Delhi’s Safdarujing Hospital, Deputy Director (Microbiology) Mahesh Waghmare of the National Center for Disease Control, Delhi and Assistant Director (Epidemiology) Suneet Kaur of Delhi’s National Center for Disease Control, besides microbiologist Shilpa Tomar and epidemiologist Avinash Deoshatwar of National Institute Of Virology, Pune.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/10-children-die-of-mysterious-disease-in-udhampur.html
103,19-1-20,"CAA Central list, not State subject, says Kerala Guv","Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan on Saturday said the amended citizenship law was the subject of the central list and not a State subject and therefore it will have to be implemented.

“There is no way other than implementing the act. It will have to be implemented under (Article) 254,” Khan told reporters in response to a question on some States refusing to implement the new law.

He said everyone should understand “one’s own jurisdiction”.

“You may give your arguments by using your intellect, you have the right to challenge it in the Supreme Court but citizenship act is the subject of Union List and not a state subject,” he said after addressing a programme at a private university in Jaipur. Khan said people can be adamant about their opinion but cannot go beyond the boundary of law.

The Kerala government earlier this week moved the Supreme Court against the Citizenship Amendment Act, seeking to declare it violative of the principles of equality, freedom and secularism enshrined in the Constitution. On Friday, Khan criticised the Left government for approaching the apex court against the CAA without informing him and said he may seek a report from it about the move.

Also on Friday, the Punjab Assembly adopted a resolution seeking immediate repeal of the law and Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said his government would approach the top court against it.

There have been protests against the amended law, and some of them turned violent last month. Some opposition parties too have opposed it, saying the law is discriminatory.

The Central Government has said the law grants Indian citizenship to religious minorities escaping persecution in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh and does not take away anyone’s citizenship.

Weighing on the protests, the Kerala governor said it was not the first time protests were happening in the country. “A bigger protest happened in 1986 when a Supreme Court judgment was reversed,” he said, without elaborating the verdict he was referring to.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/caa-central-list--not-state-subject--says-kerala-guv.html
104,19-1-20,The cosmic heirlooms,"In part one of this new series, Sumiran Annamaria Kashyap tells the readers about how to understand and embrace crystals for empowerment and harmony

Some crystals emerge from the womb of Mother Earth, Gaia. Some of them have fallen into her lap from the Great Expanse above, whenever cosmic bodies, (like meteorites) have left behind sensational hints, secrets, of the origins of our world and the worlds beyond.

I call crystals cosmic heirlooms, because they have been given to us by Powers that orchestrate the Universe, the Divine conductors of Sacred Geometry. Their fascinating structure is but a reflection of this Sacred Geometry: the silent language of the Cosmos that reveals its innate workings and unifies all Creation, as a highly responsive, ‘energy-based’ operation. It’s the Universal Law of Vibration that sets the stage for our attraction towards — and connection with — different crystals. All entities, even inanimate ones, are in constant motion, at their own vibrational frequencies. Absolutely everything is connected.

Some people are naturally more ‘rooted’ in Gaia than others, based on how they have developed as a microcosm of the Universe. Others are born with wings attached to their feet, at home when with Gaia, but perhaps more in their element, out there, in the Great Expanse. All of us are programmed to ‘hear’ the vibrations of the cosmic heirlooms — ‘Earth crystals’ or ‘Expanse crystals’ — that are right for us. This is why experts who work with crystals will advise us to ‘take what resonates.’

The fine lines between the ‘scientific’ and ‘spiritual’ understanding of how crystals work, blur here. The lattice-like structure of crystals enables them to accept and emit a harmonic variety of vibrational frequencies. The intricate arrangement of human cells allows them to do the same. When the respective electromagnetic fields of crystals and humans resonate with each other, they orchestrate a larger energy field that the brain processes, in turn orchestrating biochemical changes in the body. These changes can highlight the fact that their origins actually lie in our state of mind. We then find ourselves studying this vibrational analysis more diligently, to zero in on ‘what’s missing’ and to work towards replenishing it.

Sacred Geometry does make space for Free Will. Based on how well we understand and accept who we are, we can apply Free Will, bend the Law of Vibration to work in our favour, in our capacity as spectacular microcosms of the Universe; and set ourselves on a fresh course to ensure we attract what we want. Crystals, in this scenario, are precious guiding tools. As our cosmic heirlooms, they’ve an unobtrusive manner of refreshing dormant memories of where we come from. They help us identify and accept what makes us truly happy, so we can work towards building a life we don’t need to run away from. They instill a sense of peace and acceptance, by making us feel like we are protected by Powers that will reveal what they must at the right time. The sense of confidence that stems from this is unparalleled.

Crystals have been accepted as amplifiers by all disciplines that have studied them, which means the first step towards choosing the right crystals is to understand their benefits and applications as thoroughly as possible.

A seasoned crystal worker brings with them not just consolidated scholastic knowledge, but consolidated human experience. Comprehensive reference book are useful investments, once the decision has been made to collect and use crystals seriously, because they give provide organised information on types, cuts, quality and application of crystals.

It would be useful to mention Clear Quartz here. It’s a versatile ‘master crystal,’ that cleanses the aura, facilitates healthy energy shifts and clarity of thought, releases blocked emotions and elevates motivation levels, besides being a strong amplifier of crystals placed near it. Rose Quartz is great for ‘matters of the heart.’ Since we can’t pour from an empty cup, we should first appreciate it as a gentle ‘self-love stone.’ Amethyst balances emotions and dissolves the effects of harshness, both circumstantial and dispositional. Tiger’s Eye and Black Tourmaline are excellent for grounding and protection and for dispelling negativity.

It’s important to remember that crystals are also ‘mood mirrors.’ As we are, so are our favourite crystals. They illuminate the challenging yet cherished path of self-introspection.

105,19-1-20,Get some and save some,"Let us gain whatever we can for our well-being and secure our future, but not at the cost of the other, says AJIT KUMAR BISHNOI

The following is a true story of a retired very senior civil servant in the west, who joined an Institute in Belgium to train foreign public servants. In one such training session for Indian civil servants, she stayed around after finishing her lecture. She spoke at a personal level to a couple of Indians, and then became very emotional. She confided to them that she was very lonely. Though she was earning a lot of money, but she lived all by herself. She felt that she would have been better off in India in her old age, because of stronger family bonds in the country. She had visited India several times during her work tenure and was aware of Indian family traditions.

Where had the lady gone wrong? The fault lies in the materialistic culture of the West. It gives a false sense of security when things are going well materially. One lulls the self into assuming that things will continue go on smoothly. But, they don’t. Because the material creation is subject to changes; nothing remains as it is for long. This fact requires that one plans for future, because that will surely come. Having a wonderful present is nice but there is future also to be lived. And that gets us to the point of our discussion — what should we gain in the present and what should we save for the future.

Let me take up the present first — the more important of the two. What are we looking for in our present? Every adult will agree that self-sufficiency is on the top of their list. Without that, life can be quite miserable. We study and train for years to be able to gain that position, often sacrificing a lot of play time. Only to realise later that they should have kept aside time to enjoy. What is life if not enjoyed!

Some people go horribly wrong in their choices and cause damage to their future as a result of it. Next comes the mental level. There must be satisfaction with the way the life is progressing. Peaceful existence is another big goal to be pursued. And, we cannot leave out the sense of security about the future, which we all dream about.

How do we achieve the last three goals? This is where the material consciousness fails us. God has to be in the picture. Without Him, there is no chance of satisfaction, peace or security. This is where the lady of our example failed. With God comes God consciousness and all His instructions to live a quality life, and ensure a great future too. Because God teaches us to love fellow beings, serve them and not be so selfish that everyone abandons you in your old age. Why is India envied when family values are spoken of? Because they do believe in spirituality, a good % do. Saving money for future is nice but after a point, money is just a number, that cannot replace love from other human beings.

The human birth is meant to optimise both, that is material sufficiency and spiritual advancement. The latter is crucial for the next life. Remember, when we are born, limitations are placed on everyone. The more fortunate ones have more freedom, because they are born in cultured families who are well off too. They learn early in life that the human life is meant to advance the self perpetually. It is never to live in the present at the cost of the future by doing sinful acts and inviting a lot of suffering in the balance life and the next.

Therefore, let us gain whatever we can for our well-being and also secure our future. One should not be at the cost of the other. Some people unfortunately go to the other extreme and forget to enjoy the present obsessed as they are about securing their future. Ideally, we should gain the present and save something for a bright future. This is wisdom.

106,19-1-20,Astroturf : Overcome your habit tendencies,"A couple of years back a young man came asking one question: “Can my dream of making it big in life come true? If so, will you kindly suggest some puja needed to ensure success. On my part, I keep running through the biography of all bigwigs in the world so as to draw necessary lessons.”

If copying the mannerism of others could provide necessary lead, then nobody would need to toil for attaining success. Remember, every being is born unique, each carrying varying potential in terms of the probable field of work, virtues, attributes, and fault lines. And there is no scope for drawing any parallel with others. Also, the environmental conditions available to them — opportunities at hand and the level of challenges faced — doesn’t remain same anymore.

“Do I have the potential to reach my dream destination?” asked the young man. Well, the potential is very much there. The problem, however, is that you live in an illusionary dream world of your whims and fancies, not open to look beyond for a reality check. Also, you carry lot of infirmities that may play spoil sport with your objective. “Don’t you think it is natural to carry dreams to achieve something in life?” he countered. Agreed, dreams are necessary for reaching heights one is capable of, since they serve a focus to reach an objective. But it is also desirable to figure out whether your dream is achievable. Also, you need to check if you are well geared up to pursue your dream objective to its logical end. Bear in mind; nothing moves just to your asking. “I am ready for the task and shall put in my best in a focused way,” he asserted.

Let me first make you aware of your indwelling potential before dealing with your inherent infirmities. Uranus is firmly placed in the lagna, which is potent enough to make it big in life, if duly supported by other beneficial planets. Benevolent Jupiter, incidentally the 2nd lord identified with gains in life is beautifully aligned to Uranus. Mind signifying Moon, which incidentally happens to be the 11th lord identified with fulfilment of desires, also enjoying benefic aspect of Jupiter, is there in a supportive mode. All put together speaks high of your potential side. That, however, may not bear fruits unless you work upon your habit tendencies that doesn’t spare anybody so easily.

Towards the negative, the Sun, incidentally the 10th lord identified with career is opposite mischievous Neptune. It makes you stuck to your delusional perceptions, distanced from ground realities. This read together with Saturn conjunct Ketu implies that you are habitually an escapist who may not acknowledge truth on its first appearance. You may rather continue pursuing your dream perceptions on hope against hope till pushed to the wall. If that would not be enough, the Sun placed adverse to Jupiter speaks of your swaggering ego, which makes you stuck to your self-defined dos and don’ts, and not open to listening or counsel of elders. Added to that is Jupiter ill-placed to Neptune, which is indicative of carrying peculiar beliefs. That makes it all the more difficult to digest any contrarian viewpoint. The Sun placed adverse to Saturn brings in a sense of insecurity, which is also symptomatic of an identity crisis, which tempts you to go overboard to prove your point. Habitually, you may be suspicious of elder’s intent, and therefore, would detest their advisory. That makes it difficult for you to be in accord with them. Many a times, particularly when faced with adverse situation, you may become self-pitying.

Mind signifying Moon in a Mercury owned sign, also placed adverse to Mars and the Sun, makes you temperamental, moody, irritable, rash and argumentative. For you, ‘my way or highway’ appears to be your attitude. You expect from others to prove true to your expectations. If ever they fall short, you may become overcritical of them, and pass sarcastic remarks, often offending them. Also, you seem to be emotionally too much touchy and sensitive whereby you may get over exercised even on trivial issues and stretch them beyond due. You need to get over these limitations, if you really wish to make it to your dream destination.

“Any puja you may like to suggest that may help me transcend these limitations?” asked the young man. The problems you carry are of mind genesis. No pundit can invade your mind space to make necessary correction. But you can, if you consciously try to address them.

107,19-1-20,The rapist is you,"From the Nirbhaya case in 2012 to Hyderabad rape-murder of a 26-year-old vet in 2019, nothing much has changed when it comes to the horrific and brutal acts that shake the core of the nation. MUSBA HASHMI brings you the ugly truth about why there is no let up despite the amendments to the criminal law

December 16, 2012, is a date India is not likely to forget any time soon. It was a cold night and most Delhiites were home under blankets watching the day’s news on their TV. Elsewhere, 23-year-old physiotherapy intern was lying on the road naked with blood oozing out of her private parts and her intestines pulled out. She was found half-dead by a passerby. The night shook the nation especially the Capital. Candlelight marches took place across the country demanding justice for Nirbhaya, a name given to the girl by the media— she was fearless. On December 29 she succumbed to her injuries in a Singapore hospital. Her last words: “Maa, I want to live.”

Cut to 2020. More than seven years later, the High Court sentenced the four convicts — Pawan Gupta, Akshay Kumar Singh, Vinay Sharma and Mukesh Singh have been awarded a death sentence. While the date of sentencing was announced for 7 am on January 22, 2020, by the Supreme Court, the hanging has now been set for February 1, 2020, at 6 am. This comes after the mercy plea filed by Mukesh was rejected by the President Ram Nath Kovind.

Meanwhile, Pawan has moved the Supreme Court challenging the High Court’s order dismissing his claim of being a juvenile at the time of the commission of the offence in December 2012.

There were two more involved. Ram Singh and a juvenile. While the juvenile was given a three-year sentence in a reform facility and walked free on December 20, 2015, Ram Singh died during the trial period. A report of 2017, said that the juvenile had been sent to the southern coast and was working as a cook.Nothing much has changed since the fateful night of 2012.

A case in point is the rape and murder of a 26-year-old veterinary doctor from Hyderabad. On November 28, 2019, the girl was on her way back home from her clinic. It was a normal day for her until she found out that her two-wheeler, which she used to park near a toll plaza, was punctured. She sensed danger and called her younger sister. It was then when two people approached for help. After 15 minutes of her call to her sister, her phone was switched off. The next day her brutally burnt body was found near an underpass around 23 km south of the toll plaza.

The police arrested four men — Mohd Arif, Jollu Shiva, Jollu Naveen Kumar and Chintakunta Chenna Keshavulu based on the evidence gathered from CCTV cameras and from the girl’s mobile phone. Within 24 hours the police solved the case and all the four accused were shot dead.

This is not it. An eight-year-old girl from Rasana village near Kathua, J&K was abducted, gang-raped and murdered. The girl was kidnapped on January 10, 2018 and her body was found seven days later. Sanji Ram was found to be the main accused in the case. He is the priest of the family temple, where the incident allegedly took place. His son Vishal and nephew, a juvenile, were also accused in the case. The others who have been accused are Deepak Khajuria and Parvesh Kumar, who are police officers; Tilak Raj, a head constable and Arvind Dutta, a sub-inspector.

On 10 June 2019, six of the seven defendants were found guilty, and Sanji Ram’s son, Vishal was acquitted due to lack of evidence. Sanji Ram, Deepak Khajuria and Pravesh Kumar were sentenced to life imprisonment for 25 years, along with a fine of `1 lakh. The other three accused — Tilak Raj, Anand Dutta and Surender Verma were sentenced to five years in jail for destroying crucial evidence in the case. The eighth accused, Sanji Ram’s juvenile nephew, was tried at a juvenile court.

Another horrendous case that shook the nation is the Unnao rape. On June 4, 2017, a 17-year-old girl was gangraped by Kuldeep Sengar, a UP MLA, his brother and aides. On December 16, 2019, Sengar was convicted for the rape and was sentenced to life imprisonment by a Delhi court.

“It’s been years since people are talking about protecting girls, but no one is actually doing anything concrete. As Nirbhaya’s parents or for that matter the common man, one can only give one’s opinion. The media should question the ones in power what are they doing to protect our girls,” Badrinath Singh, Nirbhaya’s father says with a heavy voice. He tells you that people come and given speeches for a couple of days and then the whole issue is overshadowed by thousands of other issues with no solution to the issue for which the speech was given.

“We are in a state where we can only raise our voice, give suggestions for the betterment and ask for justice but apart from that we don’t have any power. No one listens to us. It is the duty of the Government to see why rapes are on a high and why there is no fear in the perpetrators. The Government should be at the answering end in such cases,” Singh opines.

Seven years back, when Nirbhaya was brutalised, there was a lot of talk of coming up with new rules and regulations and amendments to the existing laws but nothing much has happened or changed.After Kathua rape case, The Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2018 came into action which states that a culprit can be given a maximum punishment of death penalty in case of raping a girl below the age of 12. While the minimum punishment is imprisonment for 20 years which was earlier up to 10 years.

“The law doesn’t state what happens if the culprit is a minor. Also we have protected the girls below age 12 but what about the rest. Do they don’t have the right to live a safe life?” he asks.

Back then, Nirbhaya fund came into action to extend help to the rape survivors. “Unfortunately, not a single penny has been utilised to help the survivors. There are no improvements in the court conditions whatsoever. We have been fighting for so long but there are no major changes that we have seen during this period,” he says.

Throughout this long fight of theirs the get justice for their daughter, Singh and his wife, Asha Devi, have stood firm through thick and thin. Not even for a second did they feel demotivated or tired — their belief that their daughter will get justice has only grown over the years despite the recent setback.

“We abide by the rule of satya thak sakta hai par kabhi haar nahin sakta. This mantra has kept us going all this while,” Singh tells you.Unlike the other rape survivors or their families, Nirbhaya’s parents never had to go through even a slightest change of behaviour from the society.

“We were never treated any differently. The reason is clear. We didn’t commit most common mistake which many make. Humney kabhi samaaj se aankhein nahin churaayin. Jab aap khud samaaj se aankhein churaaoge to samaaj ko mauka milega aap se bhed-bhaav karne ka. Humne woh mauka kisi ko nahin diya. And why should we. It was not at all our daughter’s fault; she was the innocent here,” he tells you.

Anuja Kapur, advocate and criminal psychologist that since there were several lacunae in the system and the laws such heinous crimes haven’t seen a decrease. “There are several reasons why there is no let-up. We have to ask several questions. Why don’t we execute the criminal on time? Why do we have a lacuna? A lucana that is not time-bound. Why there is a misuse of the law? People use the law to misuse it. Some talk about the human rights of the perpetrators. What about the rights of a mother who has been fighting for seven years? What about the rights of the Unnao rape survivor? Why has a death penalty not been given? One should not dilute the law unnecessarily. If one wants to make a law with rape as a deterrent with a death penalty, it should be on a fast track,” Kapur tells you.

She questions those who say that perpetrators can be reformed hence they should be given a life sentence. “Those who say this, are they criminal psychologists? Who is going to find out if the perpetrator is a sociopath or a psychopath? Also, one has to understand that life imprisonment means until the end of the criminal’s life and not 14 or 20 years. If a death sentence can’t be given, it should be without parole because they are out on parole and commit the same crime again,” Kapur opines.

She also tells you that the amendment itself that has been made by Justice Verma Committee to the Criminal Law has no purpose. “They have created a rape law that now only looks as rarest of rare case. What does this mean? How does one put a characteristic to it? There are so many kinds of rape. We have single rape, gangrape and oral. This has diluted the law hence it is no longer a deterrent. Any law is a deterrent when there is a fast conviction where the time frame starts from the time an FIR is filed,” Kapur says. She tells you that there is a profile of people who commit such crimes.

“It requires one to decode the criminal mind. We have to first talk about the background that such people come from. If they come from a criminal background, they are most likely to in their parents’ footsteps. There is a reason why the drinking age has been set at 25. Second, is the prefrontal cortex that plays a role. Those with a high level of activity are considered to be geniuses. These are also people who have no remorse and are not emotional. A psychopath can’t be reformed. A sociopath can be reformed. Hence, the laws should be made in a manner that will incorporate all aspects. if you see the US justice system, the suspect there is a culprit until proven guilty. In India, it is just the opposite; here the suspect is innocent until proven guilty. Nature, nurture and environment play a big part,” Kapur says.

She shows you a horrific face of the society where the reason for the rise in gangrapes and then murders is because the perpetrator is getting his minute of fame.“He is getting footage. Criminals are getting their fame. They like the fact that they have taken advantage of the lacunae in the law. From living a life of anonymity, they are now known all over the world, they feel glorified. There is negative psychology at play here. Even if one talks about these people sitting at home, they are getting footage,” Kapur says.

She tells you that there is a need to bring in positive psychology. “Not that it will bring about a change overnight. But it will step in the right direction,” she says.

Advocate Pooja Sareen, who recently led the #NirbhayaDishaMe protest in Delhi to highlight the increasing crimes against women says that there has been a considerate increase in cases of rapes and sexual assault from 2016 to 2019.

“According to a Government data, more than 32,500 cases of rape were registered in 2017, almost 90 a day. The Indian courts disposed of only around 18,300 cases, leaving more than 12,800 cases pending at the end of 2017. The need of the hour is to adjudicate and attend to all pending rape cases. This should be done on priority. There should be strict timelines, which should be followed and adhered to in rape cases. Justice delayed is justice denied and Nirbhaya’s case, with one convict moving on to the Supreme Court yet remains open, like thoudands of other cases across various states,” she says.

She adds that the only solution to this can be made through fast track courts. “There are no fast track courts to hear rape cases in India. Therefore, a competent forum should be made to dispose off such sensitive cases on priority,” she says.

108,19-1-20,‘TRPs have eaten up content’,"Rakesh Bedi Known for having a perfect comic timing, Bedi believes in living comedy. He speaks with Musba Hashmi about his web series, eye for detail and how the digital space is a boon for the creative minds, among other things

What made you say yes to Fathers Volume 2 that released on TVF Play?

The series is a take on people, especially fathers, who have retired after an active life. When a person retires at the age of 58 or so, there is still a lot of energy left in him. But you don’t know what do with that and how to invest it in the right way. The children get busy in their lives, wives get busy in theirs and you suddenly feel that you are good for nothing. This is a story of three such friends, who are fathers of course and they live in close proximity. The three decide to use their energy the right way and compete with the young generation. The story is so true to life that I was sure of taking up the project the moment I read the script.

Can you share funny moments of the show?

Like I mentioned before, the three fathers decide to compete with the young generation. They heard about solo trips and playing PUBG and it fascinates them. One day they all decide to go on a solo trip and the moment they were ready to leave for the trip, they realised that there are three of them going on the trip so how can it be solo.

How was the experience working with Manoj Joshi and Virendra Saxena?

I have known Manoj for years and even worked with him. It was fun working together. We have a lot of respect for each other and we get a lot of positive vibes from each other. Everybody was kind and helpful on the sets. There were no ego clashes or anything like that.

I remember there was a moment when Virendra got angry because we were not going his way but then we all gave in and went the way he wanted us to. Everyone was co-operative.

Do you see any difference in the shows or films that were being made earlier and now?

Let me mention two shows that did well — Yes Boss and Bhabhiji Ghar Par Hain, they did well for a reason — no one interfered from the channel nor was there someone sitting on your head and trying to guide you. Both of the shows have been independently made by the creative minds. Even earlier shows like Shrimaan Shrimati and Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi, the reason why they are iconic is because there were no interference from anybody and this is how you come up with good shows. Now, people have started angsting about TRPs. The moment this pressure comes in, the show loses its essence. This is what has happened or happens with a lot of shows. This can be one of the difference that I have seen. The other thing is TV has become regressive and has stopped growing. TRPs have eaten up everything.

What is your take on the growing interest for digital space?

The digital media is a great thing that has happened to the creative minds. It is a platform where everyone can showcase their creativity without any boundations. Fresh content is coming up. With the advent of web series, the whole world can see good work of any director.

What is your approach towards acting?

I work hard. I take everything seriously. You can see it as a problem or as my plus point. On the family front, it becomes a negative for me since I am not able to give them ample time. But on the career front, I find it satisfying. I don’t let anything pass under my nose casually.

You have mostly played comic roles. Is it by choice?

You can say that because I have a comic element in me, both in writing, acting and even real life too. In one of my plays — Mera Woh Matlab Nahi Thha, I have played a serious role but have added various humourous elements in it. A pinch of humour is important for everything. Anything without it will become too serious or monotonous.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/talktime------trps-have-eaten-up-content----2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/talktime------trps-have-eaten-up-content---.html
109,19-1-20,Cheers to Italian luxury,"SHALINI SAKSENA tells you how the beverage market in the country is coming of age with luxury drinks on offer

There was a time when there were no aerated drinks in the market. At homes, one would get services shikanjvi and or Rooh Afza. Back then, if one wanted to have a cola, one had to carry in one’s baggage. Then the markets opened and there was a flood of aerated drinks. From Cherry Coke to Snapapple, the sky is the limit. People are spoilt for choice and the beverage market is changing for the better.

“The market has witnessed major growth over the past few years. The consumers who buy our products are often on the go and want to spend on healthy, quick premium convenience products. This has led to the influx of many ready-to-consumer products that became more fitting into more areas of people’s lives than we could have ever imaged. Today’s consumer is well-traveled and well-educated about various products in the market. They are sensible, smart and know what they want,” Ferruccio Lamborghini, CEO and vice-president of the Tonino Lamborghini says. The company recently launched its line of products including espresso coffee, energy drink and vodka.

He tells you that convenience, sophistication, and health are a few factors, which are directly linked with the increased sales and thereby profits for the beverage industry in India making the country a priority market.

The beverage project line that started mid ‘90s with a mission to spread intrinsic energy of the brand through a line of iconic Italian beverage products worldwide began its journey with coffee. “We believe that the Indian market has a great opportunity for our brand and of course for the positioning of our products. As for each distribution we start, we were searching for the right distributor that can perfectly interpret the values of our lifestyle brand,” Lamborghini says.

He opines that the Indian market is a young market; therefore, their target is young customers and millennials who want to enjoy life and distinguish themselves by choosing not only an energy drink or a coffee, but a true lifestyle. “Moreover, India is a very fast-growing country and of course we will take care of our heritage and brand here, at the same time, we will be flexible enough to approach the market with the right content, but always up to the level, our brand requires,” he says.

The reason to introduce luxury beverages is simple. “The mission is to spread the values of company worldwide, and we started with espresso, energy drink and vodka; all products that can express the Italian spirit and energy in the Indian market. Our beverages are just the second product line that we are launching. The first product we introduced in India, is still not in the market. In fact, we established a joint venture in Pune with Firodia family of the Kinetic Group, to design and manufacture golf carts and we hope that soon we will present other branded products as well,” Lamborghini says.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cheers-to-italian-luxury-2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/cheers-to-italian-luxury.html

L’Oréal Paris announces actor and singer — Aditi Rao Hydari; former captain of the Indian women’s national cricket team —Mithali Raj; and dancer, TV personality, and entrepreneur Shakti Mohan as the brand’s latest ambassadors in India.

Aditi, Mithali and Shakti bring alive L’Oréal Paris’ ambition of empowered beauty, encouraging women to embrace their uniqueness and celebrate their self-worth.

Aditi Rao Hydari, shares: “It is an honour to represent L’Oréal Paris, a brand that celebrates beauty in all forms and is loved the world over. I look forward to creating campaigns with L’Oréal Paris that remind women that they’re all worth it!”

“I started playing cricket when I was 9. We are not born different but the paths we choose make us so. The life I've created on this path made me who I am and I'm worth it. I am excited to collaborate with L’Oréal Paris and spread the message of beauty and inclusivity. Women must be encouraged to see beauty in their uniqueness,” says Mithali Raj.

Shakti Mohan, shared, “As someone who has worn multiple hats across my career I relate to the diversity of colour and offerings L’Oréal Paris brings. I’m keen to work with L’Oréal and spread the message of being beautiful in our own individual being.”

KRITI TO PUT ON 15 KG FOR MIMI

When it comes to pushing the envelope for her role, actor Kriti Sanon is not the one to step back. While the talented actress had a great year with box office success stories, she is set to kick off the new year with a very special film. Kriti ended 2019 by giving the best performance of her career in Panipat, which got everyone talking about her acting chops. Now, one hears that the actress is going to gain 15 kilos for her upcoming film, Mimi.

While many male actors have gained weight for their film, it is interesting to note that not many female actors undergo a physical transformation and gain weight for their role.

Considering that Kriti has always had a lean figure, it will be interesting to see how her character looks in the film which is based on surrogacy.

Talking about her role, Kriti says: “For me, putting on so many kilos is actually a challenge as it’s very new for my body. I have to in a way fight my metabolism and increase my calorie intake to gain that much weight in a short time. But I’m excited to see the transformation. It's a role very close to my heart and I want to give it everything I can, even if that means not taking up any other work in the process.”

ALLU ARJUN ALL PRAISE FOR POOJA

Actors Allu Arjun and Pooja Hegde’s film Ala Vaikunthapurramloo has already become one of the most anticipated films of the year. With the release just around the corner, everyone is looking forward to watching their onscreen chemistry spin magic for the second time.

Meanwhile, the cast is busy promoting the film and Allu can’t stop raving about Pooja, who is one of the most successful names in the Telugu film industry.

While she is getting the best of both worlds with hit films in Bollywood as well as Tollywood, her acting chops are loved by both fans and critics alike. Even Allu believes that as an actor Pooja has evolved tremendously.

The two have worked together earlier in Duvvada Jagganadham aka DJ.

The stylish star said: “Pooja is looking very beautiful (in this film). I have seen her transformation from DJ to Ala Vaikunthapurramloo. And have seen her maturity grow, and she has done a much finer performance than she has done in DJ.” He goes on to add: “I have rarely repeated any of my heroines Pooja is probably the first heroine I have repeated.”

Allu also said that a lot of people really like Pooja. “She is the most happening actress' right now. She is very dedicated. I have seen a lot of improvement in her in terms of acting, professionalism, how she presents herself. It's lovely working with her.”",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/weekly-natter-2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/weekly-natter.html
111,19-1-20,"Stalin, Alagiri iron out differences after meeting","An hour long between DMK president MK Stalin and the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K S Alagiri on Saturday has helped in resolving the outstanding issues in their ties.

Alagiri, who drove down to Anna Arivalayam, the DMK head quarters in Chennai’s Mount Road and was closeted with Stalin for nearly an hour. Later speaking to reporters , Alagiri said all was well between the two parties.

The ties between the DMK and the Congress had suffered a setback immediately after the announcement of the results of the local bodies in Tamil Nadu.

The TNCC chief had issued a release blaming the DMK for not observing the “coalition dharma” during allocation of seats and campaigning.

The comments made by Alagiri drew instant ire from Stalin, who boycotted the meeting of all prominent opposition parties called by Sonia Gandhi, the AICC president to rework the agitation and propaganda against the Citizenship Amenment Bill which had rocked the nation from day one.

T R Baalu, senior lDMK leader called on the Congress president and other leaders like Ahmed Patil and Ghulam Nabi Azad to convey the displeasure of the party on the statement made by Alagiri. “These things should have been discussed between the leaders of the two parties and it was not something which could be used to wash

the dirty linen in public,” Baalu had told.

Alagiri was summoned by Congress President Sonia Gandhi and it is reported that he was told in unequivocal terms not to do anything which would upset the DMK leadership.

The TNCC president, aftyer coming backj from New Delhi had called on Stalin and is believed to have expressed his regrets over the incident.

Meanwhile, Dorai Murugan, the second in command in the DMK, went overboard and declared that his party would not mind a damn if the Congress leaves the coalition. “The party is free to leave the coalition if they desire so,” said Murugan. It is an open secret that Murugan would not use such harsh words inless prodded by Stain.

These incidents added to the Congress leaders in Chennai resorting to a fire fighting mode and thus the Saturday meeting between Alagiri and Stalin.

The TNCC chief said after the meeting that there were in issues between the two parties and the DMK-Congress alliance would continue for the 2021 assembly election. Stalin, on his part , issued a release immediately after the meeting with Alagiri and asked his party cadre to maintain decorum and discipline while speaking about Congress and other front partners.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/stalin--alagiri-iron-out-differences-after-meeting.html

119,19-1-20,"Yogi’s ex-aide joins SP, Akhilesh says BJP’s days are numbered","Once seen as the right hand man of Yogi Adityanath, at least till he became the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister three years ago, former chief of Hindu Yuva Vahini (HYV) Sunil Singh on Saturday joined the Samajwadi Party.

Singh was inducted into the SP in the presence of party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav.

Some Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leaders also joined the SP at the party headquarters here.

Singh along with some others were expelled from the HYV, formed by Adityanath in 2002, on charges of indiscipline in 2017. He had then created a splinter outfit and declared himself as its national president.

Welcoming Singh and others to the SP fold, Akhilesh Yadav said, “The days of the Adityanath Government are numbered and the countdown has already begun.”

He said the BJP Government has slapped cases against opposition leaders for protesting against its policies.

“The Government is doing injustice from day one and false cases are being lodged for protesting,” said the former Chief Minister, adding the BJP only promoting communalism and creating a Hindu-Muslim divide.

Akhilesh said he was happy that HYV workers were with the SP now and hoped that they would unmask the real intentions of the BJP. On the occasion, Mulayam Singh Yadav termed the youth as the future of the SP and said that farmers, youth and traders have to be strengthened to make India a developed country. PTI

Singh’s shift of loyalty assumes significance as the HYV was founded to promote “Hindutva and nationalism” and went on to play a significant role in shaping Adityanath’s political rise in Uttar Pradesh.

But signs of early strains were noticed when some ambitious HYV members sought to contest the state Assembly polls, a demand rejected by the BJP, triggering massive resentment within the outfit.

Singh was removed from the HYV in January 2017 ahead of the Assembly elections after he threatened to field HYV candidates against BJP nominees to protest the denial of tickets.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/yogi---s-ex-aide-joins-sp--akhilesh-says-bjp---s-days-are-numbered.html

122,19-1-20,Western disturbance triggers harsh winter,"Intensity of Western disturbance has impacted the wind pattern and its speed in winter this year. This has led to unpredictable weather and harsh winter. Due to frequent western disturbances, north and north-western India including Punjab, Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttrakhand witnessed unprecedented snowfall, rains in December and January.

Cold wave conditions persisted in most parts of north India on Saturday with many places in Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh receiving rains, while the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh reeled under sub-zero temperatures.

According to India Meteorological Department ( IMD), this year, however, January has witnessed four western disturbances in just first 18 days of the month as compared to six in December last year. ""A fresh western disturbance is expected on January 20, which affects western Himalaya regions and plains of North West India. This will also brings snowfall and rain with thunderstorm in western Himalaya regions,"" it said.

""The frequent western disturbance in winter has impacted wind pattern and its speed. Easterly wind, which is common in January are less influential or weak as compared to the northwesterly wind. Due to weak easterly wind, severe cold wave conditions are prevailed over north, northwest and central India. The intensity of western disturbances has brought snowfall and rainfall in hills and plains in India,"" officials said.

According to IMD, western disturbances are very frequent visitors to north India during the winter months from December to March, with a normal frequency of around 3-4 per month. Research shows that the frequency of western disturbances has come down over the past few decades as around six to seven western disturbances per month used to affect the north during winters before the 1960s.

The previous disturbance-the fourth one to affect India in January 2020-reached its peak January 13, causing heavy rainfall across Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and a few other neighbouring states in the process. It also caused heavy snowfall over the north Indian states, which subsequently triggered avalanches that killed at least ten people in Jammu and Kashmir.

Due to third western disturbance, between January 13 and 14, multiple areas in North Kashmir, such as the higher reaches of Gurez, Bandipur, Kupwara, Nowgam, and Baramulla received unprecedented heavy snowfall. Temperature in North Glacier in Siachen fell down to minus 57 degrees Celsius, while fresh snowfall recorded in Gurez Sector amounted to 51 cm, with 117 cm in Machhil Sector, 56 cm in Keran and Tangdhar Sector, 122 cm in Naogaon Sector, and 61 cm in Uri and Gulmarg sectors.

As far as Delhi is concerned, it's usually remains weather free during this time of month, with only few spells of winter rains in between. January 2020 is witnessing one of the rainiest spell this time.

""The disturbance travels from the ""western"" to the eastern direction. Disturbance means an area of ""disturbed"" or reduced air pressure. Western disturbances typically originate as low-pressure systems over the Mediterranean Sea. It brings sudden winter rain to the north-western parts of the Indian sub-continent is called Western Disturbance. It is a non-monsoonal precipitation pattern driven by the westerlies. High-altitude westerly winds push these systems towards India. On the way, the disturbances gather moisture from various sources including Mediterranean, Caspian, and sometimes even the Arabian Sea. The influence of western disturbances is maximum over north and northwest India during the winter season from December to February,"" said Dr Kuldeep Srivastava, senior scientist of IMD.

During an in-camera proceedings, Additional Sessions Judge Saurabh Kulshreshtha rejected the plea on the ground that the case of sexual assault was different from the case of alleged murder of some of the girls in the shelter home, said a lawyer privy to the matter.

The CBI had told the court that the probe agency had just given an interim report in the Supreme Court stating they had found no evidence against the allegations of murder and in fact the girls who were believed to have been murdered were found to be alive, the lawyer said.

The case of alleged murder of girls in the shelter home and the case of alleged sexual assault were two different cases, the CBI said.

The probe agency, in its reply filed before the court, said that they have not yet given a clean chit to the accused against the allegations of murder and the statement in the top court was just an interim report.

The court had earlier deferred for the third time pronouncement of judgement in the case till January 20 after the petition was filed before it.

The plea said the CBI on January 8 submitted a status report in the Supreme Court wherein it said that the some of the girls of the shelter home, who were thought to be allegedly murdered, were alive.

Thakur’s petition, filed through advocate P K Dubey, has claimed that the prosecution witnesses in the shelter home sexual assault case were not trustworthy as the investigation into the allegations of murder were based on their statements.

These facts were relevant and essential for a fair trial, it said.

“It is pertinent to mention that the investigation into the allegations of murder were based on the statements made by the prosecutrixes (rape survivors) who are prosecution witnesses in the case. They had levelled false allegations against the accused before the court including inter alia allegations pertaining to murder,” it said.

The plea has further alleged that the case setup by the prosecution witnesses was “false, fabricated and concocted”.

“These facts were not only relevant but sine qua non (essential) for the just adjudication in the present case.

“The facts prove that the aforementioned prosecution witnesses are unreliable and untrustworthy and they have mislead not only the investigating agency but also this court. Further, the case set up by the prosecution witnesses is false, fabricated and concocted,” the plea claimed.

These facts were new developments which were not available with the accused at the time of the trial and therefore could not have been placed before the court despite all diligence, it said.

The court had on March 20, 2018, framed charges against the accused, including Thakur, for offences of criminal conspiracy to commit rape and penetrative sexual assault against minors.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/court-dismisses-brajesh-thakur---s-plea-claiming-witnesses-not-reliable.html
127,19-1-20,Unitech homebuyers stress restart of construction,"A majority of Unitech homebuyers reckon that the resolution of the housing mess need seed money to start construction of stalled projects, and mere the Centre taking over the management of the embattled real estate giant would not serve as a solution.

The Centre has informed the Supreme Court it’s willingness to take over Unitech management, a decision which will have significance for nearly 30,000 homebuyers.

In December, the Supreme Court had asked the Centre to explore the possibility of taking over the Unitech management, caught in a financial mess due to siphoning off more than 50 per cent of money deposited by individuals and financial institutions. In 2009, the government had taken over scandal-hit Satyam.

Advocate ML Lahoti, representing nearly 5,000 homebuyers, said the Centre should provide funds to start pending projects, and the seed money could come from the Rs 25,000 crore fund, created to salvage stalled residential projects.

Lahoti insisted that the Centre should prioritise funds, instead of change of hands, to streamline the company management.

According to the government affidavit, the Centre will not provide funds, and also sought stay on the Justice SN Dhingra Committee undertaking the work of selling Unitech assets, after the Government takeover.

“We will oppose this. The Dhingra committee should continue. We will register our grievances before the Supreme Court. The homebuyers need a long-lasting solution. The Centre can at least allocate Rs 3,000 crore. It’s a fit case for using funds meant for residential projects,” said Lahoti.

According to the affidavit, the government expresses willingness to have the right to refer the company for insolvency or IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) like resolution outside the IBC framework in the backdrop

of limited resources to complete the unfinished housing projects.

According to Vivek Kumar, a homebuyers’ representative, Justice DY Chandrachud made it clear on the last date of hearing while rejecting the NBCC proposal that after investing 2.5 years on our case, the top court will not leave homebuyers in a lurch and not allow this case to go to IBC as homebuyers won’t get anything if the company went for insolvency.

“And it will set a wrong precedent for firms to do all kinds of scams and then go for insolvency and wash their hands & leave the consumers/shareholders/homebuyers/investors in a lurch,” said Kumar.

“The Government directly allowed this scam — collection of money against unapproved projects and siphoning off funds by Unitech. Same way, the banks failed to perform their duties. No bank followed any SOP and no quarterly audit was done to see use of funds. The RBI failed to regulate banks. The Rs 4,374 crore loans were given to Unitech (as per the affidavit filed by Ajay Chandra) and they also financed individual homebuyers”, Kumar said.

The apex court will hear the case again on January 20.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/unitech-homebuyers-stress-restart-of-construction.html
128,19-1-20,Rs 5.38 lakh cr needed for primary healthcare: Govt,"Projecting a Rs 5.38 lakh crore requirement over the next five years for providing primary healthcare, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has said it will help deal with 90 per cent of the healthcare demands.

In a presentation to 15th Finance Commission, the Ministry said investment in primary healthcare could reduce the need for more costly and complex care by preventing illness and promoting general health.

There had been a lack of focus on health promotion and healthy lifestyle, causing high incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), it noted.

Four major NCDs — cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and respiratory diseases — account for nearly 62 per cent of all mortality among men and 52 per cent among women. Of this, 56 per cent is premature.

Noting the need for strengthening the primary healthcare system, the Ministry said public investment was the need of hour. People end up spending more on secondary and tertiary healthcare due to lack of high-quality primary healthcare facilities. Over 70 per cent of out-of-pocket expenditure is on non-hospital care and nearly two-thirds of this goes towards buying medicines.

Dr Shakti Gupta, Medical Superintendent of RP Centre at AIIMS, said strengthening primary health centres and district hospitals was key to improving the system.

“If the primary healthcare centres and district hospitals are strengthened in terms of infrastructure, equipments and trained manpower, no one will have to rush to medical colleges and big cities for common health issues,” Dr Gupta told IANS. “We spend more on tertiary care and less on primary healthcare,” he said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/rs-5-38-lakh-cr-needed-for-primary-healthcare--govt.html

The bid is for a contract under which an Indian shipyard will be chosen to manufacture six conventional submarines in collaboration with foreign partners.

The Congress has asked the government whether it is trying “to favour the Adani Defence JV” in the Rs 45,000-crore submarine project “in violation of the defence procurement procedures” and “by overruling” the Navy’s high-powered committee which “found the firm ineligible” for the deal.

132,19-1-20,"$5 trn eco goal difficult, not impossible: Gadkari","Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Saturday that the goal of making India a $5 trillion economy by 2024 was “difficult but not impossible”.

It can be achieved by increasing domestic production and reducing dependence on imports, he said at the 29th International Management Conclave of the Indore Management Association here.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other BJP leaders have often spoken about the goal of turning India into a $5 trillion economy by 2024.

“Strong political will is very important to achieve any goal. Manifesting the same will, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set ourselves the goal of making the country a $5 trillion economy,” Gadkari said.

“This goal is difficult but not impossible,” he added.

“Our country has plenty of resources and production capacity. Despite that we are spending crores every year on importing goods like medicines, medical devices, coal, copper, papers, etc,” the Union minister said.

“If we want to become a $5 trillion economy, we have to increase the domestic production of these things instead of importing them,” he said.

Referring to the current economic slowdown, Gadkari said, “We are the fastest growing economy in the world. But there is a cycle in the business. Challenges crops up, at times due to the global

economy and sometimes because of a gap in demand and supply.

“But I see India’s future in the leaders of younger generation who can turn difficulties and challenges into opportunities,” Gadkari said.

There was no dearth of capital, resources and technology in the country, “but there is definitely a lack of right vision and leadership in different fields”, he said.

Exports will be encouraged by focusing on increasing the participation of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the development, the minister said.

“This will help create five crore new jobs....The government is asking every department what it can contribute to achieve the target of $5 trillion economy,” Gadkari added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-5-trn-eco-goal-difficult--not-impossible--gadkari-2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/-5-trn-eco-goal-difficult--not-impossible--gadkari.html
133,19-1-20,FPIs remain net buyers in Jan on US-China trade deal,"Foreign portfolio investors (FPI) remained net buyers in the Indian capital markets in January so far despite heightened geopolitical tensions between the US–Iran and domestic economic challenges.

According to the NSDL data, a net amount of Rs 10,200 crore was invested into equities while a net Rs 8,912 crore was pulled out from the debt segment. This resulted into a net investment of Rs 1,288 crore between January 1 and 17.

Majority of the FPI investment in January came a day after the signing of the US-China trade deal and going forward FPI investments are expected to grow, Harsh Jain, co-founder and COO at Groww said.

""Post a strong comeback in 2019 by the FPIs, the year 2020 began on a muted note. This was largely due to increased volatility witnessed in equity markets worldwide due to heightened geopolitical tensions between the US–Iran. This spooked the investor sentiment and FPIs chose to withdraw money from emerging markets like India,"" Ajit Mishra, VP Research at Religare Broking Ltd said.

Umesh Mehta, head of research at Samco Securities said conviction of FPIs in the Indian markets seems to be diluting given the rich valuations of large caps, inflationary tendencies, expectation of a larger fiscal deficit along with other economic challenges.

On the future of FPI flows, Ajit Mishra said, ""Signs of easing tensions between the US and Iran and positive developments on US-China trade deal front led to renewed buying interest by the FPIs. Going ahead, earnings and upcoming budget would play a critical role in shaping their investment trend.""",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fpis-remain-net-buyers-in-jan-on-us-china-trade-deal-2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/fpis-remain-net-buyers-in-jan-on-us-china-trade-deal.html

“I want the prime minister to make the effort of coming here and addressing our issues. Why has he not come here to meet us yet?” asked 80-year-old Bilkis.

Another protestor Sarwari (75) said she also wrote to the PM, urging him to rollback CAA and not implement NRC.

Several hawkers can be seen daily selling the tricolour at the protest site. Mubarak (49) claimed that so far he has sold about 90 medium and big flags.

The Delhi Police on Friday had appealed to the agitators to unblock the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch as the residents, senior citizens, emergency patients and school-going children of Delhi and NCR are suffering due to the blockade.

The matter had also come up before the High Court.

“We again urge protesters to cooperate and clear the road in the larger public interest,” a police statement said. However, the protestors refused to budge unless the government discards CAA and any NRC exercise.

Torab Niazi, a protester, said they will not leave the place unless their demands are met.

139,19-1-20,Villagers donate rice to AASU to carry on anti-CAA protests,"The protest against the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act saw a large number of villagers in Dibrugarh district donating a large quantity of rice to AASU on Saturday to carry on the agitation.

At a public rally in Sasoni circle, which is the largest revenue circle of Dibrugarh district, residents of 85 villages donated 350 quintals of rice to All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) in the presence of its general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi, sources in AASU said.

AASU is spearheading the agitation across the state against the contentious legislation and is demanding that the law which seeks to provide citizenship to the religious minority in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan be repealed.

The revenue circle is the highest producer of rice in Dibrugarh and the sources said villagers donated 645 sacks of rice, each weighing 50 kg, to the students union.

“We are totally against the CAA as it will endanger our existence....We are donating our rice. If needed, we will not think twice to shed our blood in our fight against the Act,” Bidyanka Borgohain of Sukani village told PTI.

Siddhi Duwarah of Kukurapomia village said as CAA has already been enacted the only option to get it withdrawn legally.

“To fight a case in the Supreme Court, one needs a huge amount of money. We are an agrarian community. We do not have money, but we have our produce. So, we decided to give it to AASU for the legal battle,” he added.

Bikash Baruah of Paniabuwa village said every family donated at least four kg of rice and all the households of the Sasoni took part in this exercise.

“We started collecting rice from January 3. If needed we will donate more rice in the coming days,” Jatin Dhadumia, a resident of Khatuwa village in the circle said.

Over 60 petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court against the Act and AASU is one of the petitioners.

Meanwhile, protests against the controversial law continued across the state with thousands of people coming out on the roads to join it.

“Amit Shah thought that he would be able to implement CAA very easily in Assam, but he is wrong. We will not deviate from our stand and accept a single Bangladeshi. We will not give one inch of our land for the illegal immigrants,” the AASU general secretary said in Duliajan.

He alleged that there has been an attempt by the government to suppress the movement and efforts are being made to lure people from different fields.

“But the people of the state will not be swayed by the government tactics. The peoples’ movement will continue until the goal is reached,” Gogoi said.

The AASU and the artistes’ community organised a public rally at Chandmari in Guwahati, while a huge gathering took place at Dharapur near the Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport in the city.

“BJP had promised to deport all illegal immigrants from Assam after May 16, 2014. But they did nothing and are now trying to bring Hindu Bangladeshis. They are dividing illegal immigrants into Hindus and Muslims. Assam is a place where people are not discriminated on the basis of their religion,” popular singer Manas Robin said at Dharapur.

141,19-1-20,"Ken Starr, celebrity lawyer Dershowitz join Trump defense team","Ken Starr, who was at the center of Bill Clinton's impeachment in the 1990s, and America's biggest celebrity lawyer Alan Dershowitz were announced Friday to be joining President Donald Trump's Senate impeachment defense.

The administration has yet to unveil the full team but confirmed that White House counsel Pat Cipollone will be lead lawyer, backed by Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow.

“President Trump has done nothing wrong and is confident that this team will defend him, the voters, and our democracy from this baseless, illegitimate impeachment,” the White House said in a statement Friday evening.

But where Cipollone is ultra-discreet, and rarely speaks on the record, Dershowitz and Starr will bring the legal world's equivalent of rock stardom when the trial begins on Tuesday.

US media reports said Starr, the special prosecutor in the 1998 Clinton impeachment saga, was joining the Trump legal team. He is a hero to many on the right, even if Clinton ultimately was acquitted in the Senate.

Among the first to react -- with expletive-laden astonishment - was Monica Lewinsky, whose affair with Clinton was the subject of Starr's investigation.

“This is definitely an 'are you fucking kidding me?' kinda day,” she tweeted. No less controversial is the choice of Dershowitz, whose past clients include disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, as well as film director Roman Polanski and former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson, both embroiled in notorious rape cases.

Dershowitz himself has been accused of being a witness and participant in Epstein's sex crimes -- allegations he strenuously denies.

Dershowitz's most famous case was the successful defense of former NFL star O.J. Simpson, whose televised 1995 murder trial riveted the nation.

In the Senate, Dershowitz, who teaches at Harvard University, says he'll be pursuing loftier matters.

In a post on Twitter Friday, Dershowitz said he would “present oral arguments at the Senate trial to address the constitutional arguments against impeachment and removal.”

Lead lawyer Cipollone is the author of the Republican president's uncompromising strategy to stonewall the Democrats' impeachment investigation, calling it “partisan and unconstitutional.”

Another high-powered player will be Sekulow, a stalwart in the White House pushback against a two-year probe by special counsel Robert Mueller into Trump's controversial dealings with Russia.

A Supreme Court veteran and a big name on the right-wing evangelical Christian scene, he won't be dazzled by the bright lights of Washington's ultimate fight.

Rounding off the roster will be Robert Ray, another figure from the investigations into Clinton that rocked Washington in the 1990s, US media reported.

Trump has been impeached by the House of Representatives on accusations that he abused his office to try and force Ukraine into digging up dirt on leading Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

He was also impeached for allegedly obstructing Congress.

But the White House enters the Senate trial with a massive advantage: Trump's Republicans have 53 of the 100 seats and the party is in lockstep.

The majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, echoes Trump's claim that the impeachment is a political hit job.

As a man who has been fighting legal battles for decades - including rape allegations, multiple real estate disputes, and bankruptcy - Trump is no stranger to colorful lawyers.

His former longtime attorney Michael Cohen is serving a three-year sentence and has turned on his old boss. Before going behind bars for a variety of crimes last year, Cohen called Trump a “con man” and a “cheat.” Where Cohen left off, an even bigger firebrand, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, stepped in to serve as attorney and roving political fixer.

Giuliani's relentless attempts to prove conspiracy theories around Biden's family activities in Ukraine are interwoven with the whole impeachment case against Trump. Although Giuliani is not a government employee, he has traveled to Ukraine to lead the search for dirt on Biden.

And the outspoken former federal prosecutor who was in charge of New York on 9/11, has pushed to be allowed in on the Senate impeachment trial team. A wary White House has shut the door.

Friday evening, House Democrats released documents showing Lev Parnas, who served as Giuliani's envoy to Ukrainian officials, had been in extensive contact with an aide to Representative Devin Nunes, the highest-ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee.

The WhatsApp messages, which run from February to May of last year, indicate that Nunes's office was aware of the alleged efforts to try and force Ukraine into investigating Biden.

Parnas made headlines Thursday when, hours before Trump's impeachment trial opened, he broke ranks to charge that the president “knew exactly what was going on” regarding his and business partner Igor Fruman's efforts to influence Ukrainian authorities.

Trump denied knowing Parnas. “I don't believe I've ever spoken to him,” he told reporters.

But Parnas told MSNBC that Trump was lying. “We're not friends,” the Ukrainain-born businessman said. “But he knew exactly who we were.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/ken-starr--celebrity-lawyer-dershowitz-join-trump-defense-team.html
142,19-1-20,"Myanmar, China sign dozens of agreements","Myanmar and China on Saturday signed dozens of cooperation and infrastructure agreements aimed at strengthening their bilateral ties during Chinese President Xi Jinping's historic visit to the neighbouring country.

Xi met Myanmar's de facto leader, State counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi here for the second day of his two-day trip - the first by a Chinese head of State in 19 years - seeking to boost his Belt and Road Initiative, reports Efe news.

Xi and Suu Kyi inked 33 agreements, protocols and memoranda of understanding that underlined China's backing of the Myanmar Govt.

The deals include plans to accelerate the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, a project which involves billions of dollars in infrastructure spending that would provide Beijing with a direct link to the Indian Ocean through railways.

In addition, the two leaders agreed to set up a special economic zone on their mutual border and to promote urban development in the Southeast Asian country's biggest city, Yangon.

Suu Kyi and Xi also signed a memorandum of understanding for the building of a deep seaport in Rakhine, as well as bolstering cooperation in the security and agri-food sectors.

Xi's trip comes at a time when Suu Kyi's Government has been facing diplomatic isolation from the West and the Islamic world due to its handling of the Rohingya crisis over the past few years.

143,19-1-20,Mumbai eye first home win,"Domestic giants Mumbai will be eyeing their first ‘home’ win of the season when they take on Uttar Pradesh in their Elite Group B Ranji Trophy at the Wankhede Stadium here from Sunday.

Mumbai will continue to miss the services of regular skipper Suryakumar Yadav and young prodigy Prithvi Shaw, who are with the India A squad in New Zealand.

Also, Shreyas Iyer, all-rounder Shivam Dube and pacer Shardul Thakur are also unavailable for the game, as they are on national duty.

Hence, although the task gets tougher, Mumbai’s morale should be high, as they were able to grab crucial three points against a full strength Tamil Nadu team, which had the likes of Abhinav Mukund, Dinesh Karthik and ace off-spinner R Ashwin.

This season has been a roller coaster ride for Mumbai.

They began the campaign with a huge 309 run victory against Baroda and then were thrashed by Railways by 10 wickets at Wankhede Stadium and later were convincingly beaten by arch rivals Karnataka at the BKC.

They then took the first innings lead against Tamil Nadu at Chepauk.

The onus will be again on experienced batsman-keeper Aditya Tare to lead from the front.

But young guns like Bhupen Lalwani could see the game as an opportunity to cement their spots in the side.

Mumbai spin duo of Shams Mulani and offie Shashank Attarde have been in good form and would be more than eager to put up a strong show.

Mumbai also have a decent pace attack, which can be effective in the morning hours.

On the other hand, Uttar Pradesh have played five games so far and have drawn four, while winning just one versus Saurashtra at Rajkot, where they recorded a victory by an innings and 72 runs.

The visitors would aim to give a tough fight to Mumbai, who are the favourites to record season’s second outright win.

Bengal look to bounce back

Kalyani (West Bengal): Desperately eyeing a return to winning ways, Bengal will rely on their spinners to do the trick against a struggling Hyderabad in their Ranji Trophy fixture here from Sunday.

Bengal suffered a humiliating nine-wicket defeat to Vidarbha inside two days in an away fixture in the last round, slipping to eighth position in the cross pool of Group A and B teams.

With five teams set to make the cut for the quarterfinals, the task for the Arun Lal-coached side has become all the more challenging.

Bengal failed to take any advantage of the home conditions, settling for three points in their last two outings, against Andhra and Gujarat at the Eden Gardens.

Bengal have now gone for a spin-friendly track at the Kalyani Stadium, about 70-kms from here, hoping to win a match.

Under-23 batsman Kazi Junaid Saifi, who was initially named in the squad against Gujarat before being sent back for the Col. CK Nayudu Trophy matches, has been drafted in. With Ritwik Roy Chowdhury injured, he is likely to make his Ranji debut.

Left-hander Saifi got the nod after scoring 534 runs to help Bengal win the National U-23 one-day tournament this season.

“You can’t control things like injury. The batters have prepared well for the game and we just need to get couple of hundreds if we can.”

Bengal will also look up to the veteran Utpal Chatterjee, who will assist the side for the Hyderabad match, with bowling coach Ranadeb Bose being left out.

Hyderabad have been one of the weak teams of the group with the Arjun Yadav-coached team losing four of the five matches this season to sit at the bottom of the table.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mumbai-eye-first-home-win.html
144,19-1-20,B’desh call up uncapped Mahmud for Pak tour,"Bangladesh on Saturday called up uncapped fast bowler Hasan Mahmud for their three-match Twenty20 series in Pakistan which has been engulfed by fears over player safety.

Opener Tamim Iqbal returns after skipping a home series against Afghanistan and Zimbabwe and a tour in India. Mosaddek Hossain, Arafat Sunny, Taijul Islam and Abu Hider have been dropped from the squad.

“Hasan is a quick bowler and has a good future. So we thought maybe this is the right time to give him a break,” said Bangladesh Cricket Board’ chief selector Minhajul Abedin.

Wicketkeeper-batsman Mushfiqur Rahim was left out after saying he would not go to Pakistan for security reasons.

A senior BCB official said batting coach Neil McKenzie, spin bowling coach Daniel Vettori and fielding coach Rayan Cook would also not accompany the team.

Mushfiqur, 32, remained adamant that he would not be with the squad when they leave on Wednesday.

“I decided it a long time ago and informed the board. I have submitted a letter too. My family is concerned, and don't want me to go,” Mushfiqur told reporters late Friday.

He has also kept his name off the draft for the Pakistan Super League T20 tournament.

“There’ no bigger sin for me than not playing for Bangladesh. But I had refused an offer to play in the PSL after finding out that the tournament will be entirely held in Pakistan,” he said.

“ agree that things have improved in Pakistan, but I will gain confidence when I see teams going there for the next two years. I have been to Pakistan before, it is a great place to play cricket.”

Mushfiqur's absence will be a blow for Bangladesh who are already without suspended all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan and lost their two recent Tests in India inside three days.

“I wish good luck to our team,” he said.

Bangladesh play their T20s in Lahore from January 24-27 before returning home. They will go back to Pakistan for the first Test starting February 7 and visit again to play a one day international in Karachi on April 3 and the second Test from April 5.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/b---desh-call-up-uncapped-mahmud-for-pak-tour.html
145,19-1-20,De kock fifty revives South Africa,"Off-spinner Dom Bess claimed his first Test five-wicket haul before rain interrupted England's push for victory on the third day of the third Test against South Africa at St George's Park on Saturday.

Bess took all the wickets as South Africa slumped to 113 for five in reply to England's 499 for nine declared, still 386 runs in arrears.

With England seeking a win which would put them 2-1 ahead in the four-match series, rain started falling 15 minutes before the scheduled lunch break and continued through most of the afternoon, preventing any play between lunch and tea.

Bess bowled unchanged from the northern, Duck Pond end, and finished the morning with five for 41 in 18.2 overs. He had taken a total of five wickets in his previous three Tests at a cost of 48 runs each.

He was the first England spin bowler to take the first five wickets in an innings since Derek Underwood claimed the first seven against Australia in Adelaide in 1974/75.

Bess, who was not originally in England's tour party, was flown out as cover for the ill Jack Leach, who has subsequently returned home. He bowled steadily on a pitch offering significant but not extravagant spin.

Bess struck in the fourth over of the day when Dean Elgar was caught for 35 off bat and pad at silly point by Ollie Pope, the second of three catches by Pope.

South African captain Faf du Plessis used his feet to off-drive fours off the third and fourth balls he faced from Bess, who switched from round the wicket to over the wicket and two balls later had Du Plessis caught by Pope at short leg, again off bat and pad.

Rassie van der Dussen made 24 before chopping an attempted cut off Bess into his stumps, one over after hitting 11 runs off the spinner.

Nightwatchman Anrich Nortje remained unbeaten on 14 off 88 balls.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/de-kock-fifty-revives-south-africa.html

The two-Test tour was only announced by the Sri Lankan cricket board earlier this week, with the first match to start in Harare on Sunday.

Zimbabwe were readmitted as an ICC member last October following a three-month suspension over political interference.

“It’s always tough, going for that long between playing Tests, because you always want to play as often and as regularly as possible,” Chakabva said.

“It’s great to be compared with someone like him. I had this comparison for a long time when growing up and playing as well. The names - he’s Rahul Dravid and I’m Rahul - so the comparisons always been there and he’s someone I have spent a lot of time with talking about cricket, talking about batting and he’s coming from the same state as well (Karnataka)”.

148,19-1-20,"Rahul prepared for middle-order batting by watching videos of Smith, Williamson","He is most comfortable to bat as an opener but to deliver as a middle order batsman, KL Rahul prepared for the challenge by picking the brains of modern-day great Virat Kohli apart from watching videos of Steve Smith and Kane Williamson.

Batting at number five, Rahul conjured up a 52-ball 80 to lead India to a competitive 340 for six against Australia in the second ODI, which the hosts won by 36 runs to level the series in Rajkot on Friday.

“I don’t think technically I have practiced anything different. I just spoke a lot more to middle-order batsmen and watched a lot of videos. I spoke a lot to Virat (Kohli) and watched a lot of videos of Ab (De Villiers) and Steve Smith for that matter and how they build their innings,” Rahul said at post match press conference.

“Kane Williamson is somebody I’ve tried to go back and watch some of his videos and see how he build his innings and how they play in certain situations. The only thing I’m trying to learn is how I can use my game and be better at a certain situation.”

The 27-year-old Rahul insisted that he has got better at reading the game having played in different positions.

""It is great challenge. I have been in decent form and very pretty confident about my skill, so coming up to every game and having a new responsibility and a new role is also a blessing, I don’t think a lot of batsmen get that. That is how I look at this and I am enjoying my batting,” he said

“I have always opened the batting so that’s a position I am most comfortable with and I know how to build my innings but I get to learn so much about own self and about my batting and batting as an art, when I get to bat at 3,4,5.”

Meanwhile, Rahul is also relishing the challenge of wicket-keeping in the last two ODIs. Rahul has kept for India U19s at the World Cup and also kept wickets for Karnataka and Indian Premier League.

As regular keeper Rishabh Pant was concussed in the lung-opener at Wankhede, Rahul kept wickets in Mumbai and here. He admitted that keeping was challenging.

“It is (a challenge). Even for me sometimes I couldn't pick Kuldeep (Yadav) and (Ravindra) Jadeja at the pace he bowls is just pretty difficult, it's not what I get in my first-class team. I'm just enjoying what's thrown at me and trying to do the best I can.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/rahul-prepared-for-middle-order-batting-by-watching-videos-of-smith--williamson.html
149,19-1-20,UK plans Brexit celebrations but warns businesses may suffer,"The British Government has announced plans for special events on the night of Jan. 31 when the country officially leaves the European Union but the country's treasury chief has admitted that some UK Business sectors will suffer as a result.

Sajid Javid told Financial Times in an interview Saturday that Britain's regulations will not be aligned with the EU in future and that those changes may hurt some businesses. Currently the EU is Britain's largest trading partner.

“There will not be alignment, we will not be a rule-taker, we will not be in the single market and we will not be in the customs union — and we will do this by the end of the year,” he said, referring to a deadline at the end of 2020 for conclusion of what are expected to be contentious trade talks with the then-27 member EU.

Britain will officially leave the EU bloc on the night of Jan. 31, even though it will keep following EU rules for an 11-month transition period. It will be the first nation ever to leave the bloc. The British Government plans to mark the occasion with a series of upbeat events.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to make a speech to the nation that night after holding a rare cabinet session in the north of England to emphasise his Government's plan to spread opportunity to that economically beleaguered region.

The Govt also plans to mark Brexit by projecting a clock onto the PM's official residence at 10 Downing Street in London that will count down until 11 p.M., when the break takes place.

The entire Government neighborhood of Whitehall is to be illuminated for the occasion as part of a light show, with Union flags flown on all the poles in Parliament Square. The Government will also create a commemorative coin that will enter circulation that day.

But Johnson's Conservative Government is no longer actively pushing a plan to have the familiar chimes of the Big Ben clock tower at Parliament sound at 11 PM Despite a private fundraising push in support of activating the chimes, which are under repair.

Britain voted in a 2016 referendum to become the first nation to leave the 28-nation EU, but the process has moved more slowly than expected. A stalemate last year kept a withdrawal bill from passing, leading to a rare December election that gave Johnson's pro-Brexit Conservative Party a strong majority in Parliament.The Brexit divorce bill quickly passed when the new Parliament convened. A transition period will last until the end of 2020 as negotiators

try to forge a trade arrangement between Britain and the remaining EU nations. Johnson, who is also seeking a trade deal with the United States, has ruled out seeking an extension of the deadline for the EU talks.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/uk-plans-brexit-celebrations-but-warns-businesses-may-suffer.html
150,19-1-20,US to screen passengers for China mystery virus,"US authorities will begin screening passengers Friday arriving on direct or connecting flights from a Chinese city at the heart of a mysterious SARS-like virus responsible for two deaths.

Travellers from Wuhan to the United States will undergo entry screening for symptoms associated with the new coronavirus at three airports: San Francisco, New York's JFK and Los Angeles.

China has now reported 45 cases linked to the virus, Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) official Nancy Messonnier told reporters in a press call, most linked to a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan, while two cases have been found in Thailand and one in Japan. The CDC said that based on current information, the risk to Americans from the virus, known by its technical name 2019-nCoV, is currently deemed low. Nevertheless it was enhancing precautionary measures.

The CDC will deploy 100 additional staff to the three airports, with incoming passengers asked to fill out a questionnaire and submit to a temperature check.

Those who show possible signs will be shifted to another facility for additional screening and a rapid diagnostic test.

Messonnier said that this test would currently take around a day, “but it's going to get rapidly faster” as the diagnostic tool improves.

The UN's health agency says that the outbreak of the disease comes from a never-before-seen strain belonging to a broad family of viruses ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses such as SARS.

According to Arnaud Fontanet, head of Paris' Institut Pasteur department

of epidemiology, the new strain is the seventh known type of coronavirus that humans can contract.

The outbreak has caused alarm because of the link with SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong in 2002-2003.

Fontanet added that the coronavirus appears to be “weaker” than SARS in its current form, but cautioned that it could mutate into a more virulent strain.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us-to-screen-passengers-for-china-mystery-virus.html
151,19-1-20,China reports 4 more cases in viral pneumonia outbreak,"Four more cases have been identified in a viral pneumonia outbreak in a central Chinese city that has killed two people and prompted the United States and others to take precautionary measures.

The latest cases brings to 45 the number of people who have contracted the illness, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said Saturday. Five are in serious condition.

The cause of the pneumonia has been traced to a new type of coronavirus.

Health authorities are keen to avoid a repeat of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which started in southern China in late 2002 and spread to more than two dozen countries, killing nearly 800 people.

The US announced Friday it would begin screening passengers at three major airports arriving on flights from Wuhan.

At least a half-dozen countries in Asia also have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China. The list includes Thailand and Japan, which both have reported cases of the disease in people who had come from Wuhan.

Chinese authorities have said pneumonia linked to the virus has hit at least 41 people in the country, with the outbreak centred around a seafood market in the central city of Wuhan.

But a paper published Friday by scientists with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in

London said the number of those affected in the city was likely to be well over a thousand.

The scientists at the Centre - which advises bodies including the World Health Organization - said they estimated a “total of 1,723 cases” in Wuhan would have been infected as of January 12.

The researchers took the number of cases reported outside China so far - two in Thailand and one in Japan - to infer how many were likely infected in the city, based on international flight traffic data from Wuhan's airport.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/---hundreds--likely-affected-by-chinese-virus--researchers.html
153,19-1-20,Rainstorms douse bushfires across eastern Australia,"Rain and thunderstorms doused long-burning bushfires across much of eastern Australia Saturday, but they also brought a new threat of flooding in some areas.

Major bushfires continued to rage in regions of the south and southeast of the country that have so far missed out on the rain, including in wildlife-rich forests on Kangaroo Island off the southern coast.

The fire service in New South Wales (NSW) State, the country's most populous and the hardest hit by the crisis, said 75 fires continued to burn Saturday, down from well over 100 a few days earlier.

“Rain continues to fall across a number of fire grounds,” the state's rural fire service said, adding that “benign conditions” of rain and cooler temperatures were helping efforts to contain the remaining blazes.

To the north, Queensland state was hit by severe storms overnight, causing some flash flooding and road closures though no deaths or injuries were reported. Both states have suffered from one of the longest droughts in modern Australian history and some areas saw more rain Friday and Saturday than had fallen in more than a decade.

Fires continued to burn out of control in southern New South Wales and neighbouring Victoria state, but forecasters expected significant rainfall in those areas Sunday and Monday, raising hopes that some of those blazes could be brought under control as well.

The unprecedented fires, fuelled by climate change and a years-long drought, have claimed 28 lives over the past five months.

They have scorched massive tracts of forest and bushland in eastern and southern Australia, decimated livestock on already barren farms and destroyed more than 2,000 homes.

On Kangaroo Island, known as Australia's “Galapagos” for the large number of unique animals and other wildlife endemic to the area, fires continued to rage in a big national park.

The flames have already taken a heavy toll on the island's population of koalas, birds and other endemic marsupial species.

“Instead of just piling up the ashfall somewhere, we are able to turn it into something useful. And it includes plastics, too,” said city environmental officer Rodelio Lee.

156,19-1-20,Smith blames loss of three quick wickets for defeat,"Australia batsman Steve Smith rued the loss of three quick wickets in the middle overs, including his own, that proved decisive in his team’s 36-run loss to India in the second ODI here.

India posted a fighting 340 for six on a flat track with opener Shikhar Dhawan top-scoring with 90-ball 96 and then bowled out the visitors for 304 to level the three-match series 1-1.

“The area where we lost it was losing the three wickets in between 30 and 40 overs and not having someone there that could start to launch,” Smith said.

“If we had someone that had been out there for a while, perhaps things may have been different but that was probably where we lost it,” he added.

Australia lost three quick wickets between the 30 and 40 overs. Marnus Labuschagne was dismissed in the 31st over and Chinaman Kuldeep Yadav accounted for both Alex Carrey and Smith in the 38th over which turned out to be a game changer.

“I thought Marnus played really well in his first outing, first bat in ODI cricket. We were going at a reasonable rate at around six an over for a while. We playing good cricket shots. I thought we timed the run (rate) reasonably well but just losing those three wickets in that 30 to 40 overs but (was) a big dent in the run chase,” said Smith.

According to Smith, the key to India’s victory was their partnerships in the middle.

“I think it's just our normal one-day game plan, with the ball it's trying to take wickets and stem the run rate that way, obviously they had some pretty good partnerships, Virat (Kohli), Shikhar (Dhawan) and KL Rahul played really well at the back end. They were able to form some partnerships through the middle,” he said.

On a personal note, Smith said it was good to be among the runs but he would have preferred if he could take his team over the line.

“It was nice to score a few runs, I would’ve liked to have batted a bit longer and been there in the happy hour but unfortunately, tried to cut one that stopped in the wicket a little bit and dragged it on. It was a pretty bad time. We had lost Kez (Alex Carey) in the same over.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/smith-blames-loss-of-three-quick-wickets-for-defeat.html

158,19-1-20,"Three decades on, exodus still haunts Kashmiri Pandits","Exactly 30 years ago on January 19, 1990, the Kashmiri Pandits were forced to flee their homeland, the Kashmir Valley, as a result of being targeted by Islamic jihadis.

Meanwhile, different political parties came to power but couldn't create a conducive atmosphere for their return to the valley. Displaced Kashmiri Hindus are still longing to return to their homeland.

The exodus of Kashmiri Hindus is no secret. Since 1989-90, nothing much has changed for the displaced community. What has changed is their culture, tradition, language among others.

Every New Year brings new hopes to the world. Whereas, for Kashmiri Pandits, January brings back a three-decade-old nightmare. On January 19, 1990, Islamic jihadis wreaked havoc on the minority Kashmiri Hindus. They were left with only three options -- convert to Islam, leave the place or perish.

The terrorists murdered hundreds of Kashmiri Pandits. Women were allegedly gangraped and killed. Hindu temples were targeted. Kidnappings and incidents of stone pelting at Hindu homes were a common occurrence. Neither police nor administration came to their rescue. No human rights defenders enquired the whereabouts of Kashmiri Hindus. Even at the hospitals, Hindu patients were being marginalised.

From streets to schools, colleges and offices, the minorities were persecuted, threatened and tortured mentally as well as physically.

Had the then Governor Jagmohan not called the Army to the valley on January 19, 1990, Kashmiri Pandits would have been massacred. Slogans were being raised from the mosques' loudspeakers -- ""Kaafiro ko maaro"" (kill the outsiders), ""Yahan Nizam-e-Mustafa chalega"" (what we want in Kashmir, rule of Allah), ""We want Kashmir with Pandit women, not Pandit men"".

Lakhs of Kashmiri Muslims were present on the streets to slaughter the Hindus. At last, the Army had to come to their rescue.

Kashmiri Hindus were left with no other option but to migrate to other cities. Lakhs of Kashmiri Pandits moved to Jammu, New Delhi and other cities.

Even the then Central government couldn't do anything for Kashmiri Hindus.

According to Kashmiri Pandits, over 300 Hindus were killed between 1989-90. The massacre continued even after 1990. On January 26, 1998, 23 Kashmiri Pandits were killed in Wandhama area of Ganderbal district.

Even after 30 years of the Kashmiri Pandits' exodus, no action has been taken. Police didn't even register FIRs in several cases. After exodus, Kashmiri Pandits' homes were allegedly robbed. Many houses were set ablaze. No FIRs were registered.

Justice Neelkanth Ganjoo, telecom engineer Balkrishna Ganjoo, Doordarshan Director Lassa Kaul and political leader Tikalal Taploo, among others were brutally killed. Girija Ganjoo and Sarla Bhat were allegedly abducted, gangraped and then murdered. Justice has not yet been delivered in several such cases.

Kashmiri political leaders such as Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti or the late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed never talked about atrocities against the Kashmiri Hindus. No leader made attempts to ensure return of Kashmiri Pandits to the valley.

When Kashmiri Pandits were attacked, Farooq Abdullah was Jammu and Kashmir's Chief Minister, while Mufti Mohammad Sayeed was the Union Home Minister.

It's unfortunate that no judicial inquiry commission or SIT was formed or an inquiry could be launched in such cases.

Kashmiri Pandits are still awaiting for justice. This year is the dawn of a new era. Even after three decades in exile, the community's return to their homeland still seems to be a distant dream.

Driver Kamlesh Kamath (38), who sustained minor injuries in the incident, was apparently trying to overtake another vehicle when Azmi's Tata Safari car rammed into a truck near Khalapur, about 60 km from here in neighbouring Raigad district, a local police official earlier said.

Azmi's husband, lyricist Javed Akhtar, was travelling in another car, Raigad Superintendent of Police Paraskar told PTI on Sunday.

""We have booked driver Kamlesh Kamath under Indian Penal Code Sections 279 and 337 for rash and negligent driving and provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act. He is not yet arrested,"" Paraskar said.

The car will be sent for an inspection to RTO (regional transport office) to ascertain if there was any fault in the vehicle or if the mishap took place after the driver lost control, he said.

He said Kejriwal's somewhat ""subdued"" response to what has been happening around has not sent the right kind of signals.

""It smacks of opportunism,"" said the Rajya Sabha MP, who is a member of the Congress' election and campaign committees for the Delhi polls.

Asked if the massive uproar over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the violence on university campuses will be a major factor in the polls, Sibal replied in the affirmative.

""What has Kejriwal done? Kejriwal has not even visited the campuses, not even visited JNU, because this is politics,"" he said.

""This is the problem when political parties take positions only for the purpose of an election, not for the purpose of what is right. People see through their acts,"" the former Union minister said.

Sibal also alleged that the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was not talking much about CAA, NPR and NRC for the fear of losing a section of a vote bank that it ""desperately needs"".

He asserted that Kejriwal has to answer to the people for his response to CAA, NPR and NRC.

Asked if the Congress can form the government on its own, Sibal said, ""I don't think that we should be making such tall claims, but at the same time I think we will be a significant factor in this election... Maybe giving us enough seats to be the determining factor in the formation of the government.""

On whether the Congress can join hands with the AAP if it turns out to be the ""determining factor"", he said, ""Let us first get the results out in the open. What our strategy is will be known to everybody at that point in time.""

Sibal also dismissed suggestions that the Congress' chances in the polls may be hampered by the absence of a popular and credible face, saying the credibility of a face has no relationship to the party's credibility in terms of its functioning on the ground.

""In 2014, we had a credible face in (Narendra) Modi ji, that is what the people of India thought, see what has happened since then. So let us not talk about the faces. The face of the common man is far more important than the face of the chief minister,"" he asserted.

It is only the Congress party that has always looked at the face of the common man or woman and worked towards his or her concerns, said Sibal, who has been elected to the Lok Sabha twice in the past from Delhi's Chandni Chowk constituency.

Responding to a question about the Congress mounting a formidable challenge to the AAP, Sibal said his party does not have any seats in the Delhi Assembly, so the ruling party certainly has an advantage.

""I think they (AAP) claim more than what they have done on the ground. They have a fabulous media campaign. This is somewhat like our prime minister's media campaign which sort of tries to claim much more than what the reality is. I think the people know the reality. So let's see what happens,"" he said.

The Congress leader claimed that the BJP is on a sticky wicket in the polls as it has ""lost credibility"" and people are very unhappy with it.

He cited the examples of Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, in which the poll pundits were proved wrong, to stress that a surprise could be in the offing in Delhi and his party could deliver a strong performance in the polls.

""I think the people of Delhi, as a member Parliament and (someone) who has fought elections in Delhi I can say, have realised that it is the Congress party that has delivered in Delhi. There is no other party that has delivered in Delhi. As far as AAP is concerned, it has been in constant conflict with the Centre,"" Sibal said.

""I remember the days when Sheila (Dikshit) ji was the chief minister and (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee ji was the prime minister. Even though we were different political parties with different ideologies, the administration worked together,"" he said.

This talks well of Vajpayee's administration and Dikshit's quality to embrace everyone and get the work of the people of Delhi going, he said, adding that, Kejriwal doesn't have that art.

""In a constant state of conflict, I don't think you can achieve much. I want to know how many great bridges have been built, how many underpasses have been built (under the AAP government). There is no infrastructure development at all,"" Sibal alleged.

All the schemes that have been taken forward in Delhi have been the brainchild of the Congress, he said.

Polling will be held on February 8 for the 70-member Delhi Assembly and the results will be declared on February 11.

The Congress is seeking to revive its fortunes in the national capital this time. It had won just eight seats in 2013 and drawn a blank in the 2015 Delhi Assembly polls.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kejriwal-s--subdued--response-to-caa-npr-nrc--jamia-jnu-violence--smacks-of-opportunism---sibal-2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/kejriwal-s--subdued--response-to-caa-npr-nrc--jamia-jnu-violence--smacks-of-opportunism---sibal.html

He said like the last five years, his government will continue to control the school fees in Delhi.

""As long as there is an honest government in Delhi, parents need not worry. No private school in Delhi will be allowed to arbitrarily decide its fees. Like the last five years, we will continue to control the fees,"" Kejriwal said in a tweet in Hindi.

His comments came ahead of the February 8 Delhi Assembly polls.

In April 2018, the Delhi government had issued a circular prohibiting private unaided schools functioning on government land from hiking tuition fees without the approval of the Directorate of Education.

A call on his participation in the match will be taken after further assessment, the BCCI said in a statement.

Dhawan was taken off the field after he got inured in the fifth over of the game at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.

""Shikhar Dhawan has gone for an x-ray. A call on him being available for the game will be taken once he is back and assessed,"" the BCCI said.

The left-handed batsman had dived to save an Aaron Finch shot in the cover region before hurting his shoulder.

He then walked out and was replaced by leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal on the field.

The 34-year-old Dhawan had not taken the field for the entire duration of the Australian innings in the second ODI after a Pat Cummins bouncer hit him on the rib cage while batting.

The series is levelled at 1-1.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dhawan-taken-for-scan--call-on-participation-after-assessment-2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/dhawan-taken-for-scan--call-on-participation-after-assessment.html
163,19-1-20,"BJP set to get new president, Nadda likely to succeed Shah","The BJP is set to get its new national president in place of Amit Shah on Monday, with its working president J P Nadda expected to be elected to the post unopposed.

Top party leaders, including those from states, are likely to arrive at the BJP headquarters to file nominations in support of Nadda, who has long been seen as the choice of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Shah for the job.

His decades-long experience in the organisation, starting from student politics, proximity to the RSS and clean image are seen as his strengths.

Senior BJP leader Radha Mohan Singh, who is in charge of the party's organisational poll process, said that nominations for the national president's election will be filed on January 20, and a contest will take place the next day if required.

The BJP has the convention of electing its president with consensus and without any contest, and there is little possibility that it will be any other way this time.

The election of a new president will bring to end incumbent Shah's tenure of over five-and-a-half years during which the BJP expanded its footprints across the country like never before and enjoyed its best phase in electoral contests despite suffering a few setbacks in state polls.

With Shah joining the Modi 2.0 government as home minister, the BJP began the exercise for electing his successor as the party has the convention of 'one person, one post'.

Nadda was appointed as the party's working president in July last year in an indication that the Himachal Pradesh leader was the likely choice for the top organisational job.

In the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, he was in-charge of the BJP's election campaign in the politically crucial state of Uttar Pradesh, where the party faced a tough challenge from the grand alliance of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).

The party won 62 out of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh. Apart from handling crucial states for the BJP in the general elections, Nadda was a Cabinet minister in the first tenure of the Modi government and has been a member of the parliamentary board, the BJP's top decision making body.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bjp-set-to-get-new-president--nadda-likely-to-succeed-shah-2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/bjp-set-to-get-new-president--nadda-likely-to-succeed-shah.html
164,19-1-20,Series at stake,"India and Australia ready for showdown in winners take it all contest

A coveted series-victory will be at stake when a resilient India face a feisty Australia in the third and deciding ODI here on Sunday, promising a fitting finale between the two leading teams in world cricket.

The series was very much expected to go down to the wire but with the way the Australians hammered the hosts in the series opener, it seemed the tourists would run away with their second straight series win in India.

However, India showed commendable character in Rajkot to level the series, proving that the panic buttons were pressed prematurely following the 10-wicket loss in Mumbai.

More importantly, India got their batting combination right for the second ODI, a fair comment considering the way K L Rahul seized the opportunity in his new batting position - number five.

With Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan opening, team’s best batsman and skipper Virat Kohli returned to his usual number three spot while Shreyas Iyer was back at number four. The same order is likely to be followed on Sunday.

Rohit, who is due for a big score in the series, hurt his shoulder while fielding on Friday but Kohli is confident that the star opener will be available for the series decider at the Chinnaswamy stadium.

Dhawan was also hit in the rib cage off a Pat Cummins ball, forcing him out of action when Australia batted.

Manish Pandey played in place of injured Rishabh Pant and it remains to be seen if the southpaw is fit for the game.

The biggest plus for India from Rajkot was Rahul’s power-packed knock at number five, creating a new set of possibilities that might help in improving the team balance.

Specialist opener Rahul made the difference in India’s innings by batting at a 150-plus strike rate in an unfamiliar position, having batted at three in the previous game.

In fact, Kohli went to the extent of saying that it was the best he saw from Rahul at the international level. India are looking to add much needed firepower in the middle-order and Rahul could provide that.

In Pant’s absence, he also did well behind the wicket, effecting Aaron Finch’s stumping besides taking two catches.

Before the series, the talk was about ‘who would open alongside Rohit?’

Will it be Rahul or the fit-again Shikhar Dhawan? With Dhawan scoring big in both the games and Rahul showing his versatility, both have proved their immense value in the playing eleven.

Kohli was criticised for tinkering with the batting order in Mumbai, especially on pushing himself down to four to accommodate Rahul but he always knew what he was doing.

“We live in the days of social media and a panic button being pressed too early. It’s very important to figure out the best team you can put on the park and when you see how KL was batting today, it’s very difficult to leave someone like that out,” Kohli said after the 36-run win.

No significant change is expected even in the bowling composition with team preferring three pacers and two spinners.

Kuldeep Yadav, who did not have the best of times in 2019, reaffirmed his value by bowling a match-winning over in which he removed Alex Carey and Steve Smith.

The other wrist spinner in the squad, Yuzvendra Chahal, may finally get to play alongside Kuldeep with the Chinnaswamy Stadium being his home ground in the IPL.

Another positive for India was Jasprit Bumrah producing a tidy spell, his most impressive since his comeback from injury. He stifled the opposition as wickets came from the other end.

Mohammad Shami, who was a tad expensive early on in Rajkot, bowled well towards the end alongside Navdeep Saini.

Australia too are unlikely to make wholesale changes in their line-up following the defeat. They were very much in the run chase until Kuldeep got rid of star batsman Smith. The visitors had a great chance of wrapping up the series but were unable to win the crucial moments.

The in-form Marnus Labuschagne was impressive in his first ODI innings but got out at the wrong time.

Mitchell Starc would be itching to bounce back, having conceded 78 runs in 10 overs. His new ball partner Pat Cummins was hard to score off once again while leggie Adam Zampa got the prized wicket of Kohli for the fifth time in ODIs.

However, left-arm spinner Ashton Agar has not been that effective and needs to up his game in the all-important series decider.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/series-at-stake-2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/series-at-stake.html

The 25-year-old Bajrang staged a remarkable comeback to secure a 4-3 win against USA's Jordan Michael Oliver in the summit showdown of the 65kg freestyle category.

Ravi, who competed in the 61kg category instead of his regular 57kg, also bagged gold after getting the better of Kazakhstan's Nurbolat Abdualiyev 12-2 in his final bout late on Saturday night.

The 23-year-old from Sonepat had made the final round after securing impressive wins over Moldova's Alexaandru Chirtoaca and Kazakhstan's Nurislam Sanayev.

Up against one of India's biggest medal prospects in the Tokyo Olympics, Oliver conceded that it was not his night against Bajrang.

The American lauded the competitive spirit of Bajrang.

""Wasnt my night… but I got a lot of work to do to be where I want to be! Hats off to @BajrangPunia dude is heck of a competitor! Until next time my friend,"" the American tweeted.

Bajrang had to sweat it out in the first round against Zain Allen Retherford of the USA before prevailing 5-4.

In the quarterfinal, the ace Indian wrestler went past another American Joseph Christopher Mc Kenna 4-2, before getting the better of Vasyl Shuptar of Ukraine 6-4 in the semi-finals.

However, it was curtains for Jitender in the 74kg and world championship silver medallist Deepak Punia in the 86kg category.

Jitender won his first bout against Denys Pavlov of Ukraine 10-1 before going down in the quarterfinals against Turkey's Soner Demirtas 4-0.

Jitender got a change to fight in the repechage after Demirtas entered the final, but the Indian wasted the opportunity, losing 2-9 to Daniyar Kaisanov of Kazakhstan.

166,19-1-20,There is no doubt Dhoni will be retained by CSK in 2021: N Srinivasan,"Mahendra Singh Dhoni ""will be retained"" by Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the 2021 IPL auctions irrespective of whether he plays for India again or not, asserted former BCCI president N Srinivasan.

The lack of a BCCI central contract for the two-time former World Cup winning captain has sparked fresh rumours of his retirement in the last few days but Srinivasan, who is the vice-president and managing director of Indian Cements, owners of CSK, made it clear that Dhoni will continue to play for his franchise.

""People keep saying when will he... How long will he play, etc. He will play. I can assure you. He will play this year. Next year he will go (to) the auction; he will be retained. So there is no doubt in anybody's mind,"" Srinivasan said at an India Cements event.

Dhoni has been a part of CSK since the IPL's inaugural edition in 2008 and apart from the two seasons when the franchise was suspended, the wicket-keeper batsman has led the team admirably, guiding it to three title triumphs.

The 38-year-old was on Thursday dropped from the BCCI's list of centrally contracted players, raising fresh doubts on the future of the former India captain who has not played since the World Cup semifinal loss to New Zealand in July last year.

Dhoni recently returned to training, batting fluently in the Jharkhand team nets.

He was in the A category, which fetches a player Rs 5 crore as annual retainership, until last year.

Dhoni's contract not being renewed was not exactly a surprise as he has not played a competitive game since that World Cup semifinal on July 9. He has been on an sabbatical and has refused to divulge his future plans.

One of the biggest names in Indian cricket, Dhoni led India to two world titles — the 2007 World T20 in South Africa and the 2011 ODI World Cup at home.

The veteran has played 90 Tests, 350 ODIs and 98 T20 Internationals for India, accumulating over 17,000 runs and effecting a staggering 829 dismissals behind the stumps.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/there-is-no-doubt-dhoni-will-be-retained-by-csk-in-2021--n-srinivasan-2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/there-is-no-doubt-dhoni-will-be-retained-by-csk-in-2021--n-srinivasan.html

""...Minorities living in the country will get their legitimate rights and NRC will protect their rights taken away by infiltrators from Bangladesh,"" state BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said in a statement here.

He asked the opposition parties not to ""instil fears in the minds of minorities"" over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and instead, tell them that CAA has ""nothing against them"".

Section 6B (4) of the CAA states that the Act will not be effective in tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura, besides the areas falling under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, he said.

The BJP leader also accused the opposition parties of indulging in appeasement politics as they were ""unable to fathom"" the developmental initiatives undertaken by the central government.

According to sources, Singh will also be taken to Delhi when the team returns.

The investigating team will go to Kulgam, Qazigund, Srinagar airport and residences of Singh in the next few days to collect evidences.

A case was registered by the NIA on Saturday after receiving the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) order and started the investigation.

Singh was arrested on January 11 with three Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists including top commander Naveed Babu, along with arms and ammunition, while they were travelling in a car in Kazipur on the National Highway.

Sources said, Singh was taking Babu to Jammu and was facilitating him to travel to Pakistan. A lawayer Irfan Ahmed was also arrested.

Multiple investigating agencies have been questioning Singh ever since, who has served key postings in the past.

Singh was associated with J&K police that fights terrorism. He was also posted in the anti-hijacking wing at Srinagar.

Besides, Singh was also the part of the officials which received delegation of ambassadors that visited Kashmir earlier this month.

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has convened a meeting over the issue at the state secretariat in Mumbai on Monday.

The bandh began here at midnight, but the Saibaba temple remained open with devotees being allowed to offer prayers, officials of the temple trust and Ahmednagar district administration said.

The 'prasadalaya' and the temple kitchen were also open to ensure devotees were not inconvenienced, they said.

Long queues of devotees were seen in front of the 'prasadalaya', breakfast centre and 'laddoo' sale centres of the temple, according to sources.

Terming the bandh as ""successful"", local BJP functionary Sachin Tambe Patil, who is former trustee of the Saibaba temple, said, ""Commercial establishments, shops, restaurants and local transport (autorickshaws and other private vehicles) are closed and a complete shutdown is being observed in the town as well as in 25 villages around Shirdi.""

""However, the temple is open and devotees are coming to offer prayers,"" he said, adding that a rally has been organised here on Sunday.

Devotees who made pre-bookings at hotels were allowed to stay and taxi services from the airport to the temple were also unaffected, the district administration official said.

The state transport buses from other locations were being allowed to come to the town, he added.

Former Maharashtra minister Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil, who is the local BJP MLA, on Saturday said he supported the bandh call.

The controversy began after Chief Minister Thackeray announced a grant of Rs 100 crore for development of facilities at ""Sai janmasthan"" (birthplace) at Pathri in Parbhani district.

Local residents and leaders in Shirdi took exception to the chief minister's announcement, saying the birthplace of the famed saint was not known, and Pathri cannot make a claim to being his birthplace.

They are demanding that Thackeray withdraw his official statement where he described Pathri as Saibaba's birthplace.

Citizens under the banner of 'Goa Unity Forum' gathered in Ponda town of South Goa district on Saturday and held a protest rally.

Addressing the rally, retired IAS officer Arvind Bhatikar, who has been spearheading anti-CAA protests in Goa, claimed the new citizenship law will ""destroy India"".

But saying they will not implement it, then it is against the law. It is unconstitutional to say that"", she said.

Sitharaman was responding to a query from among the audience at an event on CAA, organised by Chennai Citizens' Forum,that some states like Kerala have opposed implementation of the CAA in their respective states.

""A state assembly can pass resolution that they will not implement CAA. It is a political statement. They can go ahead and we will not say no to that.

IMD officials said the minimum temperature was recorded 8.4 degrees Celsius, a notch above the normal, and visibility was reduced to 50 metres in Palam area during the morning hours due to a dense fog.

A Railway spokesperson said around 20 north-bound trains were delayed by two to five hours.

Chief of IMD regional forecasting centre Kuldeep Srivastava said Delhi may receive light rain on January 21 due to a fresh western disturbance but temperatures are not expected to dip drastically in the next eight to 10 days.

The maximum temperature will fluctuate between 17 and 19 degrees Celsius and minimum temperature will oscillate between six and eight degrees Celsius next week.

Delhi will witness moderate to dense fog on January 19, and January 22, 23 and 24.

“There’s almost nil chance of cold day or cold wave conditions returning to Delhi in the remaining winter season,” he said. The air quality index in Delhi Saturday evening was 250. The AQI in Faridabad was 258; Ghaziabad 252; Greater Noida 264; Gurgaon 155; and Noida 299.

175,19-1-20,Surreal twist in Behmai trial! Where’s case diary?,"The case diary of the Behmai massacre, in which 20 people were killed allegedly by bandit queen Phoolan Devi’s gang nearly four decades ago, was found missing on Saturday when a special court was to pronounce its verdict, prompting the judge to postpone the matter to January 24.

Special judge (UP dacoity-affected area) Sudhir Kumar pulled up the court official for the absence of the case diary at the time of delivering the verdict and asked him to place it before the court on January 24.

The court is likely to give its verdict on the role of the four surviving accused — Posha, Bhikha, Vishwanath and Shyambabu. While Posha is still in jail, the rest are out on bail. Three other dacoits, including Man Singh, are absconding.

The judge postponed pronouncement of the verdict after finding out that the original case diary was missing from court record, district Government counsel Rajeev Porwal told PTI. The court has now listed the case on January 24, asking its staff to trace the missing case diary and place it before it on the next date.

“The court decided to fix another date for pronouncing the judgment after the case diary is located,” he said.

The court also issued a notice to the sessions clerk concerned for the case diary going missing, Porwal said, adding strict instructions have been issued to find it.

Though the disappearance of the case diary came to light only recently, Porwal denied any conspiracy behind it.

An advocate of the complainant later said the Allahabad High Court will be moved in view of “undue delay in pronouncement of judgment” in the case and “mysterious disappearance” of the original case diary.

The special court for hearing dacoity-related cases was expected to deliver the verdict in the 1981 Behmai massacre case on January 6, but it allowed the defence counsel to submit written arguments by January 16, Porwal said.

Defence counsel Girish Narain Dubey had appeared before the court on January 6, seeking more time to submit written arguments and was granted 10 more days, the government counsel said.

“Bandit Queen” Phoolan Devi, who later entered politics, along with her gang members were accused of killing the 20 people belonging to the Thakur community at Behmai village in Kanpur Dehat on February 14, 1981.

The non-descript Behmai village, that drew national attention after the killings, is 170 km from state capital Lucknow and over 400 km from national Capital New Delhi.

Phoolan Devi had stormed into Behmai in what was described as an attack to avenge her alleged rape there by two other bandits - Lala Ram and Sri Ram - both Thakurs, a dominant caste in the village.

Two years after the incident, she had surrendered to the Madhya Pradesh police in 1983. She then went on to become a Lok Sabha member from Mirzapur for the first time in 1996 and then in 1999 on Samajwadi Party ticket.

Initially, 35 people, including Phoolan Devi, were named as accused in the case. Eight of them were reportedly killed by police in separate encounters. Three others were reportedly absconding.

The prosecution had produced as many as 15 witnesses and seven of them were material witnesses. The process of prosecution producing evidence was closed in 2014.

The Behmai killings had led to a political fallout, with then UP chief minister V P Singh, who later became the country’s prime minister, resigning owning moral responsibility for the massacre.

As per the terms of her surrender under an amnesty scheme, then Madhya Pradesh chief minister Arjun Singh agreed to keep her in the Gwalior prison, rather than being sent to a prison in Uttar Pradesh as a result of which the summons and non-bailable warrants issued by a Kanpur court were returned unserved.

She spent 11 years in Gwalior and Jabalpur jails in Madhya Pradesh and was released in 1994 without facing trial as she kept fighting a legal battle against the UP police and the Kanpur court’s orders.

Charges against the four surviving accused were framed only in 2012.

Phoolan Devi’s release was facilitated by the withdrawal of 55 cases by then UP chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav’s government in “public interest”.

Yadav’s decision, however, was set aside by the Kanpur court, with the Allahabad High Court upholding the trial court’s decision.

Even the Supreme Court had rejected her plea for dismissal of all cases against her in December 1996.

Phoolan Devi, however, evaded arrest and waged a legal battle against it in 2001.

The apex court directed her that if she wanted relief in the cases against her, she first needed to surrender to the trial court in Kanpur.

But, that was not to be as on July 25, 2001, she was killed outside her official residence in New Delhi.

Her story was told on the big screen by noted film director Shekhar Kapoor in his movie “Bandit Queen” based on the book “India’s Bandit Queen: The True Story of Phoolan Devi” by author Mala Sen, starring Seema Biswas as the title character who won the National Film Award for Best Actress.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/surreal-twist-in-behmai-trial--where---s-case-diary--2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/surreal-twist-in-behmai-trial--where---s-case-diary-.html
176,19-1-20,"CAA, NRC 'internal matters' of India: Bangladesh PM","Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has termed as ""internal matters"" of India the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), but at the same time said the act was ""not necessary"".

According to the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 following religious persecution there will get Indian citizenship. Protests are being held across India against the controversial law.

""We don't understand why (the Indian government) did it. It was not necessary,"" Hasina told the Gulf News in an interview, referring to India's new citizenship law.

Her comments came weeks after Bangladesh Foreign Minister A K Abdul Momen said that the CAA and the NRC are India's ""internal issues"", but voiced concern that any ""uncertainty"" in the country is likely to affect its neighbours.

Bangladesh, where 10.7 per cent of the 161 million population is Hindu and 0.6 per cent Buddhist, has denied any migration to India because of religious persecution, the paper said.

Hasina, who is in the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi, also said that there has been no recorded reverse migration from India.

""No, there is no reverse migration from India. But within India, people are facing many problems,"" she said.

""(Still), it is an internal affair,"" Hasina said.

""Bangladesh has always maintained that the CAA and NRC are internal matters of India,"" Hasina said. ""The Government of India, on their part, has also repeatedly maintained that the NRC is an internal exercise of India and Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi has in person assured me of the same during my visit to New Delhi in October 2019.""

She said the relationship between Bangladesh and India is currently at its best, with cooperation in a ""wide spectrum of areas"".

The NRC has been prepared to identify genuine Indian citizens living in Assam since March 24, 1971, or before, and identify illegal Bangladeshi migrants in the state.

177,19-1-20,Not a patch on Dr Dolittle,"Dolittle*ing: Robert Downey Jr, Antonio Banderas, Michael Sheen, Emma Thompson, Rami Malek, John Cena, Kumail Nanjiani, Octavia Spencer, Tom Holland, Craig Robinson, Ralph Fiennes, Selena Gomez, Marion Cotillard

Rated: 6/10

Back in 1998 when Dr Dolittle hit the screens, most animal lovers loved the concept. Almost all of us would like to know what and how the four-legged creatures think especially their thoughts about humans.

Cut to 2020. Dolittle was a movie that most people were looking forward to since it has Robert Downey Jr. The fact that he is playing the central character added to the flavour of the film. While it is good to watch him come alive on the 70 mm screen, there are a lot of things that are missing here that make this one a bit of a bore.

Robert Downey Jr tries hard to look like an eccentric doctor who speaks with animals. His scruffy and unkempt look doesn’t sit too well on the character that he portrays. His post Avengers appearance doesn’t appear to sit on him well enough for the audience to take a shine to him in this role where he is busy removing armour suits and even a bagpie from a dragon!

It is set in Victorian England where a Lord wants to kill the Queen of England to take her place. A bit of an odd setting from the time when Eddie Murphy played Dr Dolittle from America. Then there is the rather strange demand from the Queen who wants Dr Dolittle treat her, even though he is a doctor, he is famous for being a vet!

Not all is lost here. The animals are definitely cuter. A special mention for the lion cub, Chee-Chee the anxious gorilla and Dab-Dab, the crazy duck.

The makers on a mission to make this a grand project ended up with a film that is not a patch on Dr Dolittle, the funny and crazy doctor that we are familiar with.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/not-a-patch-on-dr-dolittle-2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/not-a-patch-on-dr-dolittle.html
178,19-1-20,Adnan: Love grey shadesAdnan: Love grey shades,"Adnan Khan, who plays Kabeer in Zee TV’s Ishq Subhan Allah, speaks with Chanchal Goyal about how he is similar to his character, fitness regime and upcoming projects

What is the one thing you like and dislike about your character?

What I like in Kabeer, is that he is brave. However, in real life it is not possible to face every situation bravely. What I dislike is his inability to question things. He is too strict about his ideologies and doesn’t want to change at all.

Do you share any similarities with your character?

Yes, I have a lot of similarities. The biggest one is belief in my faith. I pray everyday. I am a family man just like my character.

Which co-actor you share most cordial relations?

Obviously Esha for now, since I have spent two years working with her. I have done a lot of romantic scenes with her. Maybe I can answer this question better after I have spent equal amount of time with Tunisha too.

How did the shift from a management student to an actor happen?

Though I was pursuing my Bachelor in Business Administration, I was clear that I was not made for nine to five job. I wanted to do something creative. I used to create visuals in my head try on how to make better ads. Having said that due to my family circumstances I had to work. I was not satisfied with my job so I switched to other jobs but nothing sat well with me. There was something missing in every job I took. I decided to try my hands in anchoring. I got selected for ZEE TV’s travel show in Dubai and reached the finals. But after that there were no options. The journey was not easy. But since now I am here playing Kabeer, I believe all the efforts were worth it.

Did you prep to become an actor?

I did not prepare anything for acting. I thought that it is the easiest job on the planet! You have got a few lines and you just have to narrate them. I thought that there was no need to join National School of Drama for three years, a three-month training workshop would be more than enough. When I stepped into the field, I realised that I have entered a dark ocean. There is no end to learning. I had given a lot of auditions and failed many times. But what has worked is that I kept trying.

What kind of roles do you want to play?

I want to play a dark characters. Though I am already trying to give Kabir a grey shade, but still I would like to explore more grey characters.

From Arjun on Star Plus to Kabir. How has been your journey?

The journey has been a long one. I have seen a lot of ups and downs. Now I feel that I am at a stable stage. I work with the same energy that I had in 2013. The more you work the more you can get better. Back then, I thought acting is tough but now I feel it is much more difficult than I thought it to be. But my approach towards acting has remained the same. I still find it beautiful and difficult.

The journey is a test of your character. At times you will feel so demotivated because of all the rejections that you had to go through. People tend to lose path during this phase. Some may get addicted to drugs while others will engage themselves in parties to forget the bad times. Fortunately, because of my mother, faith in God and friends, I didn’t lose my goal during any of the hard times.

What does fame mean to you?

I don’t take fame too seriously. But yes my social media account got verified recently. I felt happy.

Which role was the most challenging for you?

All of them were equally challenging. All the roles that I played were different from each other. But to mention one, it can be Ramesh from Khade Hai Teri Raahon Mein on Hotstar. For this role, I did a lot of rehearsals and mock shoots. I performed well in the auditions but was unable to justify the character during the shoot. It took me two day to get back on track.

Can you share your fitness regime?

I have a small gym in my room. There is one elastic band, one skipping rope, one pull up bar and two dumbells. I sleep for five-six hours and spend the rest of the time in shooting and working out. This may not be the best shape I have been in but I am fit. I never miss my work out sessions.

What fitness tips would you like to give out to the youngsters?

Don’t make excuses. If you have decided to work out, make time for it and do it whole heartedly and not because someone else wants you to do it.

What are your upcoming projects?

I write scripts and recently sold one for a film based on Mixed Martial Arts. I believe we will win an Oscar for it. I will also be acting in it. I am trying my hand at direction as well and have written a short filmin which I will act as well.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/adnan--love-grey-shadesadnan--love-grey-shades-2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/adnan--love-grey-shadesadnan--love-grey-shades.html

Maharashtra claims Belgaum, part of the erstwhile Bombay Presidency but currently a district of Karnataka, on linguistic grounds.

He also said that internet services were suspended in Jammu and Kashmir to prevent certain elements from ""misusing"" information that could affect law and order situation there.

Saraswat was speaking to reporters in Gandhinagar on Saturday after attending the convocation of the Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology.

""What difference does it make if there's no internet there? What do you watch on internet there? What e-tailing is happening there? Besides watching dirty films, you do nothing there,"" he said.

""If there is no internet in Kashmir, it does not have any significant effect on the economy,"" he added.

Saraswat said the reason for suspending internet services in Jammu and Kashmir was to prevent certain elements from misusing information.

""If Article 370 had to be removed, and if Kashmir had to be taken forward, we knew there were elements there which will misuse this kind of information in a manner that will affect the law and order situation,"" he said.

He called for the issues there to be resolved ""democratically"".

Saraswat also said that protests like those against the Citizenship Amendment Act and in JNU affect the economy.

183,19-1-20,Legal lacunae delay hanging,"One after another, defence lawyers in Nirbhaya rape-murder case exploit loopholes in criminal justice system

It is turning out to be an agonising wait for both the hangman and justice seekers in the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case. The executioner may have measured the necks of the condemned prisoners, may have weighed them, and may be ready with his noose, but the defence lawyers are determined to exploit every legal loophole to delay the inevitable.

The way they timed filing of curative petitions of individual convicts and followed the same ploy while filing of the mercy plea shows the gaping lacunae in the procedure laid down for the execution of a death sentence.

A Delhi court on Friday issued fresh death warrants for February 1 against the four convicts — Vinay Sharma (26), Mukesh Kumar (32), Akshay Kumar Singh (31) and Pawan Kumar Gupta (25) — in the case. This after the court on Thursday stayed the hanging of the four convicts over a mercy petition filed by one of the convicts.

“I am not reviewing my order to pass a death warrant. There will be a stay on the execution of the death warrant since a mercy plea is there. Jail authorities just have to give me this report saying we will not hang them on January 22,” the Tis Hazari court judge said on Thursday

The defence lawyers have many more pending pleas. After asking the court to first dispose of a pending robbery case against the four convicts before taking a call on their hanging, now they have gone to the apex court challenging the Delhi HC order dismissing Pawan’s claim of being a juvenile at the time of brutally raping Nirbhaya.

The Supreme Court will hear on January 20 Pawan’s plea against a Delhi High Court order dismissing his claim of being a juvenile. A Bench of Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bushan and AS Bopanna will hear the plea of Pawan, who moved the SC on Friday challenging the High Court’s order.

Besides, the convict has sought a direction restraining the authorities from executing the death penalty, which has been scheduled for February 1.

He has challenged the High Court’s December 19 order by which it also deprecated the conduct of his advocate for filing forged documents and not appearing in the court.

On Friday, President Ram Nath Kovind rejected the mercy petition of Mukesh. The other three condemned convicts have not yet availed of the constitutional remedy of filing the mercy petitions.

The apex court had on January 14 dismissed the curative petitions of Vinay and Mukesh against their conviction and capital punishment.

In his appeal filed through advocate AP Singh, Pawan has claimed before the High Court that as per his school certificate his date of birth is October 8, 1996. Pawan had earlier moved a trial court with a plea claiming to be juvenile at the time of the offence and it was dismissed on December 21, 2019.

Meanwhile, the Bar Council of Delhi on Saturday issued notice to advocate AP Singh after Delhi High Court had last month directed it to take action against the lawyer for filing “forged” documents and not appearing for hearing.

The Bar body issued notice to Singh for February 28 and sought his reply within two weeks.

184,19-1-20,Nirbhaya’s father slams call for pardoning rapists-killers,"The tweet of senior advocate Indira Jaising in which she urged Nirbhaya’s mother to “follow the example” of Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, suggesting that she should pardon the four men sentenced to death for raping-killing her daughter in 2012 has not gone down well with Nirbhaya’s father.

Slamming Jaising, he said she should be “ashamed” of suggesting pardon and added that his family isn’t as “large-hearted” as Sonia Gandhi. Also, he demanded an apology from Jaising, who is known for her stand against capital punishment.

“We have been fighting the case for seven years. We are common people and not politicians. Such mentality is responsible for the rising number of rapes,” he added.

Nirbhaya’s father said his wife held similar views. He said they had seen Jaising in court but never interacted with her.

“Why did she have to say something and face insult when she has nothing to do with the case,” he asked.

In a tweet on Friday, Jaising said while she empathises with the pain of Nirbhaya’s mother, she urged her “to follow the example of Sonia who forgave Nalini and said she didn’t not (did not) want the death penalty for her”. “We are with you but against death penalty,” she said. Nalini Sriharan was sentenced to death in Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination case. Her death penalty was commuted to life term after the intervention of Sonia, who urged for clemency on account of the fact that Nalini had a young daughter who was born in jail.

Nirbhaya’s father said this is a “wrong message”. “She (Indira Jaising) is a woman herself. She should be ashamed of her comments and apologise to Nirbhaya’s mother,” he told PTI. “

On Friday, a Delhi court issued fresh death warrants for February 1 against the four convicts -- Vinay Sharma (26), Mukesh Kumar (32), Akshay Kumar Singh (31) and Pawan (25) -- in the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case.

Earlier in the day, President Ram Nath Kovind had rejected the mercy petition of Mukesh.

Nirbhaya’s father said he is hopeful of justice finally being delivered. A 23-year-old paramedic student, who came to be known as Nirbhaya (fearless), was gangraped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012, in a moving bus in south Delhi by six persons, including the four death row convicts, before being thrown out on the road.

185,19-1-20,2013 Nirbhaya redux in Delhi: 2 held guilty,"A POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) court convicted two men on Saturday for raping a five-year-old girl in East Delhi seven years ago, saying the case had shaken the collective conscience of society.

The gruesome incident at Gandhi Nagar in April 15, 2013, in which the convicts shoved objects in the victim’s private parts and abandoned her believing she was dead, had happened four months after the Nirbhaya gang rape-and-murder case in December 2012. The child was rescued 40 hours later on April 17.

The POCSO court convicted Manoj and Pradeep Kumar, and fixed January 30 for arguments on the quantum of sentence.

In an over 100-page judgement, Additional Sessions Judge Naresh Kumar Malhotra said, “In our society, minor girls are worshipped as goddess on certain occasions, but in the present case, the victim child, had experienced exceptional depravity and brutality.”

“The crime against the victim was committed in a most grotesque and revolting manner and the collective conscience of the community was shaken,” the court said.

It convicted the two under sections 363 (kidnapping), 342 (wrongful confinement), 201 (disappearance of evidence), 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 376 (2) (gang rape), 377 (unnatural offence) and 34 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the POCSO Act.

The offences entail a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.

The father of the victim expressed satisfaction on finally getting justice for his daughter.

“Though the trial should have been completed in two years, we are happy we got justice after six years,” he said, hoping for death penalty for the convicts.

“My wife is at home with my daughter.... She has almost forgotten the incident. We don’t want to make her remember the gruesome incident and the trauma that she had to go through. It is best she is not told anything about the case or the judgement,” he said.

While the convicts were being taken out from the courtroom, Shah attacked some of the mediapersons, hitting one of the reporters on her face.

The journalist brought the incident to the notice of the judge and also filed a complaint with the police.

It took six years, seven judges and 57 prosecution witnesses to complete the trial in the case. The process of recording statements of the accused went on from December 5, 2018, to September 25 last year, following which the prosecution and the defence counsel completed their final arguments last December.

Shah and Kumar were arrested from Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga in Bihar on April 20 and April 22, 2013, respectively.

The police had said some foreign materials -- three pieces of a candle and one hair oil bottle -- were taken out from the body of the victim, which was also proved by doctors during recording of their statements in the court.

The girl had undergone multiple surgeries at the AIIMS in Delhi.

Anger over the incident had spilled onto Delhi’s streets as outraged students and women staged demonstrations at the India Gate, police headquarters and near the residences of then prime minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

Singh had said collective efforts were needed to root out such “depravity” from society.

The trial saw an interesting turn in 2014 when Kumar had moved the court claiming he was a juvenile at the time of his arrest.

The trial court took three years to decide his application of juvenility and transferred the case in April 2017 to the Juvenile Justice Board, which granted him bail in June.

Following this, the mother of the rape survivor moved the Delhi High Court against the trial court’s order declaring Pradeep to be a juvenile. The high court had in 2018 declared that Pradeep was not a juvenile and sent him to trial before the sessions court.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/2013-nirbhaya-redux-in-delhi--2-held-guilty.html

187,19-1-20,Thousands-strong Hong Kong protest cut short by clashes,"Clashes broke out between protesters and police in Hong Kong on Sunday, cutting short a rally after thousands had gathered at a park to call for electoral reforms and a boycott of the Chinese Communist Party.

Police fired tear gas near the park, known as Chater Garden, after some protesters attacked plainclothes officers — a return to the violence that has roiled the Chinese territory off and on for months.

Sporting their movement's trademark black clothing and face masks, rally participants had earlier packed into Chater Garden, located near the city's Legislative Council building. They held up signs that read ""Free Hong Kong"" and waved American and British flags.

""We want real universal suffrage,"" the protesters chanted. ""Disband the police force, free Hong Kong!"" Hong Kong media outlets reported that police arrested the rally's organizer, Ventus Lau, shortly after he spoke to reporters.

Local broadcaster RTHK cited fellow organizers as saying that Lau was arrested for allegedly violating the police's conditions for the rally.

Earlier in the day, Lau said he believes more large-scale protests are needed for global attention to return to Hong Kong, with the protest movement losing some of its momentum in recent weeks.

""I think Hong Kong has not been the focus of the world anymore,"" he said.

He urged other countries to launch sanctions against Hong Kong's government if it does not allow residents to directly elect Legislative Council members this year.

A former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997. While the framework of “one country, two systems"" promises the city greater democratic rights than are afforded to the mainland, protesters say their freedoms have been steadily eroding under Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Frictions between democracy-minded Hong Kongers and the Communist Party-ruled central government in Beijing came to a head last June, when proposed extradition legislation sparked months of mass demonstrations.

The bill — which would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China to stand trial — has since been withdrawn, but protests have continued for more than seven months, centered around demands for voting rights and an independent inquiry into police conduct.

While the protests began peacefully, they increasingly descended into violence after demonstrators became frustrated with the government's response. They feel that Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has ignored their demands and used the police to suppress them.

In response to Sunday's rally, Hong Kong's government released a statement that warned against any foreign involvement. Beijing has repeatedly accused foreign countries like the US of inciting riots in Hong Kong in a bid to sabotage China's development.

The statement outlined the ""universal suffrage of 'one person, one vote' as an ultimate aim"" enshrined in the city's de facto constitution, known as the Basic Law. This step must be implemented in line with ""gradual and orderly progress,"" the statement said.

Underpinning the protests is a deep distrust for the central government and Xi, who is widely considered China's most authoritarian leader in decades. Some protesters have accused Lam of being ""Beijing's puppet,"" a label she has rejected.

Demonstrators have routinely thrown bricks and gasoline bombs at riot police, who have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and — on rare occasions — live rounds.

The months of unrest have sent the financial hub's economy reeling, as shops have shuttered during clashes and tourists have stayed away.

Hong Kong police gave approval for Sunday's rally, but not for a march that organizers had also planned. The march didn't happen, and the protest was curtailed by clashes after police ordered an end to the rally hours before the pre-approved finishing time.

Protesters used bricks, umbrellas and traffic barriers to barricade a road. They ran for cover after riot police appeared around Chater Garden and raised yellow warning flags, telling demonstrators that they should disperse because they were participating in an illegal assembly.

Two officers were bleeding from the head after a group of “rioters” attacked them with wooden sticks, police said in a statement, adding that some also lobbed water bottles and other objects at law enforcement. Others threw paint bombs at buildings in the Central business district, according to police.

Several young protesters were handcuffed outside the park, as officers made arrests and conducted searches into the evening. One man who refused to be searched retreated into a public restroom that was promptly surrounded by riot police.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/thousands-strong-hong-kong-protest-cut-short-by-clashes-2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/thousands-strong-hong-kong-protest-cut-short-by-clashes.html

""She is an absolutely fantastic actor. There is a fantastic ensemble cast with Manav Kaul and Shubhrajyoti (Barat). So, we have created a Nehwal family along with the coaches. I think I couldn't have gotten luckier,"" said Gupte at the 50th Foundation Day of Jamnabai Narsee School in Mumbai.

Parineeti Chopra replaced Shraddha Kapoor as Saina Nehwal in the film. Shraddha had even started filming in September 2018, but she opted out of the film reportedly due to scheduling conflicts.

Gupte insisted his film is on schedule: ""All is going well. Everything is good. We have nearly completed shooting of the film. We have finished 98 per cent of the shoot. We have some patchwork to do in February and that's it.""

In the film, Manav Kaul plays role of badminton ace Pullela Gopichand who guided Saina in her career, and Shubhrajyoti Barat plays Saina's father.

190,19-1-20,Nitin Kakkar plans to make two films post 'Jawaani Jaaneman',"Director Nitin Kakkar says he has his eyes set on two projects, a sports drama and a black-and-white partition-set film, post the release of Saif Ali Khan-starrer ""Jawaani Jaaneman"".

The film, which marks the Bollywood debut of Pooja Bedi's daughter Alaya F, will bow out countrywide on January 31. It also stars Tabu, Kumud Mishra and Farida Jalal in pivotal roles.

Kakkar, best known for National Award-winning movie ""Filmistan"", said the sports film is not a biopic of any personality as he believes in creating original work.

""There is a sports film. It is not a real life story. I like fiction. Everyone is making biopic but I like to stand out. This is going to be my biggest entertainer. I am in conversation with producers,"" Kakkar told PTI.

As for the black-and-white film, the filmmaker said the script is ready but no producer has so far agreed to finance it.

""I have a script ready and I'm keen to make the film. It is a period film, a partition story based in 1947. This is the first script I had written and wanted to make it is as my first film but nobody seemed keen (to back it). I hope I can make it. I will find a way,"" Kakkar said.

He described the project as ""black humour"", an element that was prevalent in 2012's ""Filmistan"" which presented the director's take on the relations between India and Pakistan at the time.

""It is a black humour and has an interesting story. 'Filmistaan' was also black humour, in which I showed my opinion on India and Pakistan relation. I like this space as not many people are making it,"" Kakkar added.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nitin-kakkar-plans-to-make-two-films-post--jawaani-jaaneman--2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/nitin-kakkar-plans-to-make-two-films-post--jawaani-jaaneman-.html

192,19-1-20,Zoe Kravitz says she plans to bring 'strong femininity' to Catwoman,"Actor Zoe Kravitz says she intends to channel the strong feminine traits of iconic DC character Catwoman in her portrayal for the Matt Reeves-directed ""The Batman"".

Kravitz, best known for films such as ""Mad Max: Fury Road"", ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"", will portray Selina Kyle aka Catwoman in the movie which will see Robert Pattinson making his debut as Bruce Wayne aka Batman.

Talking to Variety on the sidelines of Television Critics Association's winter press tour, the 31-year-old actor said looks up to Michelle Pfeiffer, who portrayed character in Tim Burton's ""Batman Returns"", for inspiration.

""I think Catwoman is an iconic character. I was never into a lot of comic books, but that world was always really intriguing to me. And then of course Michelle Pfeiffer — her performance has always been super inspiring to me. It just felt iconic,"" Kravitz said.

The actor said she is excited to dive in the world of Kyle, who represents ""really strong femininity"".

""I think femininity represents power, and I think it's a different kind of power than masculine power. That's something that's really interesting about Batman and Catwoman.

""I think Batman represents a very kind of masculine power, and Catwoman represents very feminine power, slightly more complicated, and softer, too. I like the idea that you can be soft, you can be gentle and still be very powerful and still be very dangerous,"" Kravitz said.

194,19-1-20,Reward improves visual learning only after people sleep: Study,"Rewarding people during a task involving visual perception may lead to performance gains only if they follow up the task with sleep, according to a study which cautions students against sacrificing sleep for late night study sessions.

In the study, published in the journal PNAS, young adults were asked to identify a letter and the orientation of a set of lines on a busy background.

Some of the participants were told to refrain from eating or drinking in the hours leading up to the task, and were then given drops of water as a reward for correct responses, the researchers including those from Brown University in the US, said.

In contrast to groups which were not rewarded during training, the findings revealed that the rewarded participants exhibited significant performance gains -- but only if they slept after the training session.

""College students work very hard, and they sometimes shorten their sleep. But they need sleep in order to retain their learning,"" said study co-author Yuka Sasaki, a professor of cognitive, linguistic, and psychological sciences at Brown University.

According to the researchers, reward -- or anticipation of reward -- reinforced nerve connections in the brain between areas responsible for reward and visual functions.

They said these brain circuits are more likely to reactivate during sleep to facilitate task learning.

During post-training sleep in participants who were rewarded, the brain electric activity pattern seen in electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, revealed an increased activation in the prefrontal, reward-processing area of the brain, and decreased excitation in the untrained visual areas.

Putting this finding in context with previous studies, the researchers said the prefrontal, reward-processing area of the brain sends signals to inhibit some of the nerves in the visual processing area.

Due to this, they added, irrelevant connections are trimmed, and the most efficient circuits are preserved, improving task performance.

The researchers also assessed when the patterns of activation occurred.

They said untrained visual areas of the brain showed reduced activation during both Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and non-REM sleep.

However, the scientists said, prefrontal, reward-processing areas became active only during REM sleep -- a kind of sleep that is associated rapid eye movements, more dreaming, faster pulse and breathing.

REM sleep, they added, could be particularly important for task learning since nerve connections are reorganised and optimised during this sleep stage.

According to the researchers, this type of sleep may be linked to the activation of reward-processing areas of the brain.

Strengthening this theory, they found that the rewarded study participants displayed longer periods of REM sleep compared to those who did not receive a reward during training.

The researchers also said rewards like food and water, may have a stronger impact on neural circuits compared to comparatively abstract rewards such as money.

""Water deprivation may be fundamental. When you're really thirsty and you get water as a reward, the impact of that reward may be more prevailing to the brain,"" Sasaki said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/reward-improves-visual-learning-only-after-people-sleep--study-2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/reward-improves-visual-learning-only-after-people-sleep--study.html
195,19-1-20,Britain's Prince Harry and Meghan to give up royal titles,"Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have agreed to give up their royal titles and public funding as part of a settlement with the Queen that lets them spend more private time in Canada.

The historic announcement from Buckingham Palace on Saturday follows more than a week of intense private talks aimed at managing the fallout of the globetrotting couple's shock resignation from front-line royal duties.

It means Queen Elizabeth II's grandson Harry and his American TV actress wife Meghan will stop using the titles ""royal highness"" -- the same fate that befell his late mother Princess Diana after her divorce from Prince Charles in 1996.

""Following many months of conversations and more recent discussions, I am pleased that together we have found a constructive and supportive way forward for my grandson and his family,"" the 93-year-old monarch said in a statement.

""I recognise the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life.""

Her comments referred to battles with the media that prompted Harry and Meghan -- known until now as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex -- to sue several newspapers in October over intrusions into their private lives.

The Queen said she was ""particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family"" and wished the couple ""a happy and peaceful new life"".

A separate statement attributed to Buckingham Palace said ""the Sussexes will not use their HRH titles as they are no longer working members of the Royal Family"". HRH stands for His or Her Royal Highness.

""As agreed in this new arrangement, they understand that they are required to step back from royal duties, including official military appointments. They will no longer receive public funds for royal duties,"" the statement said.

The settlement added that the two will also repay 2.4 million pounds (USD 3.1 million) of taxpayer's money spent on renovating their Frogmore Cottage home near Windsor Castle.

Much of the British media interpreted the ruling as the Queen's punishment for Harry and Meghan's wayward ways.

The Queen ""brought down the iron fist"", Sky News' royal commentator Alastair Bruce said.

""Make no mistake, Saturday night's statement represents the hardest Megxit possible,"" The Daily Telegraph newspaper said.

The Palace would not comment on who ends up paying for Harry and Meghan's security detail in Canada -- an issue of intense public debate.

It also failed to mention whether the couple would be allowed to benefit financially from future royalties and franchise fees.

The couple are seeking to register the ""Sussex Royal"" brand as a global trademark for their future enterprises.

They two are dedicated to environmental causes and are looking to develop their charitable foundation as part of a ""progressive new role"".

The queen's announcement is her second on the royal crisis since Harry and Meghan's effective resignation on March 8.

""We have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution,"" the couple said at the time.

""We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America.""

Meghan then jetted back to Canada and is now their with their son Archie.

Their announcement caught the royal family by surprise and created a media sensation in both Britain and the wider world.

Their treatment by London's hard-hitting tabloid press and their personal future -- as well as questions about longstanding royal traditions -- have turned into daily front-page news.

Media reports said Harry would probably join Meghan and Archie on the west coast of Canada this coming week.

The Queen's final ruling on her grandson's future drew immediate comparisons to King Edward VIII's abdication in 1936.

Edward married the American socialite Wallis Simpson the following year and spent much his remaining life abroad.

""Harry is not King (he is sixth in line) but tonight this feels like his and Meghan's own abdication,"" ITV television's royal editor Chris Ship wrote on Twitter.

""This isn't 1936. But it's still pretty big."" The BBC's royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said Meghan must decide whether she intends to return and spend time in Britain in order to gain her UK citizenship.

The couple's future tax status also remains unclear.

""I think they are feeling their way into this as much as anyone else,"" Witchell said.

The couple will now formally be known as ""Harry, The Duke of Sussex"" and ""Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex"".

The Palace statement said the new arrangement ""will take effect in the Spring of 2020"".",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/britain-s-prince-harry-and-meghan-to-give-up-royal-titles-2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/britain-s-prince-harry-and-meghan-to-give-up-royal-titles.html
196,19-1-20,IT happens: Facebook sorry for Xi Jinping's name gaffe,"Facebook apologised Saturday for a distasteful mistranslation of Chinese President Xi Jinping's name from Burmese language posts during his much-touted visit to Myanmar.

His two-day visit to Myanmar's capital Naypyidaw was the first made by a Chinese leader in almost two decades.

But the historic moment was dimmed by the automatic translation feature on Myanmar's Facebook page -- which rendered Xi Jinping's name from Burmese into English as ""Mr Shithole"".

The error most notably appeared on the official Facebook page of Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

""Mr Shithole, President of China arrives at 4 PM,"" said a translated announcement posted earlier Saturday.

""President of China, Mr Shithole, signed a guest record of the house of representatives,"" it continued.

Facebook said it was sorry and blamed a technical glitch.

""We fixed a technical issue that caused incorrect translations from Burmese to English on Facebook. This should not have happened and we are taking steps to ensure it doesn't happen again. We sincerely apologise for the offense this has caused,"" a Facebook spokesperson said.

Facebook said it did not have Xi's name in its Burmese translations data. In cases such as those, Facebook's system guesses and replaces them with words that have similar syllables.

The company tested similar words in Burmese, and other words that start with ""xi"" and ""shi"" in Burmese, which use the same character, were also translated as ""shithole,"" Facebook said.

Tech-nascent Myanmar loves Facebook.

The platform is the most popular site for news, entertainment and chat -- many even see it as synonymous with the internet.

Politicians and government agencies also use it for official statements and announcements.

197,19-1-20,Articles of impeachment dangerous attack on Americans' right to choose president: WH lawyers,"US President Donald Trump's legal team has asked the Senate to reject the two articles of impeachment passed and submitted by the House of Representatives, calling it a dangerous attack on the right of the American people to freely choose their President.

The House of Representatives, controlled by the Democratic Party on Wednesday voted to send articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate, in a major development to remove him from office for his alleged abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

In a 228-193 vote, which was mainly on party lines, the House appointed seven impeachment managers who will argue the Democrats' case for removing Trump from the office of the US President.

The managers were named by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Responding to the charges filed against Trump, the legal team of the White House said the two articles are a brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the will of the people of the county.

""This is a brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election and interfere with the 2020 election-now just months away. The highly partisan and reckless obsession with impeaching the President began the day he was inaugurated and continues to this day,” the legal team said.

The 435-member House, where Democrats enjoy a majority, on December 18 charged Trump with ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" and impeached him for pressuring Ukraine to investigate former US Vice President Joe Biden, a potential Democratic rival for the current president in the 2020 elections.

The Senate, controlled by Trump's Republican Party, will decide whether to convict and remove him from office.

Trump on Friday appointed several nationally known lawyers to the team that will defend him in the proceedings, set to open Tuesday afternoon.

The WH's legal team said that the articles of impeachment are a dangerous attack on the right of the American people.

""The articles of impeachment submitted by the House of Representatives are a dangerous attack on the right of the American people to freely choose their President,"" it said.

The House, in its 111-page brief, said that Trumps conduct is the Framers' worst nightmare.

""The Senate should do its constitutional duty to address the ongoing threat that the President poses to the nation by convicting and removing him from office,"" the brief mentions.

The House Managers, appointed by House Speaker Pelosi, are Congressmen Adam Schiff, Jerrold Nadler, Zoe Lofgren, Hakeem Jeffries, Val Demings, Jason Crow and Sylvia Garcia.

""The case against the President of the US is simple, the facts are indisputable, and the evidence is overwhelming: President Trump abused the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in our elections for his own personal political gain, thereby jeopardising our national security, the integrity of our elections, and our democracy,” they alleged.

The managers alleged that Trump attempted to cover up his scheme by obstructing Congress's investigation into his misconduct.

“And when the President got caught, he tried to cover it up by obstructing the House's investigation into his misconduct. Senators must accept and fulfill the responsibility placed on them by the Framers of our Constitution and the Oaths they have just taken to do impartial justice. They must conduct a fair trial — fair to the President and fair to the American people,” the House managers said in a joint statement.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/articles-of-impeachment-dangerous-attack-on-americans--right-to-choose-president--wh-lawyers-2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/articles-of-impeachment-dangerous-attack-on-americans--right-to-choose-president--wh-lawyers.html
198,19-1-20,"Maduro says still in control, open to talks with US: report","Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said he was still comfortably in charge and open to direct negotiations with the US, in an interview published Saturday by The Washington Post.

The interview was Maduro's first with a major US outlet since February of last year, when he abruptly ejected all Univision journalists from Venezuela.

""If there's respect between governments, no matter how big the United States is, and if there's a dialogue, an exchange of truthful information, then be sure we can create a new type of relationship,"" Maduro told the Post.

The socialist leader said he was ready to hold talks with the US to negotiate an end to sanctions imposed by President Donald Trump intended to throttle the South American country's oil industry and force Maduro from power.

Maduro indicated that, if Trump were to lift sanctions, US oil companies could benefit immensely from Venezuela's oil.

""A relationship of respect and dialogue brings a win-win situation. A confrontational relationship brings a lose-lose situation. That's the formula,"" Maduro said.

The US, along with more than 50 other countries, recognizes Maduro's opposition rival Juan Guaido as the country's legitimate interim president.

Guaido has called for a new presidential election to be held, on the grounds that Maduro is an ""illegitimate"" president because his 2018 re-election was tainted by fraud.

Oil-rich Venezuela's economy is crumbling under Maduro's rule, and millions have fled the country.

But despite the humanitarian catastrophe and biting US sanctions, Maduro maintains power with the support of the military as well as Russia, China and Cuba.

While speaking to the Post, Maduro also expressed willingness to talk with Guaido, but appeared to dismiss his opponent's main demand that he step down.

Norway has mediated talks between Maduro's and Guaido's representatives, but the meetings broke down in August.

The US in early January threw its support behind negotiations in Venezuela, saying talks could establish a transitional government, lead to fresh elections and bring an end to the country's long-running political crisis.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/maduro-says-still-in-control--open-to-talks-with-us--report-2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/maduro-says-still-in-control--open-to-talks-with-us--report.html
199,19-1-20,US-China trade deal to reduce global uncertainty: IMF chief,"The newly signed US-China phase-one trade deal will reduce the uncertainty that has impeded global economic growth, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has said.

""It is a welcoming sign that we now have the phase-one deal, sign in terms of reducing some of the uncertainty,"" Georgieva said on Friday during an event hosted by Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based thinktank.

The IMF chief said her organisation is making some projections around the impact of more certainty, which will be shared on Monday as part of the World Economic Outlook to be released at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Xinhua reported.

The multilateral lender expects the trade deal to support the growth of China's gross domestic product (GDP), Georgieva said. ""It brings China in the parameters around the 6-per cent growth for 2020, rather than below,"" she said.

In October, Georgieva warned that trade tensions were ""taking a toll"" on global growth, at a time when the global economy was going through a ""synchronised slowdown"".

According to the IMF's earlier calculation, the cumulative effect of the US-China trade conflict, provided no actions taken, could mean a loss of 0.8 per cent of global GDP, or around $700 billion by 2020.

""What we are seeing now is that we've some reduction of this uncertainty, but it's not eliminated,"" Georgieva said, adding, ""we would see shrinkage of this negative impact, but not the eradication of this impact.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-china-trade-deal-to-reduce-global-uncertainty--imf-chief-2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/us-china-trade-deal-to-reduce-global-uncertainty--imf-chief.html
200,19-1-20,Founder of S Korean retail giant Lotte dies at 97,"The founder of South Korea's sprawling retail conglomerate Lotte Group has died at the age of 97, company officials said Sunday.

Shin Kyuk-ho's reputation was tarnished in his final years when the wheelchair-bound tycoon was convicted of professional malpractice and embezzling from the firm to benefit his relatives in late 2017.

He was sentenced to four years in prison but was allowed to stay out of jail on health grounds.

Born in the southern city of Ulsan, Shin stowed away on a ship to Japan at the age of 18 to seek his fortune and established Lotte to manufacture chewing gum in Tokyo soon after World War II.

The business later grew to include dozens of subsidiaries in the food, retail and hotel industries.

Lotte is one of the biggest of the South Korean family-run ""chaebol"" conglomerates that powered the country's decades of runaway economic growth -- but which are sometimes accused of murky business practices and overly-close ties with politicians.

Shin's two sons made headlines in 2015 with a bitter public fight for control of the group, each accusing the other of mismanagement, personality flaws, and of manipulating their frail and aged father.

His younger son Dong-bin eventually took over the reins as chairman but both he and Shin were accused of causing $72 million in damages to the group by renting out Lotte Cinema concessions at discounted rates to the founder's eldest daughter and mistress.

The daughter was jailed for two years, while the mistress -- a former model and actress 39 years Shin's junior, who came to his attention after winning a beauty pageant -- was given a suspended sentence.

Shin was also found to have disposed of company assets in violation of his responsibilities as chairman by the presiding judge in his 2017 trial. He had been suffering from dementia and other diseases of old age before his death, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/founder-of-s-korean-retail-giant-lotte-dies-at-97-2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/founder-of-s-korean-retail-giant-lotte-dies-at-97.html

206,19-1-20,Kohli becomes fastest to score 5000 runs as ODI skipper,"Indian skipper Virat Kohli on Sunday became the fastest to 5,000 runs in ODI cricket as captain of a side.

Kohli brought it up with a sumptuous shot past cover for four off Mitchell Starc during India's decisive third ODI against Australia at the Chinnaswamy stadium in Bengaluru.

Kohli is the fastest to the landmark by a fair margin. His predecessor MS Dhoni got the milestone in 127 innings while Kohli has done it in just 82.

Former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting is third on the list having got there in 131 innings while South African Graeme Smith is fourth on 135.

Former India captain and current BCCI president Sourav Ganguly completes the top five having got to the mark in 136 innings.

Kohli reached the mark during India's chase of a target of 287 set by Australia earlier in the day. The series is level 1-1 with India having won the second ODI in Rajkot on Friday. They are looking to avoid a second consecutive ODI series defeat at home to Australia.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kohli-becomes-fastest-to-score-5000-runs-as-odi-skipper-2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/kohli-becomes-fastest-to-score-5000-runs-as-odi-skipper.html
207,19-1-20,"Rohit, Kohli guide India to series win over Australia","Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli paced a tricky run chase with sublime knocks as India wrapped the series 2-1 with a comfortable seven-wicket victory in the decisive third ODI against Australia, here on Sunday.

Rohit (119 off 128) was due for a big score in the series and he delivered in the all-important game for his 29th ODI hundred.

India had a point to prove against Australia, having lost the home series to them in March last year. The 10-wicket drubbing in Mumbai did not deter India as they posted emphatic victories in Rajkot and here at the Chinnaswamy Stadium.

Following Rohit's fall, Kohli (89 off 91) anchored the chase as India cantered to a the win in 47.3 overs. Shreyas Iyer remained unbeaten on 44 off 35 balls.

The 137-run stand between Rohit and Kohli effectively won the game for India, who overhauled the 287-run target with 15 balls to spare.

Steve Smith's ninth ODI hundred helped Australia score 286 for nine after Aaron Finch opted to bat. Indian bowlers, led by Mohammad Shami (4/63), did well to limit Australia to under 300.

Opener Shikhar Dhawan did not come out to bat due to an injured shoulder and he did not need to, considering the way his team got the job done.

Rahul, who batted at three in Mumbai and five in Rajkot, came out to open alongside Rohit. He began with a beautiful punch on the off side but lasted only 27 balls after Australia took a successful LBW review off Ashton Agar.

Rohit scored bulk of runs in their 69-run opening stand.

Australia offered Rohit plenty of loose balls to free his arms as he ended up smashing six sixes and eight fours. His best hit came off Pat Cummins as he flicked the pacer for a spectacular six over midwicket.

Rohit also became the third fastest to 9000 ODI runs while Kohli became the fastest batsman to score 5000 runs as skipper.

Earlier, India bounced back in the last 10 overs, conceding just 63 runs for five wickets.

Smith (131 off 132) rose to the occasion but did not get much support from the other batsmen. Shami was brilliant in the death overs striking thrice. The other substantial knock in the Australian innings came from Marnus Labuschagne (54 off 64).

Australia won the toss for the third time in a row but unlike the last game in Rajkot, opted to bat.

Kohli decided to go in with the winning combination of the last game even though Rishabh Pant was available for selection.

It meant Rahul was the specialist wicketkeeper batsman for the second successive game.

Australia lost their in-form openers – David Warner (3) and Aaron Finch (19) -- rather early. Targeting the off-stump channel initially, Shami induced an outside edge from Warner's bat with an away going delivery.

Smith was responsible for Finch's run out as he called his skipper for a run before changing his mind. Finch, who is usually calm and composed, was furious and used cuss words while walking back to the dressing room.

By the first powerplay, Australia reached 56 for two with Smith and Labuschagne in the middle. It was once again evident why they love batting together.

They both had stitched a 96-run stand on Friday and batted in a similar fashion, rotating the strike regularly and picking up an odd boundary enroute to their 127-run partnership.

Labuschagne, who made 46 in his first ODI innings during the Rajkot game but got out at the wrong time, went on to score a half-century on this occasion.

Alongside Smith, he looked set for a big knock until a diving Kohli sent him back with a stunning catch at cover.

Jadeja, who got the ball to turn on a dry pitch, got his second wicket of the over when he had Mitchell Starc, who was sent ahead of Alex Carey, caught at deep midwicket.

Smith was going along nicely at the other end but the team needed another substantial contribution to go past 300. He shared 58 runs for the fifth wicket with Carey (35) but the latter departed when the innings needed a move on.

Having missed his century by two runs on Friday, Smith reached the milestone with a single towards third man. It was his first ODI hundred in three years.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rohit--kohli-guide-india-to-series-win-over-australia-2020-01-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/rohit--kohli-guide-india-to-series-win-over-australia.html
