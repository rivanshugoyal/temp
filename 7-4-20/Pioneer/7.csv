0,07-4-20,Masking India,"The aftermath of Corona will see many behavioural changes, few might be noticed more than better personal hygiene

Once the Coronavirus passes, there will be innumerable scientific studies about what happened and why some countries dealt with the viral epidemic so much better than others. Some of the questions will have answers to ones that many of us are curious about. Such as how Germany prevented the full impact of the virus when Italy, separated by just a tiny Switzerland in between, was devastated? How could China mysteriously keep the strange Wuhan fever from devastating other major Chinese cities such as Beijing and Shanghai? At the same time, New York City, halfway across the planet from Wuhan, is getting its healthcare system pulverised. Yet, other questions might have simpler answers, such as how come Japan and South Korea prevented the full force of the attack from hitting them (so far)? One answer being offered is the high prevalence of face masks and the overall discipline among the populace in these countries. Indeed, ever since the initial SARS epidemic hit the country 15 years ago, it did not spread to the Western world but ravaged East Asia. The aftermath of those events inspired not just Hollywood movies but also established among its citizens a healthy habit of wearing surgical masks or even simple face masks when they venture outside their homes. Initially, the World Health Organisation (WHO), which has covered itself with all the ignominy during this crisis, had said that only those who displayed symptoms or tested positive had to wear the masks. It had made it clear that healthy people need not wear them. But political leaders across the world were confused and global leaders increasingly ignored the directive of the WHO, which covered up China’s mishandling of the outbreak. Wearing masks seems to have become a standard piece of advice being given by Governments to the public. Rightly so, the Indian Government, too, issued an advisory this week, asking all citizens to use “hand-made reusable face cover” when they step outside. The fact appears that wearing masks may not completely prevent the disease but it can considerably reduce its spread. This is a good thing as nations struggle to contain the outbreak. Just like citizens in several east Asian countries have become accustomed to masks in public, so will the general citizenry in India and the rest of the world. And one need not have a top-notch N95 mask, a simple home-made mask, made out of old clothes, would suffice. Given the global shortage of personal protective equipment, we must reserve them first for our medical professionals, who are at the forefront of the COVID-19 infection. Agreed, home-made masks may not be as efficient as N95 but they can reduce transmission significantly.

The genie has left the bottle and we cannot completely stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus until scientists find a preventive vaccine. Nor can we be dependent on hypothetical studies about the hot weather preventing the spread or that those innoculated with the BCG vaccine are more “immune” to the disease. A vaccine might still be a year or more away at the very least and India should not forget the impact the last global pandemic had on its population a century ago. So until a preventive vaccine is developed, wear a mask, wash your hands and maintain general social distancing. This is the least that we can all do in this fight and save each other.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/masking-india-2020-04-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/masking-india.html
1,07-4-20,Domestic violence cases on the rise in lockdown,"



|

Social distancing and lockdown might have slowed down the spread of the deadly coronavirus but it has also led to a spurt in cases of domestic violence leading to death and suicides.

In Lakhimpur Kheri, Raju (19) of Khaleypurwa hamlet of Majhgai was shot dead by his kin early Monday morning on the suspicion that he was having an illicit relation with his aunt.

A case was registered and efforts were being made to nab the assailants.

Elsewhere in Azamgarh, Irshad of Khandwari hamlet of Saraimeer used to live with his wife Ameena and seven children. While staying at home during lockdown, Irshad suspected his wife of having an affair with a cousin.

On Sunday night, the couple had a heated argument over the issue and the verbal duel took a turn for the worse when Irshad stabbed her to death.

A case was registered in this connection and the accused was arrested.

Initially Irshad fled the scene but later had a change of heart and surrendered at the local police station.

In Ambedkarnagar, Ashok Jaiswal of Surhurpur area of Malipur, had a dispute with his wife over a trivial issue on Sunday night during which Ashok took out his gun and shot at her. Fortunately, the bullet missed the mark and the woman escaped unhurt.

Hearing the gunshot, the neighbours called the police and a case was registered and action was being initiated against the accused.

In Varanasi, Nitin Kumar (30) of Jaitpur used to work as a trolley driver but due to the lockdown. he failed to meet out his expenses. His wife, Rinki, with whom he was married a year back, left home and went to live with her parents. Depressed with this, Nitin hanged himself at his house. The neighbours found his body hanging on Monday morning.

In Fatehpur, a 19-year-old youth, pursuing an ITI course, and a 17-year-old girl studying in class 11 in Rajkiya Inter College, were found hanging from a tree in Malwa police station area.

The police said that it seemed that the two were in love but their families were against their affair. The police further said that due to the lockdown all institutions were closed indefinitely and hence they were unable to meet as a result of which they became depressed and ended their lives.

A case was registered and investigations were on.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/domestic-violence-cases-on-the-rise-in-lockdown.html
2,07-4-20,ASP among cops attacked for enforcing lockdown,"



|

In yet another attack on the men in uniform for enforcing lockdown to prevent spread of coronavirus, several persons, including an IPS officer, were injured when they were targeted by a 400-strong crowd on the outskirts of Bareilly on Monday.

The Bareilly police were informed that a large group of people had congregated and were playing cards at Karampur Chaudhary village in Izzatnagar police station area on Monday afternoon. Subsequently, a police team led by ASP Abhishek Varma rushed to the village to enforce lockdown by sending the violators to their homes.

However, things turned murky when a 400-strong mob targeted the outnumbered police team and pelted stones in which Varma was injured in the leg along with other cops.

Later, additional force was rushed to the spot and it used force and pushed the residents to their homes.

Over three dozen troublemakers were detained and a heavy police force was deployed in the area to avert any untoward incident.

Meanwhile in Bahraich, two Nepalese citizens who pedalled their way to Bahraich from Chandigarh to go to Nepal violating lockdown, were taken into custody by the police and quarantined on Monday.

The youths used to work at an eatery in Chandigarh and were left with no money after the lockdown was clamped in the city. They told the police that to get out of the precarious situation, they rode a cycle for seven days to reach Rupaidiha border in Bahraich to go to their homes at Dang district of Nepal.

The police on their part sent them to Gurgutta quarantine camp for a medical scan and isolation.

Meanwhile in Meerut, three persons were arrested by the police for spreading fake news about a Muslim man spitting to spread coronavirus infection.

Arun Kumar, Manoj and Tarun Gurjar wanted to spread hatred against the minority community and hence cooked up a story.

A police team, while probing a different case in Lakhvaya village, were told that a local, Naimuddin, went to the shop of a Hindu trader and spit there to spread the virus. After investigation, the three Hindu youths were detained and during quizzing it surfaced that they fabricated the story to spread tension.

A case was registered against them at Kankankhera police station and they were arrested under sections 153B (offence at place of worship), 186 (obstructing public servant from duty), 193 (punishment for false evidence), 270 (malignant act to spread disease) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) among others.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/asp-among-cops-attacked-for-enforcing-lockdown.html
3,07-4-20,Agra cops get self tonsured to fight corona,"



|

In a bizarre way to fight coronavirus, over 50 police personnel in Agra got themselves tonsured, pledging to not grow hair till the country got over the threat of the deadly virus.

As per reports, a video clip went viral on social media in which 50 odd cops were shown marching in the area to ensure lockdown in Agra. But what surprised everyone was that every cop had shaven his head.

On being probed by the local media, it surfaced that the band of bald cops was posted in Fatehpur Sikri police station of Agra.

Station House Officer of Fatehpur Sikri, Bhupendra Baliyan, said that the police personnel had shaved their heads to fight coronavirus with the pledge that they would keep themselves that way till the pandemic was over.

The SHO felt that the action of the cops helped them in fighting the virus as there were more chances of carrying virus in the hair as compared to other parts of body, which were mostly covered by clothes.

Doctors said that a person exposed to the virus could change clothes, wash his hands, but it would be very difficult to wash hair frequently so turning bald would help in checking the spread of the coronavirus or getting infected.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/agra-cops-get-self-tonsured-to-fight-corona.html
4,07-4-20,CM Yogi inaugurates disaster control centre,"

Gearing up for a bigger battle, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath inaugurated the Integrated Disaster Control Centre (IDCC) at the office of Relief Commissioner at Lal Bahadur Shastri Bhawan on Monday and hoped that it would act as the backbone for relief work and in exigencies, would play a big role in providing necessary facilities and benefits of governance schemes.

Yogi said that in view of the lockdown, all district magistrates should deploy a nodal officer at the control rooms in their respective districts and ensure that it operated 24 hours a day.

“Relief work should be run in a speedy manner through the control room. It should be better used to deliver information on quarantine wards, institutional quarantine, isolation wards, Level-1, Level-2, Level-3 COVID-19 hospitals to the common man and deliver food packets to the needy,” he said.

The chief minister said that the IDCC had a big role in providing necessary facilities and benefits of government schemes to the needy without discrimination in the war against coronavirus.

He also lauded the Revenue department for connecting all districts in a short time through the Integrated Control Room.

Yogi expressed confidence that the control room would prove helpful in speedy delivery of relief in the state. It could also be used to provide relief to the needy at a fast pace in other situations of disaster, he added.

Yogi said that every information should be compiled in the control room, made available to the right person and resolution of the problems should be ensured.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-yogi-inaugurates-disaster-control-centre.html
5,07-4-20,"UP units ready to manufacture ventilators, PPE, masks","



|

To bolster ‘Brand UP’, the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) department is gearing up to manufacture masks, personal protection equipment (PPE) and ventilators, whose demand has spiked in view of the coronavirus pandemic.

Principal Secretary (MSME) Navneet Sehgal said that the production of ventilators in a Noida-based unit could start in a day or two, while a dozen units had the expertise to manufacture PPE.

“Within days, these units will send the sample product for testing to Coimbatore-based lab and production could start once we get an approval from there. It may take a week’s time,” Sehgal told media persons in Lucknow on Monday.

Samples of body coveralls — surgical gowns and drapes — have to be sent to South India Textile Research Association (SITRA) in Coimbatore for testing and certification, as per specifications.

There is a shortage of vital equipment needed to protect healthcare staff from getting infected as the number of COVID-19 patients rise. The certification from SITRA is mandatory for allowing local units to start the production of PPE.

“The first sample model of PPE is ready and the consignment will be sent by air to the Coimbatore-based institute by tomorrow (Tuesday). We are expecting certification in the next three or four days,” the principal secretary said

Sehgal said that small-scale units were manufacturing cotton-based masks and there was no scarcity of masks.

“We have 35 units manufacturing masks and they make good quality masks and have almost filled the gap of demand and supply,” he said.

Recently, at a meeting, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had asked the MSME department to manufacture masks to bolster Brand UP.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-units-ready-to-manufacture-ventilators--ppe--masks.html
6,07-4-20,Easing lockdown subject to improvement in UP situation,"



|

Hinting that lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus could be extended in Uttar Pradesh after April 14, a top government officer said that it was premature to talk about lifting it when fresh coronavirus positive cases were being reported from across the state and officials were still looking at the trail of Tablighi Jamaat members responsible for the recent spike in fresh cases.

Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi told news persons in Lucknow on Monday, “The number of positives cases of COVID-19 is increasing by the day and hence it cannot be said for sure that the lockdown can be lifted after April 14. It is premature to comment on this now.”

Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced a 21-day lockdown that is to end on April 14. During his interaction with chief ministers last week, the prime minister had suggested that the lockdown could be lifted in a phased manner. Acting on this advise, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had conferred with officials, asking them to look at ways and means to lift the lockdown in a phased manner so that stranded migrant workers could reach their homes without a chaos on the highways.

Awasthi told news persons that the government was reviewing the situation closely. “The religious leaders too have suggested that lockdown is the only way to prevent the virus from spreading and hence if required it can be extended,” he said.

The senior officer said that Tablighi Jamaat members were responsible for the sudden and steep spike in the number of coronavirus positive cases in recent days.

“Of the total 305 cases reported from the state on Monday, 159 are members of Tablighi Jamaat and even in the past 24 hours, 27 people tested positive out of which 21 are from the Jamaat,” he said.

“This is a big concern for the government. We have identified around 1,600 people of Tablighi Jamaat till now and quarantined 1,200 of them. Now the administration is tracing the people who came in contact with them besides others who formed the chain. This mapping and tracing will take some time for which we are going to lock down some select areas,” he added.

Asked if UP would follow the Centre’s move to curtail 30 percent salary and two years Local Area Development fund of MPs and ministers, Awasthi said that the state government was yet to take a decision in this regard yet.

Meanwhile, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ordered the setting up of 14 more COVID-19 test centres at medical colleges and sample collection centres in districts where there is no testing facility. Money collected from Corona Fund will be used in strengthening these centres. Districts where there is no testing centre at district hospitals, will facilitate collection of samples which will be sent for test to nearby testing centres.

With the new testing facilities becoming operational, the number of testing labs in the state will go up to 24. At present there are eight functional labs and two others, one at Jhansi and the other at Prayagraj, are expected to be augmented shortly.

Opposition leaders have been demanding more testing facilities so that virus infected people can be tested at the earliest.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/easing-lockdown-subject-to-improvement-in-up-situation.html
7,07-4-20,"Don’t panic, stay at home: CM to people","Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has appealed to the deniens of the capital city not to venture out of their homes and respect the lockdown which has been imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19 till April 14.

The CMO in a twitter post said, “People need not panic. It is in a contained area of #Bhubaneswar with known contact. Sincere appeal please do not venture out and respect lockdown. Police will take very tough action on violators.”

The CMO issued such a message after the Health and Family Welfare Department announced that 18 people were tested positive to COVID-19 on Sunday itself. Of the 39 COVID-19 cases, as many as 32 come from the state capital.

As Bhubaneswar’s COVID-19 status was revealed on Sunday, a large number of people called up travel agencies seeking to hire private cabs to leave the state capital for their villages, a top police officer said on condition of anonymity.

The official said the CMO’s “sincere appeal” came in wake of the people’s attempt to flee from the city, which is described as the hot spot of COVID-19.

Seeking cooperation of the people, the CMO also made it clear that there will be zero tolerance on violation of social distancing. “Any violation of social distancing will attract criminal action. The concerned shop or market will be sealed. Earnest request to cooperate in our fight against the coronavirus,” the CMO said in another twitter post.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/don---t-panic--stay-at-home--cm-to-people.html
8,07-4-20,The Bhilwara model,"Aggressive door-to-door screening and testing have put the epicentre town of Rajasthan on the road to recovery

Much has been written about how China stifled the Wuhan contagion by aggressive containment and sealing the city so that nobody could leave it, thereby confining and choking the virus in the hotspot. Of course, one wonders why China could not have shown the same military aggression when cases started multiplying, under reported them instead, turned down world virologists and WHO and erred on saving the world a disaster. A bigger success story is of Taiwan next to China, which has had positive cases but deaths in single numbers. That’s because it adopted an aggressive protocol since the last week of January, with senior Government officials travelling to China, inspectors keeping a watch on board flights, the Government suspending flights from China and then tracing, isolating, testing, treating and re-testing each citizen with a travel history, monitoring his/her every move. This it topped up with an emergency protocol should there be a flood at anytime. This is perhaps the model that Bhilwara has adapted and applied rigorously to contain the spiral of the disease. Even as the number of Covid-19 cases in India are leaping through the charts, there have been no new cases at Bhilwara, although it was a hotspot with cases spreading from a hospital. The last Coronavirus case in Bhilwara was reported on March 30 when the total positive cases in the district were 26 with two deaths. It is difficult to believe that what was once considered the epicentre of Rajasthan has turned around an intractable situation. The Bhilwara administration acted fast, enforcing a curfew and sealing district borders on March 20, even before the national lockdown. After quarantining the entire hospital staff and patients, it went for aggressive testing, conducting a door-to-door screening of its 28 lakh population to detect any signs of community transmission. It allowed bare essential shops and medical stores to stay open for limited hours while the administration home-delivered ration, fruit and vegetable supplies through local booths. The administration is now contemplating home-delivering milk and medicines so that nobody steps out at all and even cancelling curfew passes. The police are enforcing the curfew through regular patrols. The confinement has minimised the possibility of spread as nobody has been allowed to even walk the streets, leave aside crowding markets. Although it has tested 300 to 400 samples every day, the authorities are planning to ramp that up to 4,000 over the next few days. Not only that, since the samples were being sent to Jaipur, which is about 250 km away and identification took time, the town will have its own testing set-up this weekend. In effect, the entire district is under watch, cut off from the world. And till it is an all-clear, it will continue the rigour.

Perhaps, this is what the Health Ministry is considering as trends clearly establish that 80 per cent of the infection has occurred in 62 districts. And while the lockdown may be eased in low-density parts of the country, the hotspots could be subjected to an aggressive testing and containment protocol along what has come to be known as the Bhilwara model. In fact, India’s fight against COVID-19 can only be tackled if it is decentralised down to the unit level and policy-makers let specific geographies and local dynamics decide how things could work best at a cluster. The non-pharmaceutical intervention is the best way to contain the crisis given India’s non-existent health infrastructure and Bhilwara has shown how to bring the virus out of hiding. The faster we do it, the easier it will be for us to get back on the road to recovery and get the economy going.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-bhilwara-model-2020-04-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/the-bhilwara-model.html
9,07-4-20,Serve up a fresh NFSA,"The 80 crore people the Govt currently targets for giving subsidised foodgrain under the Food Security Act includes millions of higher-income beneficiaries who don’t deserve it

The Finance Minister, Ms Nirmala Sitharaman, announced a Rs 1,70,000 crore package under the PM-Gareeb Kalyan Scheme (PMGKS) to address the plight of tens of millions of workers in the “informal” sector affected by CoviD-19, on March 26. The most crucial component of this package was giving five kg of rice/wheat per person per month for “free” to around 80 crore people through the public distribution system (PDS), plus one kg of preferred and region-specific choice of pulse per household for three months. To understand the full implications of the relief — estimated to cost about Rs 40,000 crore — let us capture the basics of the food security system in India. Under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, a quota of five kg of cereals per person per month is made available at a subsidised price of Rs 3 per kg rice, Rs 2 per kg wheat and Rs 1 per kg coarse cereals to 67 per cent of India’s population or over 80 crore people. It is a matter of shame that even decades after Independence, when the NFSA was enacted, our rulers still felt that more than 80 crore people were so poor that they needed to be given food at a throwaway price. The belief as embedded in this law (in fact, the prices were mentioned in the Act and were to remain valid for a period of three years from the date of its commencement) also mocks at the official claim that India has achieved big success in bringing a large number of people above the poverty line; that the number of poor people is just about 25 per cent of the population

Be that as it may, the Government continues to believe that the interest of the poor can be fully safeguarded by not allowing any increase in the price. This is abundantly clear from a statement by Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Ram Vilas Paswan in 2017 that, “The Government will not affect any increase in issue prices for foodgrains under the NFSA.” This was made at a time when even the Act didn’t prevent a hike. True to that commitment, till date, the price remains unchanged. But has this safeguarded the poor? The answer lies in taking cognisance of a vital fact which often gets ignored.

The supplies under NFSA barely cover 50 per cent of a person’s requirement which is 10 kg per month, as estimated by the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO). This forces him/her to buy the balance quantity from the market at a much higher price. Being linked to the cost of procurement, handling and distribution (in case of rice, at least Rs 35 per kg), the market price is more than 10 times the subsidised price.

As a consequence, whatever benefit the Government gives by keeping the price low on sale of certain quantity, that is more than offset by their having to pay many times more on purchase of the balance five kg from the market. Thus, for buying 10 kg — being his/her requirement for a month — they have to spend a total of Rs 190. The effective price paid by him/her is Rs 19 per kg instead of Rs 3 per kg — a sense one gets by a plain reading of the NFSA. The underprivileged are also getting hit in another way.

All along, the Government has taken recourse to increasing the Minimum Support Price (MSP). While this is meant to incentivise farmers produce more, this leads to a collateral damage. The increase in MSP leads to increase in the cost of supplying food, which triggers a hike in the market price, implying that the poor will need to spend more on the quantity bought from the market. The decision of the Government to give five kg of rice/wheat per person per month to 80 crore people for “free” over and above the five kg they are already getting under the NFSA can help remove this anomaly. Having got all of 10 kg at an effective price of Rs 1.5 per kg, s/he need not buy any from the market. But this is a mere coincidence (an offshoot of the Corona-crisis); it was never intended as a conscious policy move. In any case, the additional five kg for free is available for three months only. Thereafter, it will be back to square one.

Can the Government consider giving 10 kg per person per month at the subsidised price of Rs 1/2/3 per kg? In case it is given to all the 80 crore people, this will be at a huge cost, as then the food subsidy (excess of the cost of supply over the issue price multiplied by total quantum of sale under the NFSA) will increase sharply from an already whopping Rs 2,19,000 crore during 2019-20 to Rs 2,53,000 crore expected during 2020-21. This is unconscionable.

How can the food requirement of the needy be met in full without entailing additional burden on the exchequer? How can the two objectives be reconciled? What is the way forward?

To get there, we need to recognise that the 80 crore people — the Government currently targets for giving subsidised foodgrain under the NFSA — includes millions of higher-income beneficiaries who don’t deserve it. This was duly accepted in early 2015, when a committee headed by Shanta Kumar, senior BJP leader, recommended a reduction in coverage under the NFSA from the existing 67 per cent to 40 per cent, restricting the eligibility of subsidised food at Rs 1/2/3 per kg only to the poorest of the poor under the Antyodaya Anna Yojna (AAY), plus increasing their entitlement from five kg to seven kg per month and making the rest pay 50 per cent of the MSP paid to farmers. Reduction in coverage by 27 per cent can remove 35 crore people from the scheme. That will release 175 crore kg per month, which can be used to give an additional five kg per month to those under the AAY. The number of families under the AAY being 2.5 crore or 12.5 crore people (five per family), five kg extra for each will consume 62.5 crore kg per month. Even after this, there will be a monthly surplus of 112.5 crore kg or 1.125 million tonnes. In other words, the Government need not undertake distribution of 13.5 million tonnes of grain annually, which will result in corresponding saving in subsidy or Rs 43,000 crore annually.

Likewise, an increase in issue price to beneficiaries, other than those under the AAY or 32.5 crore from the existing Rs 3 per kg to 50 per cent of the MSP paid to farmers or Rs 14 per kg rice, can help reduce subsidy. The savings will be about Rs 1,800 crore per month or Rs 21,600 crore per annum.

Yet, the Government has not acted upon the recommendations of the panel. Meanwhile, the country continues to be saddled with millions of under-fed poor; unsustainable high subsidy; inefficiency in handling and distribution by State agencies; misuse of subsidy and subsidised food being cornered by millions of undeserving people.

These maladies are germane to the existing dispensation of controls on almost every aspect of the food supply chain. When subsidised food is available at a fraction of the market price, there is huge incentive for dubious operators to siphon off. When handling and distribution cost (besides MSP paid to farmers) is reimbursed to agencies on “actual” as food subsidy, inefficiency and inflated cost claims (including bogus) are inevitable. When millions of the rich/better-off are also made beneficiaries under the NFSA, subsidy is bound to balloon.

The implementation of the committee’s package could have made some headway in addressing these maladies but still it would be far from eliminating them as it does not alter the fundamentals of the existing dispensation.

To achieve drastic outcome in terms of higher efficiency and lower cost in handling operations, prevention of misuse and saving in subsidy, there is an urgent need to remove all controls, allow participation of private entities in procurement and distribution and make way for competitive markets. The subsidy should be restricted only to the poor (about 25 per cent of the population) and given directly to the beneficiaries using the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mechanism.

Will the Corona crisis wake the political class from its deep slumber into implementing this reform? Only time will tell.

10,07-4-20,An opportunity taken in a crisis,"Dictatorship was clearly where Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán was heading — and now he has arrived with the passage of an ‘emergency’ law

Hello, dictator!” said Jean-Claude Juncker cheerily to Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, at a European Union summit a couple of years ago. The president of the European Commission was only joking, of course, but it was gallows humour. Dictatorship was clearly where Orbán was heading — and now he has arrived.

Recently the Hungarian Parliament passed a new law, allegedly to deal with the Coronavirus crisis. The law declares a state of emergency and allows Orbán to rule by decree for the duration of the crisis — but it doesn’t say when that state of emergency will end. That will be decided by the man who has just been granted supreme power. Orbán’s spokesman, Zoltán Kovács, helpfully explained, “Just as in wartime, a state of emergency could extend until the end of hostilities. Today we confront not a military power but are in a war-like state to defend our people against a pandemic the likes of which we have not seen in a century.”

“Never waste the opportunity offered by a good crisis,” as Machiavelli allegedly said 500 years ago. So is what we are seeing in Hungary now the tip of the iceberg? Will governments in other democracies whose leaders have dictatorial ambitions use the Coronavirus crisis as an excuse to give themselves absolute powers? Will Rodrigo Duterte take “emergency” powers to get around the one-term Filipino presidential limit that obliges him to quit in two years’ time? Will Narendra Modi copy Indira Gandhi’s 1975 “Emergency” and set up as the “temporary dictator” of India? Will Recep Tayyip Erdogan destroy what remains of Turkey’s democracy to save himself if his popularity declines further? For that matter, will Donald Trump use the great wave of American Coronavirus deaths in the coming months and an alleged threat of mass disorder as an excuse for postponing the November election, especially if his prospects for re-election are not looking bright? It’s a toss-up with Duterte, who is responsible for so many murders that he can never safely retire. But for the rest, the answer is almost certainly “no.”

Both Modi and Erdogan have created solid blocs of religious supporters, who practically guarantee their political futures (at great cost to the unity and future prospects of their respective countries). They don’t need to destroy democracy to survive. As for Trump, whose “base” is too narrow to assure him a political victory in November if other elements of his victorious 2016 coalition defect, he doesn’t really have the option of cancelling the election. Americans’ loyalty to their ancient Constitution is still too strong to let that happen. In any case, Trump probably won’t need such extreme measures to hold on to office. He is already re-writing the script so that his heavy responsibility for the silent carnage that awaits the country is erased in the public’s mind by his last-minute swerve towards a strong policy of social distancing that averts a much greater loss of life. Hail the saviour!

Which leaves us, then, with the question of why Orbán is going to such political extremes when he already had all the power he could possibly want. He has already fiddled with the Constitution so that his party can win a two-thirds majority of the seats in Parliament on only 44 per cent of the votes.

Hungary is effectively a one-party State and the media and the judges both serve Orbán’s Fidesz Party, not the general public. He even had a “state of emergency” in place already, declared in 2016 during the great refugee flood of that year (though none of the refugees came to Hungary) and he has never rescinded it. True, he can now hand out five-year prison sentences to Hungarians who spread “false” information but the courts were already giving his critics multiple shorter sentences if they got too noisy. Why go to this extra trouble when it might even tip the European Union into expelling Hungary as a non-democratic country (although I wouldn’t hold my breath on that one)?

I once spent a day with Orbán in Budapest, when we were both much younger men. He was a student leader who had just got famous for defying the Communists with a fiery nationalist speech and I had spent the summer in the Soviet Union interviewing the emerging democratic Opposition. (We were introduced by Hungarian-born philanthropist George Soros, then Orbán’s mentor and later a prime target of his rabid anti-Semitism.) We had much to talk about and I enjoyed his company. What struck me, though, was that he really thought like a lawyer. Maybe a radical one and certainly later a corrupt one. But a lawyer by character and by training. So maybe what he’s doing now is just tidying up the law. Hungary was already a dictatorship in practice. Now it’s also one in theory.

11,07-4-20,Hardly an elevation for a former CJI,"Both ‘Mr Gogoi’ and ‘Justice Gogoi’ have not broken any law. Still, perhaps Justice Gogoi may have dropped the ball on the way to the Rajya Sabha and allowed the common man to question the independence of the judiciary

Former Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi demitted office in November 2019 and four months later he was nominated by the President under Article 80 of the Constitution as a Member of Parliament (MP). His nomination has raised many questions. Why did Gogoi accept the nomination to the Rajya Sabha (RS)? Did he not decide cases where the Government was a party? Is the judiciary independent? Only an independent judiciary can direct the Government to enforce rights and one of the most important objects of the Constitution is to secure justice to all its citizens.

The State comprises three organs — the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. It is envisaged that the State and the executive are to be separate from the judiciary which is independent. This independence and impartiality is essential for the Supreme Court and the High Courts to direct the Government to enforce the fundamental rights of citizens and order the Government and its functionaries to respect individual liberties.

Liberty, fundamental rights and freedom are essential for existence and the Constitution recognises this. It vests unfettered and independent jurisdiction on the Supreme Court to pass any order in public interest to do complete justice. Independence of the judiciary is an integral part of the Constitution as is expected of a sovereign democratic nation. The power of the apex court to direct the Government is essential in our democracy, considering the immense powers that the Government has. Justice Khanna says that independence of the judiciary is also linked to essential human rights and civil liberties and the rights are needed because while you want to enable the Government to control the governed, you also want it to control itself.

However, the Government is the biggest litigator in India and about 37 million cases are pending in the District Courts and High Courts. As on March 1, over 60,469 cases were pending in the apex court and according to the Department of Justice in 2017, approximately 46 per cent of the total pending cases in courts pertained to the Government.

The courts are bound to decide millions of cases where the Government is a party. The independence of the judiciary is perceived by the common man by the conduct of the judges. The confidence of the citizens will be diminished if the judges are seen too close to the executive and it is the responsibility of the judges and lawyers to ensure that this trust is not lost.

The CJI’s Office is the highest and most respected positions in the judiciary. The importance of this position can be appreciated by the fact that on January 26, 1950, the Chief Justice MK Kania administered the oath of office to Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India. Later, in 1969 Chief Justice M Hidayatullah was briefly made the President.

In the higher courts when a lawyer becomes a judge, they are referred to as “justice” after that. The judge’s oath is to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution and duly, faithfully and to the best of their ability, knowledge and judgment perform the duties of the office without fear or favour, affection or ill-will uphold the Constitution and laws. Disrespect to a judge or court is contempt of court and punishable to protect the dignity of the institution of justice. Under the Constitution, a judge of the Supreme Court is prohibited from practising in any court after retirement. The first Law Commission headed by India’s first Attorney-General, MC Setalvad presented a report on Judicial Reforms in 1958. It was recommended that a Supreme Court judge should be totally barred from accepting any employment under the Union or a State after retirement other than employment as an ad hoc judge of the Supreme Court under Article 128 of the Constitution. The Law Commission also recommended that judges of the Supreme Court should not start chamber practice after retirement. These recommendations have not been implemented. Other Constitutional functionaries such as the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India and members of the Union Public Service Commission are barred from post-retirement employment with the Government. Bureaucrats in the Administrative Services can take up commercial employment after one year, post-retirement, also known as the cooling-off period. In 2014 Chief Justice R M Lodha at his retirement suggested a two-year cooling-off period for Supreme Court Judges after retirement.

Setalvad’s recommendation to ban all post-retirement employment makes good sense for the preservation of the independence and dignity of the judiciary. However, it may not be fair to prohibit a retired judge from working. United States (US) Federal judges are appointed for life or up to when they choose to quit. The Supreme Court judges in the United Kingdom (UK) retire at the age of 70. Considering that the Government is the largest litigant with millions of cases being heard, a cooling-off period of two to three years is called for in the interest of justice.

In Justice Gogoi’s defence, by accepting the RS nomination he has not broken any law. And this is not the first time that a retired judge has been elected to the Upper House. Further, being a MP may not be an employment with the Government.

The experience and skills of retired judges in India are a great resource and should not be wasted. Perhaps the questions arising from the issued raised by the nomination of Justice Gogoi will encourage lawmakers to seriously think about the independence of the judiciary and the enhancement of the retirement age of judges from 65 years to 70 years, with a ban on all post-retirement employment. Our judges are extraordinarily hard-working and highly experienced and this wealth of knowledge would be put to productive use if they are allowed to continue for a few more years beyond the age of 65.

In a recent interview, Justice Gogoi said that he could be addressed either as “Justice Gogoi” or “Mr Gogoi.”

Justice Gogoi as CJI held a high position in the order of precedence till November 2019. Now as an MP, he is about 10 to 15 places down in the hierarchy. As the CJI he was protected by the Constitution and respected in accordance with the finest traditions at the Bar. The Judiciary and the Bar consider the CJI to be the head of the family. The Bar, always holds retired justices in high esteem. Coming down the protocol ladder and getting jeered during his oath-taking ceremony in the RS may have hurt the institution of justice. Both Mr Gogoi and Justice Gogoi have not broken any law. Still, perhaps Justice Gogoi may have dropped the ball on the way to the RS and allowed the common man to question the independence of the judiciary.

12,07-4-20,BJP pursuing political agenda: Akhilesh,"



|

Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Monday slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party, alleging that the ruling party was pursuing its political agenda in the cover of completing 40 years of its foundation even as the whole country was suffering from the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic.

“People across the country have closed their ranks in the hour of crisis and are following the directions of the government by remaining indoors during the lockdown period while the BJP has flouted all democratic conventions and is busy celebrating its 40th Foundation Day,” the SP chief said here on Monday.

“The BJP leadership cannot see beyond their nose. The nation is facing the worst ever challenge from the pandemic but the BJP cannot see beyond the next election and is busy in mobilising and influencing the voters through letter of thanks,” the SP chief said, and added, “The letter of thanks should have been issued by the government as the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh have no locus standi to issue the letter of thanks to the people,” he said.

Akhilesh Yadav alleged that the BJP was also cheating the people in providing relief.

“The common people and non-governmental organisations are donating relief material and the same is being distributed by the BJP and the RSS, claiming it as their effort,” the SP chief charged.

He said the people in rural areas were starving and discrimination was rampant in the distribution of relief material.

Akhilesh charged that the SP workers taking food items and relief material for the poor and hungry people were being stopped at various places in the state. “This is not a healthy tradition in a democracy,” he said.

The SP chief said that owing to the lockdown, people from other states had also come to their villages in large numbers. “Neither these workers have work nor do they have money for food. Their families are not able to have one square meal a day. Many youngsters have lost their jobs,” he pointed out.

Akhilesh Yadav alleged that during the BJP rule, unemployment had grown by leaps and bounds due to demonetisation and goods and services tax (GST). He said the lockdown had further aggravated the situation and the government should immediately make arrangements to make relief or aid reach the farmers, the poor people and the youth.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-pursuing-political-agenda--akhilesh.html

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra stressed the urgent need for carrying out more tests of COVID-19 suspects, saying that only early detection could help in checking the spread of the deadly coronavirus.

“To stop the spread of coronavirus, the only way is to go for maximum tests so that we can treat the affected. ‘Do maximum tests, treat the patients’, should be our pledge to fight the pandemic,” Priyanka tweeted on Monday.

She also asked Congress workers to exert pressure on the local authorities to conduct more tests to check the spread of the virus.

After Priyanka exhorted partymen to step out of their homes and help the authorities in fighting the pandemic, UP Congress started ‘Sanjhi Kitchen’ in several districts of the state.

On Sunday, a ‘Sanjhi Kitchen’ to feed the needy was started at Congress headquarters in Mall Avenue.

Congress spokesman Brijendra Singh, after starting the kitchen in Lucknow, said that similar services were started in the party’s district offices in Varanasi, Fatehpur, Gautam Buddha Nagar (Noida), Bulandshahr, Hapur, Ghaziabad and over a dozen other districts on Monday.

Singh said that directions had been issued to all district and city chiefs of the party to make necessary arrangements so that no one in the state slept hungry. He said that besides food packets, party workers were distributing sanitisers and masks to prevent the spread of coronavirus.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/priyanka-advocates-increased-testing-of-covid-19-suspects.html
14,07-4-20,BJP removes ‘shooting’ Mahila Morcha leader; FIR lodged against her,"





|

An overzealous Bharatiya Janata Party’s Mahila Morcha leader had to pay a price for firing from a revolver in the air after lighting diyas for nine minutes on the call of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday night when a case was registered against her in Balrampur.

Besides. the BJP removed her from the organisational post and suspended her from the outfit.

As per reports, after lighting diyas at her home in Balrampur district, Mahila Morcha district chief Manju Tiwari fired in the air from her husband OP Tiwari’s licensed revolver.

The video of the incident was soon uploaded on her Facebook account with the caption ‘Firing to chase away coronavirus after lighting the diyas’. Soon the video went viral on various social media platforms causing embarrassment to the BJP leadership.

Though Manju Tiwari was quick to tender an apology, the Balrampur police, ostensibly under direction from the top, registered a case under relevant sections against the leader and the licence of her husband’s gun could be cancelled.

Her unconditional apology and assurance not to repeat such act in future failed to get her any respite from disciplinary action from the ruling BJP and she was removed from the post of Mahila Morcha district chief and also suspended.

Meanwhile, UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu questioned the BJP government over the incident.

“BJP leaders and workers are violating all norms during lockdown. I also want to know what action will the chief minister take against the party leader, who made a mockery of the prime minister’s call,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-removes----shooting----mahila-morcha-leader--fir-lodged-against-her.html

18,07-4-20,"No takers, W Odisha veg growers in dire straits","It appears farmers never have secured future. Natural calamities are their permanent enemies. And this time, it is Coronavirus.

Just a few days back, farmers were not getting adequate fertilizers all over the Hirakud command area for second and third doses in Dalua crop.

However, after the interference of the RDC (ND) the problem has been solved. And now non-selling of vegetables, another prime source of income for the farmers of the non irrigated areas, added to their miseries. And they are sure to incur huge losses all over western Odisha.

Local markets apart, businessmen from Cuttack, Bhubaneswar, Rourkela and neighbouring Chhattisgarh purchase vegetables from here and mainly from Sambalpur and Bargarh districts. But due to lockdown, these traders are not coming here.

“Even if vegetable transportation is not debarred from lockdown, but traders and the vehicle owners are not taking the risk of travelling long distances,” farmers from Bargarh said.

“We normally sell vegetables of different varieties at an average whole sale price of Rs 12 to Rs 16 per kg. But we are now unable to sell it even at Rs 4 or Rs 5,”said Prafulla Pradhan, a farmer of Ganiapali village of Barghar district under Padmapur sub division. “There are no takers for all varieties of vegetables like brinjal, tomato, ladies finger, cucumber, chilies, bitter gourd and also water melon,” added Pradhan.

""Local market is also equally disadvantageous for us as consumers are not coming both out of fear and awareness for Corona. Hence, we have no market locally or outside,” said another farmer V Ramesh Babu of Gaurtikra village.

20,07-4-20,Fight the virus in tandem at multiple levels,"Movies are an expression of the real society in which we reside. That is why the movie ‘Contagion’ and COVID-19 scenario across the world are so pertinently and peculiarly similar. The novel corona virus was first identified in Wuhan in China in 2019 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as on March 11, 2020.

Amid the chaos and uncertainty that prevails today, let us look at the two great economies of our times, China and India, with almost equal population and yet when one is recovering speedily, the other still struggles with the pandemic. Unlike the Chinese economy, the Indian economy is not so equipped to fight and get away with the serious COVID-19 due to several bottlenecks like poor healthcare infrastructure, prevalence of blind beliefs and superstitions, lack of awareness among the people (though thanks to the mobile phones its less now), institutional support to track and help each and every citizen and above all, the panic over the lockdown and the fear of getting dead with hunger rather than the virus.

In line with the neoclassical growth models which highlighted on the importance of technological advancement as a fuel for the growth process, the Chinese economy no doubt adhered to the same yet with a spotlight on the socialist market economy. When it comes to the Chinese people the Government has always focused for their betterment – a truly communist mindset.

The Indian subcontinent which has various States and UTs is the largest democracy in the world with each State having its own resource endowments and potential threats. Of late, the Governments (be it in the Centre or the State) have been trying to reduce the inequality by various policy initiatives. Here in India, growth is no longer the big question but distribution is. However, there is a lot which has to be done for reducing the inequality gap or to ascertain distributional justice.

If we look back to the 2008 global financial crisis, both India and China were able to float safe due to the fiscal austerity measures and fiscal strength respectively. Now if we look at the present COVID-19 pandemic, China was the epicenter of the virus, went for a lockdown, virus spread globally and now China has recovered. Various advanced nations like USA, UK, and Italy etc. are still going through the chaos. China is now equipped to help itself and offer a helping hand to the rest of the world; be it as a saviour or a game changer.

However, India is still struggling to get rid of the crisis.

A lot has been debated about the biological weapon in the form of Coronavirus being used by China. However, if or not it is a weapon of mass destruction, the bigger issue at hand is how to ensure a normal situation during and after the lockdown? Further, the vaccine or any medications for the same needs some transmission time in terms of production, allied issues of procurement and distribution.

Unlike the pandemic board games which are based on cooperative game theory, where there are some four diseases, two to four players and the task is to find four cures without losing the game; here in real life, it’s only one Coronavirus which can affect anyone anytime without doing anything. The task is to stay safe from the virus spread. The two players can be seen as a vector of variables. The first player comprising the Government officials, doctors, nurses, medical staff, policemen, community helpers, the service providers and anyone under the essential services; the second player comprising civilians starting from daily wage earners, manual laborers, children, old aged persons, teachers, students, youth and anyone not in the essential services. The payoffs in this case could be seen as a decline in the number of COVID-19 positive cases; a decline in the number of deaths; a cure (gradually if not immediately) and a slow yet gradual economic recovery.

The whole issue is about coordination at multiple levels (international, national, State, local, regional and community). The time will only show how this coordination and cooperation will reflect upon ending the pandemic. As of now, we need to follow the safety instructions of staying at home, keeping our needs to the minimum, covering our mouth and nose while going out, maintaining our hygiene and of course washing our hands properly. Stay safe and stay healthy.

25,07-4-20,Women SHGs play vital role in anti-corona fight,"From delivering rations to opening vegetable shops and spreading public awareness about the need of remaining indoors, as many as 70 lakh women members of six lakh Mission Shakti Self-Help Groups (SHGs) are working hard across the State during the time of challenge posed by the coronavirus pandemic.

And Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has expressed his gratitude to the SHGs for their role. “I am heartened by the all-round response of women, especially members of Mission Shakti SHGs, during this critical time,” Patnaik said recently. The women are even making 50,000 masks every day, he noted.

The Mission Shakti programme was launched by Patnaik in 2001, a year after he assumed power. It has always played a vital role during any disaster or emergency situation and has now become a movement in the State, Patnaik said.

The SHG members work both in rural and urban areas and provide a vital link between the Government and the community as leaders, partners in service delivery at the grassroots level, said Mission Shakti Director Sujata R Karthikeyan.

From early March, the SHGs were assigned the responsibility of creating awareness on coronavirus at the community level. They circulated pamphlets mostly among women, who have little knowledge on hygiene and sanitation, and carried the Chief Minister’s pledge of “Stay Home, Stay Safe” at the doorsteps of people, who do not have access to newspapers and television channels. They made the rural people understand in simple language that it is not impossible to defeat corona if they stay home and break the virus’ transmission chain, Karthikeyan said. In view of the public demand, about 400 SHGs are making 50,000 masks every day, she informed.

The SHGs have sold nearly 6 lakh masks so far to agencies, institutions banks, police and village health workers at a reasonable rate of Rs 15-Rs 20 per piece. Many SHGs have also undertaken the job as a philanthropic activity and distributed masks free of cost to those in need, Karthikeyan said.

About 500 SHGs have set up dry ration, vegetable and fruit shops across the State with the help of the district administrations. The SHG members are also carrying out home delivery services for providing ration in many urban centres like Brahmapur, Cuttack, Kendrapada and Koraput, she said.

Meanwhile, the Chief Minister has entrusted the responsibility of managing the free kitchens in every gram panchayat to the SHGs.

RCCF Palamu Mohan Lal said the DFO Medininagar Rahul Kumar and Mohammadganj ranger A K Singh have reached the place of occurrence.

Lal said the elephant was said to have a rubbing with a nearby electricity pole which led to the breaking down of an 11,000 volt over head wire which fell and the elephant in contact with this wire died of shock.

DFO Rahul Kumar told Lal, “The broken wire on the ground was feet away from the carcass of the elephant. The wire was not found entangling the body.”

Sources said again Rahul Kumar has told Lal that the body does not look any charred when charring is a classic sign of electrocution but the rubbing signs on the electricity pole are there too big and visible.

Lal said Kumar, who has examined the body of the elephant, has definitely spoken about wire not near the carcass nor any dis colouration of the carcass found any visible except that elephant’s rubbing the electricity pole is there.

The RCCF said the post mortem has been conducted and its viscera would be sent to Ranchi for analysis to ascertain as to how it died.

On being asked about any foul play or this elephant getting any victim of man elephant conflict (MEC) Lal said, “ One cannot jump to any conclusion. There is the broken electricity wire of 11,000 volt. This cannot be overlooked.”

SDPO Hussainabad Vijay Kumar said his police officials have also found broken 11,000 volt wire and the body some feet away from it but signs of this elephant rubbing an electricity pole are too speaking and loud.

RCCF Lal said its two tusks have been extracted and preserved while burial of it has been done with lots of lime and salt.

The SDPO said there was a problem with its burial as the farmer Sanjay Mahto near whose arhar pulse field this elephant fell dead, was not ready for its burial on his field.

He said police had to do a lot of persuasion to get him agreed to its burial on his field as here is no forest land in the nearby nor any GM land as well.

Sources said as elephant is seen as the carrier of Lord Ganesha and it had small tusks some religiosity too was behind the farmer’s reluctance to the location of its burial which the police got over.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/elephant-dies-of-electrocution-in-palamu.html

The Pioneer: What about essential commodities like milk and vegetables. Were they made available within the 48 hours?

DM: Our purpose was to minimise footfall, as these points attract congregation and the whole idea of social distancing would have been foiled. Therefore we did not include any such sale of such items which would allow people to congregate.

The Pioneer: How was the district administration coordinating with the public health system?

DM: Absolutely we are getting lots of support from the public at large, the police administration and municipal corporation administration as well the district administration. We are working together as one team to mitigate the current situation as well the future challenges to fight the pandemic coronavirus. And during shutdown period, we worked in tandem.

The Pioneer: As Cuttack is more than 1,000-year city and it’s densely populated, do you think there are high chances of the virus to spread in community.

DM: You are right. Cuttack is a very old city and it is densely populated, that has made our job tough and we are taking all possible steps to ensure that the denizens don’t fall prey to the deadly virus.

DM: PDS points have been activated and commodities are being distributed among the people. But I understand that it has not been distributed seamlessly that is because of the delay in movement of transport vehicles. I assure you all the beneficiaries will be covered soon.

Linda said the Mushars numbering 40 or so told him when he made an outreach there they demanded raw food be given to them like rice and pulse and then they will not look forward to cooked food of the police rather they will prepare food for themselves as per their own convenience.

Linda said these Mushars told him that they would arrange dry wood for cooking fuel.

Linda said he has directed his SDPO Gupta to send these Mushars adequate quantity of rice and pulse on Tuesday.

Sources said neither the SP nor his team of officials saw any Mushar owning any LPG gas cylinder under PM Ujjawala Yojna. Also, there is no database of such people who live in a scattered way and have nothing to lean upon for living except resources of nature.

Sources said these Mushars were told by police team not to sit too close but to maintain a distance which they just could not comprehend as to for what this distance is so talked about.

Sources said the Mushars know there is coronavirous striking people but before their own hunger or deficiency of food this danger looks secondary to them.

Sources said food is coming to the needy from such sources which are not making any noise for publicity like the Jain Samaj here which is distributing highly hygienic packed food among the needy without ‘getting any photographed’.

A posh hotel which in happier times was known for vegetarian dishes is preparing food for the needy courtesy the Jain Samaj.

Sources said some benevolent are flashing their photographs with some 20 or 30 small packets of food claiming they are the ones who are feeding a good number of people.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mushars-urge-palamu-sp-to-give-them-raw-food--not-cooked-one.html

60,07-4-20,Ration to those who applied online soon: Kejriwal,"Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said his Government will start providing ration to those who have applied for ration card online. The ration will be provided to them at 421 schools from Tuesday, with an initial capacity to provide ration to around 10 lakh people.

While coronavirus in Delhi is spreading, Monday witnessed 20 new cases and one death have been reported in past 24 hours.

Kejriwal said cases in Delhi have increased, partly due to increased testing. Now, we are going to further increase testing so that positive cases could be identified. Situation is still under control and there is nothing to worry. He appealed to the people to adhere to the lockdown.

Importantly, the Delhi Government has ordered one lakh testing kits to increase the testing capacity in Delhi to 1000 people per day.

In order to protect doctors from getting infected with deadly corona virus that has claimed thousands lives globally, the AAP Government has petitioned the Centre and it has received 27 thousand Personal Protection Equipment ( PPE).

Thanking the Centre, Kejriwal said, “It is a great step towards ensuring the safety of doctors in the state.””These kits should be delivered to us by Tuesday or the day after. This is a great step towards ensuring the safety of our doctors. The Delhi government, the Central government, and the people are collectively fighting the battle against Corona. I hope that we will overcome it very soon.""

Quoting health bulletin, he said, “There were 503 cases in Delhi yesterday, and with 20 new cases in the last 24 hours, there are a total of 523 cases in Delhi. Out of these 20 new cases, 10 are from Markaz and 10 are from other reasons. Out of the total 523 cases in Delhi, 330 cases are from Markaz, 61 cases have a history of international travel, 7 people have been confirmed dead with one new death in the last 24 hours. 25 people are in the ICU, 8 people are on ventilators, and the rest of the patients are in a stable condition.""

""In the last few days, it must have seemed like there has been a sudden rise in the COVID-19 positive cases in Delhi. One reason for that is the rise in the Markaz cases, which is evident since 330 out of 523 cases are from Markaz. The second reason is that now, we have started getting the testing kits and testing capacity has increased across Delhi in the last few days. We want maximum people to be tested to provide better treatment to the people infected by Corona,"" he added.

“The more tests would ensure that infected people are identified, quarantined, and treated so that the virus does not get transmitted to other people. He said that through this, the State will be able to contain the outbreak of corona this way and even developed nations, like South Korea, increased their testing capacity to contain the rising cases of Corona,” he said, adding, ""Our testing capacity around 25th March was 100-125 people per day, which has increased to 500 people per day after 1st April, and is now reaching a capacity of 1000 tests per day. We have given the orders for 1 lakh testing kits, which are expected to be procured by Friday.""

Delhi Government has served lunch to around 6,90,000 people and dinner to around 6,94,000 people.

“I want to assure you that we would not let anyone in Delhi suffer from hunger. I want to thank the people, NGOs and Civil Society Organisations who are distributing food packets in different areas in their capacity,"" said the CM.

""I want to appeal to all MLAs, MPs, and councilors to ensure that the distribution places do not get crowded because it will defeat the purpose of social distancing.

""This is to bring to your notice that over the last few days, our frontline healthcare workers- doctors, nurses and other support staff- had come forward with their problems and issues related to availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), COVID testing kits and quarantine facilities, on social media. The officials should view these inputs constructively,"" AIIMS RDA president Adarsh Pratap Singh and general secretary Srinivas Rajkumar T, said in the letter. “Instead of appreciating their efforts towards welfare of their peer and patients, they have received a harsh backlash. In the face of coronavirus pandemic, it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that these 'soldiers' are heard and their opinion respected, rather than humiliating them,” they said.

It also condemned the targeting of medical workers on social media, saying that such inputs should be viewed constructively and urged the government to consider creating a healthy space for debate and discussion to aid healthcare workers. ""Being an active user of social media for constructive purposes yourself, you can understand the situation of doctors put in this state,” it said.

""We strongly condemn these events and would be really thankful if Government creates a healthy space for debate and discussion to aid healthcare workers rather than ridicule them. All punishments are to be withdrawn and their honor restored,"" it said.

75,07-4-20,IIT Roorkee develops surveillance system to tackle COVID-19,"In an endeavour to augment government efforts for surveillance of COVID-19 suspects, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee has developed a unique tracking mobile application. The institute’s department of civil engineering professor Kamal Jain has developed the application which is endowed with state of- the art features. The app can track individuals and also can do geofencing around him or her. The system will get an alert, if geofencing is violated by the quarantined person. In case GPS data is not received, the location will be obtained automatically through the triangulation of mobile towers. If the internet is not working in a certain area, the location will be received through SMS. If the application gets off, an alert will be received immediately. The location of the person can be received by sending an SMS to the device. It allows the sharing of quarantined persons/places photographs on a Google map, uploading geotag image to a server. Furthermore, administrators can view all reports on a map. If installed on the affected person, it can provide a history of all people in his vicinity for a defined period.

“We are committed to aiding the efforts of the government during this unprecedented time. This system will greatly help in tracking and surveillance of COVID 19 suspects,"" said IIT Roorkee director professor Ajit K Chaturvedi.“The tracking system allows for state-of-the-art surveillance during COVID-19 pandemic. Besides facilitating quarantine management, it helps to overcome overcrowding at any location by issuing an alert to the predefined agency. This is our small step to supplement government efforts in these testing times,” said Jain.

The surveillance system is a plug and play device and allows tracking with an accuracy of +/- 5 meters through notifications at 2, 10 or 20 seconds. Besides live tracking, the administrator can view the entire movement history of an individual. In case of loss of data, the device sends an alert to the team concerned. Other features of the app include multi-camera support, surveillance magnetic device, halt time and auto camera click on preset time.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/iit-roorkee-develops-surveillance-system-to-tackle-covid-19.html

77,07-4-20,"State MPs hail salary cut, suspension of MPLAD fund","Jharkhand Parliamentarians have welcomed the decision of Union Government to cut 30 per cent salary of all MPs for one year to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The BJP MPs from State claimed that the decision of Prime Minister is welcome on the day of BJP’s foundation day as the national interest is supreme for it. The BJP leaders claimed that everyone in the party is always dedicated to the service of the nation.

The Union Cabinet on Monday approved an ordinance to reduce the salaries of Members of Parliament (MPs) by 30 per cent for one year and the amount will be utilised in the fight against coronavirus.

The Cabinet also approved temporary suspension of the MPLAD (Member of Parliament local Area Development) fund scheme during 2020-21 and 2021-22, and the funds will be used for managing health services and the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.

Welcoming the decision, Union Tribal Affairs minister Arjun Munda said, “The Union Government has taken a right step at right time. Entire country is facing serious situation due to Coronavirus. Now the MPLAD fund for two years which amounts to Rs 10 crore will be spent on coronavirus treatment.”

Echoing the views of Munda, Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth said that it is historic decision taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He said, “In current situation there can be no better example of human service than announcing the MP LAD fund for Coronavirus.

The Congress too has welcomed the decision. The Congress leadership in New Delhi has welcomed the government's decision to cut MPs' salaries to fight the battle against coronavirus, but said suspending MPLADs will undermine the role of an MP and called for its review.

However, none of the Congress MPs can be contacted. Attempts to contact Congress Rajya Sabha MP, Dhiraj Sahu failed as he didn’t respond to phone call.

Earlier, Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth had announced to give Rs 1 crore from his MPLAD fund in fight against Coronavirus.

86,07-4-20,Taphrina fungus hits peaches & plums in Nainital,"While humans are facing the threat of COVID-19, fruit trees in Nainital district are becoming afflicted with taphrina fungus. Hail experienced earlier this year had damaged the fruit trees on top of which taphrina is threatening to severely damage the peach and plum production in the mountainous regions of Nainital. Ramgarh, Dhari and Bhimtal blocks of the district are worst affected by this problem.

Peach and plum trees were flowering when Ramgarh, Dhari and Bhimtal experienced hail on March 13 and 14. The hail, rain and fluctuating weather caused about 90 per cent of the flowers to drop. The government had started a survey to ascertain the damage caused by the hail but the COVID-19 situation cropped up due to which the survey was stopped midway. It should be noted here that the Ramgarh-Mukteshwar fruit belt in Nainital district is known for considerable peach production. Apples, plums, apricots and walnuts are also cultivated in this fruit belt. Due to good snowfall during January-February this year, the farmers were expecting a good yield of fruits. The peaches grown in Talla Ramgarh are famous in India. Last year about 26,428 metric tonnes of peaches were harvested from about 1,824 hectares and 6,294 metric tonnes of plums were harvested from 586 hectares. There are about 40,000 farmers cultivating fruits in eight blocks including Kotabagh, Ramgarh, Dhari, Okhalkanda and Bhimtal. However, only about 15,000 farmers are insured against weather damage to crop. The district horticulture officer Bhawna Joshi said that farmers should have sprayed in November for protecting their trees from taphrina. Due to damage caused by rain and hail, the horticulture secretary R Meenakshi Sudaram had directed a survey to ascertain the damage in Nainital, Almora, Pauri, Rudraprayag, Chamoli, Pithoragarh, Bageshwar, Uttarkashi and Tehri districts. However, the reports from the districts are awaited. The taphrina fungus afflicts trees due to high humidity following rain and hail. Currently, peach trees in Ramgarh, Bhimtal and Dhari blocks have been afflicted by this fungus which causes the green leaves to turn brown and at times dries the tree itself. Farmers have sprayed their trees thrice so far but this has not had any effect on the fungus. Earlier, due to the meteorological factors, it was estimated that between 40 to 50 per cent of the fruit production in the district could be damaged. However, after the fungus affliction, farmers are estimating that up to 90 per cent of the fruit production could be damaged.

It is pertinent to mention here that apart from fruit cultivation, farmers also grow various vegetables in different parts of the district. However the rain and hail experienced on March 13-14 destroyed the peas in various areas. Further, the considerable rain is also expected to affect the potato production in the district.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/taphrina-fungus-hits-peaches---plums-in-nainital.html

Social distance was maintained at the event.

Apart from Dhrampal Singh the newly appointed State president Deepak Prakash paid floral tributes to Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee and Pt Deendayal Upadhyaya party ideologue and founders of Jan Sangh the erstwhile political entity of BJP. Mookerjee in 1951 founded the party, while Deendayal Upadhyaya was General Secretary of the Bhartiya Jan Sangh from its first Kanpur session in Dec. 1951 to its 14th Cabinet session in Dec. 1967.

Senior BJP leader and party legislative leader Babulal Marandi too celebrated the foundation day at his home. He paid floral tributes to Syama Prasad Mookerjee and Pt Deendayal Upadhyaya.

Prakash said, “As the country is facing coronavirus pandemic we have decided to celebrate the foundation day in simple way. We have asked all party cadres and leaders to celebrate the foundation on the instructions issued by the BJP national president JP Nadda.”

The BJP was founded on this day in 1980 by leaders of the erstwhile Jana Sangh, which had merged with the Janata Party to put up a united fight against the Indira Gandhi-led Congress in the 1977 Lok Sabha polls, held after the Emergency.

Nadda has urged party workers to provide food packets to the needy, distribute home-made face covers and get signatures of people to express gratitude to emergency staff, from health professionals to sanitation workers and police besides bank and postal employees among others, working during the lockdown to express the feeling of unity and solidarity.

Also, the BJP Karyakartas will encourage 40 others to donate Rs. 100 each to PM-CARES Fund.

89,07-4-20,Covid-19: Admin seals Hindpiri for 72 hours,"The District Administration on Monday sealed Hindpiri locality for at least 72 hours, prohibiting outsiders from entering the area and locals from moving out. The decision came hours after the second case of COVID-19 in Ranchi was reported from Hindpiri.

""Hindpiri has been sealed for 72 hours after the second case of COVID-19 was reported from the locality,"" said Ranchi Deputy Commissioner Rai Mahimapat Ray. ""No outsider will be allowed to enter this area during the next 72 hours. And no person living in the area will be allowed to move out,"" he added.

By now, two cases of the lethal viral infection have been reported in Ranchi – both from Hindpiri. Stretching adjacent to Mahatma Gandhi Road and touching Upper Bazar from one end and Pe Pee Compound from the other, Hindpiri is one of the most densely populated areas in the city. Dominated by the minority community, it includes slums as well as apartments and small bungalows.

The District Administration has set up a control room at Guru Nanak School, a strategic point that marks the end of Hindpiri and the beginning of Pe Pee Compound – a posh area dominated by top businessmen, lawyers and hoteliers of the State capital.

Ranchi Senior Superintendent of Police Anish Gupta said that policemen have been deployed at 15 strategic points in and around Hindpiri in order to ensure that nobody moves out of the area and vice versa. ""Policemen on two wheelers will also patrol the area,"" he added.

Meanwhile, the Government is not only combating the virus, but also attempts by locals to keep their history of contact with patients a secret, a senior health official said on Monday. Rumours about poor treatment meted out to suspects in Isolation Centres have made many locals resist screening and sample collection, he added.

Last week, a team of health workers had to retreat after some locals in Hindpiri raised a ruckus over medical examinations. Some resisted medical tests, suspecting that the data collected will be eventually used for National Population Register (NPR), officials said.

However, the administration eventually managed to pacify the locals and collect samples of more than 100 people from the area, sources said.

The woman, who may have contracted the virus by directly coming in contact with State's first coronavirus patient, is the fourth case of the lethal viral infection in Jharkhand and the second in the State Capital, they added.

The finding has rung the alarm bell for the Government here as the woman may have come in direct contact with many more people in her locality and family since she got infected, sources said. She was admitted in the Isolation Ward of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) on Monday. State's first Coronavirus patient –a Malaysian woman who returned from the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in New Delhi and was staying behind a mosque in Hindpiri– lived at a stone's throw from her house, sources said.

“She may have come in direct contact with the Malaysian woman. Now, we are screening all the residents who may have come in contact with either of the two women,"" said Health Secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni. ""We are requesting all the people who came in contact with these two women to get tested,” he added.

Meanwhile, the Government is not only combating the virus, but also attempts by locals to keep their history of contact with patients a secret, a senior health official said on Monday. Rumours about poor treatment meted out to suspects in Isolation Centres have made many locals resist screening and sample collection, he added.

By now, COVID-19 cases have been reported from Ranchi, Hazaribag and Bokaro. Interestingly, only two of the four patients in the State had travel history to a foreign country.

On Sunday, an elderly woman from Bokaro, who had travelled to Bangladesh recently, tested positive. Last week, a Hazaribag man, who attended a wedding in West Bengal, tested positive.

Despite a delayed entry in Jharkhand, the virus has already infected people living in rural areas – a cause for concern for the Government. The number of cases here quadrupled in a fortnight, and many people who might be infected have not even been tested, said a source from the health department.

By Monday, the Government collected samples of 1004 suspects and 842 of them tested negative, a report released by the National Health Mission (NHM) said.

During the last week of March, the State had hardly 60 corona virus cases while Maharashtra and Kerala topped the table. But by April 1, the number of coronavirus cases in Tamil Nadu touched 200 and since then it was an unexpected surge.

By Sunday evening, it was announced by Beela Rajesh that the number of corona cases had crossed the 570 mark making Tamil Nadu the State with the second highest number of corona patients after Maharashtra. It is reported that the Government has ordered a detailed probe to find out the reasons behind the increase in the number of patients.

Out of the 570 patients tested positive for corona, more than 400 are either the returnees of the Tabligh Jamaat congregation held in Delhi or those who came into contact with them. The State administration is on a mission mode to prevent the disease reaching the Stage-3 (community transmission). But law breakers are having a field day in various parts of the State. Virudhunagar and Thoothukudi districts reported shop keepers openly violating prohibitory orders and selling meat.

Though there is a notion about the poor hygiene of the people of the State, Tamil Nadu has been doing well in waste management and disposal. The health sector too had registered impressive growth with many corporate hospitals opening branches in interior Tamil Nadu. The State is on its way to establish Government medical colleges in all the districts. South India’s first All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is fast coming up at Madurai.

Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswamy convened a media meet on Monday after his interaction with officials (both revenue and police ) and appealed to the people to cooperate with government officials to prevent the spreads of the disease.

“We have brought in laws to check the spread of the disease. But it could be implemented only with the cooperation of the people. The police are over worked and they have been instructed to be courteous with the people. Now it is for our people to reciprocate by obeying the guidelines, dos and don'ts,” said Palaniswamy.

The video message aired by the Government of Tamil Nadu through news channels has caught the attention of the people. Doctors and nurses appeal to the people of the State to stay at home and not to come out. “It is patient who asks us to save his/her life. This is out turn to request you to stay home and stay safe by not coming out of your houses,” says Dr Raghunanthan, professor of medicine, in this one-minute message.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sudden-surge-in-cases-baffles-tn-govt.html

Preparing for managing a staggered post-lockdown scenario, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday suggested harnessing technology and encouraging exploration of innovative solutions like ‘truck aggregators’ while interacting with his Council of Ministers whom he asked to prepare a list of 10 major decisions and 10 priority areas of focus after April 14.

Stressing that lockdown measures and social distancing must go hand in hand, Prime Minister said that it's essential to strategize for emergent conditions once lockdown ends.

The Centre has asked states and union territories to ensure smooth harvesting and sowing operations and exempted agricultural activities from the 21-day lockdown enforced to combat coronavirus. It has also allowed shops of agricultural machinery and its spare parts to remain open during the period.

Modi said that welfare of farmers is of high importance and affirmed that his government would provide all possible help to farmers in the harvesting season.

He also underlined the need to devise a strategy to ensure procurement of tribal products so that the source of income of the indigenous tribal populace remains intact.

While making important recommendations and asking for suggestions, he underlined importance of being “motivated, determined and vigilant in the battle against COVID-19” .

He sought that Ministers should remain in touch with State and District Administration, provide solutions to emergent problems and formulate district level micro plans.

Modi asked relevant Ministries to continuously monitor and ensure that benefits of Rs Garib Kalyan YojanaRs keep reaching intended beneficiaries in a seamless manner and tasked his Ministers to popularize Aarogya Setu app in the rural areas and grass root institutions.

He also asked the Ministries to prepare a Business Continuity Plan and be ready to fight the economic impact of COVID-19 on war footing.

He said it is imperative that the leaders communicate exhaustively with the state and district administration, especially in the districts which are hotspots for the pandemic, to be apprised of the ground situation and also provide solutions to the emerging problems. He noted that a graded plan to slowly open departments where hotspots aren’t existing should be made and that the crisis offers an opportunity to become self-dependent in the medical sector.

It is also important to ensure there is no crowding at PDS centres, maintain effective monitoring, take action on complaints and prevent black marketing and rise in prices of essentials, he said.

While mentioning that due to the emergent challenges, the country needs to lessen its dependence on other nations, he asked all departments to maintain an objective index on how their work will promote Make in India.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/centre-may-go-for----truck-aggregators---.html

126,07-4-20,Health officials develop PPE kit with help of prisoners,"Amid the shortage of safety gear for medical staff in the fight against coronavirus, Madhya Pradesh, health officials with the help of some prisoners, have come up with a low-cost personal protective equipment kit.

State health commissioner Faiz Ahmed Kidwai has also called for rational use of PPE kits, which the health care workers and those deployed at quarantine centres, hospitals and laboratories need the most at this crucial time.

In view of the growing demand for safety gear by those treating coronavirus patients, the health officials in Betul have prepared their own personal protective equipment (PPE) with the help of prisoners of the district jail.

""We have developed our own PPE kit, which includes a robe stitched by prisoners lodged at the district jail. The raw material required for this locally made kit was procured from the neighbouring Chhindwara district with the help of funds provided by the local MP,"" Betul's Chief Medical and Health Officer Dr G C Chourasia said.

The prisoners earlier prepared masks which have been provided to the local health workers, he said.

Betul district hospital's medical officer Dr Ankita Seete said.

The prisoners have so far provided 30 protective robes to the health team.

As part of the PPE kit, the health officials have also made a 'face shield' out of plastic which can be used along with the robes.

Betu's Shahpur block medical officer Dr Shailendra Sahu said he has prepared the face shield with locally available material, after seeing some foreign videos of the safety gear.

""After finding that such a face shield was not available online or in the local market, we prepared it with the plastic sheets used in the packing of sarees, hair bands, tapes and adhesives.

This is also included in the PPE kit being given to the health staff of the district,"" Sahu said.

The robe in the PPE kit costs around Rs 150 and ensures the safety of health workers, said Yogesh Pandagre, the MLA from Amla assembly seat of the district, who is also a doctor and has helped in preparing the kit.

""The quality of this protective robe is at par with the product of any big company, he claimed.

Meanwhile, health commissioner Kidwai directed the medical staff across the State for judicious use of PPE.

In a directive issued on Saturday, he said there is limited availability of PPE kits and N95 masks, so these safety gears should be used rationally during the battle against coronavirus.

Kidwai also directed the health staff to adopt other safety measures like washing hands frequently and maintaining distance from each other along with the use of PPE.

The state health department currently has about 18,911 PPE kits, 72,304 N95 masks and 1.76 lakh three-layered masks, an official said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/health-officials-develop-ppe-kit-with-help-of-prisoners.html

129,07-4-20,Superstitions and hearsay cannot weaken our battle against COVID-19: Vice-Prez,"Cautioning that superstitions and hearsay cannot be allowed to weaken our battle against COVID-19, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu has described the spread of misinformation, especially on social media, as a “virus” that needs to be checked.

Observing that free flow of authentic information to quell rumours and misinformation is critical, Naidu in a Facebook post said the war on virus cannot be won if we have inadequate or faulty understanding of the magnitude of the problem.

Referring to irresponsible flouting of the precautionary social distancing guidelines in some states and exemplified by the recent congregation in New Delhi, the Vice President underscored the need for greater dissemination of guidelines and stricter implementation.

He said there has to be a greater awareness of the urgency and the scientific evidence about the spread of the virus necessitating a total societal response cutting across caste, creed, class, language, regions and religions.

At the same time, Naidu, said that there has to be a common understanding among all religious groups that social distancing norms cannot be taken lightly and there should not be large congregations till the current challenge is overcome. “We hope there will be no more such unfortunate, blatant violations of the prescribed guidelines”, he observed.

The Vice President also called for steering clear of untenable generalisations about communities and not viewing events from the prism of prejudices and biases. He said this is no time to relax and a tough struggle lies ahead. “Unity of thought and action and solidarity with all the brave warriors is the need of the hour,” he outlined.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/superstitions-and-hearsay-cannot-weaken-our-battle-against-covid-19--vice-prez.html
130,07-4-20,"Tiff between BJP, Didi on ‘politicising corona’","With the BJP Information Technology cell charging the Bengal Government with hiding facts related to corona deaths, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday returned fire saying these were no time to reap political harvests.

Banerjee disclosed the number of Corona infected patients in the State but gave a curt reply to BJP leader Amit Malavya’s allegations --- that the Government was fudging the number of corona deaths --- saying “some parties are playing politics in these hours of crisis … a party’s IT cell is using fake news to malign our health department … at a time when our doctors and health staff are doing their best to fight the disease. This is not the time for petty politics for which they will get plenty of time later on.”

Claiming that she was “not finding faults in what the central government was doing while dealing with the crisis,” Banerjee said “they may be more interested in politics by descending on the streets, ringing bells, clanging utensils … but we are not. We are more interested in serving the people.”

Earlier, leaders like Malavya and even Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh questioned the Government was functioning in Bengal saying the “hospitals in the State are under pressure from the Chief Minister who is also the Health Minister to underplay the Corona related deaths.”

The BJP IT cell chief wondered as to why the State Government did not come out with medical bulletins on 2nd, 3rd and 5th April. He also questioned the reason “why the number of Covid-related deaths are missing in the bulletin released on the 4th.”

Ghosh said the Government was doing so in order to save the insurance money worth Rs 10 lakh that the Chief Minister has promised in case of any death in the medical fraternity for treating Corona. The Chief Minister has promised an insurance of Rs 10 lakh for the government staff involved in fighting the disease.

Not only the Chief Minister but also other opposition leaders slammed the BJP for politicizing the fight against corona by encouraging its supporters to burst crackers and light candles “as if this is a time to celebrate the crisis… as it they have won the battle.”

While Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh supported bursting of crackers on Sunday night to express solidarity with ‘corona warriors’ saying “the locked down people were giving vent to their frustration… so there is no harm in it,” State Minister Tapas Chatterjee said “in the name of showing solidarity the BJP was getting the people to celebrate its foundation day.”

Congress MP Pradip Bhattacharya wondered whether Corona will go by lighting candles and bursting crackers. CPI(M) Legislature Party Leader said Sujan Chakrabarty “efficient tackling of the crisis and not publicity stunt is the need of the hour.”

Elsewhere the police arrested 126 people for bursting crackers. Over enthusiastic supporters of Narendra Modi tended to overshoot the Prime Minister’s appeal to switch off lights and light up candles only and hit the streets bursting crackers and flying hot air balloons.

Meanwhile, as per the updates made available by the Chief Minister on Monday the number of Corona infected patients in Bengal was 61 while the number of deaths remained at 3 whereas 13 patients have been cured thus far.

There were 6890 people who have been put under government quarantine, the Chief Minister said adding out of the 61 people infected 55 belonged to seven families with foreign travel history.

In a bid to expand the fight against the virus the Government also set up a “Global Advisory Board for Covid Response Policy to help and advise us on tackling the crisis,” Banerjee said adding Nobel Laureate economist Abhijeet Vinayak Banerjee and WHO accredited Dr Swaroop Sarkar had been requested to be a part of the committee.

Elsewhere the State Government on Monday sent 64 people including patients, medical staff and 39 doctors of the Government owned NRS Medical College and Hospital to home quarantine following the death of a suspected corona patient on Saturday night. His pathological samples had been sent for tests.

As a precautionary measure the CCU unit and the male medicine ward of the hospital had been shut down for disinfection works, sources said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/tiff-between-bjp--didi-on----politicising-corona---.html
131,07-4-20,Tourism Ministry comes to rescue of foreign tourists post lockdown,"The Tourism Ministry has come to the rescue of a number of foreign tourists including an American, two Costa Ricans and an Australian family stranded in India. As many as 769 foreign tourists have reached out to the Government for help and support amid the 21-day nationwide lockdown to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.

The foreign tourists registered themselves on the Tourism Ministry’s portal strandedinindia.com, launched five days ago. The portal has been launched to identify, assist and facilitate foreign tourists who are stranded in various parts of India.

Every State Government and Union Territory Administration has identified a Nodal Officer for assisting such foreign tourists and the 5 Regional Offices of the Ministry of Tourism are constantly coordinating with the Nodal Officers.

While the Tourism Ministry Regional Offices are coordinating with the Bureau of Immigration and FRROs regarding Visa issues being faced by the stranded foreigners, requests for movement within the country/ state and for transfer to home country of such tourists are also being coordinated with the Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Home Affairs and with the respective Embassy/ High Commission/Consulate.

The stranded foreign tourists are being contacted over e-mails, telephones and also in person depending on the nature of support required by them.

“A lady, who is an American citizen, was stranded in Supaul district of Bihar amidst the COVID19 lockdown, while her son was undergoing a surgery at Delhi. The portal facilitated the required inter-ministerial, inter-departmental and State-Centre coordination and secured her a special transit-permit to travel to Delhi. She has safely reached her destination and expressed her gratitude for the efforts put in by all the concerned agencies,” the Ministry said.

It also cited the examples of helping out two Costa Rican and an Australian tourist who was stranded with his family in Ahmedabad. “The tourist has epilepsy and ran out of medication prescribed by Australian doctors due to the lockdown.

press meeting at Thiruvananthapuram, Vijayan said 122 persons were admitted to various hospitals on Monday.

“There are 266 persons undergoing treatment in various hospitals in the State. We have been successful in containing the spread of the disease. On Monday, nine persons tested positive for corona in Kasargod district. Six out of this nine persons had travelled abroad and would have developed the disease during their trip,” the Chief Minister said.

He said more than 1.52 lakh persons in the State have been put under observation. An important information disclosed by Vijayan was that Karnataka Government has agreed to allow non-coronavirus patients from Kasargod district to travel to Mangalore for medical aid. “If the person carried a certificate indicating the name of the hospital in Mangalore where he is planning to get admitted and that he was not suffering from corona virus, the Karnataka Health department officials would allow his passage to the district,” said the Chief Minister.

Relations between the two States had reached a flashpoint last week when Karnataka sealed its border with Kerala at Kasargod. This was the fall out of persons afflicted with corona virus in Kasaragod rushing to neighbouring Mangalore for medical aid.

Kasaragod, described as Kerala’s epicentre of Corona Virus cases, has no speciality hospitals or medical colleges and residents in the district are dependent on Mangalore in Karnatakl for their medical needs.

On Sunday, K K Shyalaja, Kerala’s health minister flagged a team of doctors, nurses and para medical staff from Thiruvananthapuram on deputation to Kasaragod to face the medical emergency.

133,07-4-20,Women stronger against Covid-19 but other factors fail them: UNFPA,"When it comes to mounting an immune response against Covid-19 infections, women may seem to be a stronger sex as reflected in various data, but, ironically, they bear the brunt of the pandemics in the form of domestic violence and maternal mortality because of disruption of accessibility to vital health and gender-based violence services and social support.

Flagging the deeper crisis owing to the lack of support amid Coronavirus crisis, the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) on Monday said that the present situation could also exacerbate existing financial inequality between men and women.

Dr Natalia Kanem, executive director of the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), warned that the coronavirus outbreak has “severely disrupted” access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and gender-based violence (GBV) services “at a time when women and girls need these services most”.

Among the risk groups she identified are pregnant women who need antenatal care but are unsure whether to attend a clinic, and women in abusive relationships trapped at home during the lockdown.

Data available on the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women is currently limited, with no suggestion of increased susceptibility or of vertical (mother-child) transmission.

However, aid organisations working in so-called ""weak health systems"" – defined by a high maternal mortality ratio (MMR) – are drawing lessons from the 2014-16 Ebola epidemic in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. A huge surge in MMR was recorded during and after the outbreak, as women stayed away from medical facilities due to quarantine restrictions or misconceptions about virus transmission, and were forced instead into riskier home births, said the statement from the UNFPA here.

Rising tensions due to economic losses could lead to a spike in domestic violence behind closed doors – during a period when counselling and support services may be stripped back to a minimum.

At a time when nations across the world are implementing ""stay at home"" measures, the UNFPA warned that women are more likely to shoulder higher proportions of the domestic burden during lockdown.

The organisation also warned of a potential rise in female-genital mutilation, as well as early, child or forced marriages at this time of restricted movement, poor visibility and weakened protection systems.

Kanem said that preparedness will be key in dealing with the pandemic’s knock-on effects. The UNFPA is pressing for the full maintenance of sexual and reproductive health services during the COVID-19 outbreak, which should include antenatal and postnatal care, access to modern contraception and emergency contraception, and safe abortion and post-abortion care ""to the full extent of the law"" in all areas where services are likely to be impacted.

The organisation is calling for priority testing of pregnant women with COVID-19 symptoms, isolation of pregnancy wards from confirmed COVID-19 cases, an elevation of care for any pregnant women with respiratory illnesses, and extra care for all women in delivery, in case breathing complications should arise.

Another chief area of concern is the medical frontline, where women make up an estimated 70% of the world’s global health and social sector workforce. In many cases, their safety is being compromised through contact with high-risk environments and a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). Adequate psychological support is also essential at a time of high stress for health workers, the UNFPA said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/women-stronger-against-covid-19-but-other-factors-fail-them--unfpa.html

136,07-4-20,"Banks to witness spike in credit costs, non-performing assets in 2020","Banks in the country are likely to witness a spike in their non-performing assets ratio by 1.9 per cent and credit cost ratios by 130 basis point in 2020, following the economic slowdown on account of COVID-19 crisis, says a report.

In its report titled “For Asia-Pacific Banks, COVID-19 Crisis Could Add USD 300 Billion To Credit Costs” S&P Global Ratings said, it expects the non-performing assets (NPA) ratio for the Chinese banking sector to increase by about 2 per cent in 2020, and credit losses, to increase by about 100 basis points.

On India, the report said “the NPA ratio in India is likely to fare similarly to China’s (1.9 per cent vs 2 per cent) but the credit costs ratios could be worse, increasing by about 130 basis points,” the rating agency’s credit analyst Gavin Gunning said in the report.

Gunning said there are concerns that the coronavirus will spread faster, further, and for longer. “This will deepen the economic pain we already anticipate for 2020. Financing conditions may likewise sour as investors become more risk averse. This would hit bank credit,” he said.

The report noted that an additional USD 300 billion spike in lenders’ credit costs and a USD 600 billion increase in (NPAs) will occur in 2020 due to the adverse impact of coronavirus pandemic.

While banks are not as exposed as the corporate sector during the initial stage of the pandemic, the strain on lenders could ultimately be profound. Banks face a second-order hit compared with the corporate and household sectors. The report said the economic storm created by COVID-19 will test the ratings resilience of the region’s 20 banking sectors.

“The resilience of banks’ asset quality in 2020 hinges in part on the success of governments’ and regulators’ policy responses. These measures are in early stages. Some have started, some are in planning, and we suspect many more may be in the wings,” Gunning said.

Asia-Pacific Governments, central banks, and supervisory authorities have rolled out diverse measures to address COVID-19.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/banks-to-witness-spike-in-credit-costs--non-performing-assets-in-2020.html

140,07-4-20,Mukesh Ambani’s net worth drops 28% to $48 bn in 2 months,"The net worth of India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani dropped 28 per cent or USD 300 million a day for two months to USD 48 billion as on March 31 due to the massive correction in stock markets, a report said on Monday.

The chairman and managing director of the diversified Reliance Industries saw his wealth decline by USD 19 billion in February-March period, taking his global ranking down eight places to 17th, the Hurun Global Rich List said.

Other Indian businessmen who have seen a major drop in wealth include Gautam Adani whose wealth eroded by USD 6 billion or 37 per cent, HCL Technologies’

Shiv Nadar (USD 5 billion or 26 per cent) and banker Uday Kotak (USD 4 billion or 28 per cent), it said.

All the three have dropped off the top 100 list, leaving Ambani as the only Indian in the league.

The Indian market has corrected by 25 per cent in the last two months as the economic costs and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on companies led to a sell off across the world.

“India’s top entrepreneurs have been hit by a 26 per cent drop in the stock markets and a 5.2 per cent drop in the value of the rupee compared with the US Dollar. For Mukesh Ambani, it has been a perfect storm, with his wealth down 28 per cent,” Hurun Report India Managing Director Anas Rahman said.

Ambani is the second biggest wealth loser globally, after French fashion giant LVMH’s chief executive Bernard Arnault, whose wealth dropped by 28 per cent or USD 30 billion to USD 77 billion.

Berkshire Hathway’s Warren Buffet also lost USD 19 billion of wealth in the last two months, to USD 83 billion, making it a smaller fall in percentage terms at 19 per cent, the report said.

With hospitality coming under intense pressure due to the pandemic, shared economy platform Oyo Rooms’ Ritesh Agarwal is “no more a billionaire”, the rich list said.

Others in the top-10 list of wealth losers also include Carlos Slim and family, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Michael Bloomberg, it said.

Amazon’s Jeff Bezos continues to be the richest man in the world with a networth of USD 131 billion, which has slid only by 9 per cent during the last two months and is followed by Bill Gates with a fortune of USD 91 billion (down 14 per cent), Buffet and Arnault.

Chinese billionaires were among the few gainers in the last two months, and included promoters of video conferencing and pork meat producing companies, it said.

While India lost three rankings in the top-100 rankings, China added six billionaires in the league, it said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mukesh-ambani---s-net-worth-drops-28--to--48-bn-in-2-months-2020-04-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/mukesh-ambani---s-net-worth-drops-28--to--48-bn-in-2-months.html

145,07-4-20,Bavarians resume training,"Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich resumed training on Monday for the first time since the German league was suspended due to coronavirus but the players were put through their paces in small groups and maintained social distancing measures.

Keeping at least 1.5 metres from each other, players including captain Manuel Neuer, Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Mueller trained together for the first time since the Bundesliga was halted on March 13.

“It was a very unusual feeling to hold a training session in small groups, but it was also nice to see the boys in person again,” said Neuer after Bayern had previously held training sessions online.

After arriving at staggered times to limit contact -— with no greeting hugs or handshakes — the 21-man squad was split into five groups, each containing a maximum of five players.

When they changed, the players were kept four metres apart in the changing rooms at the club’s state-of-the-art training complex in southern Germany.

On the pitch, Bayern’ stars were careful to keep their distance from each other and there were no challenges or tackles.

Once training was over, the players left to shower at home, where they ate food provided by the club in lunch boxes.

Bayern asked fans to stay away from the Saebener Strasse complex, where hundreds of supporters usually turn up to see their heroes.

Other clubs also cautiously resumed training Monday, after the league’s ban on doing so until April 5 passed, amid hopes the league will resume in early May.

Bayern are four points clear in the Bundesliga table.

At the training ground of their closest rivals Borussia Dortmund, the players also did not shower or eat on site after a session that focused on running and shooting.

Since the coronavirus outbreak, the pandemic has killed 3,331 people with the number of infections rising to 81,708 by Sunday, China’s National Health Commission (NHC) said on Monday.

A total of 1,299 patients are still being treated, while 77,078 patients have been discharged after recovery, it said.

The official declaration of the state of emergency would likely come as soon as Tuesday, Shinzo Abe told reporters, as the country grapples with a recent spike in coronavirus cases, especially in the capital Tokyo. “Currently, we are seeing rapid increases of new infections particularly in urban areas like Tokyo and Osaka,” said Abe.

The declaration hands regional governors the power to ask residents to stay inside, seek the closure of businesses that attract large crowds and commandeer land and buildings for medical purposes.

But it falls far short of the sort of lockdown measures imposed in parts of Europe, where police have patrolled the streets and fined offenders.

“We envision, for a period of about one month, that we will ask further cooperation of the Japanese people to reduce person-to-person contacts that lead to infections,” said Abe.

The measure does not include legal powers to enforce requests for people to stay inside, or punishments for people who fail to do so. “In Japan, even if we declare a state of emergency, we will not close cities as seen in foreign countries. Experts have told us that there is no need for such a step,” said Abe.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/japan-pm-proposes-state-of-emergency-over-virus---1-trillion-stimulus.html
154,07-4-20,Tigress tests +ve in US’ zoo,"Nadia, a 4-year-old female Malayan tiger at the popular Bronx Zoo here has tested positive for the novel coronavirus, probably infected by an asymptomatic employee, in what is believed to be the first known case of an animal infected with COVID-19 in the US, raising new questions about human-to-animal transmission of the deadly virus.

The tigress, her sister Azul, two Amur tigers and three African lions had developed a dry cough late last month with decrease in appetite, said the Wildlife Conservation Society, which manages the zoo.

Nadia, along with other big cats, is thought to have been infected by the zoo keeper who has not been identified, it said in a statement on Sunday, adding that all the animals are expected to recover.

“Though they have experienced some decrease in appetite, the cats at the Bronx Zoo are otherwise doing well under veterinary care and are bright, alert, and interactive with their keepers,” the CNN quoted the zoo as saying.

“It is not known how this disease will develop in big cats since different species can react differently to novel infections, but we will continue to monitor them closely and anticipate full recoveries,” it said.

The test result has stunned zoo officials. “I couldn’t believe it,” zoo director Jim Breheny said.

The coronavirus, first detected in humans in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, is believed to have spread from animals to humans, and a handful of animals, including two dogs, have tested positive in Hong Kong.

The pandemic has been driven by human-to-human transmission, but the infection of Nadia raises new questions about human-to-animal transmission.

According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), no other animals at the zoo are showing symptoms.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/tigress-tests--ve-in-us----zoo.html
155,07-4-20,Scientists link air pollution and COVID-19 mortality in Italy,"An environmental researcher from Aarhus University in Denmark and health researchers from Italy have claimed there could be a link between the high mortality rate seen in northern Italy and the level of air pollution in the same region.

Environmental scientist Dario Caro from Department of Environmental Science, and two health researchers, Professor Bruno Frediani and Dr Edoardo Conticini from the University of Siena in Italy found yet another small piece in the puzzle of understanding the deadly disease that has killed nearly 16,000 in the country.

They focused on examining why the mortality rate is up to 12 per cent in the northern part of Italy while it is only approx 4.5 per cent in the rest of the country. In research project published in the scientific journal Environmental Pollution, they demonstrated a probable correlation between air pollution and mortality in two of the worst affected regions in northern Italy: Lombardy and Emilia Romagna.

The population of the northern Italian regions lives in a higher level of air pollution, and this may lead to a number of complications for patients with COVID-19 in the regions, simply because their bodies may have already been weakened by the accumulated exposure to air pollution when they contract the disease. “There are several factors affecting the course of patients’ illness, and all over the world we’re finding links and explanations of what is important. It’s very important to stress that our results are not a counter-argument to the findings already made,” said Caro.

“Our considerations must not let us neglect other factors responsible of the high lethality recorded: important co-factors such as the elevated medium age of the Italian population, the wide differences among Italian regional health systems, ICUs capacity and how the infects and deaths has been reported have had a paramount role in the lethality of SARS-CoV-2, presumably also more than pollution itself,” he explained.

The two northern Italian regions are among the most air-polluted regions in Europe.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/scientists-link-air-pollution-and-covid-19-mortality-in-italy.html
156,07-4-20,Musical nostalgia,"Singer, composer and multi-instrumentalist Raghav Sachar pays tribute to his favourite video game, Super Mario Brothers, in his signature style. By Ayushi Sharma

Can you recall those days when engaging with Super Mario’s adventures, typically in the fictional mushroom kingdom, after school was our prime entertainment? Mario was often joined by his brother Luigi, and occasionally by other characters. The player runs and jumps across platforms as well as atop enemies in various levels of the game. For sure, by now the 90s kids must have pictured every bit of the video game, right up to the dragon and rescuing the kidnapped princess Peach from the primary antagonist, Browser.

Undoubtedly, Super Mario has been one of the most influential games for multiple generations. And singer, composer and multi-instrumentalist Raghav Sachar has paid a tribute to it in his signature style where he is dressed as Mario and Luigi. The main instruments used are the alto, soprano and tenor saxophones along with some other woodwind instruments like piccolo and flute. The trumpet adds bass, and all of this is blended in with electronic instruments like the guitar, seaboard and the keytar.

How did you first conceptualise it? What was the idea behind?

I always wanted to create my own rendition of the Super Mario Brothers theme as it was such an amazing melody. It had a lot of nostalgic value for me and, I am sure, for every child born in the 80s and the 90s. The idea was to do my best to showcase the variety of instruments that I play to emphasize the different stages and melodies of the game. To take things a notch further, I am even dressed up like Mario and Luigi playing various instruments in the video. I wanted the audio to sound larger than life and ended up creating a massive wind symphony of the music. It’s my tribute to the makers of the game and the creator of the theme who composed it only with 8bit sound as that was the only thing available then.

Since Mario was a video game of the 90s primarily, do you aim to cater to that age group only? If not, how do you think rest of the audience will relate to it?

Mario has been developed over the years and a new cooler version is available for the millennials to play. It does not have the same theme though but they might be able to relate to the character. However, it will hold a lot more nostalgic value for the people who have played the original game because my rendition is a tribute to that version. I hope that the youngsters and musicians see my video from the point of view of a musical extravaganza.

You have used various instruments for this composition. How difficult was it to synchronise them together so that one doesn’t overshadow the other?

I have recorded over 100 audio tracks and featured 11 different instruments. It was crucial that I identify which section would feature which instrument in the foreground. Since it is a wind symphony, woodwinds like saxophones and flute along with trumpet (brass) take centre stage with drums and percussion keeping the energy alive and electric instruments giving the modern vibe. Synchronising all the instruments was very difficult. Mixing and mastering 100 live tracks and making everything heard at the right place was tiring and cumbersome. I would do a mix and hear it on various systems like my car, headphones, small speakers and more. It took many attempts and days before I was satisfied with the final video.

What is peculiar about the video that you have created?

The most peculiar thing would be that the game is a part of the video. I wanted it to evoke that feeling of nostalgia among viewers when they hear and watch it. The editing process took ages because finding the right clips and then inserting the sound effects of the game along with multiple other screens of me playing so many different instruments was a huge task. The process of creating this audio and video took more than six months, which is the longest that I have taken to create anything so far.

You do a lot of film tracks often, how is your creative process for them different from the songs for albums?

Private albums and single are an artistes’ true calling because he/she is not directed to create it. Creation of Mario has been a passion project for me and it took much more time than I had initially anticipated purely because it’s musically very challenging and complicated. Film work is very different and is very ‘agenda’ oriented. The makers always need a ‘HIT’, which frankly no music director can confirm 100 per cent. I feel when you approach music from a commercial point of view rather than a creative point of view, there’s a lot of imbalance and the process is more mechanical rather being organic and intuitive.

Most of the industries are suffering because of the pandemic. Do you think the music industry is affected as the songs are already online?

This is an unprecedented situation that no one had foreseen. Frankly no one has any answers to what’s going on and when will it end. The industries worldwide have been hit and it will take a really long time for all of us to bounce back to our regular routines and for the fear to go away. Music as an industry has the highest demand during this time. In fact, it can easily be classified under essentials because people rely on it to relax themselves, meditate, feel spiritual, reinforce love, experience heartbreak and become positive in their overall outlook towards life. Creating music and releasing it is not as difficult if you are a producer like me who pretty much is self sufficient. If I want any singer to record on my audio, then I can send files to them via internet and mostly everyone who is engaged in making music has a small setup at home. It is also easier to release audio tracks without videos because it can literally be done from home and does not require manpower. We don’t do that as much in India because every artiste wants a video to go along with the audio and that costs a lot more money and time while involving many more people.

Is there a specific reason you planned to release it now amid this global crisis? Do you think it will affect its viewership?

This track was supposed to release in March with a big press conference and a performance on various instruments by me for the media to capture. Initially, I wanted to wait and release it after the lockdown but then when I realised that there is uncertainty about how long we will be stuck like this, I decided to entertain the audience while they have fewer distractions. I think it will be a very uplifting video for many and I am expecting huge viewership because the game is not limited to India. It was a huge success worldwide and there are many communities who love Mario. I wish the circumstances were different but life still goes on...",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/musical-nostalgia-2020-04-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/musical-nostalgia.html
157,07-4-20,Glow at home,"Here are a few tips from experts on how to take care of your skin and hair amid the pandemic. By Team Viva

The fallout of the Coronavirus pandemic is a quarantine lifestyle which also means parlours that have downed shutters. Our skin and hair are bearing the brunt. Therefore, right from using cleanser, face masks to hair oil, it is very important to take charge of your skin and hair as less physical activity and extra sleep hours can result in dullness. Utilise the gift of time that this global crisis has bestowed on you to the fullest. Pamper your skin, experiment with hair colours and see what suits you the best.

It’s the best time to indulge in self-care and beauty practices as we are all sitting at home. The plus point is that there is no stress of rushing to work and no excess pollution. You could just sit in your pajamas with an oily and messy hairdo and a refreshing face mask, while working on your laptop. Imagine what rejuvenating effects it will have on your skin if you follow the regime daily.

Dr Blossom Kochhar, founder of Blossom Kochhar Aroma Magic and chairperson of Blossom Kochhar Group of Companies, suggests that people must use this little extra time to be productive, instead of lazing around. Bollywood celebrities like Anushka Sharma were recently seen giving her husband Virat Kohli a haircut while Taapsee Pannu experimented with her hair colour and haircut. You can do it too.

Here are a few easy tips from experts to take care of your skin and hair at home.

That perfect face glow

Eating healthy, working out, staying happy are some of the ways to achieve that perfect glow. “Climb stairs for 10 minutes. This is a good workout. If you like to dance, then dance to a song in the room. This will keep your hair and skin healthy. Be active for at least 20 minutes each in the morning, afternoon and evening. This also helps in the circulation of antioxidants in the body,” says Aashmeen Munjaal, beauty expert and owner of Star Salon n Academy.

Amid this lockdown, it is very important to have a routine and divide time equally for exercise and other physical activities. “The key is to follow a routine of using cleanser, toner and moisturiser everyday. This will help the body follow a pattern,” says Vedika Sharma, founder of Mantra Herbal.

Stay hydrated and banish processed food

Processed food is not good for the skin. It affects both the body and skin negatively, especially when physical activities are reduced. The less processed the food, the better it is. Aashmeen says, “Unprocessed, fresh food will strengthen your immune system and also help in producing antioxidants, which are very important at this time. Drink fruit juice and coconut water. Eat fresh vegetables, fruits and salads.” Light food with fewer spices and a healthy soup are good for skin and body. Staying hydrated is the common solution for all the skin, hair or body problems. Vedika says, “It is extremely important to have clean and healthy eating habits during this time. We should keep ourselves hydrated at all times and drink about three litres of water every day. We should also hydrate our hands and moisturise them often as they get dry and dehydrated due to frequent washing and sanitising.”

Switch to natural ingredients

It is always better to use natural products for skin care instead of readymade cosmetic products. This time is the time to find the skin and hair care ingredients in your kitchen best suited to your needs.

Aashmeen says, “You can follow my tried and tested recipe. You will need a cucumber, tomato and a potato. Wash and grind all these. You can make its ice cubes and apply one cube daily. A tray will last for a week for the whole family. This will keep the skin glowing. At this time, when you are not able to go to the parlour, adopt this method to make your skin glow.” Dr Blossom too is on favour of digging into the kitchen for self care. “Personally, the reason why I feel it is the best time is because I can use things from my kitchen which are really fantastic and are filled with minerals and vitamins. Natural ingredients have no substitutes.”

Even for hair care we should use natural things like curd. “Do not use detergent-based shampoos and regularly massage your scalp for naturally shining hair,” says Dr Blossom.

Kill that dead skin

The season is changing and there are higher chances of dead cells accumulating on the surface of your skin leading to dull skin. Though we usually use an exfoliator to remove dead skin cells, here is a face pack by Aashmeen for different skin type. “For dead skin, add half teaspoon each of semolina and bran and mix with a teaspoon of gram flour to make the skin glow. If the skin is oily, then add rose water to this mixture. If the skin is normal, then mix with curd and if your skin remains very dry, make a pack with mustard oil. Vary the ingredients according to your skin type while keeping the gram flour, semolina and bran constant. Apply and leave for sometime. Remove the pack by moving your hands in circular motion. Keep moistening the pack by adding water in between. It helps in improving the blood circulation, makes the skin glow and also gets rid of dead skin.”

Following rise in equities, the market capitalisation of the BSE-listed firms zoomed Rs 7,71,377.02 crore to Rs 1,16,38,099.98 crore.

159,07-4-20,"Virus can last on face masks for a week, banknotes for days: Study","The novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can remain infectious on face masks for up to a week, and last on banknotes, stainless steel and plastic surfaces for days, according to a study. However, the virus can be killed by household disinfectants, bleach or frequent hand washing with soap and water, said the researchers from the University of Hong Kong (HKU).

The study found that the COVID-19 virus can stick to stainless steel and plastic surfaces for up to four days, and to the outer layer of a face mask for a week, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Monday.

The report, published in The Lancet journal, adds to a growing body of research about the stability of SARS-CoV-2 — as the novel coronavirus is formally known — and what can be done to prevent its transmission.

“SARS-CoV-2 can be highly stable in a favourable environment, but it is also susceptible to standard disinfection methods,” said the researchers, including Leo Poon Litman and Malik Peiris, both from HKU’s School of Public Health.

The researchers tested how long the virus could remain infectious at room temperature on a variety of surfaces.

On printing and tissue paper it lasted less than three hours, while on treated wood and cloth, it had disappeared by the second day. On glass and banknotes, the virus was still evident on the second day, but had gone by the fourth, while on stainless steel and plastic it was present for between four and seven days.

“Strikingly,” the researchers said, there was still a detectable level of infection on the outer layer of a surgical face mask after seven days. “This is exactly why it is very important if you are wearing a surgical mask you don’t touch the outside of the mask,” Peiris said.

“Because you can contaminate your hands and if you touch your eyes you could be transferring the virus to your eyes,” he was quoted by SCMP.

On all surfaces, the concentration of the virus reduced quite rapidly over time, the study said. The researchers said that the results did “not necessarily reflect the potential to pick up the virus from casual contact,” as the presence of the virus in the study was detected by laboratory tools, not fingers and hands as would be the case in everyday life.

A study by American researchers on the environmental stability of the coronavirus published last month in the journal Nature also concluded that it can remain infectious on some surfaces for days. They found the virus was present on plastic and steel for up to 72 hours, but did not last more than four hours on copper or 24 hours on cardboard. The findings from HKU add to the conversation about public health and hygiene, and what kinds of precautions people should take when bringing items like groceries into their homes.

Poon said hand washing remains at the top of the list, and it was theoretically possible for tins of food to carry enough live virus to cause an infection, but that the exact risk is yet to be established.

“If you want to protect yourself just maintain good hygiene, wash your hands often and try not to touch your face, your mouth or nose without cleaning first,” he said.

People who were particularly concerned might prefer to leave non-perishable items in their shopping bags in the kitchen for a day before handling them, he said. “That would reduce the viral concentration a lot. But the most important message is wash your hands,” he said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/virus-can-last-on-face-masks-for-a-week--banknotes-for-days--study.html
160,07-4-20,"IMF encouraged by recovery in China, but pandemic could resurge","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday cited limited but encouraging signs of recovery in China, the first country to suffer the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic, but said it could not rule out a resurgence of the pandemic in China and elsewhere.

In a blog, top IMF economists said the pandemic caused by the new coronavirus had pushed the world into a recession that would be worse than the global financial crisis, and called for a global, coordinated health and economic policy response. “The economic damage is mounting across all countries, tracking the sharp rise in new infections and containment measures put in place by Governments,” the IMF experts wrote. The total confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the world jumped to more than 1,288,000, with 70,600 deaths reported, according to a Reuters tally.

China was seeing a modest improvement in its purchasing manager surveys (PMIs) after sharp declines early in the year, and daily satellite data on nitrogen dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere - a proxy for industrial and transport activity - showed a gradual decline in containment measures, the IMF experts wrote. “The recovery in China, albeit limited, is encouraging, suggesting that containment measures can succeed in controlling the epidemic and pave the way for a resumption of economic activity,” the authors wrote.

“But there is huge uncertainty about the future path of the pandemic and a resurgence of its spread in China and other countries cannot be ruled out,” they added. European countries such as Italy, Spain, and France were now in acute phases of the outbreak, followed by the United States, while the epidemic appeared to be just beginning in many emerging market and developing economies.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/imf-encouraged-by-recovery-in-china--but-pandemic-could-resurge.html
161,07-4-20,France heading for worst recession since WWII: Minister,"France is likely to see its deepest recession since the end of World War II this year because of the coronavirus crisis, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire warned on Monday. “The worst growth figure in France since 1945 was -2.2 per cent in 2009, after the financial crisis of 2008. We will probably be very far beyond -2.2 per cent” this year, Le Maire told a Senate panel.

“It’s an indication of the amplitude of the economic shock we’re facing,” he said. France imposed a nationwide stay-at-home order from March 17 after shuttering all nonessential businesses. Officials have said the lockdown will last until at least April 15.

Statistics office Insee said last month that the lockdown has slashed overall economic activity by 35 percent, and estimated every month of shutdown would cut annual GPD by three percentage points. Services, heavy industry and construction are all taking big hits, Insee said, as factories are shut and only a handful of business sectors, such as supermarkets and pharmacies, remain open.

162,07-4-20,Stock markets rebound on easing virus crisis but oil dips,"Asian and European equity markets rebounded Monday as some of the world’s worst-hit countries reported falling death rates, providing much-needed hope in the battle against coronavirus, but oil prices sank after a meeting of top producers was delayed.

While deadly COVID-19 continues its deadly sweep across the planet, with more than 1.25 million now declared infected and nearly 70,000 dead, news out of Europe that the rise of fatalities was easing has lifted spirits on trading floors.

Italy reported its lowest daily death toll in two weeks, while Spanish officials said deaths fell for the third straight day and France reported its lowest daily toll in a week.

In early afternoon eurozone deals, Frankfurt stocks rallied 4.5 percent, Paris won 3.7 percent, Madrid gained 3.0 percent and Milan added 3.2 percent. “European markets are trading higher because investors are shrugging off the pessimism,” said AvaTrade analyst Naeem Aslam.

“They are focused on more optimistic things: the slowing death rate caused by coronavirus. Italy, Spain, France, and Germany have all seen declining numbers.” London jumped 2.1 percent nearing midday, with gains capped by news that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was hospitalised for precautionary tests after suffering “persistent” coronavirus symptoms for ten days.

The pound however rose as officials insisted that Johnson was “still very much in charge of the government”.

Elsewhere, South Korea saw the fewest new cases in six weeks, Australian new infections were also dropping and Donald Trump said the US was showing signs of stabilising, despite the number of cases there passing 335,000 — the highest in the world.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/stock-markets-rebound-on-easing-virus-crisis-but-oil-dips.html
163,07-4-20,Debate heats up over using an anti-malaria drug for COVID-19,"President Donald Trump and members of his administration are growing emphatic in promoting an anti-malaria drug not yet officially approved for fighting COVID-19, even though scientists say more testing is needed before it’s proven safe and effective against the virus.

Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro promoted the drug, hydroxychloroquine, in a television interviews Monday, a day after Trump publicly put his faith in the drug tolesson the toll of the coronavirus pandemic.

“What do I know, I’m not a doctor,” Trump told reporters Sunday. “But I have common sense.”

The administration’s promotion of the drug comes after a heated Situation Room meeting of the White House’s coronavirus task force on Saturday, in which Navarro challenged the top US. Infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci over his concerns about recommending the drug based only on unscientific anecdotal evidence.

Navarro, who has no formal medical training, erupted at Fauci, raising his voice and claiming that the reports of studies he collected were enough to recommend the drug widely, according to a person familiar with the exchange who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the Situation Room blow-up.

Fauci has repeatedly said that current studies provide only anecdotal findings that the drug works. Navarro told CNN on Monday, “I would have two words for you: ‘second opinion.’” Hydroxychloroquine is officially approved for treating malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, but not COVID-19. Small, preliminary studies have suggested it might help prevent the new coronavirus from entering cells and possibly help patients clear the virus sooner.

Two reports gave mixed results. A series of 11 patients in France found that an antibiotic-malaria drug combo did not improve how fast patients cleared the virus or their symptoms.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/debate-heats-up-over-using-an-anti-malaria-drug-for-covid-19.html
164,07-4-20,‘hardest’ week AHEAD,"The coronavirus threatened Americans with their hardest week in living memory on Monday and put Britain’s Prime Minister in hospital, despite early signs that some of Europe’s hardest-hit countries may be turning a corner.

More than 72,000 people have now died worldwide in the epidemic — some 50,000 of them in Europe— and, as the human tragedy continues to escalate, the global economy is plunging into what leaders warn will be a historic recession. More than 1.3 million declared cases have now been registered around the world.

The US surgeon general compared the likely impact of the epidemic in the week ahead to 9/11 or Pearl Harbour and France warned of the worst economic slump since World War II.

In London, Prime Minister Boris Johnson remained in hospital on Monday but was in “good spirits” after being admitted for tests for “persistent” coronavirus symptoms.

“The Prime Minister had a comfortable night in St Thomas’ Hospital in London and is in good spirits,” Johnson’s spokesman said, adding that the 55-year-old British premier remains “under observation”. Johnson tested positive for the virus 10 days ago, and despite his hospitalisation his housing minister Robert Jenrick said the leader was still “in charge” of the Government as the country grapples with the continuing crisis.

It was a mixed picture in Europe, where countries already ravaged by deadly COVID-19 outbreaks reported lower numbers of new infections and, in Austria and Italy, began thinking about easing lockdown restrictions.

The new coronavirus has reached almost every corner of the planet, confining nearly half of humanity to their homes and turning life upside down for billions.

About three quarters of all deaths have been clocked in Europe, and the US now has the most recorded cases of any country — along with a steadily rising death toll.

“This is going to be the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans’ lives, quite frankly,” US Surgeon General Jerome Adams told Fox News ahead of what is expected to be a tough week for already hard-pressed American healthcare providers.

Italy’s daily coronavirus death toll shot up to 636 on Monday, just one day after dropping to its lowest level in over two weeks, the civil protection service said. The number of fatalities had fallen to 525 on Sunday, the lowest since March 19. Italy’s total number of deaths officially attributed to COVID-19 rose to 16,523, more than in any other country.

In Spain, nurse Empar Loren said, “The situation is more stable. The number of patients in intensive care is not growing much anymore, and we are starting to discharge quite a few.”

Hard-hit Spain recorded deaths down for a fourth straight day on Monday — but still logged 637 fatalities.

At a field hospital set up at a Madrid conference centre, staff applauded whenever a patient was healthy enough to be sent home. The effective mothballing of the global economy is beginning to hit hard with analysts warning millions of jobs will be lost despite unprecedented stimulus programmes.

Germany announced that the Government would guarantee loans for small businesses but France was gloomy, with Finance Minister Bruno le Maire estimating that the 2020 crunch would be “far beyond” the previous post-1945 worst case.

Despite the gloom, heartwarming examples of humanity around the globe have lifted spirits, with ordinary people doing what they can to help those on the medical front line. In a Barcelona restaurant, chefs flipped burgers to deliver to nurses and doctors.

“When you deliver the food and you see they’re happy, that makes us happy and it makes us stronger,” said delivery man Daniel Valls.

And in the southern Italian city of Naples, a street artist lowered a “solidarity food basket” from his balcony, hollering: “If you can, put something in. If you can’t, take something out”. “We started by putting a piece of bread, a bag of pasta, a box of peeled tomatoes,” said English-language tutor Teresa Cardo, who also lowered a basket.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/---hardest----week-ahead.html
165,07-4-20,New anthem of hope,"Music heals.” This would definitely sound like an old saying but that’s the symphony that the nation needs now to win the Coronavirus battle. With this thought, some eminent Bollywood names have come together to bring about positivity and contribute towards a nationwide initiative through Muskurayega India. It’s a special track, released yesterday, which aims to give strength to Indians in these testing times.

Actor Akshay Kumar took to social media and shared the poster. He wrote, “At a time like this when our days are clouded with uncertainty and life has come to a standstill, bringing you a song of hope.”

Jackky Bhagnani also announced about the song. He said, “Phir hogi subah, phir jagmagayega India. Hum sab agar saath dein, toh jeet jayega India. #MuskurayegaIndia.”

He added, “This song is a humble tribute to bring smiles to the faces of all Indians. I personally felt the only thing that helps in times of uncertainty is hope so we came up with this song. A big thank you to all our friends who helped us bring this together. All proceeds from this song will go into supporting the central and state governments’ efforts to fight the virus. This is just a small tribute to the spirit of our country, to the power of 1.3 billion Indians.”

Hinting at the silver lining, the song marks the coming together of the film fraternity for a cause.

Commenting on the same, Akshay shared, “With the help of this song, we want the people to be certain of one thing — everything will go back to usual. All we need is a united stand against COVID-19. Aur phir Muskurayega India!”

Curated by Jackky’s music label JJust Music and composed and sung by the talented Vishal Mishra, Muskurayega India’s lyrics have been penned by Kaushal Kishore. The anthem is being presented by Cape of Good films And Jackky Bhagnani.

Other names like Tiger Shroff, Taapsee Pannu, Vicky Kaushal, Bhumi Pednekar, Kartik Aaryan, Kriti Sanon, Ayushmann Khurrana, Kiara Advani, Rajkummar Rao, Sidharth Malhotra, Rakulpreet Singh, Shikhar Dhawan and Ananya Pandey have also been a part of the song.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/new-anthem-of-hope-2020-04-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/new-anthem-of-hope.html
166,07-4-20,"India’s win in Aus because of Smith, Warner absence: Waqar","Former Pakistan captain Waqar Younis feels that India’s Test series victory in Australia back in 2018-19 could be largely attributed to the absence of Steve Smith and David Warner from a team that was already reeling due to the after effects of ball-tampering controversy.

The legendary fast bowler, who is also the bowling coach of Pakistan team was speaking in context of his country not being able to wn even one Test match since 1995.

“I am not trying to take away any credit from India, they played well and they are a very good side. But yes at same time when they won in Australia, there is no doubt that Australian cricket was going through a turmoil and there were problems in their dressing room. And they were without Steve Smith and David Warner,” Waqar said during a video conference.

Waqar himself is not sure as to what has been the reason behind Pakistan’s failure Down Under.

“I really don’t know why we have not won Tests their all these years. At times, we went there with top bowling attacks yet lost. To me it was a case of when the bowling worked the batting didn’t put up enough runs or when the batters put up enough runs the bowlers didn’t come through,” Waqar said.

For example the tour of of 1999, when the bowling attack had Waqar himself, the iconic Wasim Akram, fiery Shoaib Akhtar, along with all-rounder Abdul Razzaq and wily Saqlain Mushtaq but yet they lost 0-3.

But at same time he pointed out that in Tests, India had also generally struggled in Australia until 2018.

“You have to keep in mind that Australia is never an easy place to tour for any side. Look at the recent tour by New Zealand they are a top side and they lost badly. England have lost Ashes in Australia in a one-sided series.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india---s-win-in-aus-because-of-smith--warner-absence--waqar.html
167,07-4-20,Dhoni owns Malinga in IPL battles: Styris,"Former New Zealand all-rounder Scott Styris believes the IPL rivalry between Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians pits the game’s best finisher, M S Dhoni, against the best death bowler, Lasith Malinga, in which the former India captain owns the veteran Sri Lankan.

Super Kings have made 8 finals in 10 editions they have played in and Mumbai five in 12 editions, having won four out of those summit clashes.

“It’s about consistency, CSK have never missed the final series, have won the most knockout matches, it’s the expectation and reliance on these IPL teams to produce Indian players and CSK have produced the most uncapped players for India and it’s a real desire that they have to continue to develop players in that regard,” Styris told Star Sports.

“It’s about the best finisher in the game against the best finisher bowler. Dhoni vs Malinga and Dhoni owns Malinga,” he said.

Chennai may be the most consistent side in IPL history but of late Mumbai Indians have managed to gain an upper hand, feels former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar.

Reigning champions Mumbai Indians have won the IPL four times and Chennai Super Kings thrice.

“...When we look at winning percentage, which is a good way of looking at teams, a good winning record, CSK is right up there, but of late, there’s been a surge by Mumbai Indians coming through the ranks, winning titles as well,” Manjrekar told Star Sports.

“Mumbai Indians have won 4, CSK has won 3 but they have played less IPL (they were banned for two seasons). When you look at that, Mumbai Indians is emerging as a team that is threatening CSK in the last few years, they have actually been the better team than CSK, couple of IPL titles to MI.”

Mumbai had pipped Super Kings in the final of the previous edition.

“When MI come to the final, they tend to win it, CSK not as much. When you look at the entire IPL, CSK go first, but of late, may be Mumbai Indians have a slight edge.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dhoni-owns-malinga-in-ipl-battles--styris.html
168,07-4-20,Not over yet,"Unfazed by people’s opinion Sushil preparing for 2021 Tokyo Games

“People have this habit of writing me off every now and then but it does not affect me,” says veteran wrestler Sushil Kumar, quashing talk of retirement and insisting that postponement of Tokyo Olympics has given him a very good shot at qualifying for his fourth Games.

The 36-year-old was struggling to make cut for Olympics, postponed to 2021.

The showpiece, originally scheduled for July-August this year, was expected to be a swansong for veterans such as Sushil and tennis ace Leander Paes. But the one-year delay seems to have caused a change of plans.

Set to turn 37 next month, Sushil said, “I am not going anywhere as of now. I have got more time and more time means better preparation.”

Making a comeback at the 2019 World Championship, Sushil showed glimpses of the form that made him look invincible in his prime before he lost steam and made an early exit.

That disappointment is, however, already behind him.

“Wrestling is such a sport that if you manage to remain injury-free, practice well, set a target and work on that, you can have a shot at your goal,” said Sushil, the only Indian to win two Olympic medals.

“I am still practising twice a day. Obviously I am not hitting the mat but I am trying to be in shape and God willing, I will be able to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics,” he added.

Sushil competes in the 74kg category in which India is yet to lock quota. Will he be able to beat the slowing reflexes?

“People were saying similar things in 2011. I know how to handle this. It’s my daily job to manage it.”

Sushil was referring to doubts cast in 2011 over his ability to repeat his Beijing’s Bronze medal-winning show at the 2012 London Games. However, he ended up winning a Silver in London.

The delay in Olympics has also brought Sushil’s old foe Narsingh Yadav into the equation since his four-year doping ban will be over in July, making him eligible to take a shot at Oly qualification.

The Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) has already said it will allow Narsingh to make a comeback.

Narsingh was preferred over Sushil for the 2016 Games but it all ended in disaster when the former failed a dope test. Sushil’s demand for a trial was turned down by the federation as well as the Delhi High Court and he was even accused, without a shred of evidence, of sabotaging Narsingh in some quarters.

When asked about possibility of a face off, Sushil said, “We will see when the time comes. What can I say now about this.

Jitender Kumar is also doing a decent job as he recently won a Bronze in 74kg at the Asian Championship.

Sushil, it seems, does not consider any of the compatriots his real rivals.

When asked about the competition he is likely to face from fellow Indians, he said, “If you think small, you will achieve nothing. I am thinking about the international wrestlers, who are my likely rivals.

“Like there is one Uzbekistan guy, who won Asian Games Gold (Bekzod Abdurakhmonov). He is really good, my preparations are keeping in mind these wrestlers.

“I am keeping an eye on everyone. I am analysing everyone. If I think about the small targets, it won’t lead me anywhere,” he signed off.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/not-over-yet-2020-04-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/not-over-yet.html
169,07-4-20,"At times, cricketers hurt national interest due to easy T20 money: Waqar Younis","Pakistan bowling coach Waqar Younis feels the ""easy money"" on offer at mushrooming T20 leagues is, at times, making cricketers inconsiderate towards national interest.

Waqar said Mohammed Aamir and Wahab Riaz's decision to quit red-ball cricket last year was one such instance in which their personal goals ended up adversely affecting the national team. Aamir's decision to quit at an age of 27 caused quite a stir.

""These leagues offer easy money for players who can remain in comfort as they have to bowl just four overs,"" Waqar said in a conference call with journalists on Monday.

""But at times, while thinking about their comfort zone players don't think how much damage they can do to national interest. They don't think about the broader picture,"" he added.

Waqar also criticised Aamir and Wahab for the way they announced their decision.

""If you are sitting on social media and announcing your decision it really hurts. They should have informed their management or board first. They should have discussed it first. It is unfortunate they did this because of this we had to suffer a bit,"" he said.

""But I wouldn't say we are lost or anything. If they have taken their decisions fine. But we have no grudge against them. I still think they both have cricket left in them.

""They should carry on playing white ball cricket if they are selected for Pakistan. Yes they did leave the team in a difficult situation at that time,"" he added.

He noted that head coach and chief selector Misbah-ul-Haq has spoken about having a policy where the board and management is aware of players wanting to quit Test cricket.

""I think there should be a policy based on which players quit Test cricket but we can't put any restrictions even by law. Players should take decisions by coordinating with the board because it hurts the team,"" he said.

Waqar did not believe there was any communication gap between players and the board which led to this situation.

He also spoke about Pakistan pacer Hasan Ali not being able to play for Pakistan since the last World Cup and said injuries had hurt him.

Pakistan's former bowling coach Azhar Mahmood has claimed that Hasan's injury was prolonged and affected his fitness because he was made to lift heavy weights in the gym.

Waqar said this was the first time he had heart about this.

""I don't know how Azhar knows this while sitting in England but what I know is that injuries hurt him. Look fast bowlers will also have fitness issues. It is difficult that a fast bowler will never get injured.

""One has to tough and smart as a fast bowler to have a long career. But Hasan is an asset to Pakistan cricket and he is very aggressive and we need him as he is a fine cricketer. Hopefully he will be back soon,"" he said.

170,07-4-20,Coronavirus not an opportunity for athletes to dope: WADA president,"Athletes are fooling themselves if they think they can use the chaos caused globally by the coronavirus pandemic to cheat, World Anti-Doping Agency president Witold Banka has told AFP.

The Pole said physical testing might be virtually at a standstill but WADA and national anti-doping agencies possessed other weapons they can deploy in the fight against doping.

Canada and Russia have gone public in saying they have suspended their testing programmes while the British anti-doping body has significantly reduced its testing.

""COVID-19 is not a space for the athletes to cheat,"" Banka said in a phone interview from his home in Poland.

""They should not feel it is a time for cheating. Otherwise, the anti-doping agencies will use their weapons to catch them.""

The 35-year-old former Polish sports minister, who only took up his post on January 1 after being elected to replace Craig Reedie, said he hoped it would not take long once the pandemic was over to return testing to its ""full power"".

In the meantime WADA would rely on other means to keep tabs on athletes.

""Testing is not our only weapon and we have some strong ones,"" Banka said.

""There is the athlete biological passport, there is long-term analysis of samples, there is intelligence.

""The biological passport is a useful tool for the profile of the athletes.

""Also they are still obliged to tell us of their whereabouts even if we cannot go and test them.""

Banka is mindful however that on a global basis, combating the coronavirus is the number one priority.

""Anti-doping is not as important as people's lives,"" he said.

The former international 400 metres runner said he had been in regular contact with leading sports bodies including the International Olympic Committee and the National Anti-Doping Organizations to discuss the current situation.

""We issued guidelines for them that cover a number of areas that may be affected by COVID-19.""

'Cause for concern'

The pandemic has forced Banka to put on hold several ideas he wants to implement, especially a bid to increase funding for the anti-doping fight.

""I am pursuing the idea of a Solidarity Fund to serve regions like Africa, for example, where they have very limited anti-doping systems (there is just one accredited laboratory in South Africa),"" he said.

""We are still working on that, this is a very important issue."" He aims to encourage sponsors and corporate partners to back the fight against doping with hard cash.

""The idea is to get them to contribute a minimum of their sponsorship investment in sport (to anti-doping efforts).""

Such corporate involvement could go some way to resolving an age-old problem for WADA, and one Reedie frequently raised -- that their budget is insufficient for the size of the task they face.

""We are a strong organisation with powerful tools,"" said Banka.

""But taking into account our budget, 36-40 million a year, that is not in line with the expectations towards the organisation expressed by our stakeholders. We want, or rather have to, increase it.

""That is why we are looking for some alternative sources of funding.""

Banka said proudly that WADA ""plays many roles"" and achieves a lot even with the budget constraints but stresses that with extra funding ""it could do a lot more"".

""One aspect we would like to address is that at the 2016 Rio Games, 10 percent of the medallists came from countries who either have very weak anti-doping systems or none at all,"" he said.

""That is a cause for concern and one which we should have the capability to address.

""That would be possible if sponsors were willing to contribute to the Solidarity Fund."" Banka said the coronavirus pandemic would not deter WADA from its over-riding goal.

""This is a new world for all of us,"" he said.

""WADA, though, will do everything to maintain the integrity and beautiful idea of clean sport.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus-not-an-opportunity-for-athletes-to-dope--wada-president-2020-04-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/coronavirus-not-an-opportunity-for-athletes-to-dope--wada-president.html
171,07-4-20,Japan ends Olympic flame display due to virus,"The Olympic flame will be removed from display in Japan, officials said Tuesday, as the country braces for a state of emergency due to the coronavirus that also forced the historic postponement of Tokyo 2020.

It had been on public display in the northeastern Fukushima region since last week, but Japanese Olympic organisers decided to shelve it as coronavirus cases climb in the country.

The ill-fated flame, lit in Greece, arrived in Japan on March 20 for a torch relay originally scheduled to start six days later and climax at the Olympics opening ceremony on July 24.

But the raging pandemic prompted the first postponement of the Games in peace-time, with the opening ceremony now slated to take place on July 23, 2021.

To keep the Olympic spirit alive in Japan, local organisers decided to maintain the flame in a lantern and display it in Fukushima, where the torch relay was going to start.

""Originally we wanted to hold the public display until the end of April. But considering recent developments, we decided to stop,"" said a Tokyo 2020 organising committee spokesman.

He declined to comment on where the flame will be stored, saying that organisers had no immediate plan to show it to the public and hoped to prevent people from congregating around the storage location.

The flame has had a troubled journey due to the coronavirus since being lit in ancient Olympia without spectators to avoid spreading the disease.

The Greek leg of the torch relay was scrapped when large crowds mobbed Hollywood actor Gerard Butler as he lit a cauldron in the town of Sparta.

The flame arrived to a muted welcome in northern Japan in front of a few dozen officials and guests, after plans to invite 200 schoolchildren were abandoned.

It then attracted large crowds in Japan despite calls from organisers to avoid mass gatherings because of the virus.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/japan-ends-olympic-flame-display-due-to-virus-2020-04-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/japan-ends-olympic-flame-display-due-to-virus.html

Amid the Coronavirus pandemic, a slew of celebrities, including Amitabh Bachchan, Rajinikanth, Chiranjeevi, Priyanka Chopra, Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt among many others, have come together to create awareness about COVID-19 through a short film, titled Family.

Conceptualised and virtually directed by Prasoon Pandey in collaboration with Big B, the film will show that staying at home, staying safe, maintaining hygiene, working from home and maintaining social distancing can be productive and should be taken in one's stride.

Family will be premiered across Sony Network on Monday at 9 pm.

‘It is not only Corona that we are tackling. We are also dealing with something much bigger that's affecting the world economy, the food that people are getting, our daily wage earners and just everyone. But we're in this together. So I think the best thing we can do right now is just be at home, be safe and keep donating.’

—Jacqueline Fernandez

Actor Mugdha Godse says that lockdown has given us time to reboot ourselves.

Talking about daily wage earners, she said, “Once this lockdown is over, the economy is going to topple and there is going to be a huge recession. Many companies are going to have backlog and things are going to change. I don't know the exact ratio but it's going to hit the market severely. I do agree daily wagers are suffering now but once everything is stable, I am sure the government will take care of them. There are also many NGOs which are coming forward and doing the needful. The economy will need time.”

‘My time in India was unforgettable’

Hollywood star Chris Hemsworth says he was “incredibly excited” about coming to India to celebrate his forthcoming Netflix film Extraction.

The actor was scheduled to reach Mumbai on March 16 to promote the film that has been shot in India. The tour was called off due to Coronavirus pandemic.

In a desi way, Hemsworth sent his love to India in a video, “Namaste India! Chris here, all the way from Australia. As you may have heard, I was incredibly excited to come to India and celebrate this film where it was filmed. My time in India during production was unforgettable and I was looking forward to returning,” he said.

The World Cup, originally scheduled to be held from March 15-26, was postponed to May barely four days before the start of the event.

176,07-4-20,"F1 in ‘very fragile state’, warns McLaren boss","McLaren boss Zak Brown on Sunday said that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged Formula One into “a very fragile state”, warning that as many as four teams could even be driven out of business.

The 2020 world championship has been unable to start with eight races of a scheduled 22 already either scrapped or postponed.

“This is potentially devastating to teams, and if (it is devastating) to enough teams then it’s very threatening to F1 as a whole,” Brown told the BBC on the eve of a meeting planned to discuss cost-cutting in the sport.

Brown insisted that all the teams have agreed to lower the 2021 budget cap to $150m (138.7 million euros) down from $175 million.

However, he said the ceiling needs to be reduced further to counter the financial fall-out from the virus-hit season.

“Could I see — through what is going on right now in the world if we don’t tackle this situation head on very aggressively — two teams disappearing? Yeah,” said Brown.

“In fact, I could see four teams disappearing if this isn’t handled the right way.

“And then, given how long it takes to ramp up an F1 team, and given the economic and health crisis we are in right now, to think there would be people lined up to take over those teams like there has historically been... I don’t think the timing could be worse from that standpoint.

178,07-4-20,Oz will struggle to dominate in sub-continent till spinners are encouraged: O'Keefe,"The just-retired Steve O’Keefe has rued that spinners are not allowed to win matches in Australian cricket, saying the country will struggle to dominate in the sub-continent until the issue is not addressed.

O’Keefe, the New South Wales left-arm spinner who took 301 first-class wickets at 24.66 and earned nine Test caps, ended his first-class career recently after being denied a new contract by his state.

After calling it quits, he has urged that spinners be given more opportunities to shine.

“We have so much talent in this country, spin-bowling depth. I look across at the top two spinners in each state that I really think there’s so much quality,” O’Keefe was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo.

“The problem is that they aren’t being encouraged enough to be given a ball in the first ten overs and being told to win a game of cricket. The conditions haven’t allowed them to express themselves.”

On their last Test tour of India, Australia were thrashed by Virat Kohli’s team and even though they came from behind to win an ODI rubber before the 2019 World Cup, the Aussies finished second best in the 50-over face-offs earlier this year.

“When you want to win overseas, spinners are the ones who have to win you games. But go back and have a look at Shield cricket.

“I’m the leading wicket-taker this year with 16 wickets and played five games. I’ve not had a match-winning role in any of the games,” O’Keefe said.

“When you go to these places, it’s all on your spinners; they have got to be people who are mentally tough and have the skill. It is a matter of urgency, if we are going to win over there to make sure we encourage these guys.”

180,07-4-20,AgustaWestland: Christian Michel's interim bail plea citing coronavirus risk in jail dismissed,"The Delhi High Court has dismissed the plea of Christian Michel James, an alleged middleman arrested in connection with the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam cases by the CBI and ED, seeking interim bail on the ground of the risk of contracting coronavirus in Tihar jail.

Justice Mukta Gupta, who conducted the hearing through video conferencing, said the apprehension of Michel that because of his vulnerable age and overcrowding in jail he is likely to contact COVID-19 which may be detrimental to his health, is unfounded.

The probe agencies opposed the interim bail plea.

The 59-year-old Michel claimed that his health condition was critical and incompatible with the current prison status, especially to cope with the risk of contracting COVID-19 infection which could have a lethal effect on him as he is already suffering from serious pathologies.

Michel, extradited from Dubai, was arrested by the ED on December 22, 2018.

On January 5 last year, he was sent to judicial custody in the ED case. He is also in judicial custody in another case registered by the CBI in connection with the scam.

Michel is among the three alleged middlemen being probed in the case by the ED and the CBI. The other two are Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa.

181,07-4-20,Tiger habitats in India on alert after tigress found Covid +ve in US,"Zoos and tiger habitats across the country have been put on high alert after a 4-year-old Malayan tigress was found positive for coronavirus at Bronx Zoo in New York in the US. It is said to be the first known infection of the virus in an animal in the United States or anywhere in the world.

Not taking chance, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and Central Zoo Authority (CZA), both statutory bodies under the Union Environment Ministry monitoring tiger reserves and zoos respectively, on Monday issued an advisory to the States asking them to keep tabs on Covid-like respiratory signs of nasal discharge, breathing problems or coughing among the animals.

There are around 2,967 tigers in the wild in 50 tiger reserves and their periphery and another 390 big cats in 145 CZA recognised zoos across the States.

“On Monday, we directed chief wildlife wardens (CWLWs) of all tiger-bearing States that owing to the communicable and zoonotic nature of the disease, big cats may be observed for symptoms of Covid-19 to avert the disease in wild tigers,” said NTCA member-secretary Anup Kumar Nayak.

The NTCA advisory states tigers must be observed for Covid-like respiratory signs of nasal discharge, coughing and laboured breathing through direct observation to the extent possible, and also through camera trap.

“The CWLWs should ensure that personnel handling tigers in human-tiger negative interactions and translocation operations are coronavirus negative. They should take due precaution as advised by the Union Health Ministry,” said Nayak.

The NTCA has also called for exercising diligence while handling post-mortem cases and collecting samples for coronavirus diagnosis. “It should be in consultation with the state veterinary officials while safeguarding oneself through appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE),” it said.

“As coronaviruses are known to affect gastrointestinal system in felines, requisite correlation may be made for characterizing the virus type in consultation with the State veterinary department. Differential diagnosis with feline infectious rhino-tracheitis needs to be made as similar respiratory symptoms may be observed,” said the NTCA advisory.

For Covid-19 diagnosis as well as differential diagnoses and characterisation, the NTCA has asked States to send samples to approved laboratories of the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR).

The States have also been asked to gear up frontline staff as well as veterinary officials engaged in monitoring tiger mortality to detect the disease and prevent any spread in tigers in the wild. Being a notifiable disease, any positive case needs to be reported immediately to the NTCA for onward transmission to authorities concerned.

Similarly, CZA member-secretary SP Yadav in his advisory issued to the zoos’ heads and the respective departments asked to watch the animals through CCTVs for any abnormal symptoms. “We have instructed that zoo keepers and animal handlers should not be allowed near the cages without safety gear,” Yadav said.

The CZA member-secretary said mammals like carnivores, especially cats, ferret and primates need to be monitored carefully every fortnight for Covid-19 while following all bio-containment and safety measures required to handle this high risk pathogen.

“For safety of zoo personnel we have asked all the zoos to coordinate with designated government agencies responsible for public health response and screening,” said Yadav.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tiger-habitats-in-india-on-alert-after-tigress-found-covid--ve-in-us-2020-04-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/tiger-habitats-in-india-on-alert-after-tigress-found-covid--ve-in-us.html
182,07-4-20,"Prez, PM, MPs take 30% pay cut for 1 yr","The Union Cabinet on Monday decided to “temporarily suspend” MPLAD funds for two years and approved an Ordinance to cut 30 per cent of salary and pension of MPs and former MPs.

The Opposition slammed the decision to suspend MPLAD scheme and Left parties said the decisions reflected the dire straits of the Indian economy.

Citing the age-old adage that “charity begins at home”, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar told the media that President, Prime Minister, Ministers and Governors also decided voluntarily to take salary cut. “The money will go to Consolidated Fund of India,” said Javadekar.

There 788 MPs in Parliament (543 in the Lok Sabha and 245 in the Rajya Sabha). The one-year deduction of 30 per cent of the salary could save around Rs 60 crore, according to officials. The pension reduction of all the former MPs will also save around Rs 100 crore, they said.

The Cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was conducted through video conferencing.

“The Cabinet approves Ordinance amending the Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament Act, 1954 reducing allowances and pension by 30 per cent w.e.f. April 1, 2020 for a year.

“The President, Vice President, Governors of States have also voluntarily decided to take a pay cut as a social responsibility. The Cabinet approves temporary suspension of MPLADS during 2020-21 and 2021-22 for managing health and adverse impact of outbreak of COVID-19 in the country,” said the Government in a statement.

Every MP is allotted Rs 5 crore per year in MPLAD fund to undertake constituency specific developmental and emergency works. Rs 7,880 crore big fund usages is now suspended for two years, which is expected to seriously affect the developmental works in constituencies. The MP fund is preferred as it is very hassle free for development and construction works.

Many schools, hospital buildings, equipment in hospitals, and construction of small roads across India were created by using MPLAD funds.

While Home Minister Amit Shah hailed the decisions, the Congress and TMC were quick to oppose the decision to suspend the MPLAD scheme.

“Parliament of the world’s largest democracy stands together in these challenging times. I thank all the parties and MPs for their support,” said Shah.

While supporting the decision to deduct the salary of MPs, Congress and Trinamool Congress criticised the suspension of MPLADS. The Left parties took a pot shot at Centre and questioned the state of economy of the Modi Government which forced them to take such decision. They also accused the Centre of fudging data.

“Please note that MPLAD fund is meant to execute developmental works in the constituency. Suspending MPLAD fund is a disservice step to the constituents and it will undermine their role and functions,” said Congress party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala.

Senior Congress Ahmed Patel “welcomed” the Cabinet pay cut decision, saying “in difficult times it is necessary that we help citizens”.

“As a Member of Parliament, I welcome the Government’s decision to cut the salaries of MPs. In this difficult time, this is the least we can do to help fellow citizens,” he tweeted.

Senior party leader and former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh went against the party’s stand and welcomed the Government’s decision on MPLADS.

“I welcome the decision on MPLADS. I have been arguing for long that the approximately Rs 7,000 crore given to MPs & MLAs annually for development works should be used as a corpus for State funding of elections,” Ramesh said.

CPI-M General Secretary Sitaram Yechury, however, accused the Government of “fudging data”, and said it had pushed the economy “steeply downhill” even before Covid-19.

“Transfer of money to the Consolidated Fund of India, instead of being directed towards fighting COVID-19, shows that it is a measure to deal with the economic destruction caused in the past six years,” Yechury said.

Saugata Roy, Lok Sabha MP representing the Trinamool Congress said though he had no issues with the cut in salary for MPs, he opposed the two-year suspension of MPLADS.

On Monday when Mumbai recorded four more deaths and 34 positive cases taking the total number of deaths and infected cases in the metropolis to 34 and 492 respectively, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) sealed the Wockhardt Hospital at Agripdad in south Mumbai, after 26 nurses and three doctors tested positive for Covid-19 during the past one week.

Earlier on Wednesday last, the Jaslok Hospital — acting on the directives of the BMC — stopped new admissions and shut down its outpatient department (OPD) after one of its staff members tested positive for Covid.

Elsewhere in Pune, at least 92 staff members of DY Patil Hospital, including doctors and nurses, were moved out of the main hospital premises and quarantined in neighbouring on the same premises, after a road accident victim, who was treated at the hospital, tested positive for the pandemic.

The closure of Wockhardt Hospital was triggered by a tweet put by leader of the Opposition in Kerala Assembly Ramesh Chennithala, saying: “Called Maharashtra Health Minister Shri. Rajesh Tope ji @rajeshtope11 seeking urgent intervention to ensure safety of 40 Covid19 positive Malayalee nurses working @ a pvt hospital in Mumbai”.

Following closure, the hospital has barred the entry and exit from its premises.

The hospital closure came a day after the BMC declared it as containment zone

BMC’s Additional Municipal Commissioner Suresh Kakani said the staffers of the hospital would not be allowed to go out of the premises until they tested negative for a coronavirus test.

Laying the blame at the door of the hospital management for its failure to take precautionary measures, Kakani said: “The hospital management failed to take precautionary measures. As a consequence, nearly 300 staffers have been quarantined. The BMC has set up a team to look into how the virus spread among so many people in a hospital setting,” he said.

Informed sources in the Wockhardt Hospital said two positiveCovid-19 patients were brought to the hospital from Kasturba Gandhi Hospital on March 20 and they were kept along in a general ICU ward instead of isolation ward, and that too along with non-Covid-19 patients, which said to have resulted in large-scale infection in the hospital.

In a related development, the problem at the Jaslok Hospital came to light after a nurse working at the hospital put out a video message - in which she said that one staffer had contracted Covid-19 - in social media which went viral.

Taking serious cognisance of the video message, the BMC health officials held a meeting with the hospital management and ascertained what the nurse alleged was indeed true

Following the meeting, the Jaslok Hospital on Wednesday stopped the new admissions and closed down its OPD for an indefinite period.

Meanwhile, as many as 92 staff members, including several doctors and nurses, in Pune’s DY Patil Hospital were quarantined on Monday, after an accident victim, who was being treated at the facility, tested positive for Covid-19.

Confirming the development, Jitendra Bhawalkar, dean of the DY Patil Medical College and Hospital said that an autorickshaw driver, who had met with the accident on March 31, had been admitted to the emergency section of the hospital on March 31 after the accident. “The accident victim was operated upon and on the second day, he developed fever. The doctors got suspicious and his samples were sent for testing which came out positive for Covid-19,” he said.

“After we received the report of the autorickshaw driver having testing positive, we tried to ascertain as to who all in the hospital had come in contact with the man. Not wanting to take any chances, we quarantined our 42 doctors and 50 paramedical staff members as a precaution. Samples of all of them have been sent for tests,” Bhawalkar said.

The Hospital management has, meanwhile, de-contaminated the operation theatre where the autorickshaw driver was operated. The affected nurses and doctors have shifted to a separate isolation ward located adjacent to the main hospital in the same premises.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/2----infected----mumbai-hospitals-shut-2020-04-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/2----infected----mumbai-hospitals-shut.html
184,07-4-20,"Trump talks tough, warns of 'retaliation' if India doesn't export Hydroxychloroquine to US","President Donald Trump has warned India that the US may retaliate if it did not export anti-malarial drug Hydroxychloroquine despite his personal request, saying he would be surprised in case of a negative outcome as New Delhi has good relations with Washington.

Hydroxychloroquine, an old and inexpensive drug used to treat malaria, is seen as a viable therapeutic solution by President Trump to coronavirus that has so far killed more than 10,000 Americans and infected over 3.6 lakh within weeks.

Last week Trump said he has sought help from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow the sale of Hydroxychloroquine tablets ordered by the US to treat the growing number of coronavirus patients in his country, hours after India banned the export of the anti-malarial drug.

""I would be surprised if he would, you know, because India does very well with the United States,"" Trump told reporters during a press briefing at the White House on Monday.

Last month, India imposed a ban on the export on Hydroxychloroquine, on which Trump is now banking heavily for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

India has received similar requests from several other countries including its immediate neighbours Sri Lanka and Nepal. India has said that it is reviewing its export ban order.

Notably, India's decision to ban the exports of Hydroxychloroquine is driven by its desire to take stock of the domestic requirements and ensure that the country has enough in its kitty.

Reiterating that for many years, India has been taking advantage of the US on trade, Trump said that he would be surprised if New Delhi was to stop export of Hydroxychloroquine to the US.

""So, I would be surprised if that were his decision. He'd have to tell me that. I spoke to him Sunday morning, called him, and I said we'd appreciate your allowing our supply to come out. If he doesn't allow it to come out, that would be okay, but of course there may be retaliation. Why wouldn't there be?"" Trump said.

His remarks came at a time when both countries are in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has recommended the anti-malarial drug for those involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of the coronavirus and also, for the asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases.

On Monday, a senior State Department official said that India has been a significant partner of the US in the pharmaceutical sector and it expects similar cooperation to continue between the economies.

India has long been a significant partner of the United States in the pharmaceutical sector, Alice G Wells, the Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia, told reporters during a press briefing.

The Trump administration has already created a national strategic stockpile of 29 million doses of the malaria drug, anticipating that its test results on more than 1,500 COVID-19 patients in New York is yielding positive results.

Global scientists, racing against time to find either a vaccine or a therapeutic cure to the virus, have begun testing Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as candidates for potential COVID-19 treatments and the FDA last week issued an Emergency Use Authorization for the prescription of the drugs in certain circumstances.

In addition to New York, COVID-19 patients in several States are being treated with Hydroxychloroquine, including Michigan and Texas.

Based on some initial results, the Trump administration is banking heavily on using Hydroxychloroquine for the successful treatment of coronavirus.

According to Trump, the drug is yielding positive results. If successful, he told reporters that it would be a gift from heaven.

185,07-4-20,Manage COVID-19,"Time and again, doctors are highlighting the importance of having strong immunity to keep coronavirus and other infections away. ARCHANA JYOTI tells you more

There is an adage: Prevention is better than cure. It still stands true, particularly at a time when the entire world is grappling with the deadly Covid-19 which has claimed over 80,000 lives and there seems to be no stopping. As a preventive measure from the virus that primarily affects the lungs and respiratory system, the importance of immunity has been stressed upon once again.

Strong immunity is necessary to fight any kind of foreign body or disease. People with poor immune system tend to be more prone to face the wrath of infections.

While following a healthy diet and lifestyle is the first and foremost way to strengthen one’s immunity, there are certain foods and herbs that can speed up the process with their immune-boosting properties, say experts.

Luckily, we have Ayurveda treasure trove that needs to be explored once again, as a good immunity may perhaps sail us through the Coronavirus crisis, said Dr AKS Rawat, former CSIR scientist.

In fact, underscoring the need of good health and strong immunity, Prime Minister Narendra Modi too recently emphasised on the need to look towards our traditional medicine system. He said that he has been witnessing a rise in the discussion on topics related to fitness, staying healthy and boosting the immune system. “This is a great sign,” he said as he urged people to make the protocol by Union Ayush Ministry a part of their lives and also share them with others.

Sanchit Sharma from herbal products manufacturing firm, AIMIL Pharma agrees that immunity will be “our saviour” against the virus. “Also, a healthy immune system will help in recovery from the coronavirus infection, Sharma adds.

The firm offers herbal drug Fifatrol, a multi-drug combination of classical ayurvedic medicines and herbs like mrityunjay rasa, sanjeevani vati, tulsi and giloe which are some of the Ayurvedic herbs that are helpful in building the immunity and preventing the infection.

These herbs also help increase the production of interferons (proteins) and antibodies to generate an immune response against viruses and increase the rate of phagocytosis to destroy microorganisms, thus, increasing immunity from containing viral infections, Dr Rawat adds.

Dr Partap Chauhan, Director, Jiva Ayurveda advices not to panic. He tells uou that fear and negativity reduces immunity. Excessive mental stress also affects our digestion and thus causes formation of “ama”, a toxic material that is responsible for causing many diseases.

“Maintaining hygiene is the best way to prevent the virus from entering the body. Wash hands often with soap and water, use sanitisers, cover nose while sneezing, and avoid visiting busy and crowded places. Performing agnihotra/yagya or burning havan samagri (a mixture of herbs) keeps home and environment free from germs,” adds Dr Chauhan.

187,07-4-20,Dockyard : Dos and don’ts for Diabetics,"In shortage of stevia, Diabetics should not use artificial sweeteners beyond the recommended quantity. If possible try to drink tea/coffee without sugar

April 7 of each year marks the celebration of World Health Day. Ever since its inception, the celebration has aimed to create awareness of a specific health theme to highlight a priority area of concern for the World Health Organisation. Over the past 50 years this has brought to light important health issues. The celebration is marked by activities which extend beyond the day itself and serves as an opportunity to focus worldwide attention on these important aspects of global health.

This year on World Health Day we are facing the challenge of COVID-19. It is observed that Diabetics are at high risk of having infection from Corona Virus as compared to normal people. Also because of the lockdown, it is becoming difficult to follow optimal diet and exercise patterns, hence special attention to Diabetics is needed so that they can gain health, build immunity and fight the pandemic.

Here are few do’s and don’ts for Diabetics during the time of COVID-19-

Firstly, they should mentally adjust with the dietary and exercise constraints happily rather than complaining.

Do’s:

Dietary innovations: 25% grain, 25% daal and 50% cooked vegetables

Intermittent fasting with proper insulin/ medicine dose adjustments

Eat diet low in glycemic index which helps keep the blood sugars in normal range.

Add anti-diabetic food items in diet — bhindi (okra), tendli (kundru), cabbage, garlic, onion, cucumber and methi as is available.

Eat dal-based roti instead of grain.

Start meal with clear soup or methi soup.

Filtered mustard oil, coconut oil, sunflower oil, groundnut oil, rice bran oil and gingelly oil are preferred. Olive oil can be best used for salads.

Ensure eating food at the appropriate time, in appropriate amounts and in proper frequency.

Drink sufficient amount of water.

Sleep before 11 pm, maintain a proper sleeping time and time period.

Don’ts:

Do not eat white bread, chips, and pastries, which quickly increase blood sugar.

Avoid processed foods as they are rich in salt and oil.

Restrict fried and fatty foods.

Do not watch too much of TV especially while eating food.

Avoid table salt and restrict the use of salty processed foods.

Do not miss your medication.

Restrict refined and starchy food items such as maida, rava, white bread, potatoes, other tubers, processed foods and meats.

In shortage of stevia, do not use artificial sweeteners beyond the recommended quantity. If possible drink tea/coffee without sugar.

Exercise is must. Try to concentrate more on exercise than diet in this lockdown phase.

Being homebound means less activity, less mobility, less exercise thus increases the risk to other health problems because of lack of movement. Thus one should include certain homebound easy exercise to be physically active like super brain yoga and chair suryanamaskar. This is the best time to master pranayama and deep breathing exercise.

188,07-4-20,India to export ant-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine on case-by-case basis: MEA,"India has decided to export anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine to several countries including those in the neighbourhood on a case-by-case basis in sync with its commitment to the international community to fight the coronavirus pandemic, officials said on Tuesday.

Hydroxychloroquine is an old and inexpensive drug used to treat malaria.

Last month, India banned export of hydroxychloroquine in the midst of views that the drug could be used as potential anti-viral agent to protect healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients from the infection.

President Donald Trump has warned India that the US may retaliate if it did not export hydroxychloroquine despite his personal request, saying he would be surprised if New Delhi did not relent as it has good relations with Washington.

""India has always maintained that the international community must display strong solidarity and cooperation. This approach also guided our evacuation of nationals of other countries,"" Spokesperson in the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava said.

""In view of the humanitarian aspects of the pandemic, it has been decided that India would licence paracetamol and HCQ (hydroxychloroquine) in appropriate quantities to all our neighbouring countries who are dependent on our capabilities,"" he said while responding to media queries on the issue.

India has received requests from several other countries including its immediate neighbours Sri Lanka and Nepal for supply of hydroxychloroquine.

The suggestions came after Modi reached out to several opposition leaders, including Gandhi, on Monday.

In her letter to the prime minister, Gandhi also called for ordering proportionate reduction of 30 per cent in expenditure budget (other than salaries, pensions and central sector schemes) for the government of India.

All foreign visits of the president, prime minister, Union ministers, chief ministers, state ministers and bureaucrats must be put on hold, she said.

191,07-4-20,"Mehbooba Mufti being shifted to her official residence, detention continues","In a partial relief, former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, who was detained under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA), is being shifted to her official residence that has been converted into a subsidiary jail where she would continue to be in detention.

Mufti, who heads the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that was in alliance with the BJP till June 2018, was detained on August 5 last year when the Centre abrogated the special status of the erstwhile state and divided it into two Union Territories.

Initially, she was taken into preventive custody. Later on February 6 this year, she was slapped with the PSA along with another former chief minister Omar Abdullah, who was released recently.

According to an official order issued by the home department of the Union Territory, ""The government hereby orders the change of place of lodgement of Ms Mehbooba Mufti... to subsidiary jail, Fairview, Gupkar Road, Srinagar, with immediate effect.""

Mufti, who has completed eight months in detention, was lodged at a government bunglow on Maulana Azad Road near Lal Chowk. Fairview is the official residence of Mufti, which is located on the high-security Gupkar Road.

Reacting to the development, former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abduallah said that his political rival should be released and the PSA slapped on her should be revoked.

In a tweet, he said, ""Mehbooba Mufti must be set free. Shifting her home while continuing to keep her detained is a cop out.""

Mufti's daughter Iltija had moved a habeas corpus petition before the Supreme Court in February challenging her mother's detention.

A three-judge bench had issued a notice to the Jammu and Kashmir administration seeking its response on the plea and posted the matter for a hearing on March 18. However, the petition was not taken up for hearing due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Habeas corpus is a writ seeking production of a person supposed to be in illegal detention before a court.

192,07-4-20,News broadcasters body 'deplores' Sonia's suggestion of ban on media ads by govt,"The News Broadcasters Association (NBA) on Tuesday ""strongly deplored"" Sonia Gandhi's suggestion of imposing a ban on media advertisements by the government and PSUs for two years, saying the Congress president's call was ""highly demoralising"" for media personnel.

In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress president Sonia Gandhi made various suggestions for fighting COVID-19 including imposing a ""complete ban on media advertisements - television, print and online - by the government and Public Sectors Undertakings (PSUs) for a period of two years"".

NBA strongly deplores the suggestion by the Congress President to impose a complete ban on media advertisements, the news broadcasters body's president Rajat Sharma said in a statement.

""At a time when media personnel, without fearing for their lives, are doing their national duty by disseminating news on the pandemic, a statement like this from the Congress President is highly demoralizing,"" he said.

On one hand there has been a slump in advertisement revenues of electronic media due to recession, on the other hand it is suffering from financial blows due to nationwide lockdown of all industries and businesses, Sharma asserted.

""Moreover, news channels are spending heavily on providing safety to their reporters and production staff. To suggest a 'complete ban' on government and PSU advertisements is not only ill-timed, but highly arbitrary,"" he said.

193,07-4-20,3rd Tablighis; highest death toll 30 in a day,"Out of every four Covid-19 patients, three are male. The Union Health Ministry revealed this on Monday — on a day when nearly 500 new cases surfaced in India. The highest number of single-day deaths stood at 30 in the last 24 hours taking the total tally to 135 fatalities.

The Government data shows that women seem to be having a greater ability to fight against the infections than men as 73 per cent of the Covid-19 deaths have been reported in men, while 27 per cent of those have been in women.

“Seventy-six per cent of the coronavirus patients in India are men, while, 24 per cent of those are women,” said Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary in Union Health Ministry.

More than 4,500 positive cases have been reported in India by late Monday evening. As many as 1,445 cases are related to Tablighi Jamaat, 25,000 workers of whom and their contacts have been quarantined and five Haryana villages where they visited sealed. Globally, nearly 70,000 people have died and over 1.25 million tested positive.

Elderly people remain a high risk population in the country as also across the world. Statistically, 63 per cent of the deaths in India have been reported among people over 60 years age, 30 per cent in the age bracket of 40 to 60 years and 7 per cent victims being below 40 years age. Agarwal said the deceased below 40 years were suffering from the co-morbidities like diabetes, chronic kidney ailments, heart diseases and hypertension.

Further, though 37 per cent deaths are reported from people below 60 years, approximately, 86 per cent of deaths among people with co-morbidities indicate that young people with co-morbidities are also at high risk of COVID-19.

He implied that if elders, because of their old age and co-mobidities were vulnerable so were those in the young age group having such conditions mainly related to lifestyle which results into weak immunity.

“While coronavirus is a bigger threat for the elderly, young people with co-morbidities also need to be protected,” Agarwal added.

Similar trend was reported in China too where a 2.8 per cent death rate in men while only a 1.7 per cent death rate in women due to COVID-19, according to the data provided by Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). While the number of people infected was almost equal in number, it were the women who had a comparatively more survival rate.

Agarwal emphasised that elders should be protected and every youth has to be careful that they maintain sufficient social distance to not pass infection to anyone in the family, particularly the elderly.

“We urge social distancing in the long term and all the dos and don’ts followed by everybody in the family,” he added. Clarifying the queries connected with community transmission in the country, the Health Ministry said if at all there is any community transmission, it will alert the people.

“Localised community transmission implies that increase in cases was observed in a particular area. Our action plan is that we should not reach stage 3 (which is the community transmission stage),” he said.

The official also clarified that whenever a drastic increase is observed in the number of cases in an area, the Ministry adopts a containment action plan. “All the districts have been informed to have an action plan on Covid-19, if there are cases or no cases”, added Agarwal.

Regarding the total cases, the official said out of the 4,067 confirmed coronavirus cases in the country, 1,445 have been epidemiologically linked to Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddin. A Ministry of Home Affairs official said 25,500 local members of the Tablighi Jamaat and their contacts have been quarantined. “Five villages in Haryana where foreign nationals, who were connected with Tablighi Jamaat, lived, have been sealed and quarantined,” added the Home Ministry official.

Meanwhile, the Indian Council for Medical Research (CMR) said orders have been placed for 5 lakh rapid antibody testing kits for conducting COVID-19 tests in hotspots. These will be available by April 8 or 9.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/of-4-500-cases--1-3rd-tablighis--highest-death-toll-30-in-a-day-2020-04-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/of-4-500-cases--1-3rd-tablighis--highest-death-toll-30-in-a-day.html
194,07-4-20,"UP, Telangana favour lockdown extension","Uttar Pradesh and Telangana on Friday hinted that the ongoing lockdown could be extended even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the country should be ready for a long “haul” to deal with the coronavirus outbreak.

Appealing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to extend the three-week lockdown beyond April 15, Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao on Monday said the nation can recover from the hit that the economy was taking but it can’t bring back lives of the people.

“Lockdown is the only weapon that India has given the weak health infrastructure that we have. I propose that the lockdown be extended by at least one or two weeks and a call on opening up can be taken after that,” the Chief Minister told the media at Pragathi Bhavan in Hyderabad.

“The lockdown is impacting all sections of society and the economy at large, but the issue of coronavirus is the biggest crisis faced by the mankind and it calls for stern measures,” he said.

At the same time, throwing a hint that lockdown in Uttar Pradesh could be extended, a Government spokesman said that it was premature to talk about lifting the lockdown when fresh coronavirus cases are reported across the State.

“The number of positives cases of Covid-19 is increasing day by day, hence it is premature to say that lockdown could be lifted after April 14,” Additional Chief Secretary Awanish Awasthi said here on Monday.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier announced a 21-day lock down, which ends on April 14.

In his interaction with the State Chief Ministers last week, the Prime Minister had suggested that the lockdown could be lifted in a phased manner. Acting on this advice, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had held a meeting with officials asking them to look at the ways and means to lift lockdown in a phased manner so that stranded migrant workers can reach home without creating a chaos at the highways.

Awasthi said the Government is reviewing the situation. “The religious leaders too had suggested that lockdown is the only way to prevent the virus and hence if required it should be extended,” he said.

He said that Tablighi Jamaat people were responsible for the rise in the number of positive cases. Of the total 305 cases in the State on Monday, 159 are linked to members of the jammat. He said during the past 24 hours, 27 people were tested positive in which 21 are from the jamaat.

“This is a big concern for the Government,” he said. “We have identified around 1,600 people of the Tablighi Jammat till now and quarantined 1,200 of them. Now the administration is tracing the people who came in touch with them besides others who formed the chain,” he said.

This tracing would take some time for which we are going for total lockdown in some select areas, he added.

Meanwhile, Yogi Adityanath has ordered setting up of 14 more Covid-19 test centres at the medical colleges and sample collection centres in the district where there is no testing facilities. Money collected from Corona Fund will be used in strengthening these centres.

With this new testing facilities become operational, the total number of testing labs in the State would go up to 24. Presently, there are eight functional labs and two more - one at Jhansi and other at Prayagraj - would open shortly.

He further said that the districts where there is no testing centres the hospitals would facilitate collection of samples and will send these for test in the nearby testing centres.

Opposition leaders are demanding that there should be increase in the testing facilities so that virus infected people are detected early.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/up--telangana-favour-lockdown-extension-2020-04-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/up--telangana-favour-lockdown-extension.html

196,07-4-20,FATF to review Pak's performance on global commitments to fight terror in June in China,"Global anti-money laundering watchdog FATF will review Pakistan's performance to meet international commitments in the fight against terror financing during a meeting scheduled to be held in China in June.

Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 to combat money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system.

Currently placed on the FATF's 'grey list', Pakistan has been scrambling in recent months to avoid being added to a list of countries deemed non-compliant with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing regulations, a measure that officials here fear could hurt its economy, which is already under severe strain.

The global watchdog will review Pakistan's performance to meet international commitments and standards in the fight against money laundering and terror financing at its meeting slated to be held in Beijing on June 21-26, Dawn news reported.

It is not yet clear if the meeting could be postponed due to the global coronavirus pandemic which broke out in central China's Wuhan city.

In February, the FATF gave Pakistan a four-month grace period to complete its 27-point action plan against money laundering and terror financing committed with the international community when it noted that Pakistan had delivered on 14 points and missed 13 other targets.

A senior government official said Pakistan's performance would be reviewed at the joint working group meetings of the FATF and Eurasian Group scheduled in Beijing and the assessment would lead to final announcement in October this year if Pakistan should move out of the grey list.

He said certain action points were yet to be complied with the commitments mainly because of ongoing coronavirus lockdowns.

He said that Pakistan had put in place a broad-based strategy for taking necessary actions to complete outstanding commitments with the FATF in February and was actively making progress.

The FATF announced on February 21 that all deadlines given to Pakistan to complete the 27-point action plan had expired and yet only 14 items had largely been completed, leaving 13 unaccomplished targets.

It strongly urged Pakistan to swiftly complete its full action plan by June 2020 or else it would be moved to the list of monitored jurisdictions, commonly known as blacklist.

""Otherwise, should significant and sustainable progress especially in prosecuting and penalising TF (Terrorist Financing) not be made by the next Plenary, the FATF will take action, which could include the FATF calling on its members and urging all jurisdiction to advise their Financial Institutions (FIs) to give special attention to business relations and transactions with Pakistan,"" the FATF said in a formal announcement in February.

The FATF had noted ""recent and notable improvements"" but ""again expresses concerns given Pakistan's failure to complete its action plan in line with the agreed timelines and in light of the TF risks emanating from the jurisdiction"".

Pakistan has to show compliance with 13 remaining action points in eight key categories. The country has to demonstrate that remedial actions and sanctions are applied in cases of Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act (AML/CFT) violations, relating to TF risk management and TFS (Terror Financing Sanctions) obligations.

Pakistan has to demonstrate that competent authorities were cooperating and taking action to identify and take enforcement action against illegal money or value transfer services and prove the implementation of cross-border currency and 'bearer negotiable instruments' controls at all ports of entry, including applying effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions.

It also has to demonstrate that law enforcement agencies are identifying and investigating the widest range of TF activity and that TF investigations and prosecutions target designated persons and entities, and those acting on behalf or at the direction of the designated persons or entities besides showing TF prosecutions result in effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions.

Pakistan's outstanding action areas also include effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions (supported by a comprehensive legal obligation) against all 1,267 and 1,373 designated terrorists and those acting for or on their behalf, including preventing the raising and moving of funds, identifying and freezing assets (movable and immovable), and prohibiting access to funds and financial services.

It will have to demonstrate enforcement against TFS violations, including administrative and criminal penalties and provincial and federal authorities cooperating on enforcement cases and prove that facilities and services owned or controlled by designated person are deprived of their resources and the usage of the resources.

The FATF plenary had formally placed Pakistan in the grey list in June 2018 due to 'strategic deficiencies' in its AML/CFT regime after a push from India supported by the US, the UK and some European countries.

Pakistan then committed at the highest level to a 27-point action plan but failed to meet deadlines. It has finalised major amendments to at least a dozen of its laws to meet FATF requirements by June, according to the report.

The FATF currently has 39 members, including two regional organisations -- the European Commission and the Gulf Cooperation Council.

India is a member of the FATF consultations and its Asia Pacific Group.

The Ministry of National Health Services, in an early morning update on its website, reported that four patients died of coronavirus in the last 24 hours.

The total number of patients who died due to COVID-19 has reached 54. As many as 429 have recovered while 28 were in critical condition, it said.

The country has so far tested 39,183 people, including 3,088 during the last 24 hours.

The increase in the number of new cases was reported despite hectic efforts to curtail the spread of the virus.

The government has extended the partial lockdown until April 14 and asked people to stay at homes and follow social distancing.

Prime Minister Imran Khan also announced Rs 1,200 billion financial package to help vulnerable people and businesses.

Meanwhile, medical staff across Pakistan have complained for weeks over the severe shortages of safety equipment in hospitals as they treat patients suffering from the coronavirus.

Police on Monday arrested doctors and medical staff in Balochistan for protesting over the lack of protective gears.

According to President Young Doctors Association Dr Yasir Khan, more than 150 doctors and paramedics have been arrested.

The doctors and medical staff wanted to protest outside the Chief Minister House when the police baton-charged them.

The protest came after more than a dozen doctors contracted the virus reportedly while discharging their duties.

Supreme Court Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed on Monday criticised the government for lack of efforts to combat the coronavirus, saying ""nothing is being done on ground"".

200,07-4-20,"PM: Corona a long battle, also opportunity for Make-in-India","While indicating that the country should be ready for a long haul, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday assured that “power of light of 130 crore Indians” as reflected from Sunday night’s togetherness has provided enough strength to “all of us” to prepare for “a long battle” against coronavirus pandemic.

“..130 crore deshvashiyon ki mahashakti ke mahaprayash se utpann mahaprakash ne deshvasiyon ko ek lambi ladai ke leye taiyar kiya hai..”, said the Prime Minister addressing the BJP on the occasion of party’s foundation day.

Modi said, “Today our aim, mission and determination is one and that is to score victory against coronavirus.”

Modi on Monday asked Union Ministers to prepare plans to fight the economic impact of COVID-19 on war footing and asserted that this crisis is an opportunity to boost the “Make-in-India” initiative and reduce dependence on other countries.

The Prime Minister further said “in this hour of crisis, the responsibility of party workers towards rashtra seva and manav seva increases more so,” and appealed them to carry out five-fold task to battle out the pandemic.

Modi asked party “karyakartas’ to help and feed those in need, reaffirm the importance of social distancing and contribute to PM-Care fund amid the coronavirus pandemic that has been impacting the country. He also asked each worker to help 40 people load Arogya app.

“We mark our party’s 40th anniversary when India is battling COVID-19. I appeal to BJP karyakartas to follow the set of guidelines from our party president JP Nadda-ji, help those in need and reaffirm the importance of social distancing. Let’s make India COVID-19-free,” he tweeted.

The BJP was founded in 1980 on April 6 emerging from the Rs Bhartiya JansanghRs with Atal Bihari Vajpayee as its first president.

Modi said all BJP workers will provide one meal to the poor on the occasion of party’s foundation day as a way to show solidarity with people facing hardships during the lockdown due to the novel coronavirus.

Modi paid tribute to all those who have toiled hard to build the party over the decades and said the party workers have got the opportunity to serve crores, but stressed that social distancing rules must be adhered to.

“Whenever the BJP has got the opportunity to serve, the party has focussed on good governance and empowering the poor. In line with the party’s ethos, our karyakartas have worked hard to bring a positive difference in the lives of many and done great social service,” Modi said.

The Prime Minister said in last few weeks countrymen have shown exemplary unity and solidarity with each other and expressed their determination to defeat the enemy at hand.

Nadda, who took over as the BJP chief in January, has asked party workers to hoist party flags at all offices and at every karyakarta’s house while maintaining social distancing norms to mark the party’s 40th foundation day. He also said party workers will give up one meal to show solidarity with people facing hardships during the lockdown. Besides, he has asked workers to provide food packets to needy.

Nadda also asked party workers to encourage 40 others to donate Rs 100 each to the PM-cares fund. Also, he has asked them to contact 40 houses at booth level and get their signatures on 5 thank you letters for police, doctors and nurses, safai karamcharis, bank and postal employees, and Government and civic employees.

Party workers are also to make at least two face masks at their homes for the people. All these steps suggested by the Prime Minister and the party president would be undertaken by the BJP workers across all States.

Soon after the three-week lockdown Nadda had asked each party worker to feed five poor people affected by the shutdown. The appeal from the Prime Minister is a second appeal to the party to do the needful in the wake of hardships caused by the lockdown which may get extended beyond April 14.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pm--corona-a-long-battle--also-opportunity-for-make-in-india-2020-04-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/pm--corona-a-long-battle--also-opportunity-for-make-in-india.html

""I was shooting three projects and the plan was to finish them, so that by the month of May I could start shooting 'Made In Heaven' season 2. But now everything is on hold. I was shooting for the Telugu-Hindi bilingual 'Major' with Mahesh Babu. In fact, Mahesh Babu is also producing the film.

I had a release of a Malayalam film 'Kurup' opposite Dulqure Salman. We have to reschedule the release of the film now,"" Sobhita told IANS.

""So initially, I was feeling restless over what had happened so suddenly. I had planned everything, I had a flowchart and I had prepared myself as an actor. Now what should I do? Of course, we are artiste and things affect us emotionally. But now I am not fighting it anymore. I know this too shall pass. I am not anxious about the future, that is not productive,"" mentioned the actress.

So how is she dealing with the lockdown time? ""Now I am taking care of my body and mind. I am evaluating my decisions and putting things in retrospect. I am watching web series, films and I am also reading books. I remember as a child I was such a geek, loved reading books. In the last few years, things have been different. I am finishing some books that I so wanted to read for long. And also, I started cooking again after three years. So my days are packed,"" Sobhita signed off.

203,07-4-20,DadiKaKehna,"Due to lockdown all salons are closed but there are several alternative home remedies that one can follow for soft hands and feet, says Roshni Devi

Run out of moisturiser? Fret not. There are several cheaper options that are in our kitchen which make for a great way to keep hand and feet soft and moisturised. Use full fat yogurt. For better results add a teaspoon of honey to the yogurt and mix well. Slather this on your hands and feet and leave the marks for 10 minutes. Rinse properly and pat dry.

Scrub your hands and feet at least once a week with a good exfoliating agent to get rid of any dead skin. Take a teaspoon each of sugar, olive oil and mix it well with the juice of half a lemon. Rub this on your hands and feet for five to 10 minutes. Wash off with lukewarm water and pat dry.

Clean under your nails with a nail brush on a regular basis. When you wash your hands, use a good quality nail brush to gently scrub beneath your nails and remove any dirt that may be stuck there.

Being home with no maids means that many are spending a lot of time cooking. After kneading the dough for roti don’t wash your hands. Add a few drops of milk and lemon juice. Leave it for a few minutes. This will cleanse and moisture your hands.

Apply a mixture of glycerine and rose water regularly on hands and feet before going to bed. Leave it overnight. Do this regularly.

If you have cracked heels use honey of even coconut oil. Do this till crack disappears.

204,07-4-20,Guide to baby’s good night sleep,"We all know the importance of a good night’s sleep. As adults, if we don’t get proper rest, we are unable to do our work to the best of our ability and in all probability we are in a bad mood the entire day taking out our anger on others. So why should babies be any different? If your baby is otherwise healthy and yet cranky and irritable, there is a possibility that he has not had a good night’s sleep.

Believe it or not, the same holds for school going kids. For a child to be attentive in class it is important that he has had sleep for at least eight to nine hours. Most doctors would tell you the same thing — that for humans to realise our potential we need those many hours of sleep. But hoe does a country that stands at No 2 when it comes to being sleep deprived, get a good night sleep?

It is something that we need to inculcate in our kids from the time they were babies. Kerry Bajaj’s book Sleep, Baby, Sleep gives you a sneak peek into how one can ensure that your baby is tugged away in bed at 8 pm and sleeps till 8 am without much fretting. What is interesting about this book is that it takes you step by step on how parents whose babies and kids are not getting as much sleep and keep parents up till late into the night can actually put them to sleep so that the next morning their kid is fresh and ready to tackle the day with a smile.

A smile that is so important to us. If our child is cranky, the parents are worried and harassed. It also means that until the child is old enough to be left on nannies, parents have almost zero social life because the child would not let the parents be.

The language used here is simple so that parents can follow the advise that has been to a T. The sentences are not too long and hence easy to remember.

The book tells you that in order for your child to have a good night sleep, it is important to creat a spa-like environment. Just live adults instantly relax the minute they enter a spa — with its dim lights, sweet smell and soft music, the same way parents need to create that environment during nap time.

It also advises parents that it is them who decides when and where the baby will sleep and not the baby. Once the parents have set a time and space for the baby to sleep, it is important to stick to it and shuffle the baby around.

Routine matters and parents needs to stick to it is the mantra to a baby’s good night sleep.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/guide-to-baby---s-good-night-sleep-2020-04-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/guide-to-baby---s-good-night-sleep.html

Johnson, 55, asked UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab to deputise for him as he was moved on Monday to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at St Thomas' Hospital in London, a move Downing Street said was a precaution should he require ventilation to aid his recovery.

Over the course of this afternoon (Monday), the condition of the Prime Minister has worsened and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the ICU at the hospital, a Downing Street spokesperson said.

The Prime Minister has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is the First Secretary of State, to deputise for him where necessary,"" the spokesperson said.

Raab, speaking after taking temporary charge, said the team spirit within the government would be focussed on taking Johnson's plans to defeat the pandemic forward.

The minister said: The government's business will continue. The Prime Minister is in safe hands with that brilliant team at St Thomas' hospital, and the focus of the government will continue to be on making sure that the Prime Minister's direction, all the plans for making sure that we can defeat coronavirus and can pull the country through this challenge, will be taken forward"".

""There's an incredibly strong team spirit behind the Prime Minister, and making sure that we get all of the plans the Prime Minister's instructed us to deliver, to get them implemented as soon as possible. And that's the way it will bring the whole country through the coronavirus challenge that we face right now, the minister said.

Downing Street said Johnson remains conscious and is receiving excellent care , for which he thanks all National Health Service (NHS) staff for their hard work and dedication.

Queen Elizabeth II has been kept informed about Johnson's health by No 10, according to Buckingham Palace.

According to the BBC, Johnson was given oxygen late on Monday afternoon, before being taken to intensive care. However, he has not been put on a ventilator.

Earlier in the day on Monday, Johnson had messaged from his hospital bed to say that he was in good spirits and staying in contact with his ministers to oversee the UK's coronavirus fightback despite his hospitalisation on Sunday night due to persistent COVID-19 symptoms.

He was last seen in public applauding the NHS and other key workers just outside his flat in Downing Street last Thursday and posted his last Twitter video message on Friday in which he said he was still displaying minor symptoms.

""I still have a temperature. So in accordance with government advice I must continue my self-isolation until that symptom itself goes. But we're working clearly the whole time on our programme to beat the virus,"" he said.

206,07-4-20,China says no new coronavirus deaths for first time,"China on Tuesday reported no new deaths from the deadly coronavirus for the first time since it started publishing figures in January but the number of imported infections increased to 983 with 32 new confirmed cases, health officials said.

China's National Health Commission (NHC) on Tuesday said that no death was reported on Monday. The official death toll in China is 3,331.

It is a landmark in China's over two-month-long fight against the deadly virus as the country continued to report coronavirus deaths till Sunday, especially from the epicentre Hubei province.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland have reached 81,740 by Monday, including 1,242 patients still being treated, 77,167 patients discharged after recovery, and 3,331 people died of the disease, the NHC said.

While no new domestically transmitted cases of the coronavirus were reported, 32 imported cases were reported on Monday taking their total to 983, it said.

A total of 30 new asymptomatic COVID-19 cases were reported on the mainland on Monday, including nine imported ones, it said.

Asymptomatic coronavirus cases are those who test positive for the virus but do not show any symptoms and have the potential to cause sporadic clusters of infections.

Last week, China began disclosing the number of asymptomatic cases for the first time, after growing public concerns over the potential of ""silent"" carriers to spread the disease.

The NHC said 1,033 asymptomatic cases were still under medical observation, including 275 from abroad.

By Monday, 914 confirmed cases, including four deaths have been reported in the Hong Kong, 44 confirmed cases in Macao and 373 in Taiwan including five deaths.

China for the first time issued an official timeline of coronavirus on Monday in which it stated that coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan in ""late December 2019"" where the infection was listed as ""pneumonia of unknown cause"", but skirted the key question about its origin.

In late last December, the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in central China's Hubei province detected cases of ""pneumonia of unknown cause"", state-run Xinhua news agency reported, citing the 38-page timeline document.

China has faced criticism over COVID-19 crisis and Beijing has been accused of using its ""propaganda"" to hush-up coronavirus cases.

China and the US had a lengthy spat over origin of the virus.

While US President Donald Trump called COVID-19 as ""China virus"" and ""Wuhan virus"", Beijing said such allegations amounted to stigmatising China. Beijing said the origin of the COVID-19 can be determined only by scientific and professional views.

The US has accused China of delayed action resulting in the pandemic spreading to other countries, an allegation Beijing vehemently refuted asserting that it was working with the international community in an ""open and highly responsible manner"" to contain the global crisis.

According to estimates by the Johns Hopkins University, there are over 1.34 million confirmed coronavirus cases across the world and over 74,000 people have died of it.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-says-no-new-coronavirus-deaths-for-first-time-2020-04-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-says-no-new-coronavirus-deaths-for-first-time.html

208,07-4-20,"US coronavirus deaths top 10,000: Johns Hopkins tracker","More than 10,000 people have died of coronavirus complications in the United States since the outbreak began in late January, Johns Hopkins University said Monday.

The Baltimore-based school, which has been keeping a running tally of global coronavirus numbers, said there are at least 347,003 confirmed infections in the US with 10,335 deaths.

The world's leading economy is one of the worst-hit countries, trailing only Italy (15,877) and Spain (13,055) in numbers killed by the deadly pandemic.

The number of daily deaths is falling in some of the worst-affected European countries, but the US has yet to reach its peak of the crisis.

Since the middle of last week, the US has recorded more than 1,000 new deaths every day, with containment measures of varying degrees being enforced on a state-by-state basis.

New York is the main focus of the American outbreak, with more than 4,750 deaths statewide and 130,000 cases, more than half of them in New York City.

Authorities have warned that between 100,000 and 240,000 people could die from COVID-19 in the US, even in a best-case scenario with social distancing guidelines being observed.

The pandemic has killed more than 70,000 worldwide since the emergence of the new coronavirus in December in China, according to an AFP tally compiled from official sources. (AFP)

210,07-4-20,My parents wanted me to chart my own path: 'Bamfaad' actor Aditya Rawal,"Newcomer Aditya Rawal, son of veteran actors Paresh Rawal and Swaroop Sampat, says his parents were understanding about his acting ambitions but wanted him to chart his own course in the industry.

Aditya is making his acting debut with ZEE5 original film ""Bamfaad"".

""It wasn't ever a case where we were looking for something to be launched with. It was never premeditated they

let me choose my own path, I was charting my own path in life,"" Aditya told PTI in an interview.

""Bamfaad"" was shot at the end of 2018 with utmost secrecy because both Aditya and director Ranjan Chandel were making their foray into films and they wanted to talk only after they had a complete project in their hands.

Aditya said he was more into sports and had played cricket and football, till he realised acting was his true calling.

In school, I was more into cricket, then I took up football, played for Mumbai and Maharashtra, I have been the captain of Mumbai University. Slowly my interest deviated from sports to theatre and acting and then came a time to make a decision, he said.

I grew up with my parents, who are into theatre and I remember sitting in the audience and watching them perform for the nth time. I did theatre in school and college. I was always around that world, he added.

Aditya said when he chose to get into films both his parents wanted him to make his own decisions.

""They supported me and were happy that I was getting into this profession. But it was made very clear to us that we make our own decisions and journey and be responsible towards it, we were told whatever we do we must enjoy our work.

""They said they are there to guide us. You need perseverance and strength to be in this field and he did warn us about it before I jumped into this profession.

Aditya, who has co-written Panipat and assisted Umesh Shukla on OMG Oh My God! said he did receive some acting offers before Bamfaad but nothing was as interesting as this.

Before he went to New York to study filmmaking, he had auditioned for a film but he didn't clear it. After coming back, casting director Taran Bajaj suggested that he audition for Bamfaad and this time it worked in his favour.

The film is set in a romantic volatile backdrop which will bring out an unusual yet raw and edgy love story on the screen.

Aditya, who is playing the male lead Nasir Jamal, said he is happy that he got the chance to enter the film industry with such a thrilling story.

When I read the script I found the role, the world very interesting, it was different from the world I grew up in. As an actor you want to discover or explore new worlds. I am glad in my first film I got the opportunity to show as many facets as possible as an actor. It is a happy accident that the film has all the ingredients from romance to action.

Aditya and Shalini Pandey of Arjun Reddy fame are paired as inter-faith lovers in Bamfaad , which is set in Allahabad.

Presented by Anurag Kashyap, Bamfaad will stream on ZEE5 from April 10.

The film is releasing amid the coronavirus pandemic. The newcomer, however, hopes that his film gives some comfort to the viewers.

""We have made this film with heart and soul and wanted it to reach as many people as possible. It is a very very difficult time and as artistes we can contribute something to it by entertaining and engaging viewers though our work is nowhere near as important to those who are in the medical field or in any essential service.""",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/my-parents-wanted-me-to-chart-my-own-path---bamfaad--actor-aditya-rawal-2020-04-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/my-parents-wanted-me-to-chart-my-own-path---bamfaad--actor-aditya-rawal.html

""One of the most difficult things I find as an actor is to laugh on cue. It is way harder than crying or other emotions. It's sometimes harder than yawning on cue,"" Sayani said.



Recalling her experience of shooting the web series ""Four More Shots Please!"", she said: ""Every time the girls got together for the bar scenes, which were ‘the girls are having fun and bonding' scenes, after about 4 takes and tons of laughing out loud, it would be damn tough to keep it light and spontaneous.

We would just keep pondering like and coming up with new ways of amusing each other in every take.""

220,07-4-20,'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' lands Amazon in legal soup,"The Rachel Brosnahan-starrer blockbuster series, ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" is in for legal trouble. An author, who claims the concept of the hugely popular series has been copied from her book, has sued Amazon Studios, the streaming service hosting the show.



Author Jodi Parmley claims that the crux of the series was taken from her 2014 novel ""F.I.F.I. Financial Infidelity F**k It: The Mistress of the New Millennium"", reports dailymail.co.uk.



In her lawsuit, the author said that Amazon Studios stole a number of creative elements from her book, including the plight of the main character, the stand-up comedy, general plot points and character traits.



Set in 1950s Manhattan, ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" tells the story of Midge Maisel (Brosnahan) who is trying to find her own voice after her husband leaves her. With music and lighter tones, the show by Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino, puts the spotlight on gender issues, and the disparity. It also stars Michael Zegen, Alex Borstein, Marin Hinkle, Tony Shalhoub and Kevin Pollak.



In the documents obtained by TMZ, Parmley said she wrote her book and then adapted a screenplay from it. She then went to different studios pitching her idea and says many were interested in her idea.



Parmley didn't name any specific executives she met at Amazon, but did imply that word got out to them about her book and screenplay.



After seeing the premiere of ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" in 2017, Parmley, who lives in New Orleans, believed that much of the storyline, like the struggling lead character seeking financial independence and leaving her husband, was taken from her book.



Now, Parmley is suing for the profits Amazon has made from the show. The exact figure is not known -- but it is likely to be a huge amount considering the critical and commercial success that the show got during its three seasons to date.

State Health Minister Anil Vij maintained that the spike in the number of COVID-19 cases is due to many Tablighi Jamaat members testing positive for the disease.

Vij, who also holds the home portfolio, said 1,526 Tablighi Jamaat members, including 107 foreigners, have been tracked down in the state so far.

232,06-4-20,A ticking COVID bomb,"The much-recommended measure of social distancing practised around the globe to stem the spread of this pandemic is almost impossible in many parts of India

When pandemics hit, they usually hit the poor the hardest, if not the first. Like the months bygone, the next couple of months are going to schlep through the looming threat of the contagion bulging into the next stage of community spread. This may precipitate the exponential disease spikes and deaths in numbers that we can very well speculate. They may be in thousands if not millions, considering the poverty and density of population. It is high time that we stand up and walk with the Government and aid its efforts to fight the pandemic by not only following its instructions on social distancing and not hoarding essential commodities but also by contributing intelligent observations and suggestions.

We have seen so far that COVID-19 can quickly overwhelm the health systems of countries, including those nations that are said to have advanced healthcare systems, like Italy and the United States (US). The ongoing rise in mortality in such developed nations portends a very dark future for poorer nations with inadequate healthcare facilities, including ours.

The first line of defence against any pandemic is surveillance: Monitoring human (and animals where relevant) populations to spot outbreaks and containing them at the earliest. In countries with overall impoverished infrastructure, isolated outbreaks are likely to go undetected longer and thus simmer and spread.

At the current stage, our public healthcare system is expected to detect where the virus is spreading and collect high-quality real-time data from various geographies and groups of people, identifying pockets of infection before they multiply into larger outbreaks.

It is for our health systems to be able to figure out which communities can expect to see a rise in Coronavirus cases and where to allocate resources in anticipation of rising hospitalisations.

Without quality data, no one can respond appropriately to this fatal threat, neither as individuals nor as a society. Nor can we learn whether countermeasures adopted so far against the pandemic are working or not. The most important component of the contagion data is information from the laboratory tests detecting active infections, past infections, immunity status of people as well as assessing herd immunity in communities. These present a real picture of the Coronavirus’ spread and status in the country.

The priorities of action plans for the road back to normalcy would be maintaining a robust and vigilant healthcare system, a firm administration with impeccable attention to detail regarding the nuances of the vulnerable groups living at the edges (migrants and daily wage labourers) and an effective targetted (sentinel) surveillance system.

If the country’s systems function to their full potential, we would be able to learn where the Coronavirus is dormant. And once we know the location and size of the problem, we can start leaving our homes gradually, return to work and attend schools and universities, bring businesses back in shape and let people congregate for movies, meetings, weddings or mass prayers.

An observation, or rather a lesson learnt from countries battling the Coronavirus in an advanced stage than ours, is that the threats posed by the virus have cast a spotlight on the shortcomings in healthcare systems across the globe. The population of billions in India may be the next battleground in the fight against the contagion if proactive measures are not undertaken at this stage.

Home to one-third of the world’s slum-dwelling population, India is largely filled with people battling poverty and poor education (including health education and general inadequate know-how about things), existing co-morbid conditions and most importantly hygiene challenges (i.e., limited access to resources such as clean water, soap, disinfectants and so on).

The much-recommended measure of social distancing practised around the globe to stem the spread of this pandemic is almost impossible in many parts of India. With a population density of 2,77,136 people per square kilometre (sq km) in Mumbai’s Dharavi slum to 1,25,000 people per sq km at the Rasoolpura slum in Hyderabad, the difficulty in observing social distancing is self-explanatory. Slums are an integral part of a city’s economy as those are where a majority of the labour force and domestic help stays, all around the country. Now, with three cases of Coronavirus cases appearing in the Dharavi slum, these places are also a ticking time bomb where the contagion is concerned.

The biggest challenge regarding hygiene is overcrowding around common toilets — Dharavi slum has one toilet per 1,440 residents. The Covid-19 virus is known to survive longer than three days in faecal matter, which makes crowding around toilets and living amid bad drainage a major threat.

The focus must now shift to proactive testing for asymptomatic and symptomatic Covid-19 bearers, within the most vulnerable, high population density pockets of India.

There are genuine capacity issues but we need mandatory Covid-19 testing of all slum inhabitants across the country. Quarantine is a must for the asymptomatic and symptomatic bearers of the Coronavirus in slum zones in different pre-identified, isolated locations.

This test data is vital in enabling the right strategy to manage the next steps of Coronavirus containment and eradication. The health system hence should encourage doctors to test liberally (without any out-of-pocket payment from the people given their economic status).

About laboratory test data, we see that unlike in developed nations, the data is either incomplete or completely unavailable in developing nations like ours due to poor infrastructure and coordination issues. This makes it impossible for administrators, scientists, healthcare professionals, researchers and the general citizen to assess the extent and significance of the testing efforts.

The other component of an effective healthcare system of a low-income country is to focus on serology tests. RT-PCR is the confirmatory test for COVID-19 which is currently priced at Rs 4,500 per test and takes more than a day for the result to be available. The serology tests on the other hand are much cheaper and can be used extensively for screening. These are not confirmatory tests and hence not used in clinical practice but these tests have value in epidemiology studies and herd immunity assessment.

These tests screen blood for the antibodies that confer immunity after exposure to a pathogen. In public health management, this is essential for tailoring interventions and stopping local spread of a disease, especially a contagious one. Serology is uniquely useful for defining specific anti-viral immunity. If you know that a large percentage of people have been exposed and developed some immunity, it may allow for less-restrictive measures. These tests can be added to routine blood draws with no additional hassle for the patient.

For instance, in the US, ever since the Coronavirus outbreak began, many different groups have ramped up their efforts to develop a serological test. Should a test like this ever become available to the public, it could radically shape how healthcare professionals decide who gets to leave home and return to some semblance of a normal life.

Considering the current status of the Coronavirus contagion, with the uncovering of 10 hotspots of the viral infection within the country, a sentinel surveillance system must now exist in full force and to the highest accuracy.

The Government needs to build it with dedicated funding, perhaps as part of the next stimulus package. This will require an efficient data-collection system that allows cases/suspected hotspots of the disease to be identified and tracked in real time (without overburdening providers with data entry and case reports).

Many of our citizens have already called for the need for special financing arrangements to support surveillance and preparedness for the worst-case scenario of a fierce outbreak. They have also underscored the importance of incentivising the right type of capacity-building, including the right research and evidence-generation capability, to enable effective containment of infection and other mitigation strategies. With funds coming in from various sources and from the taxpayers’ money that is directed towards the COVID-19 response, India, even with a weak healthcare system should concentrate on this and use all available resources wisely until we come out of the pandemic, bruised but not totally defeated.

233,07-4-20,"COVID-19: Govt mulling extending lockdown beyond April 14 after requests from states, experts","The Central government is mulling extending the nationwide lockdown beyond April 14 to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic following requests from several states and experts, government sources said on Tuesday.

However, sources did not indicate if a final decision has been taken on the matter, and Joint Secretary in the Union health ministry Lav Aggarwal said, ""no decision on extending lockdown as yet (taken), please don't speculate.""

India is currently under the 21-day lockdown since March 25, with only essential services exempted, to contain the fast-spreading virus, which has claimed more than 75,800 lives globally and afflicted over 13.5 lakh people across 183 countries.

""A lot of state governments as well as experts are requesting the Central Government to extend the lockdown. The Central government is thinking in this direction,"" a source said, a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked countrymen to be ready for a long battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, and exhorted people to not feel tired or defeated while expressing confidence that India will emerge victorious in the fight.

Chairing a meeting of the council of ministers through video conferencing on Monday, Modi had clearly indicated that the lifting of the lockdown in one go is very unlikely while discussing the modalities of lifting it.

The Prime Minister also asked the ministers whether the restrictions should be lifted sector-wise or district-wise, a source said.

Reiterating that lockdown measures and social distancing norms need to go hand in hand, Modi also told ministers to popularize Aarogya Setu app in the rural areas and grass root institutions.

Several chief ministers have favoured the extension of the lockdown in the country to contain the fast-spreading virus, as the number of COVID-19 cases climbed to 4,421 and death toll touched 117.

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said his government will extend lockdown if need arises, while his counterpart in Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot said the state cannot withdraw the lockdown immediately, and it has to be done in a phased manner.

In a statement to mark two weeks of lockdown, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu said the next one week of the lockdown is ""critical"" for evolving an exit strategy as the data regarding the spread of coronavirus will have a bearing on the decision to be taken by the government.

He also appealed to the public to abide with whatever decision is ultimately taken by the government and cooperate with the same spirit that has been evident so far, ""even if it meant to continue with some degree of hardship beyond April 14"".

On Monday, Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao had said he will appeal to Prime Minister Modi to extend the lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus in the country.

Also Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary R K Tiwari said,""there is still time for the lockdown and we will review the situation and then decide"" on lifting it.

Since there is no vaccine to fight COVID-19, the government has stressed that social distancing is the only way to check the spread of the virus. Lockdown is considered the best way to keep people indoors.

234,07-4-20,A COVID-19 patient can infect 406 people in 30 days if preventive measures not in place: ICMR study,"An ICMR study has found that a COVID-19 patient can infect 406 people in 30 days if preventive measures such as lockdown and social distancing are not implemented, the Union health ministry said on Tuesday.

With preventive measures in place, the possibility of the infection can be reduced to an average of just two-and-a-half persons per patient in the same period, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Health Lav Agarwal said.

Citing the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) study, Agarwal said that the current 'R0' or R naught for the coronavirus infection is somewhere between 1.5 and 4.

'R0' is a mathematical term that indicates how contagious an infectious disease is. It tells the average number of people who will catch a disease from one infected person.

""If we take the 'R0' to be 2.5 then one positive person can infect 406 people in 30 days, if the lockdown and social distancing measures are not in place, but if social exposure is reduced by 75 per cent then that one sick person will only be able to infect only 2.5 persons,"" Agarwal said, highlighting the importance of the ongoing 21-day lockdown and social distancing.

He appealed to the people to adopt social distancing and follow the lockdown order, saying this is a very important intervention in terms of management of COVID-19.

235,07-4-20,"New MERS vaccine may block coronavirus infections, study shows","A novel vaccine fully protects mice against a lethal dose of MERS, a close cousin of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, scientists said on Tuesday.

The vaccine uses a harmless virus to deliver a MERS coronavirus protein into cells to generate an immune response, said the researchers from researchers at the University of Iowa and the University of Georgia in the US.

It may hold promise for developing vaccines against other coronaviruses diseases, including COVID-19, they said.

The team tested the MERS vaccine candidate in mice engineered to be susceptible to the MERS coronavirus.

The vaccine is an innocuous parainfluenza virus (PIV5) carrying the ""spike"" protein that MERS uses to infect cells. All the vaccinated mice survived a lethal dose of the MERS coronavirus, according to the results published in the journal mBio.

""Our new study indicates that PIV5 may be a useful vaccine platform for emerging coronavirus diseases, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Paul McCray, a professor the University of Iowa.

""Using the same strategy, vaccine candidates based on PIV5 expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been generated,” McCray said.

The researchers are planning more studies in animals to test the ability of PIV5-based vaccines in preventing disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.

MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and COVID-19 are both caused by coronaviruses.

MERS is deadlier and is fatal in about one third of known cases, but there have been only 2,494 cases since 2012, when the virus first emerged, the researchers said.

In contrast, there have been over 1.25 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide since it first emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and almost 70,000 people have died from the disease, they said.

The study found that just one, relatively low dose of the vaccine given to the mice intranasally -- inhaled through the nose -- was sufficient to fully protect all the treated mice from a lethal dose of MERS coronavirus.

When the researchers analysed the immune responses generated by the vaccine, they found that both antibodies and protective T cells were produced.

However, the antibody response was quite weak and it seems most likely that the vaccine's protective effect is due to the T cell response in the mouse lungs.

The researchers note several factors that make PIV5 expressing a coronavirus spike protein an appealing platform for vaccine development against emerging coronaviruses.

PIV5 can infect many different mammals, including humans, without causing disease, the researchers said.

The fact that a low dose of the vaccine was sufficient to protect the mice might be beneficial for creating enough vaccine for mass immunization, the researchers said.

Also, the vaccine in the current study was the most effective MERS vaccine to date in animal models of the disease, they said.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/new-mers-vaccine-may-block-coronavirus-infections--study-shows-2020-04-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/new-mers-vaccine-may-block-coronavirus-infections--study-shows.html
236,07-4-20,"Foreign docs fighting COVID-19 at AIIMS want salaries, institute says they are sponsored by their countries","A group of 70 foreign doctors at Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences working to combat COVID-19 alongside their Indian colleagues say they have been reduced to borrowing money because they have not been paid their salaries.

While AIIMS authorities maintain the doctors -- from Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Bangladesh -- are sponsored by their respective countries, the junior and senior resident medicos say banks back home are not operating because of the lockdown everywhere.

A senior AIIMS administrative official said the institute is under no obligation to pay the doctors.

In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 5, the AIIMS' Residents Doctors Association said amendments should be made in the rules so the foreign doctors are paid their salaries. The foreign doctors, irrespective of their nationality, are “working tirelessly and under similar stress”, the letter said.

The AIIMS Resident Doctors Association, the umbrella body representing all resident doctors at the premier institution, also urged Modi to provide special financial benefits to the foreign doctors for their “selfless efforts” in treating people amid the coronavirus outbreak.

“There is urgent need to solve the payment issue of foreign doctors. They are serving our country in this hour of crisis. The concerned authorities must give them their dues,"" Adarsh Singh, president of the RDA, told PTI.

The foreign doctors said they are relying on money borrowed from their colleagues as banks are not operating in their respective countries due to the lockdown.

“We have been tirelessly working in critical conditions day and night like our Indian colleagues yet we are not receiving payments. We are unable to even ask for money from home due to the lockdown and hence have to borrow money from our Indian friends here,” Sagar Poudel, a doctor from Nepal with the community medicine department of AIIMS, told PTI.

He said the authorities should at least release their stipends as they have been serving Indian patients under tremendous pressure despite their financial crises.

The foreign resident doctors said their Indian counterparts at AIIMS earn between Rs 80,000 to Rs 1 lakh per month depending on the year they are in. But they don't get a single rupee from the hospital.

They also rue the fact that Modi's announcement of Rs 50 lakh insurance per person for frontline health workers who are treating coronavirus patents does not cover them as they are foreigners.

Ansarul Haq, another foreign doctor from Nepal at AIIMS, alleged the hospital is making a mockery of the system as it is defying the Delhi High Court order.

""While others who are rendering the same service as us are getting paid, we are being ignored. Don't we have families to feed? Are we not humans?"" he asked PTI.

Every year, doctors from SAARC countries come to India to pursue medical courses followed by a residency in three institutes – AIIMS, Delhi, the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, and the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research (JIPMER), Pondicherry.

In 2013, the Delhi High Court directed AIIMS to start paying its foreign doctors on par with Indian doctors. The prime minister and the Ministry of External Affairs in 2018 also directed the institute to make necessary amendments and release the due salary of the foreign doctors.

While PGIMER and JIPMER have been paying their foreign doctors, AIIMS has not because it places the doctors from abroad in the same category as sponsored students from India, an official explained.

The Health Ministry also allows foreign resident doctors to draw stipends on par with their Indian counterparts, but prohibits sponsored students from doing so. However, the AIIMS administration has not initiated the procedure yet.

According to an AIIMS official, all sponsored students, including those from the Army, Navy, Air Force and state governments, are being paid by the sponsoring authority.

“They do not compete on open seats but on reserved seats with hardly any competition and are aware when they apply that their government is supposed to pay them. They can also appear in open competition as others, qualify and get paid,” he told PTI.

Another senior administrative officer, who did not wish to be named, said the matter was “technical” in nature and would be sorted in “due course of time”.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/foreign-docs-fighting-covid-19-at-aiims-want-salaries--institute--says-they-are-sponsored-by-their-countries-2020-04-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/foreign-docs-fighting-covid-19-at-aiims-want-salaries--institute--says-they-are-sponsored-by-their-countries.html

Several of those who attended the Tablighi Jamaat meeting later tested positive for coronavirus.

""Two things come to my mind, without any politics (involved) in it....I want to ask these questions as a citizen,"" the Baramati MP said during an interaction through Facebook.

""Riots broke out in Delhi when (US) President Trump visited (in February). What was the police commissioner there doing?

""What was the Delhi administration exactly doing then?"" Sule asked.

She was not seeking to politicise the issue, she added.

Sule also praised the Maharashtra government and police for not giving permission to a similar event in the state.

She, however, added that this was no time to play politics.
