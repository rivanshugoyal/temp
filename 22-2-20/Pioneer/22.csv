0,22-2-20,A day of martyrs,"February 21 has a special significance for Bangladesh, which transcends its observance as the International Mother Language Day. On this day, Dhaka fought for Bangla’s recognition

February 21 has a significance for Bangladesh that transcends its observance as the International Mother Language Day. Every year from 1953, it has been observed in that country as the Bengali Language Martyrs’ Day or Language Martyrs’ Day in memory of four students — Rafiq, Barkat, Jabbar and Salam — killed in police firing on a peaceful demonstration in Dhaka on the same day in 1952. The demonstration, in turn, was a part of the historic language movement that, more than anything else, contributed to the rise of the liberation struggle, which culminated in Bangladesh’s emergence into freedom in 1971.

The language movement owes its origin to the Pakistan Government’s decision to have Urdu alone as the country’s State language. Its incipient stirrings followed the announcement by Pakistan Government’s Central Education Minister in late 1947 that Urdu would be the country’s only State language. A resolution seeking to make Bengali a language of the Constituent Assembly along with Urdu and English, was defeated on the first day of Session on February 23, 1948, thanks to bitter opposition by former Pakistan Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan. A massive burst of anger exploded in what was then East Bengal, which was renamed East Pakistan in 1955 under former Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Bogra’s one-unit scheme, which also merged the four western provinces into a single unit, West Pakistan.

The anger spread and intensified following Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s visit to East Bengal from March 15 to 28, 1948, during which he reiterated his stand of Urdu being Pakistan’s sole State language and warned Bengalis about the activities of “subversive elements” bent on destroying Pakistan. A lull followed, only to be shattered by the interim report of the Constitutional Basic Principles Committee on September 28, 1950, which stated that Urdu would be Pakistan’s State language. The movement peaked after Nazimuddin, who became the Prime Minister following the assassination of the preceding incumbent, Liaquat Ali Khan, on October 16, 1951, read out from Jinnah’s speech in Dhaka saying that Urdu would be Pakistan’s sole State language. More, he denounced those who wanted Bengali to be a State language as “provincialists” and, as such, enemies of the Pakistani State.

A series of strikes and demonstrations that followed culminated in a general strike throughout East Bengal on February 21, 1952, the day when the four students were killed. Dhaka and many parts of East Bengal remained paralysed on the 22nd when two persons were killed in police firing and 45 injured in lathicharges and tear gassing by the police. The movement intensified throughout Bangladesh in the next few days, with shops and offices closed and train and steamer services paralysed and Dhaka seething in anger. Savage repression by the Government foiled the general strike called for in Dhaka on March 5, 1952. By then, however, the movement had spread to even the most remote reaches of Bangladesh and it had become clear that it was a matter of time before the Central Government accepted Bengali as a State language. This it did on April 19, 1954, when Pakistan’s Constituent Assembly decided that both Bengali and Urdu would become the country’s two State languages.

The installation of Bengali in its rightful place in Pakistan’s governance and public life was a historic victory for the people of East Bengal. It was, however, the immediate and most visible outcome of the language movement. Far more important was the latter’s identity-defining and transformative role in the history of East Bengal, leading to the eventual rise of the sovereign nation of Bangladesh. A mass movement involving almost every part of Bangladesh and every section of its population, it shaped the self-perception of the overwhelming majority of the people as Bengalis as well as Muslims and not — as immediately after India’s Partition — as Muslims above everything else. It also prompted the province’s rising middle class to identify itself passionately with Bengal’s rich, eclectic and liberal-humanist culture, which acted as a powerful countervailing force against the spread of fundamentalist Islamist doctrines in its ranks.

In terms of historical causation, however, the most important consequence was the feeling of self-confidence that victory in the language movement imparted to large sections of people in East Bengal. The increasing feeling that they could confront and defeat the rulers entrenched in Karachi and Islamabad did much to sustain their long resistance to the western wing’s efforts to economically exploit and politically subjugate them, of which the language policy was a part and which owed much to the composition of the country’s armed forces and bureaucracy.

The role of the Army was particularly important. It ruled the country from 1957 to 1968, 1977 to 1988 and then again from 1999, when General Pervez Musharraf captured power through a coup, to 2007, when he resigned as President to avoid impeachment. It has always called the shots even when a civilian Government has been in power. Almost wholly from the western wing, Army officers favoured the interests of the region and, as a hangover from the British period, looked down upon Bengalis as “non-martial.”

The bureaucracy, particularly the Civil Service of Pakistan, which wore the mantle of the erstwhile Indian Civil Service, was dominated by Urdu-speaking people from the western wing. Given the low competence level of Pakistani politicians, they exercised a disproportionate influence on making and implementing policies. People from East Bengal had little say.

An early indication of the intended shape of things to come was clear from the report of the Constitutional Basic Principles Committee, which besides saying that Urdu would be Pakistan’s State language, provided for a Constitution, which would neutralise the impact of East Bengal’s numerical superiority in the country’s politics, and put it under the western wing’s domination. It also sought to create a presidency vested with arbitrary powers, which made it easy for an incumbent to become a dictator. Widespread agitation postponed a decision on the report. Nevertheless, its contents as well as the Government’s language policy convinced an overwhelming majority of people in East Bengal that their Central Government was bent on dominating and exploiting them — a belief that was increasingly strengthened over time by the policies emanating from Karachi and Islamabad.

The rest, including the evolution of the resistance movement into a tidal wave for national liberation under Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s leadership, India’s trouncing of Pakistan in the 1971war and Bangladesh’s emergence as a sovereign nation in the teeth of genocidal repression, is history.

1,22-2-20,A Chinese conundrum,"As that nation catches a cold, the world sneezes. But the virus spread has led to a revival of crucial sectors back home

The effects of Coronavirus, now called COVID-19 by the World Health Organisation (WHO), have mostly been contained along China’s borders. Beijing declared a war-like situation to deal with its spread. It shut down all its cities effectively and Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, became a ghost town. Streets, that once bustled, wore a deserted look. According to data from Flightradar24, a flight tracking site, air traffic in China dropped by over 80 per cent since the outbreak. Nevertheless, the spread of coronavirus forced the entire world to realise just how integral China is to the global supply chain, even when it does not produce finished products. Take the example of the Indian pharmaceutical sector, which is afraid that a shortage of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) that form the basis of many important medications, including anti-retroviral drugs used to manage HIV/AIDS, will start running out by mid-March. We are so dependent on China-sourced raw materials that they form almost 70 per cent of India’s imports of key ingredients for medicines. The potential damage this has caused to the sector cannot be wished away. Most importantly, domestic manufacturing is struggling to take off. But the long-term implications of the spread of the virus must not be missed and it has at least compelled the Government to reset its focus on local sourcing to offset the current supply disruption. In the pharma industry itself, a revival of old drug manufacturing units that once produced key ingredients for crucial medicines is on the cards. In other sectors such as automobiles, a complete shutdown in China is expected to lead to a shortage of fuel-injectors and electronic control units among other devices that are essential to meet the new BS-VI emission norms that come into force nationwide on April 1. In sectors like paints and plastics, China supplies essential dyes used for colouring. Industry insiders have warned that production lines in various sectors as also across the country will come to a screeching halt if supplies do not restart by the middle of next month. And even if they come back into the market, it might take six to eight weeks for fresh products to be shipped from China to India. The situation is so dire that even the Central Government has said that the Coronavirus outbreak can be considered a force majeure on contracts and that it can even be classified as an act of God for vendors so as to negate penalties if delivery schedules are not met. Logistical experts are working overtime to ensure once supplies start, delays at ports and at Customs points are minimised.

While there is no firm outline as to when production will restart at factories, the Chinese Government has announced that production units in Wuhan will remain shuttered till early March at the very least. However, manufacturing can happen around Beijing and the Pearl River Delta, possibly with limited production by next week. The Coronavirus outbreak must serve as a warning for Indian industries to diversify their supply chains. The Indian Government, too, must start encouraging production of critical components within the country. While this is an extreme situation, it has exposed Indian vulnerabilities to Chinese supplies. The latter is the former’s top non-oil trading partner. But statements from the Chinese Government concerning Arunachal Pradesh prove that it is still inimical to India’s interests, even if, at least once, it did support our stance against Pakistan at the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) pertaining to the farce surrounding Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar. While we live in a globalised world and it is impossible for a single nation to do everything for itself, India must use the COVID-19 outbreak as an opportunity to protect its industrial interests. This will be in the world’s greater interests as well.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-chinese-conundrum-2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/a-chinese-conundrum.html
2,22-2-20,Pak in grey zone,"No matter what the FATF says, India has to develop its own dynamic on the war on terror at a time of shifting alliances

Just when all the lobbying by Pakistan seemed to have softened up deciding powers at the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) — the global watchdog that tracks terror-funding States and can disqualify them from global aid — they have held themselves back, and rightly so, keeping our neighbour in the grey list. Though we have been lobbying hard, and had even at one stage argued convincingly enough for Pakistan to be blacklisted, its all-weather friends, China, Turkey and Malaysia, brought it back from the brink. It needed the support of 13 countries to get out of the grey list, and though it has taken a few compliant correctives, they weren’t proof enough. It may have finally imprisoned the 26/11 mastermind of the Mumbai attacks Hafiz Saeed and even booked his charities through which he funded money but is yet to cap the money trail to other terrorists or prosecute the financiers. Besides, it could deliver only on 13 of the 29-point action plan it had promised to implement during the last session. It now must show improvements in the next four months. For India, this comes as a reprieve considering at the last regional meeting of the FATF, it was the lone voice of protest with the US, EU and even Japan appearing convinced about Pakistan’s efforts to curb terrorism. But the US, while endorsing India’s position on Kashmir at the UN and proscribing Jaish chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist, is too invested in stitching up a deal with the Taliban before it exits Afghanistan. That explains the clean chit in Beijing and even the acknowledgement of Pakistan’s “great efforts” at course correction. The US also thinks that freezing aid to Pakistan might just aggravate the economic instability in the region and have a cascading impact on politics. The US also needs a trade deal with India, which is why it will not overtly hurt our position vis-a-vis the FATF. China, which is increasingly looking at a strategic partnership with India while being Pakistan’s ally, has devised its own workaround. It now wants a renegotiation of the FATF brief itself, saying the grouping had no business to blacklist nations but should help them counter terrorist funding and networks. India must realise that the shades of the FATF list mean nothing in terms of threat levels ever since the blacklist was diluted as a “call for action” and the grey list was downgraded to “other monitored jurisdictions.” Besides, the FATF has just put Pakistan on an extended timeline to fulfil the technical criteria and not been exactly censorious about it. For our neighbour, this means a radical overhaul of its terror economy as it has to show visible proof of penalties against terror-financing, including sanctions and controls on international transactions.

In the end, India must remember that global penalties won’t impact Pakistan’s proxy war with India. Even while staying on the FATF watch, there has been no cessation of terrorist infiltration into Kashmir. Pakistan will continue raising Kashmir. India has to evolve its own dynamic regarding terror instead of focussing solely on isolating it diplomatically. For the fluidity of geopolitics means that each nation would work out its tactical advantage in an evolving context and might not prioritise India’s concerns. And global politics is but transactional and revolving stakes mean shifting alliances.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pak-in-grey-zone-2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/pak-in-grey-zone.html
3,22-2-20,Digital slums in internet society,"A divide is explicitly emerging in India, which might result in massive gaps in access to the internet in the age of a network society

The internet has entered all possible dimensions of human existence. It has overwhelmingly transformed the contours of social communication, behaviour and imagination. The web is gainfully managed by knowledge workers, who could be from diverse social groups and identities, to steer it in a determined direction to attribute shape through three indispensible variables: Power, language and culture.

Internet has acquired the status of something that is inherently for the good of the public, hence it must be considered a fundamental human utility. Our growing reliance on communication networks has facilitated the advance of a technology-driven internet society.

In India, the rapid growth of online and partially private behavioural and policy changes in doing business furthered the rise of an (ICT) Information and Communication Technology-monitored “internet economy.” Diffusion of mobile phones could make access possible to various things, which were earlier only physically accessible. In India, not enough theoretical engineering has taken place concerning online communities to enable them to exploit the scope of the same comprehensively. It however, remains explicit that the internet can bring significant threat to conventional corridors of power, making them fearful of its power. And rightly so, as it carries the potential to transform prevailing social structures.

The internet has become a crucial constituent to underline the arrival of digital citizenry throughout the world. This will further contribute in the formulation of different online social groups and identities. However, it is notable that new and efficient legislations have not emerged so far pertaining to digital citizens. Therefore, new citizens act without any constraints, rules and procedures in this new land. This perhaps helps them escape accountability for certain actions, in contrast to the physical citizenry. In doing so, this might develop the case for an appropriate study of anonymity, verification, authenticity and lack of moral currency. Social network theories are helpful to understand online communities in the country. Moreover, information exchange can happen among people of same communities, whether they are members of civil society, students or professionals. We are, however, not sure about the quality of the same.

Internet Society, in a 2017 report, maintains that the Net allows people to develop and join new communities and eliminates geographical barriers to make connections. It further demonstrates that around 53 per cent of the world’s population was offline in 2017. As mainly rural regions of the world did not have access to the internet, this has reasonably contributed to a sharp rise in the digital divide/digital discrimination. The personal freedom to express and right to the internet was largely suspended and put on hold.

The web deliberately seems to be failing in projecting its true meaning to produce extensive, eloquent departures to the new age to humanity, different from the agricultural and industrial society. Though new means of communication have carved out a social, political and economic space for some unnoticeable and unsung communities, the internet has also been considered as a new instrument to withstand new business organisations, power structures and technology-determined groups of diverse nature.

Certainly the goal of digital citizens and digital participation is gaining momentum. India has close to 1,162 million mobile phone subscribers and 1,183 million telephones. Though, in contrast to 2018, there is a sharp decline in mobile subscribers and telephone subscribers in 2019. A major cause of the same could be the deteriorating health of the Indian economy. The Government must employ strong measures to arrange for free and affordable internet to maximise digital participation in digital India. Instead of doing that, the Government is promoting the culture of internet shutdowns across the country. In 2019, the number of internet shutdowns rose over 100 times than in the past.

Ordinary citizens could be the generators and contributors of information i.e. knowledge. This, however, is brought along with the ample use of technology, which is costly and requires trained and efficient individuals to make use of it. In an agricultural society, those who could not acquire land of their own to cultivate then just worked as labourers, in other words service providers. Likewise, in this technology-driven age, with some exceptions, they cannot acquire key positions to make it functional for them, particularly the underprivileged.

Telecom Statistics India (2019), reports that telephone subscribers in rural and urban India stand at 514 million and 669 million respectively. It authenticates that a considerable widening disparity exists between rural and urban telephone subscribers, which stops a sizeable rural population from existing in the online/digital world. A study by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), India Internet (2019), noted that nearly one-third of users access the internet for more than one hour in urban areas, whereas in rural regions, a similar proportion of users access the net for 15-30 minutes. It raises pertinent questions about the elementary construction for rural India to be an effective contributor to the vision of the Digital India Programme.

In this age of alternative facts, anyone can claim information/knowledge by generating and contributing to content making. It raises grave concerns regarding the validation of this information. In the meantime, this has provided people with ample opportunities to become knowledge producers instead of remaining consumers of manufactured information/knowledge.

Women’s Rights Online by the World Wide Web Foundation says that in the poor areas of New Delhi, the few women who are online use the internet to look for important information on their rights (17 per cent), search for jobs (29 per cent) or voice their opinions online (eight per cent). The survey, initiated to minimise the gender gap in India, argues for prioritising free public net access.

In another report by IAMAI (2017), in urban India, the ratio of women mobile internet users stands at 40 per cent as opposed to an impressive 60 per cent of men. In rural India, women mobile internet users are only 33 per cent compared to 67 per cent men.

This widening inequality might be a notable obstruction to the purpose of digital equality and participation. It, therefore, shall be a matter of grave concern to all of us. According to the same report, 57 per cent of the mobile internet users are under the age of 25 and a large portion of that, with the help of fake news, trolling and disinformation, cater to online constituencies of political parties.

Still there are people who can’t access the internet as they don’t have smart phones, laptops, gadgets and other mandatory devices. Therefore, a digital divide is explicitly emerging in India, which might result in massive gaps in access to the internet in the age of a network society. The huge cost of access to and the use of new technology will set the stage for a digital divide i.e. digital discrimination. Digital illiteracy is also on the constant rise in India. Paradoxically, the Government is claiming to be manufacturing the base at a breakneck pace for Digital India, without addressing these unrelenting problems.

Leading theorist of the information society, Frank Webster argues that the new society is more of a theoretical one. The construction of these theories will determine the democratic and egalitarian patterns of this new age. If these ingrained flaws formed during the construction of theoretical knowledge are rectified, it would foster a sustainable information environment.

Undeniably, at this epoch, we have information in abundance and fewer instruments to certify authenticity, relevancy and beneficial information, which set the score for the post-truth age. Meanwhile, still, some of them could not enjoy the enormousness of information. Hence a parallel, mammoth building in the internet society is constructed, wherein digital slums will find a permanent place, without any trace of their digital history.

4,22-2-20,Medical R&D a lost cause,"Medical research should be one area where we have the potential to lead India towards the beginning of an era of bio-economy by 2030

Research and Development (R&D) contribute to strengthening the economy of a country in terms of growth and revenue. While R&D is primal, it is also essential that the Government pays attention to sustain the same in every industry and particularly healthcare, which is one of the fastest growing sectors. At present, the healthcare industry has a long way to go when it comes to research and technological progress. There is a dire need for R&D in basic medical sciences so that indigenous technology gets a chance to grow. This is only possible, when there is support from the Central Government in the form of policies and capital. The availability of good infrastructure, too, is imperative to create a conducive environment for R&D. Thankfully, several areas have been identified by the Centre to keep up the tempo on infrastructure development. It is well-known that several large organs are received from human donors only and the wide disparity in the supply and demand ratio has resulted in many fatalities. Today, the stage is evolving into a time where solid organs could be manufactured using a person’s own cells and a biological scaffold, like a shark fin, on which it could be grown. This will soon be available off the shelf. Shark skin is another potential tissue substrate to create biological tissue heart valves in view of its inherent tensile strength and durability. Unfortunately, due to ignorance on the part of regulatory bodies and other law enforcing agencies, even the licence for producing them has been poorly formulated and prioritised.

Another important area is in the realm of stem cell research with its tremendous regenerative potential, but we face many hurdles in their commercial production despite having the knowledge, technology and facilities. According to a recent study published in the British Medical Journal, the Indian medical industry fares poorly on multiple critical parameters, including the quality of care, ill-equipped facilities, lack of healthcare professionals, paucity of funds and professional qualifications of doctors, making the entire sector a debatable part of the Indian economy. Therefore it is important that provisions be made in the Union Budget to address this issue by providing funds for skill acquisition and establishment of educational institutions. It is quite overwhelming to see that in our country, where growth is a priority, change is a very slow and ignored process and our healthcare sector has been ailing for several decades now. But, as the country recompenses a claim at the geopolitical high table under a nationalist Government, its human development motives are increasingly pushed toward severe scrutiny. Also in this day and age, affordable healthcare for all should be one of the top priorities of the Government.

Growth in India’s younger working population is also posing challenges we have not seen before. High stress levels, unhealthy and sedentary lifestyle, increased intake of processed foods, increased tobacco and alcohol use and so on, are giving rise to co-morbidities like diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia/obesity and other lifestyle diseases, which in turn have accelerated the growth of Coronary Artery Disease with a high incidence of premature deaths. The major challenges being faced in cardiac care are low availability of quality treatment, specialists, preventive and curative cardiac care facilities and due to this, the future of cardiac care should be given a holistic outlook. In addition, majority of the hospitals with cardiac facilities are located in urban areas while the rest of the country is faced with little to no access to quality care.

Today, technological disruptions are transforming healthcare delivery worldwide. The role of medical technology, emergence of Information and Communications Technology, expanding network of the internet and social media play a major role in transforming healthcare delivery. Digital medicine is the future as devices get interconnected. In a large country like ours teamwork is crucial when it comes to delivering quality healthcare. The current taxation policies and regulations do not address issues regarding diagnostic tests and home healthcare, which should definitely be considered under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, as well. In our nation, healthcare has always been expanding and the need to increase expenditure proportionally has to be addressed.

India imports more than 75 per cent of its medical devices and patented drugs, thus making healthcare unaffordable to the masses. While we are big on generic drugs, new molecule development and patenting is lacklustre. Moreover, medical equipment should be exempted from taxes so that healthcare is more affordable. The necessity to forge new advances in cardiac healthcare and bio-medical engineering are being slowly extinguished not by time but by a Government that is apathetic to the possibility that millions could have access to better healthcare and this, in turn, could stimulate and pioneer cutting-edge research. India should make optimum use of the new Budget which will create an opportunity for opening and supporting the first Medical SEZ. Time and again, India has taken the lead in pioneering developments. Medical research should be one area where we have the potential to lead the country towards the beginning of an era of bio-economy by 2030.

5,22-2-20,The quality of water still awaits a verdict,"Clean supply is a basic right like clean air and is needed for survival. The citizens of Delhi must fight for their fair share of this important natural resource

Last November saw at least four reports coming out in quick succession pertaining to the quality of the piped water supply in the Delhi-National Capital Region (Delhi-NCR). In two of its reports, the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs stated that the tap water samples collected from different parts of Delhi failed to meet safety norms. However, these reports were quickly followed by two more studies, this time from the Jal Shakti Ministry and the Delhi Government, which rebutted the Union Ministry’s reports and gave a nod of approval to the Capital’s water supply.

They even labelled the water quality to be better than that of some European cities. Even though the comparison with European cities seems a bit far-fetched, what is really worrying is the fact that the citizens of Delhi still have no conclusive answer regarding the quality of their water supply. And all the reports did was to spark off a slanging match between various political parties in an election year.

Traditionally, we rely on the authentic testing standards and procedures of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). In September 2019, the BIS collected tap water samples from 11 locations across Delhi and tested the same for odour, colour and pH values and Total Dissolved Solids. These were part of the 24 parameters on which the samples were assessed. The water samples eventually failed on all the 24 parameters, leading to a major hue and cry in the political as well as public sphere.

However, even as the confusion over the authenticity of various reports remains, children and the elderly continue to consume water with dubious quality. The only one to gain out of this mess is the water purifier industry, which is witnessing an unprecedented boom on the back of the fears of the populace. The just-concluded elections also did not see any of the contesting parties give clarity on how they would approach the problem of unsafe drinking water and air pollution in the national Capital.

So, for the citizens of Delhi, the problems continue unabated as they battle with dirty air and water, with no respite in sight. In January, a leading media group commissioned a study to test the water quality in seven Lok Sabha constituencies across Delhi in an effort to highlight the water quality woes of the Capital before the February 8 Assembly elections. Termed as Operation Paani, the initiative involved collecting water samples from across the city on three different days and getting them tested by independent water quality experts. The tests eventually found that half of Delhi was getting unsafe drinking water. However, this time the report has not found any detractors. But then, the elections are over, so who is bothered to highlight the issue anymore. The spectre of beleaguered, frustrated and short on temper residents fighting for water near rusty water tankers is an all too common sight in India. Unfortunately, it is the same even in the national Capital and has remained so even after decades of governance by some of the so-called best governments in power. It seems like it is in the best interests of political parties not to solve such problems so that they can be milked for votes in the next elections.

This, sadly, is the fix that India finds herself in, where political issues are kept alive at the cost of the common man. So, how does Delhi get its water right? Clean water is a basic right like clean air and is needed for survival. The citizens must fight for their fair share of this important natural resource. The present Government in Delhi prides itself on the fact that it is people-friendly and approachable, which means it must listen to the problems of the people and more importantly do something about solving the issues that matter to the populace. And not just the Government, water woes are an amazing opportunity for the corporate world, too, if India Inc wants to approach the issue through its corporate social responsibility (CSR) programme. Under the CSR programme, corporates can tie up with the Government and install an on-the-spot water checking mechanism that is connected to the water supply pipes. This will give a real time feedback on the quality of the water being supplied. If suitable technology is paired with this initiative, then water quality readings can be forwarded to the citizens’ phone through an app and also be sent to the Government department concerned. This initiative will definitely improve water quality and Government accountability in one go, provided the politicisation of the issue stops and a genuine quest for a solution begins.

13,22-2-20,War of words between Akhilesh and CM’s media advisor,"A Twitter war over ‘Ram Rajya’ versus Samajwad broke out between Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and the media advisor to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday.

Yogi had recently observed that the country needed ‘Ram Rajya’ not Samajwad & socialism was no longer relevant, and the country did not need the ideology. Reacting to this, Akhilesh listed the reasons for the relevance of socialism.

Marshalling his arguments in favour of socialism, the SP chief said: “The Chief Minister’s comment that ‘Samajwad nahi chahiye’ was against letter and spirit and also against the essence of the Constitution.’’

“The Chief Minister is against the poor and he is siding with the rich and capitalists. The CM is working for a particular class of the society and not for the whole society. He is against egalitarianism and social equality as socialism also stands for caste less society,” he alleged

In a quick riposte, CM’s media advisor Mrityunjay Kumar said: “Only one family headed by Akhilesh Yadav flourished in the garb of socialism. The family amassed huge wealth and also got the office of Chief Minister”.

Without naming the coup against Mulayam Singh leading to his marginalisation in Samajwadi Party and Akhilesh capturing the party, Kumar said, “Akhilesh Yadav attacked the very person with whose blessings he managed to occupy the post of Chief Minister.’’

Mrityunjay further said, “Goondaism and corruption rose by leaps and bounds during the SP regime. I salute this kind of ‘Samajwad’ from a distance.’’

Attaching the video link of the CM’s speech on a debate on motion of thanks to Governor Anandiben Patel in Assembly on Wednesday, Kumar said: “It’s beyond your capacity to comprehend the meaning of ‘Ram Rajya’. Listen to the Chief Minister’s speech once again.’’

During his speech in Assembly on Wednesday, Chief minister Yogi Adityanath launched a scathing attack on the SP chief and his father Mulayam Singh Yadav. Yogi said that the Supreme Court verdict in favor of Ram temple on November 9 last year, underlined the fact that those who ordered police firing against Kar Sewaks in Ayodhya in October/November 1990 were wrong and Ram Bhakts were on the right path.

Without naming Mulayam Singh, Yogi recalled his controversial ‘boys will be boys’ remark and mocked the opposition for speaking on women empowerment.

While opposing capital punishment for rape, Mulayam Singh had sparked an outrage by saying ‘ladke, ladke hain... galti ho jati hai’ (boys will be boys... they commit mistakes).”

The CM also criticised Akhilesh for sending his daughter to Hussainabad where protests are being staged by women against the CAA.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/war-of-words-between--akhilesh-and-cm---s--media-advisor.html
14,22-2-20,Govt to set up centre to increase population of vultures,"Aiming to conserve near-extinct vultures and help increase their numbers, the Uttar Pradesh government will set up state’s first Jatayu Conservation and Breeding Centre at Bhari-Vaisi village in Pharenda tehsil of Maharajganj.

To be developed on five hectares under Gorakhpur Forest division, the centre will be developed on the line of India’s first such centre at Pinjore in Haryana.

A senior government official told The Pioneer on Friday that the centre at Maharajganj would be set up jointly by Wildlife Research Organization and Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS).

“The BNHS has prepared a Detailed Project Report (DPR), which has been sent to seek funds under the CAMPA scheme. About 60 percent of the survey work has already been completed,” he added.

The official said it would be the first scientific centre of vultures in UP to find out which species is the most threatened and the locations where these natural scavengers were thriving. “A survey carried out in 2014 across 13 districts of the state put the population of vultures at 900,” he said.

“The government has decided to set up the centre at Bhari-Vaisi village of Maharajganj as over 100 vultures were seen in Madhwaliya range of Maharajganj Forest division in August last year. Another flock of these birds had also been seen near a bovine protection centre set up by state government. Abandoned bovines were kept in this bovine centre. Because of being very old and week, these cattle die very soon, and their corpses naturally attract vultures,” he said.

The Indian Vulture (Gyps Indicus) found in India, Pakistan and Nepal has been listed as a critically endangered on International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List since 2002, as the population severely dwindled. To protect the scavenger, the UP government had earlier proposed setting up of a Vulture restaurant in 2016 which failed to get the nod from the then Akhilesh Yadav regime.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-to-set-up-centre----to-increase-population----of-vultures.html
15,22-2-20,Congress announces candidates for election to Legislative Council seats,"Uttar Pradesh Congress announced candidates for election to vacant Legislative Council seats from Graduate and Teachers Graduate Constituencies on Friday.

As per in-charge of UPCC administration Siddharth Priya Srivastava, Rajesh Dwivedi will be the party candidate from Agra, Jitendra Kumar Gaur from Meerut, Ajay Kumar Singh from Allahabad and Brijesh Kumar Singh from Lucknow while for Graduate constituencies, the candidates will be Nagendra Nath Tripathi from Gorakhpur-Faizabad and Dr Mehndi Hassan from Bareilly-Moradabad.,

Meanwhile, Srivastava hit out at the BJP government for their leaders involvement in sensational crimes or their kin taking law into their hand.

“Uttar Pradesh has been pushed into ‘jungle raj’ by the Yogi’s government. Now his party legislators or their close kin are indulging in sensational crimes and taking law in their hands,” Srivastava asserted while referring to cases registered with Bhadohi, Ballia and Bulandshahr police during the last 48 hours.

Srivastava said people have not forgotten how BJP MLA Kuldeen Sengar raped a minor girl and got the father of the victim killed, another former BJP minister Swami Chinmayanand was involved in sexual exploitation of a LLM student and there were several others instances were BJP members exploited their status and committed crime with impunity.

Only on Thursday, two cases were registered against BJP MLA’s sons in Bulandshahr and Ballia. He claimed that in Bulandshahr, the BJP MLA’s son was booked for opening fire during a wedding ceremony despite a ban on the practice. An FIR was lodged against BJP’s Khurja MLA Vijendra Singh Khatik’s son Vikas Khatik after a video of Vikas firing multiple shots from a gun surfaced on social media on Thursday.

Similarly in Ballia, BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh’s son was accused for manhandling a Dalit Revenue department official. The official, Radheyshyam Ram, registered a case against Hazari Singh and 10 others for manhandling and abusing him on Wednesday. All accused were booked under relevant sections of the IPC and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

Srivastava said that despite the offences being non-bailable, the police did not arrest the MLA’s son for his contacts.

The Congress leader claimed that likewise in Bhadohi, local BJP MLA Ravindra Nath Tripathi and six others, including his three sons, were accused of raping a woman repeatedly for a month in 2017.

“In this case too, the local police instead of registering a case gave a free hand to the accused to terrorise the victim and get the case withdrawn. It was only after the media highlighted the issue that the police provided security to the victim but no action was taken against the accused so far,” Sriavstava said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/congress-announces----candidates-for-election----to-legislative-council-seats.html

18,22-2-20,Cane commissioner wary of locust attacks,"Due to the information of locust (grasshopper) outbreak in some states, Commissioner of Cane and Sugar (UP) Sanjay R Bhoosreddy issued instructions to all departmental officers and scientists of Sugarcane Research Centres to carry out awareness campaign among farmers to protect cane crop from pests in the state.

Bhoosreddy said that locusts attack in a flock and devour green leaves of any kind of vegetative plants rapidly and in high quantity.

“Since its activity increases in less water, drought and summer, special caution is required during summers,” he said.

“Locusts breed and grow in winter (from November to December), spring (from January to June) and summer (from July to October). Locust outbreaks have been reported in border areas of UP. To avoid locust raids, it is necessary to constantly survey and monitor so that in they could be prevented from spreading in the state and wreak havoc,” he said.

Bhoosreddy instructed officials for close monitoring of the possibility of occurrence of the pest, and warn farmers on a priority and ensure awareness about locusts. “Once that is done, we could adopt the principle of ‘prevention was better than cure and necessary protective measures could be taken in time to protect the cane crop,” he said.

The Cane Commissioner also appealed to cane farmers to closely monitor locust outbreaks while visiting their fields. “If locusts are spotted in cane fields, spray insecticides like Chlorpyrifos 20 percent EC, Chlorpyrifos 50 percent EC, Bundiomethrin, Fipronil and Lambda immediately,” he advised.

“To ensure immediate preventive measures, cane farmers should inform concerned institutions of Government of India and also inform Cane Development Department immediately,” he said.

Regional and district officers have also been allocated targets based on area to keep watch regularly and to visit villages continuously to make farmers aware and take adequate precautions to thwart any possible attack of locusts.

“Officials have been instructed to distribute pamphlets, handbills and publish pest prevention measures in newspapers, write pest prevention measures on walls of all offices and warehouses and convey information to all farmers,” Bhoosreddy said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cane-commissioner----wary-of-locust-attacks.html
19,22-2-20,BG teachers now denied right to protest,"It reminds one of the famous quote of former American President Abraham Lincoln, ‘You cannot fool all the people all the time,’ as one sees the long agitation of the Block Grant (BG) teachers in Odisha against the hypocrisy of the State Government.

As the disgruntled teachers have again warned the Government of taking to streets after being befooled by the Government, wary of saving its skin, the Government has now grown vindictive. In a recent circular by the Higher Education Department, it has been told that if any teacher remains on leave for participating in any agitation, it will be viewed seriously leading to curtailment of salary, pre-mature retirement and even withholding of the financial grant to the institution. However, the move has raised eyebrows as it not just exposes the autocratic attitude of the Government meant to suppress agitation by the teachers by hook or by crook, but a breach of the their fundamental rights protesting an injustice.

As per reports, when the Government framed the 2017 Grant-In-Aid (GIA) order, it was clarified that the teachers and employees under Block Grant system would be entitled to all benefits, including DA, yearly increment and salary hike as per 7th Pay Commission recommendations. Though the new GIA policy was based on the declaration of CM Naveen Patnaik to abolish Block Grant system in order to regularise the beneficiaries but the GIA 2017 order was framed in such a manner that there was no scope for regularisation of service.

Again, before the last general elections, these employees under the banner of the Odisha School, College Teachers and Employees United Forum held a dharna before the State Assembly for fulfilment of their genuine demands like service conditions, equal pay for equal work, abolition of all anomalies in GIA order 2017 , extension of GIA to newly opened schools and colleges, pension benefits to employees and enhancement of pay as per the 7th Pay Commission rules etc.

To satisfy them, the BJD leaders had assured them of fulfilling the demands if their party came to power. Accordingly, these employees declared their support and felicitated CM Patnaik. But after the win of the BJD and Patnaik forming the Government for the fifth consecutive time, the ruling party reneged from its commitments.

While this has led to large scale resentment among the teachers and employees and they are preparing for a next bout of agitation, in order to cut them to size, the Higher Education Minister has implemented 5T principles under which 7-hour duty and biometric attendance were made mandatory. And, as per its latest move to foil agitation of the teachers, the circular issued on February 18 has banned any leave for participating in agitation against the Government.

To create division among the teachers community, the Government is going to make different pay structures for 488 category and 662 category of college teachers and employees. Commissioner cum Secretary of Higher Education Saswat Mishra has warned not to sanction any leave to any employee saying ‘leave is not a matter of right.’

On the other hand, convenor of 662 category colleges Golak Nayak said that in a democratic country, peaceful demonstration is a fundamental right of an individual. “But the Higher Education Department in Odisha is making a mockery of it by mounting pressure on the Principals not to let off their employees for agitation,” said Nayak, adding that he would move the court of law soon for breach of the fundamental rights of the teachers community.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bg-teachers-now-denied-right-to-protest.html

34,22-2-20,"Dissent, dialogue key features of democracy","The blanket labelling of dissent as ‘anti-national’ or ‘anti-democratic’ strikes at the heart of our commitment to the protection of constitutional values and promotion of a deliberative democracy,” a national newspaper reported Justice DY Chandrachud as saying as part of Justice PD Desai Memorial Lecture at Gujarat High Court. He said this while advocating on the citizen’s right to protest against the prevailing laws in every conceivable manner.

‘Dissent’ is an essential feature of a democracy, but it has only one just method of resolution that is ‘dialogue’. It is not universal in every issue, we at times also move ahead with unanimity but its absence is not absolute either.

The very idea of India entails plurality which is an obvious ground for disagreement and dissent. But ‘plurality’ is in many ways a positive notion that presupposes a ‘harmonious coexistence of the differences’ or ‘heterogeneous harmony’, howsoever one may put it. But what holds a ‘plural entity’ together, especially when it is plurality in caste, creed, colour, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, is the space for dissent, respect for differences and a judicious majority as opposed to a whimsical majoritarianism.

A true democracy with a plural culture shall not leap either from dissent to riot or to a disagreement that is muzzled by the State machinery before it is clearly expressed as dissent or even if shaped as dissent, it is undemocratically suppressed.

The ‘idea of India’ and the ‘Indian democracy’, has travelled through the scale of considerable challenges, which at times have threatened their very existence. But what has thwarted the threats is the resilience and the Darwinian trait of adaptability that is imbibed in the very being of Indianness.

Dissent is the seed to change, the change of status, stature and state, without which, it is impossible to comprehend development and improvement of the human standard of thought and living. There are many theories of substance that give us an array of reliable answers to the question of ‘what freed us of undemocratic British subjugation’, like, the idea of ‘non-violence movement’ to the post second World War ‘financial debility in British empire’ and the mounting international pressure thereafter, especially that of the USA, which was hostile to British rule, but conceptually, the most plausible answer is, the courage to ‘dissent’ from the plans of the mighty British empire.

Revolutions are born in the lap of ‘dissent’, parented by both ‘dissent’ and ‘enlightenment as to truth’. Calling a spade a spade is the first sign of intellectual honesty, which may not always make you politically correct but is certainly crucial to national development and which when stated against the popular perception is labelled as ‘dissent’.

Being unpopular while stating a truth is not a curse, but is rather essential. The world’s most popular ideas were at one point of time unpopular, Gandhi and Nelson Mandella were jailed; Ambedkar was disliked; Galileo was charged with heresy for propounding the theory of ‘heliocentrism’ or ‘the earth and planets revolve around the sun’.

Ambedkar most popularly said, ‘Educate, Agitate and Organise.’ This is something which is by far most judicious approach towards ‘dissent’. It advances an idea of dissenting, which is tempted by an ‘enlightenment reached through education and truth’. Today if a majority of the persecuted nationalities have found voice and organisational manifestation, the coming up of Dalit India Chambers of Commerce and Industries (DICCI) mentored by Adi Godrej is only because of such a clarion call.

While being in total agreement with Justice DY Chandrachud, another thing may be added to the story of ‘running the democracy’, that is, dialogue is essential, but it can only be possible when dissent is fuelled by truth but not the torments of religious propaganda and caste, class and religious hysteria. Dialogue shouldn’t be either to simply pacify the differences and dissent, but to understand the real cause behind it and reason out with such cause and be considerate in the approach while trying to resolve the differences. In essence, the process should lead to dominance of one thing that is justice.

What has disturbed many of us over last few weeks is the video footage of the police atrocity and lathicharge on the innocent students in the reading hall of Jamia library. By any stretch of imagination, even if the police have released videos of CAA protesters entering the library with stones, the police action was not justified.

Dissenting is not terrorism, we ought to be reasonable and judicious even if we may subscribe to a different ideology.

‘Dissent’ that is treated with a ‘meaningful dialogue’ shall definitely lead to a robust democracy, and this in return shall make us go way ahead of the mark of socio-economic development, political maturity we could have ever contemplated. This by far is the most cherishable among the best Constitutional practices we can think of in tackling the challenges of the prevalent times.

38,22-2-20,Closed Adhunik Metaliks plant to be rerun,"Now, the decks are cleared for the Delhi-based Liberty House to take over and run the Adhunik Metaliks unit after a green signal from the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), New Delhi. Notably, the plant has been shut down since April 1, 2018, throwing about 5,000 workers jobless.

Though Liberty House chairman Sanjeev Gupta’s declaration to start the company has brought a ray of hope among the Adhunik Metaliks workers, but there is confusion over whether the new management will accommodate the old workers.

The Adhunik Metaliks Karmachari Sangh (affiliated to CITU) while welcoming the decision has urged the Liberty House management, the district administration and the State Government to ensure redeployment of the former workers.

Briefing mediapersons, AMKS president and CITU national vice-president Bishnu Mohanty said, “In 2004, Adhunik Metaliks started it production in its Chardihariharpur, Kuarmunda unit. The major production items of the unit were TMT bar and sponge iron. While about 1,500 direct workers and officers were engaged in the company, more than 3,500 contract workers were also engaged. Besides, the other ancillary units and nearby areas were also getting economic momentum due to the plant.”

But on February 13, 2015, the company management unilaterally declared the lockout of the company which was vehemently opposed by the AMKS. The State Government declared the lockout illegal. After certain legal battle, the company rerun from May 7, 2015 to July 31, 2017 with the help of CDR and SDR. But within these periods, the company management could not succeed to revive the situation of the unit and finally Adhunik Metaliks was declared insolvent and declared for auction.

The Liberty House got the authority to take over and rerun the unit through auction and got clearance from all legal hurdles on February 17.

So, in this context, Mohanty urged for re-engagement of the employees of Adhunik Metaliks as they were starving with their families due to being jobless for a long time, though they had a lot of contribution for the establishment of the plant.

Besides, taking the old workforce will lead to a conducive environment between the management and workers in the smooth running of the plant, claimed Mohanty.

Among others, union leaders Biman Maity, Raj Kishore Pradhan, Jahangir Alli, Srmant Behera, Prafulla Padhihari, PL Mishra, Maheswar Nath, Bijay Kumar Swain, Atal Bihari Swain, N Senapati, SK Patra, Debasish Sahoo, Alok De and Debanarayan Jena were present.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/closed-adhunik-metaliks-plant-to-be-rerun.html
39,22-2-20,UT Admin set to alter wildlife corridor plan,"Having failed to execute its much-touted project of developing a wildlife corridor between the Lake Reserve Forest and Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary in the past one decade, the Chandigarh Administration is now set to revise the project proposal in an attempt to resolve the land acquisition problem.

The Administration has planned to construct a pathway on about 100 acres land instead of a corridor which was proposed to come up at around 450 acres land to connect the forest area and wildlife sanctuary.

The decision has been taken in view of huge cost involved in developing the wildlife corridor, aimed at creating a safe passage for wildlife between the forest area and sanctuary. The proposed corridor to come up between the Reserve Forest area and the Regulator End of the Sukhna Lake on a stretch spanning nearly 1.4 km was to be developed in phases.

The corridor plan was, however, put on the backburner even as around 50 acres land was acquired by the Administration in 2011 for the project.

“A meeting was convened recently to hold discussion on how to proceed on the long-pending wildlife corridor project. It is estimated that around Rs 2500 crore would be spent if the Administration go ahead with the existing plan.

As huge funds are required for acquiring land, including a special grant from the Central Government, we have decided to chalk out a revised plan where about 100 acres land would be required for the project,” said a senior officer of UT Administration while talking to The Pioneer.

The officer said that instead of acquiring a total of 450 acres land to connect the forest area and wildlife sanctuary, we have planned to acquire a total of 100 acres to construct the pathway.

This would not require huge funds and could be implemented after the Centre’s approval, he added.

Objective of the corridor

The wildlife corridor on land measuring 450 acres in Kaimbwala village in the north-eastern part of the city adjoining the inter-state boundary with Punjab and on the upper end of the Sukhna Lake was proposed in Chandigarh Master Plan 2031.

The Lake Reserve Forest and Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary are separated by agricultural land and the growing wildlife population in the Sanctuary has often resulted in animal straying into nearby settlements in Kishangarh and Khuda Ali Sher in the Union Territory of Chandigarh and in Kansal in the State of Punjab.

As per the master plan, the basic objective of the wildlife corridor is to provide connectivity of sanctuary and reserve forest so that animals from the forest area can move freely to wildlife sanctuary and vice-versa. At present, the Reserve Forest is separated from Wildlife Sanctuary by roads and agricultural land.

The Reserve Forest area is also prone to fire hazards especially in summer, due to which wild animals like Sambhar stray into city area and also onto the roads. If the wildlife corridor is established, the wild animals can in case of such fire hazards and other such emergencies, move into the area of wildlife sanctuary, the master plan stated.

The Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary habitat has a large number of Sambars, peacocks and endangered species like spotted deer, porcupine, pangolin, wild pigs, cheetal. The Lake Forest Reserve is also inhabited by Sambars and other animals.

Sambars, monkeys, snakes, pythons are often found to have strayed into the residential areas posing a risk to the human life.

The corridor project is also aimed at preventing unauthorized construction taking place in the area and to preserve and protect the wildlife in the Sanctuary

Thematic plantation at acquired 50 acre land

On the acquired 50 acre land at village Kaimbwala, the Forest Department, Chandigarh has carried out thematic plantation of fruit bearing species in around 48 acre area while the rest of the two acre area, which already has the vegetation is being maintained as such.

Saplings of fruit bearing species namely Mango, Jamun, Guava, Shatoot, Neem, Pipal, Pilkhan, Dhek, Imli etc have been planted to improve the quality and bio-diversity of the vegetation in the Lake Reserve Forest behind Sukhna Lake. Availability of the food to the wildlife and monkeys in the area will be ensured by this plantation, the Chandigarh master plan stated.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ut-admin-set-to-alter-wildlife-corridor-plan.html

According to Negi, the state government is just trying to trick the Anganwadi workers by passing the proposal for maternity leave. “The High Court had already passed the order for providing the maternity leaves for Anganwadi workers two years ago but the chief minister is talking about implementing this order now.

Around 32,000 women workers who are divorced, widows, single mothers or abandoned by their husbands are not going to benefit from the maternity leave. Such women workers need the proper allowance from the government to take care of themselves and their families,” said Negi.

She further said that the Anganwadi workers suspended their protest on the assurance that the government will form a committee to address the issues of the workers by March 10 and the allowance will be raised from the new session that begins in April.

But so far, nothing has been done by the government. Just to project the government as considerate towards the Anganwadi women workers, the CM passed the proposal of maternity leave which was not even among the demands of Anganwadi workers, opined Negi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/anganwadi-workers-seek-raise-in-allowance--not-maternity-leave--says-rekha-negi.html
67,22-2-20,PPSA accuses SCPCR of unnecessary interference,"The State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) is unnecessarily interfering in the matters of private schools and education- issues which are not related to the commission, alleged the president of Principals Progressive Schools’ Association (PPSA) Prem Kashyap.

Addressing the media at the Press Club, members of the association alleged that the managers of various private schools in the state are being harassed by SCPCR.

Kashyap said that children whose parents’ monthly income is less than Rs 4,500 are given admission under Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act.

As per the education department, school management can ask the parents of the child availing education under RTE to show the income certificate of the family.

However, when the management of Doon World School asked for the income certificate of the students studying under RTE, SCPCR served them notice for alleged mental harassment of the child and the parents.

“How can the child rights commission serve the notice to the management of the school on the basis of the complaints of some parents who showed wrong details of their monthly income during the admission of their children? When the detail of income is found wrong by the school,

the parents have to pay the full fees of the child. Even if after a few months or years, the monthly income of parents increases, they will have to submit the fee in the school since the time their salary increased. We are talking about the parents who do not submit the proper fee of the school in spite of being financially well off,” said Kashyap.

The members of PPSA also alleged that repeated interference by SCPCR chairperson Usha Negi is because of her extensive political interest in the state. According to them, Negi recently sent a notice to a school, when the school management denied admission to a child.

Kashyap said that every school has its own criteria for giving admission to children and there is no provision in the government that says a school cannot deny admission to any child. The notice sent by Negi is completely pointless, he said.

Doon International School chairman DS Mann and other PPSA members were also present in Press conference.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ppsa-accuses-scpcr-of-unnecessary-interference.html

Singh further said that in this drive apart from Jharkhand Police other stake holders are not showing much interest they should also co-operate in this drive to completely eradicate the Puppy cultivation from the State.

“Since mid of January the poppy crops starts giving flower then it is easy to see and destroy it. The harvesting time of the crop is mid March to April end. The Police start this drive every year in this session because if the police will start the drive months before January like October or November then the farmers will sow it again,” said Singh.

Namkum Police Station In charge cum Police Inspector, Praveen Kumar led the Poppy destruction team which destroyed Poppy around large area under Namkum police station. The drive is going on since last 19 days in the area, informed Kumar.

It may be mentioned here that Chief Secretary DK Tiwari emphasized on strict measures to curb the production, sale and smuggling of narcotics in Jharkhand.

He directed to create a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for fixing the responsibility of the officers of all the concerned departments for this.

In this, it will be clear that at which level, which officer will have what role and responsibility. Also, what would be the mechanism to curb the drugs. At the same time, how will effective coordination be made between the responsible officers of different departments. The Chief Secretary has instructed to make its proposal.

She said, “Parents of the children who are studying under RTE Act will definitely save some money as under this act BPL parents do not have to spend much to provide quality education to their kids.

Why should a school suddenly ask for the income certificate of such children’s family when they are already studying there for many years?” She added that schools in the state are not giving admission to poor children under RTE Act and even if they do, they make them sit separately from other students. The school management is harassing children. SCPCR works for the welfare of children and not just schools.

If the schools do not follow the guidelines as per the government, High Court or Supreme Court, and neglect child welfare, the SCPCR will get involved in such matters.

She said, “The schools are not following guidelines like the formation of POCSO committee, giving admission to poor children under RTE Act and appointing a child counsellor in the schools. The authority is consistently pressurising the schools to follow such guidelines and that is why such schools are accusing SCPCR of interference.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/scpcr-concerned-with-harassment--non-observance-of-guidelines-in-schools--negi.html

73,22-2-20,Govt under pressure as employees threaten indefinite strike,"The announcement of indefinite strike from March 2 made by the Uttarakhand General, OBC employees association has put the State Government in a tight spot as the Budget Session of the Assembly is commencing from March 3. The association made this declaration during the massive rally to the residence of chief minister in Dehradun on Thursday. The association is also planning to hold state wide Mashal rallies on February 26 to warn the government.

The threat of indefinite strike given by the powerful association is being viewed as a pressure tactics to exert pressure on the state government to implement the order of Supreme Court (SC) on the reservation in promotions and withdraw the ban imposed on promotions. The budget session of the Uttarakhand Vidhan Sabha is starting from March 3 at Gairsain and by threatening to go on an indefinite strike a day prior to the start of the session,

the association of General and OBC employees know that the time is right to put pressure on the government. The association is also demanding that the State Government should place a bill in the Vidhan Sabha on promotions without reservation. When contacted, the general secretary of the Rajya Karamchari Sanyukt Parishad and a prominent leader of the General, OBC association, Arun Pandey said that the employees don’t want to put pressure on the Government.

He said that it was the state government which challenged an adverse order of Uttarakhand HC in SC and got a favourable decision from the apex court.

Pandey said that now the government is dithering to implement the order on account of undue politics on the issue. He said that in the neighbouring UP, the BJP government has implemented the order and has even reverted the officers of SC and ST categories.

“ We are not demanding reversion and only want the state government to remove ban on promotion and undertake promotions on the basis of merit and seniority,’’ he said.

While hearing a Special Leave Petition (SLP), the SC on February 7 had said had opined that the states are not bound to provide reservation in promotions and said that the reservation is not a fundamental right. The SLP was filed by the Uttarakhand government against the Uttarakhand High Court (HC) order in Gyanchand Vs state case.

This order has brought a sharp schism among the employees on caste lines. The general and OBC employees want that there should be no reservation in promotion while the SC and ST want that the benefit of reservation should be extended to them in promotions also.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-under-pressure-as-employees-threaten-indefinite-strike.html

The mayor snatched the mike away from the MLA after which the MLA snatched it back from the mayor to speak in the meeting, which elicited sloganeering from the councillors.

Shortly after its start, the MCR board meeting witnessed councillors objecting to views of the Jhabreda MLA.

Responding to this, the mayor said that development works costing about Rs 1.5 crore had been done in Karnwal’s constituency and the boards placed there carry his name. After this when the Jhabreda MLA spoke, the councilors protested. The mayor also objected to Karnwal’s statements averring, that the MLA had insulted him.

80,22-2-20,Ranchi’s LGBTQ community not out of closet yet,"The Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer (LGBTQ) community seems to have not come out of its closet in Ranchi yet. Ayushmann Khurrana starrer ‘Shubh Mangal Zyada Savdhaan’, a film revolving around a homosexual-couple, hit the theaters on Friday and received an average response in Ranchi despite Friday being a public holiday, said staff from various theaters in the city.

The LGBTQ movement has been fast spreading across the country, and some members of the community in Kolkata – the nearest metro city – had reasons to celebrate the movie release.

However, Ranchi is yet to witness the presence of any such group that rejoices the acceptability of homosexuality by the society, said Pawan Dhall, a Kolkata-based LGBTQ activist. “I don’t think there is any group that supports LGBTQ rights in Ranchi,” he said.

On Friday, the seat occupancy could not even exceed 50 per cent in many shows. Theater managers here were expecting a better response as Ayushman Khurrana’s films have always attracted viewers in Ranchi.

However, they said that the response is likely to improve on weekend. “The response has not been overwhelming on the first day despite it being a holiday. However, the response may improve on weekend,” said an executive from Spring City Mall.

A manager at Carnival Cinema, who refused to be named, said that movie watchers these days prefer watching the review of films and then book the tickets, so the rush is often more on the second or third day of the release.

The film, however, has received an average rating by most of the websites that have reviewed it so far. NDTV.com has given it a 2.5 out of 5 and FirstPost has given it a 3.5 out of 5 star rating. Ayushmann’s films like ‘Bala’ and ‘Dream Girl’ were blockbusters and gave theater owners in Ranchi more than one reason to smile.

The filmmakers have said that the film not only targets to entertain people but also to spread awareness about homosexuality.

It is aimed at increasing the acceptability of homosexuals in the society and address homophobia – a mindset that convinces a person to be either scared of or detest homosexuals.

“People in Jharkhand have still not come out of the closet. The decriminalisation of homosexual relationships has encouraged a few people to come out in the open and support the LGBTQ cause. However, the community here still faces lack of acceptance in the society and thus they do not find the courage to talk about their sexuality,” said Anubhuti Bannerjee, who runs Wings campaign for LGBTQ community in Tata Steel.

Considering homosexuality a psychological disorder, families of many homosexual teenagers are taking them to leading psychiatry institutes in Ranchi with the belief that counselling may change their sexual orientation, say doctors, highlighting the lack of awareness and taboo about gays and lesbians in this part of the country.

Every year, at least 15 such youths, in the age of 15 to20 years, are brought to the Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP) here by their guardians, says Dr. Nishant Goyal, an assistant professor at the institute.

This mindset could also be one of the reasons for guardians to stop their children from watching the latest movie, say activists.

On September 6, 2018, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Section 377 is unconstitutional as it infringed on the fundamental rights of autonomy, intimacy, and identity, thus legalising homosexuality in India. The court explicitly overturned its 2013 judgement, in which it had criminalised homosexual relationships.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ranchi---s-lgbtq-community-not-out-of-closet-yet.html

83,22-2-20,Cong to protest LPG price hike tomorrow,"Chhattisgarh Women Congress will hold state-level demonstration at Gandhi Maidan, Raipur on February 23 to protest the erroneous policy of central government which led to the rise in prices of LPG cylinders.

They demanded roll back of the recent price hike.

Women Congress state president Phulo Devi Netam will lead the demonstration.

Netam said during Dr Manmohan Singh government when prices of LPG cylinder was increased by 50 paise, the then BJP women leaders had demonstrated on the roads carrying fire woods but now they are keeping total mum.

She said not only the LPG, prices of other materials are on rise during the BJP-led Central government’s rule. The household budget of women is spiraling while the poor are facing more difficulty in day-to-day life.

Congress leader said the Ujjwala scheme was launched to provide free LPG cylinders to poor but now the poor women are unable to refill due to higher costs. They are now forced to return to their traditional cooking with fuel wood and other materials, she added.

Netam added that 2003 Atal Bihari Vajpayee government fell due to hike in onion price now Modi government will face same backlash from women over the price hike of all materials including LPG, petrol-diesel.

The Congress woman leader added that agitation will continue till the hike is rolled back.

84,22-2-20,BJP State president by end of Feb,"With the selection of BJP legislative party leader in Assembly, the process for appointment State president post too will be expedited. Sources said that the State president’s post will be given to any non-tribal leader, as the name of Babulal Marandi is final for BJP legislative party leader.

Marandi this week merged his 14-year old party Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) in presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and senior BJP leaders.

BJP national president, JP Nadda has appointed BJP national general secretary, P Muralidhar Rao as the central observer for the selection of the leader of the legislative party in Jharkhand.

For the state president post, prominent leaders are lobbying from Ranchi to Delhi. Sources said that as the post of Leader of Opposition (LoP) is to likely to be given to a tribal leader, the State president post will automatically go to any non-tribal so as to maintain social balance.

Sources said that many non tribal leaders are in fray for State president’s post. The senior BJP leaders who are in fray for state president post include, BJP state general secretary Deepak Prakash, two times MLA from Rajmahal Anant Ojha, former BJP state president Ravindra Rai and Chatra MP Sunil Singh among others.

Many of these leaders are lobbying from Ranchi to Delhi for the coveted post. A senior BJP leader requesting anonymity said, “Chatra MP Sunil Singh who is close with RSS is relying on his RSS lobby to get the post.

It was RSS lobby which had worked in favour of Sunil Singh that he was given ticket to contest from Chatra despite strong anti-incumbency against him.” Rajmahal MLA Anant Ojha is also being considered as strong contender of BJP State president post as a young leader and he is good orator too. Sources said that despite BJP’s poor performance in Santhal Pargan in Assembly election, Ojha was successful in winning the Rajmahal seat.

The other leaders who are in fray are BJP state general secretary Deepak Prakash. Prakash, who had worked in BJP organization for years is said to be close to BJP national president JP Nadda too.

The names of former State president Ravindra Rai is also doing round for state president post.

As Nadda has already dissolved the state working committee, with the selection of new state president the BJP organizational set up will be done.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-state-president---by-end-of-feb.html
85,22-2-20,One KGBV in each district to turn English medium,"The Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) has drafted a proposal to change the medium of education from Hindi to English in at least one Kasturba Gandhi Valika Vidyalaya (KGBV) in each of the 24 districts here – a move aimed at achieving excellence in education and making rural girls of the tribal State fluent in the most popular international language, officials from JEPC said on Friday.

State Project Director of JEPC, Umashankar Singh said that the JEPC has drafted the proposal and expects it to get tabled in the upcoming Budget session of the State Assembly. “We have drafted a proposal for the Budget session. Having an English medium KGBV in each district is only one part of the proposal that aims at incorporating changes in the KGBVs for betterment of students,” he said.

There are as many as 203 KGBVs – Government-run residential schools for girls who come from the marginalized and poor sections of the society – in Jharkhand. And the medium of education in all these schools has remained Hindi since they came into existence. Many students in these schools are rescued survivors of human trafficking, child marriage and child labour. One of the objectives behind starting these schools was to empower such girls.

However, changing the medium of education to English is a daunting task as a majority of students are not comfortable with the foreign language, say teachers. In order to tackle the teething problems in the initiative, the JEPC has decided to recruit teachers who have experience of teaching in English medium schools and plan an overhaul of the teaching staff in the KGBV that is chosen for the project. JEPC will also conduct an internal assessment of the 70,000 odd KGBV students in order to know who all are fit to study in English medium, Singh added.

“We will conduct internal assessments to know how comfortable students are with the use of the English language.

We will also conduct different exercises to know which all students have interest in learning more about the English language,” said Singh, adding that the process may take time after the proposal is passed in the Budget session.

The School Education and Literacy Department had taken steps to encourage the use of English language along with Hindi in the past as well. Under the former Raghubar Das-led NDA Government, the department had organised special trainings for Government school teachers.

The correct use of English language was a part of the training session.

KGBVs, however, are not like ordinary Government schools. Some incidents in the past have painted a negative picture of the KGBVs. Incidents of girls getting impregnated and falling ill after consuming meals prepared at the school have been reported from the interiors in the recent past. “We are striving for excellence. I am sure that the girls will accept the changes and volunteer to learn the English language,” said the JEPC Director.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/one-kgbv-in-each-district-to-turn-english-medium.html

In view of various arson incidents encountered the city in recent months, the buildings and market places mostly public-visiting places in Jamshedpur are still not equipped with necessary fire-safety systems, this posing threat to human lives in general.

Thousands of other buildings in the city have no fire safety systems where massive public movement is seen almost every day. The city has registered a sudden rise in fire accidents for last few months giving the jitters to the officials and occupants of the high rise buildings.

An official said that most high- rise residential and commercial buildings in the city are extremely vulnerable to fire hazards, mainly in the absence of fire protection and extinguishing systems. ADM has sought a report on the preparedness so that an action plan can be drafted to ensure better mechanism to deal with fire incidents.

Another senior official of the district said that most high- rise residential and commercial buildings in the city are extremely vulnerable to fire of fire protection and extinguishing systems. Jugsalai, Sakchi, Mango, Pursuih and Baghbera stills lack fire safety facilities.

He went on to add that with rise in temperatures, the number of fire incidents have also increased.

To prevent such incidents, occupiers of the high risers must take some safety measures.

The mandatory measures also include installation of automatic sprinkler system, portable appliances, automatic fire detection or manual alarm system, public address system, exit signs and wet riser.

Another district official said, “If required we will even cut the water and electricity connections of buildings that will violated the safety norms and the supply will not be reinstalled if they not put these measures in order"".

Fire services department has sounded a general alert asking people to take precautions but lack of proper safety arrangements still remain major concern.

The fire control is receiving nearly a dozen distress calls everyday as against the normal average of five to eight calls in rainy and winter seasons.

Regarding the fire safety arrangements of the multi-storied buildings, he lamented that no public agency had ever physically inspected the fire fighting facilities of the tall buildings of both residential and commercial status.

Fire safety issues have become one of the major issues of concern for the urban population here in recent years, especially following the major fire cases that occurred since the onset of summer.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/adm-seeks-report-on-fire-safety-preparedness-in-market-areas.html

93,22-2-20,Authorities collect used cooking oil for bio-diesel production,"On the directives of higher-ups District Food and Safety department is conducting a survey in hotels and restaurants in Bokaro Steel City to collect used cooking oil (UCO), which would be used in making bio-diesels.

“Under the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India’s (FSSAI) the project, ‘RUCO’ (Repurpose Used Cooking Oil) we have conducted the survey in over 25-30 big hotels and restaurants across the city. We are identifying such establishments from where we can collect UCO on a daily basis,” said Apoorva Minz, Food and Safety officer Bokaro.

“We have kept a target to collect 2500 litres of UCO from hotels and restaurants on a daily basis so that it can be utilized in making bio-diesels. The aim behind this initiative is to prevent repeated use of cooking oil and to convert it into bio-fuel,” said Minz.

“We have observed that UCO finds its way to small food vendors and households at cheap prices as well. It is hazardous not only for health, but also for the environment. UCO, when discarded without any treatment, clogs drainage systems as well,” said Minz.

Last year FSSAI has released a detailed guidance note on the handling and disposal of UCO by small and big food business operators and household-level users. According to this repeated use of cooking oil is banned as it can have serious repercussions on health, said Minz adding that those who do not obey the rules will have to pay a penalty of Rs. one lakh.

It has been notified the limit of total polar compounds (TPC) used in cooking at 25 per cent.

TPC is used to measure the quality of oil, and its level increases every time oil is re-heated. TPC beyond 25 per cent is considered unfit for human consumption, she said. FSSAI in association with the Biodiesel Association of India (BDAI) has recently launched ‘RUCO’ project, short for repurposing used cooking oil, said an official. RUCO is a project that plans to convert vegetable oils, animal fats or restaurant grease that has already been used in cooking into biodiesel for running diesel vehicles, or any other equipment that uses diesel.

RUCO enables the collection of inedible cooking oil by authorised agencies from institutional and individual users, which is then transferred to a plant to make bio-diesel.

This fuel is then proposed to be blended with vehicle fuel produced by oil marketing companies for distribution at the pump, said the official.

According to the official records, about 2,700 crore litres of cooking oil is used in our country, out which 140 crores UCO can be collected from the consumer such as hotels, restaurants and canteens for conversion, which will give around 110 crore litres of biodiesel every year. While about 850 crore litres of diesel is consumed every month in India at present.

The government aims to blend five per cent of biodiesel in diesel in the next ten years. Thus, 500 crore litres of biodiesel is required in a year, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/authorities-collect-used-cooking-oil-for-bio-diesel-production.html

The Delhi police also admitted that the protesters hadn’t blocked the parallel road but it is the police that barricaded the road to provide security to Shaheen Bagh protest site.

Senior police officers said they are left with little option as the safety and security of the protesters, comprising of women and children is of paramount importance. Hence the radial and arterial roads leading to the protest site have been closed.

Advocates Sanjay Hegde and Sadhana Ramachandran, the apex court-appointed interlocutors, met the protesting women in a tent in the south Delhi neighbourhood to hold talks for the third consecutive day. The protesters jointly told the interlocutors that the Delhi Police has barricaded parallel road to the tent as well two other roads that connect Shaheen Bagh-Kalindi Kunj road and it is not they who have blocked the roads but police.

The interlocutors also asked Delhi Police officers to come at the protest site to discuss the issue with protesters. A Delhi Police official told interlocutors and protesters that the parallel road was kept shut to ensure protection to the venue. The police official added that certain other roads adjoining this area were barricaded to ensure protection to the site.

“We barricaded the parallel road to protest site (the tent) to ensure security to the protest site. If the road is open-end for commuters, we will ensure double security to protesters,” said a police official.

A woman protester stood up and told mediators, “The Government thinks the women are uneducated. We all are educated women who know what we are fighting for. The students from Jamia Millia Islamia who were teaching us more on CAA and NRC are being beaten up. If the police couldn’t stop men who fired at us how are they claiming they will protect us if parallel road will be open.

The protesters demanded that if the adjoining road to protest site (the tent) is open, the Delhi Police must ensure security of the protestors.

“We want in writing that if there is single incident of attack or firing, the police officials from SHO to Police Commissioner should be shunted out. The HM Amit Shah said NRC is not coming soon so ask him to pass circular from MHA that they are not bringing in NRC now. We want Supreme Court to pass a order on our security if the adjoining road to protest site is opened back,” said a woman protestor.

Hegde said, “The issue is not about only about opening of this road, open the roads of your heart. We all are humans and as humans if you can lessen another human’s pain, you will be a greater human.”

The interlocutors checked all roads that join Delhi to Noida late in Thursday along with some protestors and Delhi Police officials. “When we checked the roads, we noticed that you (protesters) were right. Many roads are open which were blocked by the Delhi Police. I am very upset saying this that the Noida-Faridabad road which was opened today was again closed by police. Whoever has done this is now answerable to Supreme Court,” said Ramchandran.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/police-blocked-parallel-road--shaheen-bagh-protesters.html
99,22-2-20,Noida-Kalindi Kunj route opened for just 40 minutes,"The road between Noida to Delhi’s Kalindi Kunj road witnessed vehicular movement for 40 minutes after Noida Police reopened the route on Friday. However, the joy of the motorists was short lived as the road was closed again.

The protestors are sitting on Road number-13 in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, which is on the route connecting Noida with Delhi via Kalindi Kunj, for over two months to mark their protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Due to the ongoing protest, the Delhi and Noida police had closed the entire stretch which has been resulting in massive traffic snarls in other areas connecting Noida with Delhi. Nearby locality residents have been complaining about hardships that they are facing owing to the unending blockade. They all are forced to opt for alternative routes to reach to their destinations and it has added to their travel time.

According to a police official, the barricades installed at Noida Mahamaya Flyover were removed for sometime on Friday morning. “The road was opened only to clear the passage of a bus. The barricades were restored minutes after the road was reopened,” said the police official.

The stretch of Shaheen Bagh to Kalindi Kunj road which is about two to three kilometres has commercial centers housing shops and restaurants. The road ends at Atlanta Water Park. The Shaheen Bagh-Kalindi Kunj road is parallel to the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway which is used by a large number of commuters between Delhi and Noida.

“All the roads that are close to Shaheen Bagh-Kalindi Kunj road like Kalindi Kunj bridge, Amrapali Road, Okhla Barrage Road, Okhla Bird Sanctuary Road, Dadri main road and Noida-Greater Noida Expressway were open but the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch is closed,” said the protestors.

“It is the police that has barricaded and blocked the road. We don’t have any issue if there is traffic movement as protest is our right and we are protesting peacefully. We don’t have any intension to disrupt other people life. Police should be blamed for closing the entire stretch not us,” said the protestors adding that we are ready to even manage traffic if this route is opened for vehicular movement.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/noida-kalindi-kunj-route-opened-for-just-40-minutes.html

104,22-2-20,Fusion song on Ranchi goes viral on social media,"Is hawa ki hai khushboo aise, jangalon mein ho phoolon jaisi’ are the lyrics of ‘The Ranchi Song’, which has become a musical anthem for Ranchiites across the globe. With catchy lyrics and foot thumping beats, the song is a fusion of Hindi, Nagpuri and Rap and emphasizes on the fact that the City has much more to offer than just MS Dhoni.

The song has been trending on all social media platforms and music channels including Apple Music, Jio Sawn, Wynk Music, Google Music. It has been viewed as many as 35 thousand times on Facebook and about 20 thousand times on YouTube with numerous shares on Facebook and Whatsapp. It’s the first song from the region to be released by T- series.

“Being the first song from and about Ranchi, the responses received have been great and very over whelming. Those who have heard it have loved it and said that it has a real feel of the place. Local references like ‘dil mein palash jaisi aag’, ‘rangrej’, have added to the flavor of the song,” said the 32- year old composer Abhishek Sagar.

Shot in and around Ranchi, the song which was released on January 26 highlights not just the scenic beauty of the place but also shows the deep bonds people from varied cultures and backgrounds form and share here.

“The idea for the song struck me while I was doing a survey for Jharkhand Tourism. It was odd how people only related to the city because of Dhone. It was then that I decided to write this song which would act both as an introduction of the place for many and also serve as a memoir for those living away from their hometown,” said the singer.

Sagar has also penned the lyrics for the song and sung it with Piush D Rapstar and Munna Dhamal. The music has been added by Sanjay Sonwar and Hemant Runda while the video has been made by Sunniy Khan. The song features popular places from the city and its surroundings like Dassam Fall, Hundru Fall, Rock Garden and Nucleus Mall among others.

“I started writing this song about a year ago and it took about six months to produce the audio and video. It has mainly been written in Hindi but there is a Nagpuri part as well. I wanted to create a fusion of three genres- pop, rap and folk to grab the audience’s attention,” added the lyricist.

Sagar has also written other songs as well related to the people of the state. “Jharkhand has a beautiful culture which is still hidden from the mainstream and it’s a great opportunity to highlight this.

I aim to produce more songs that will promote good music and artists from here,” he remarked.

Born in Patna, the singer came to Ranchi at the age of eight years with his family and completed his schooling from JVM Shyamali.

He has done his B.Tech in Information Tecchnolgy from KIIT Bhubaneswar and pursued masters of technology from Middlesex University London.

“Growing up in Ranchi was beautiful. Coming from a busy town like Patna, I instantly fell in love with nature here. This is what led m to start writing songs. My parents and my wife have been my greatest motivators and sources of strength.

They are super excited to see me achieving my childhood dreams and are very optimistic for the future,” he said.

Presently, Sagar is based in Tajikistan and is pursuing music production and also working as a design consultant for a MNC. His wife Manita K is in Indian Foreign Services. His father Anant Sagar retired as a Chief Engineer from JSEB while his mother Krishna Sagar is a homemaker and they are residents of Hinoo, Ranchi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/fusion-song-on-ranchi-goes-viral-on-social-media.html

109,22-2-20,"Convince men for sterilisation or lose job, MP tells health workers","Within hours after reports of Madhya Pradesh Health department issuing orders for forceful sterilisation for males, the State Government swung into action and removed National Health Mission director Chhavi Bhardwaj and the controversial order was also withdrawn.

Taking cognizance of low male sterilisation figures in Madhya Pradesh, the NHM had ordered health workers to either get at least one male for sterilisation or face action like stalled salary or voluntary retirement.

Soon after the report of forceful ‘nasbandi’ campaign of the emergency era under late PM Indira Gandhi’s son Sanjay Gandhi, went viral on social media, the government withdrew the order.

Former Chief Minister Shjivraj Singh Chouhan was quick to react on twitter saying was it part 2 of emergency? If Male Multipurpose Health Workers are lacking, the state government should act but withdrawing salaries and forceful retirement is autocratic.

Leader of Opposition Gopal Bhargav and some others too reacted sharply to this order.

Public Relations Minister PC Sharma was the first to react on the issue accepting that there was something wrong claiming the Health minister Tulsi Silawat would look into the matter.

The order might be a human error and no employee would be forced into any sterilisation target, Sharma claimed.

However, as the controversy snowballed into major controversy, Health minister Tulsi Silawat was quick to issue order withdrawing the controversial order from the NHM director. Initially the minister had termed this order a directive from the Centre (NHM) and had promised to review it.

Chhavi Bhardwaj, known as one of the honest officers of State bureaucracy, was removed and has been posted at Mantralaya as an Officer on Special Duty. At present, Bharadwaj is in Mussoorie for training. Congress media cell coordinator Narendra Saluja said that male sterlisation is a voluntary practice and as no target has been fixed, there was no issue of any action on anyone.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/convince-men-for-sterilisation-or-lose-job--mp-tells-health-workers.html
110,22-2-20,Prepare unified plan for Dwarka sub-city: L-G Baijal to DDA,"In a bid to develop an eco system for Dwarka Sub-City, including proper parking facility, women and children safety, commercial and social activities, the Delhi Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal on Friday directed the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to merge all the projects by preparing a strategic plan to develop the eco system for Dwarka.

The strategic plan will focus on a range of issues related to regional connectivity of Dwarka, woman and children safety and security, lack of commercial activities, lack of work centres, parking issues and similarly lack of public activities/social infrastructure.

“Our main goal is to deliver a pleasing urban experience included high quality and safe (especially for women) and to deliver High Return on Investment. Currently, y the Dwarka Sub-city is not seen as an investment destination, projects are being fragmented and women safety is a big concern in this area and entry and exit points of Dwarka are congested, that needs to be addressed,” said the official.

Officials also added that transportation is also a major problem in Dwarka as currently it takes nearly two hours per person to reach work centers by metro and frequency of airport express line is also less.

“Dwarka has a well-developed primary network of 60m, 45m and 30m roads, but has a weak secondary and terrtory network which is important for shorter commutes through walk or cycle. Thus, we have decided to connect rail connectivity by running high-quality electric multiple unit (EMU) on existing Railway Line which will connect Dwarka to Bijwasan and to Old Delhi and Ghaziabad,” said the official.

The official also recommended solutions in the strategic plan such as new metro link required to minimize interchange from Sector 21- Palam - Delhi Cantt - Sarai Rohilla RS, increasing frequency of Airport Line and decreasing fare could also be considered as an option and to reduce the traffic load on roads the options of BRTs or Light Rail could be explored. Further, to improve the Bus connectivity frequency of 2-5min during Peak hours and more direct routes to Job Centres are being planned,” they said.

Also, to tackle the issue of Dwarka considered as non-desired destination for investors, it was suggested to develop all Metro stations in Dwarka Sub-City along the Blue Line as a Metro boulevard.

During the meeting, LG also asked DDA, to provide solutions to reduce the use of private vehicle by making the areas within 500m of metro stations approachable to pedestrians with easy 6 minute walk, designing of an “Integrated Scheme” to create a direct access to metro through pedestrian friendly passages and walkway.

Moreover, DDA has also been asked to implement complete streets project inclusive of cycle tracks on 70km of Roads with making a green corridor.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/prepare-unified-plan-for-dwarka-sub-city--l-g-baijal-to-dda.html

116,22-2-20,HC seeks Govt response on Swamy’s PIL,"The Uttarakhand high court has sought the government’s response within three weeks in the public interest litigation filed by Rajya Sabha MP and senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy challenging the Char Dham Devsthanam Management Board Act brought in by the state government. The division bench of chief justice Ramesh Ranganathan and justice RC Khulbe also asked the state government to also respond on whether the PIL is sustainable or not.

It is pertinent to mention here that in his PIL, Swamy has contended that the Devsthanam Act is unconstitutional. The government taking over management of the Char Dham and 52 other shrines under the Act is a violation of articles 25 and 26 of the constitution, the petition states. Swamy said that in the past, similar decisions had been taken in the states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Maharashtra. He had filed petitions against these decisions in the Supreme Court and won the cases. He further said that there are various decisions on the Supreme Court in such matters. Swamy has also opined that the decision of the Uttarakhand state government is against the policies of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Swamy has also requested in his petition that the government not take any further action until the matter is in the court. However, the state government appointed the chief executive officer of the Char Dham Devsthanam management board shortly after the petition was filed, which raises questions at the government’s intentions, opined the senior BJP leader.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hc-seeks-govt-response-on-swamy---s-pil-hc-seeks-govt-response-on-swamy---s-pil.html
117,22-2-20,NEP in works again: Rollout delay likely,"The ambitious National Education Policy (NEP) has gone into the works yet again to specifically address some key contentious issues, and this could result in a further delay in its implementation despite the Government’s plans to table a Bill in this regard in the current Budget Session of Parliament.

In a review meeting a couple of days ago, sources said, the Prime Minister's Office asked the HRD Ministry to rework on certain issues in the draft NEP before being finalised and brought in the Union Cabinet for its approval.

Sources said that the PMO went through every detail in the NEP and while seeking clarifications also directed to make the necessary changes both in the higher education and secondary education segments.

""The HRD Ministry will now have to amend the NEP policy document on a war footing to seek Cabinet approval as the PMO has desired that the NEP be brought in during the current Budget Session of Parliament,"" sources said.

In the wake of controversy over language in State education system, the PMO suggested that NEP should not impose any language on the States but at the same time ensure that the existing three-language formula is continued.

While the NEP draft has talked about bringing the pre-primary education from age three onwards within the purview of the HRD Ministry, the PMO said that the existing system of early childhood education be continued with Women & Child Development (WCD) Ministry.

It said this should be reworked with age group 3-5 years being under the WCD Ministry and five years onwards under the HRD Ministry. The PMO is also learnt to have asked the HRD Ministry to omit the clause of State regulatory bodies for schools as objections have been reported to the PMO by the States.

The PMO also raised doubts as to why there are four channels in higher education regulations which seem to be complicated and there has to be one overarching body of the higher education regulator.

On the issue of restructuring of higher education regulatory system, NEP advocates for a National Higher Education Regulatory Authority (NHERA) as regulator and recommends three independent bodies working simultaneously - General Education Council (GEC) for academic standards, the National Assessment & Accreditation Council (NAAC) for accreditation functions and the third one Higher Education Grants Council (HEGC) for funding.

A new NEP has been the ruling BJP's agenda in every manifesto and soon after coming to power in May 2104, the Modi government promised to transform educational system with a new NEP. The last NEP was revised in 1986.

Two former HRD Ministers - Smriti Irani and Prakash Javadekar -formed their own committees to draft the NEP. While Irani tasked T.S.R. Subramanian Committee to suggest recommendations for the policy, Javadekar rejected the Subramanian panel's report and disbanded the committee and formed another chaired by former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chief K. Kasturirangan. The committee began work on the policy in July 2017.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nep-in-works-again--rollout-delay-likely.html

The event comprises musical performances by renowned musical bands, comedy shows, magic shows, puppet shows, sound and light show.

Baijal while appreciating the efforts of SDMC said that the South civic body has developed splendid parks like ‘Waste to Wonder’ park, Nandan Van and Woodland Amusement Park.

He said on the lines of Waste to Wonder Park, SDMC has started the process of developing another magnificent Bharat Darshan Park in Punjabi Bagh.

Baijal said that Waste to Wonder Park is a shiny example of Waste to Wealth concept. “SDMC should develop such more parks which are self-sustained and based on Waste to Wealth concept. It has limited parking space and for construction of parking site, DDA land will be provided to the SDMC,” he said.

SDMC Commissioner Gyanesh Bharti said that it is a matter of great appreciation for SDMC to organise this grand festival on its anniversary and announce that the civic body has recovered the entire cost of this park by generating the revenue of more than eight Crore.

Bharti said that approx 16 lakhs people have visited this wonderful park with an average daily footfall of 4,000 to 5,000 and it increases up to 10,000 on weekends and public holidays.

120,22-2-20,RSS chief stresses on need to increase membership,"In an effort to expand its social base in the State, particularly in rural areas, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has drawn up a blueprint to strengthen its organisational structure. The RSS Sarsanghchalak (Chief) Mohan Bhagwat who is on a five-day visit to State is likely to draw the blueprint for strengthening the organisation.

The RSS chief in this connection on Friday had series of meeting with people from different walks of society. Bhagwat on Friday had meeting with eminent personalities from different sectors at Indian Institute of Management (IIM) campus. The eminent personalities who meet Bhagwat included teachers, doctors, advocates, artists from different sectors among others.

A university teacher who too attended the meeting with RSS chief requesting anonymity said, “The RSS chief talked about various social cultural issues in the country urging people from different sectors to come up. Such types of meeting are helpful as it makes people to become more responsible towards the society.” However, RSS Pranth Sah Karyavahak Rakesh Lal said, “The meeting with RSS chief was not with any agenda. It was just get-together with one another.”

The RSS chief after having meeting with intellectuals also had a discussion with sportspersons at Jharkhand State Cricket Academy (JSCA) premises.

“Such sportsperson who are ideologically associated with RSS were invited for the meeting. The RSS chief met with each other and also discussed political and social issue plaguing in Country.”

Meanwhile, the RSS chief also asked the RSS members to increase the number of RSS Shakas in State with the focus in slum area. Sources said in State there are around 780 shakhas while in Ranchi there are around 90 shakhas.

Sources said that the RSS is the ideologue of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party or BJP. Given this close relationship and influence, the expansion of the RSS presence in the country will meld well with the BJP’s plans to expand its electoral footprint.

The RSS chief on Thursday attending Sangh Samagam said that people should avoid using the word ‘nationalism’ as it has connotations of ‘Hitler, Nazism and Fascism’. Bhagwat suggested the use of ‘national’ or ‘nation’ and ‘nationality’, instead of ‘nationalism’.

He also said that though India has diverse religious values but they stay connected to the country through a single word ‘Hindu’. The word ‘Hindu’ does not represent a particular community rather it is the recognition of a country on the world map.

The RSS chief is in Ranchi on a 5-day visit to Jharkhand and has programmes on religion, communal/social harmony, family values and environment plus water conservation for Bihar and Jharkhand RSS cadre.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rss-chief-stresses-on-need-to-increase-membership.html
121,22-2-20,Govt to encourage forest-based industries: CM,"Chief Minister Hemant Soren today said that the Government will work at a full pace after Budget Session of Assembly in the direction of providing employment and other benefits to people through forest conservation and value addition of forest produce. The CM while addressing people in a two-day workshop on effective implementation of Forest Rights Act 2006 at Dr Ramdayal Munda Tribal Research Institute said that there was a close connect between Jharkhand resident and forests.

“It is the priority of our government to connect people from all sections, including tribals from remote rural and forest covered areas with forest-based industry,” he added.

Soren said that a large part of Jharkhand is covered with forests. “A large number of people here are connected to water, forest and land. There has been a discussion on how to make a source of income by adding value to the produce in the forests for centuries.

But, I believe that this discussion is happening very late. Our eyes open when problems arise.

There should have already been work on forest protection and forest produce.

Today many institutions-NGOs are discussing forest activities not only in our country but also abroad. Presently, global warming is emerging as a major problem and challenge for the whole world. Natural system is an important link for humans,” he said.

The CM said that now people in large cities of the country are being deprived of clean environment.

“This is the reason that whenever people get little time, people turn to natural beauty with the whole family. People also spend millions on natural beauty. There are many states in our country, which have only natural beauty and those states today are among the leading states of the country,” he said.

Giving the example of states like Goa, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand etc, the Chief Minister said that these states have only natural beauty but our State Jharkhand has natural beauty as well as mineral wealth. For years, people have been meeting their ends through the resources here.

Soren said that sometimes there has been loss of forests due to change of law. There was also a time when police action was taken against people for selling bamboo shoots, mahua, amla, etc as a forest product, but the amendment of such laws facilitated things. He said that the connection between nature and man needs to be understood in the present scenario. The line of development cannot be drawn by keeping the natural eye on. One can only move ahead if the gap between the natural system and development is bridged.

The CM, while referring to the Odisha Government’s decision, said that the Government of Odisha has taken a positive decision and issued orders that the plates made of leaves will now be used in the food and snacks served in any programme of the Government. He said that this is a very good initiative. Such decisions will have a positive impact on business, employment and the environment.

Soren extended his best wishes and congratulations to Dr. Ramdayal Munda Tribal Welfare Research Institute for organizing such a workshop. He said that this institution will play an important role in the development of the State in the coming times. Soren expressed confidence that whatever will emerge in this two-day workshop will be helpful in the development of the state.

Welfare Secretary Himani Pandey, Director DRMTRI Ranendra Kumar, ISB, Hyderabad Professor Ashwin Chhetri, representatives of Forest, Welfare department along with researchers from various states were present on the occasion.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-to-encourage-forest-based-industries--cm.html
122,22-2-20,Give our share in Central taxes: AAP,"Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Friday met Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and demanded Delhi’s share in Central taxes, which he said would help speed up cleaning the Yamuna and make arrangements for sufficient electricity and water supply in the city.

Taking to Twitter, Sisodia, who also holds the finance portfolio in the AAP Government, said Delhi has not been given any share in Central taxes since 2001.

In the meeting, he also demanded funds for all the three municipal corporations in Delhi, the same way as Centre gives money to civic bodies in other States.

According to a Government statement, Sisodia in a letter to Sitharaman urged her to consider providing Delhi a share in Central taxes.

Sisodia also referred to the erstwhile Article 270 (3) which discussed the share of taxes between the Centre and the Union Territories.

While the Delhi Government has to maintain infrastructure that meets world standards, it also has to improve supply of civic amenities to the burgeoning population who legitimately expect employment and a fulsome life in the city, Sisodia said in the letter.

Consequently, large investments in education, health, social, food securities, transport, roads and hospitals among others have to be made, the Deputy Chief Minister said. “But for the inadvertent omission of erstwhile Article 270 (3) of the Constitution of India, the Government of NCT of Delhi would be getting its legitimate share in central taxes of at least Rs 7,000 crore per annum with an appropriate annual enhancement like other states to finance the development needs,” Sisodia said. He also urged Sitharaman to provide additional Terms of Reference to the Fifteenth Finance Commission to enable it to recommend legitimate share of NCT of Delhi in central taxes.

“The NCT of Delhi has the character of a state, and therefore is eligible to be treated at par with other states for receiving a share of Central taxes,” Sisodia said. In the letter, he also said that the Fifteenth Finance Commission in its report for the financial year 2020-21 has provided one per cent of the divisible pool for the newly formed union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, and assign the same to the central government.

“As you are aware, the union territory of Jammu & Kashmir & the NCT of Delhi are on a similar footing within our Constitution as union territories with legislature.

Accordingly, additional terms of reference to the finance commission at the stage would bring justice to the people of the NCT of Delhi and rectify the anomaly created by the inadvertent omission of Article 270(3),” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/give-our-share-in-central-taxes--aap.html
123,22-2-20,Real-time pollution assessment soon: Rai,"Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Friday visited an air quality monitoring station established in association with Washington University for undertaking real-time source apportionment study.

Addressing the media during his visit to the model station at Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium, Rai said if it is a success, it can be replicated across the national Capital.

The Minister said the Government has joined hands with Washington University to have source apportionment study to obtain data on real-time concentrations of different sources of pollution.

The study will also highlight the contribution of various gases, waste generation and local burning which are the primary factors in air pollution.

“We will launch a targeted campaign based on the findings of the reports, which will help us in identifying the real sources of pollution and to work on reducing the existing pollution levels in the city. Once we are able to identify the real sources, we will be able to take immediate action and balance our efforts in reducing the pollution generated daily by two crore people of Delhi,” he said.

The aim of the Government is to create awareness in the people, by transcending the environmental situation in Delhi into a mass movement, he added. Jain further said several studies have been shared on the Air Quality Index of Delhi and the contribution of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 levels to the air pollution in the city. Primarily, three studies have relevantly come into the picture, including a 2010 study from Nagpur, a 2016 study by IIT-Kanpur, and a 2018 study by TERI, he said, adding that the different apportionment studies undertaken by different agencies are based on a particular point of time.

The first source apportionment study was undertaken for Delhi in the year 2010 by ‘National Institute of Environmental Engineering’, Nagpur. That study was based on PM 10. IIT Kanpur undertook a source apportionment study for Delhi Government in the year 2016, which was widely quoted, but it was unable to propose real-time concentrations. The study by TERI in the year 2018 gave the source apportionment study based on PM 10 and PM 2.5; however, seasonal source apportionment was used for the study.

“We have 26 pollution monitoring centers of the Delhi government across various locations in Delhi. The mechanism in these centers monitors AQI at a particular point of time in a span of one hour. But the mechanism has failed to detect the sources of this pollution,” he said.

The Delhi government has associated with Washington University to have a real-time source apportionment study to obtain data on real-time concentrations from different sources of pollution. The study also highlighted the contribution of various gases, waste generation and local burning which are the primary factors in air pollution.

“The interim report will be submitted by the University by March 2020 and the model will be functional by the month of June 2020. Further action plans will be devised on the basis of the study report obtained in March,” Rai said.

Rai had on Thursday chaired a meeting with scientists, environmentalists and officials of various other departments and instructed them to prepare a comprehensive action plan to mitigate the impact of pollution.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/real-time-pollution-assessment-soon--rai.html

125,22-2-20,Pak remains in FATF grey list,"The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Paris-based international global terror financing watchdog, on Friday decided continuation of Pakistan in the 'Grey List' and warned it of stern action if it fails to check flow of money to terror groups like the Lashkar-e-Tayyeba(LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM).

The decision taken in the FATF plenary session also warned Islamabad that if it does not complete a full action plan by June this year, it could lead to consequences on its business, sources said here.

Already facing a grim economic and financial scenario, Pakistan will not be able to access loans from the International Monetary Fund(IMF) and the World Bank, Asian Development Bank(ADB) and the European Union if the FATF takes any tough action after the June deadline is not complied with.

The plenary noted that Pakistan addressed only a few of the 27 tasks given to it in controlling funding to terror groups like the LeT, JeM and the Hizbul Mujahideen, which are responsible for a series of attacks in India. The FATF said Pakistan has to swiftly complete its full action plan by June, the source said.

If Pakistan fails to abide by the FATF directive, there is every possibility that the global body may put the country in the 'Black List' along with North Korea and Iran.

India has all along stressed the point that Pakistan extends regular support to terror groups like the LeT, the JeM and the Hizbul Mujahideen, whose prime target is India, and has urged the FATF to take action against Islamabad.

Pakistan is believed to have received strong backing from Malaysia but failed to impress western nations due to India's consistent efforts by providing materials and evidence on Pakistan's inaction to check funding to terror groups operating from its soil.

Pakistan needed 12 votes out of 39 to exit the 'Grey List' and move to the 'White List'. To avoid the ""Black List"", it needs the support of three countries.

The 'Grey Listing' came three days after a sub-group of the FATF recommended continuation of the country in it. The FATF meeting, from February 16 to 21, was held a week after an anti-terrorism court in Pakistan sentenced Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai attack and founder of the LeT, to 11 years in two terror financing cases.

The Pakistani court's judgment came ostensibly to please the FATF and western countries so that the country can exit the 'Grey List'.

Saeed, 70, a UN designated terrorist on whom the US has placed a USD 10 million bounty, was arrested on July 17, 2019, in the terror financing cases. He is lodged at the high-security Kot Lakhpat jail in Pakistan.

Pakistan has also recently informed the FATF that JeM founder Masood Azhar and his family are ""missing."" It has claimed that there were only 16 UN designated terrorists in Pakistan, of which ""seven are dead.""

Out of the nine who are alive, seven had applied to the UN for exemption from financial and travel restrictions. In the last month's FATF meeting in Beijing, Pakistan got support of Malaysia and Turkey besides FATF current chair China.

In the Beijing meeting, Pakistan provided a list of its action taken to comply with FATF directions.

Pakistan was placed on the 'Grey List' by the FATF in June 2018 and was given a plan of action to complete by October 2019 or face the risk of being placed on the 'Black List.'

The FATF is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 to combat money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system.

It currently has 39 members, including two regional organisations the European Commission and the Gulf Cooperation Council. India is a member of the FATF consultations and its Asia Pacific Group.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pak-remains-in-fatf-grey-list.html
126,22-2-20,3D fabricated model exhibition on famous monuments on till Feb 23,"Five world-renowned Indian archeological wonders - Taj Mahal in Agra, Kashi Vishwanath temple, Konark Sun Temple in Odisha, Rani Ki Vav (stepwell) in Gujarat and the ruins of Hampi in Karnataka have virtually come alive here at an exhibition at the National Museum here.

Trained in state-of-the-art technologies, Vizara Technologies, a startup under the incubation of IIT Delhi in collaboration with the Department of Science and Technology has created accurate 3-dimensional models of these five most important archaeological sites in India, allowing for detailed study by archaeologists and future preservation.

A visual treat particularly to the tech-savvy visitors at the museum, the exhibition which is on till February 23, 2020 showcases 3D fabricated models of the famous monuments with interactive virtual walk-throughs and projection mapping, and a room-scale 3D model of a Hampi Temple, with augmented reality (AR), virtual Reality (VR) and holographic interactions.

Dr Anupma Malik, CEO of Vizara Technologies explained that these installations combine multiple technologies, which can be used by a visitor to interact with the physical models and experience personalised, realistic virtual walkthroughs of each of these heritage sites, and get information about their various facets.

Under the project, damaged historical monument and extinct art forms like dance are being conserved for the future generation.

The process includes laser scanning and mapping of the monument and preparation of digital format of the monuments on the basis of the available historical facts information. For instance, 3D model of Rani Ki Vav, an engineering marvel, showcases entire stepwell, intricately carved walls, detailing the terraces that lead to the well.

Union Minister of Science and Technology Dr Harsh Vardhan who had visited the exhibition on digital conservations termed it a rare public showcase of digital preservation work undertaken in India.

""The exhibition serves as a bridge between the past and future and will make aware the next generations about the rich cultural values and architectural techniques; this will help the new generation to learn the move forward in conserving monuments,"" he added.

The research conducted as part of the Indian Digital Heritage (IDH), initiative of DST, aims to develop indigenous technologies to digitally preserve Indian heritage, by focusing on the UNESCO world heritage site of Hampi, Karnataka as an illustrative example.

Teams from various cultural and scientific institutes such as IIT Delhi, IIT Bombay, CSIR-CBRI Roorkee, National Institute of Design, Bengaluru worked together to identify research problems such as how to restore fading murals that could reveal more about social life in the past.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/3d-fabricated-model-exhibition-on---famous-monuments-on-till-feb-23.html

128,22-2-20,Rajnath lays foundation of ‘Thal Sena Bhawan’,"Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday performed the stone-laying ceremony, 'Bhoomi Pujan', for the proposed 'Thal Sena Bhawan' of the Army in Delhi Cantonment which will bring together various pockets of the Army headquarters spread across Delhi under one roof. At present, nearly eight offices of the Army are spread all over the national capital.

Observing that there is movement of about 3,000-4,000 vehicles every day from the various Army establishments in the city, Singh said this would be not required once the 'Thal Sena Bhawan' comes and would significantly reduce fuel consumption, expenses and pollution. ""The new sena building will ensure they can work under one roof,"" he stated. The new Thal Sena Bhawan will be spread over 39 acres and the building will be completed in five years.

Singh also said the newly created Department of Military Affairs (DMA) headed by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) will also work from here. ""This will help in jointness,"" he added.

The seven-storeyed complex is designed ""like a rising sun."" Singh said ""we have laid the first stone of the new Sena Bhawan. This (stone) will not reach the top, but it is the first stone.

And, it will represent the unsung heroes of the armed forces who have sacrificed their lives for the country.""

The proposed Thal Sena Bhawan will bring all Army HQ offices under one roof thereby improving the working efficiency, while reducing the carbon footprint and logistics requirements, Army Chief Gen Manoj Naravane said adding it will also allow more family time for all personnel tenating peace posting at Delhi.

The 'Thal sena bhawan' spread opposite Manekshaw centre in Delhi Cantonment will bring together Army headquarters split in eight pockets across Delhi. Presently, Army Headquarters is split into eight pockets across South Block, Sena Bhawan, Hutments Area, RK Puram, Shankar Vihar and other places, the Army said. The work was sanctioned to make up the existing deficiency of 44% and also to accommodate the Army Headquarters in one place.

It is conceptualized as a multistory green building adopting Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) norms and will house offices, residential area for security personnel and basic amenities.

Approximately 7.5 Lakh square meter of area will be constructed to house the office complex and parking. A total of 6,014 offices will be constructed which will house offices for 1,684 officers both military and civilian and 4,330 sub staff, the Army said. The proposed work will generate minimum 2 Lakh hours of skilled and unskilled work. There will be parking for 4,000 cars, sources said.

The Army Chief will continue to sit in South Block in close proximity to the Defence Minister and the present Army HQ 'Sena Bhawan' will continue to exist though some functions would be shifted to the new complex. The cost of the new project is about Rs 700 crores.

The present Army Headquarters is situated near South Block on the Raisina Hill.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/rajnath-lays-foundation-of----thal-sena-bhawan---.html
129,22-2-20,"Waqf Board accepts alternative site, will decide on Monday how to use it","The UP Sunni Central Waqf Board on Friday said it does not have the option to reject the alternative piece of land given to it under the Supreme Court’s Ayodhya verdict but will decide how to use it when it meets on Monday.

In a historic verdict in November on the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of construction of a temple. It also ruled that an alternative five-acre plot must be found for a mosque. Soon after the verdict, there were suggestions that the board should not accept the land.

“Following the Supreme Court verdict, the Sunni Waqf Board does not have the choice of rejecting the five-acre alternative land for the construction of a mosque in Ayodhya as it would amount to contempt of court,” Farooqui said.

“We had been saying since the very beginning that we will abide by the court verdict on the issue, and because of this we did not go in for a review of the verdict. There has been no shift in our stand,” he said.

“But on how to use the land given to us by the government, it will be decided at the all important- meeting of the board slated on Monday,” he said.

Farooqui said the apex court order clearly stated that the Uttar Pradesh government will allot a plot to the board and “we had the liberty to build a mosque and associated amenities on it”. “It did not say that the board had the liberty of rejecting it,” he added. Besides Farooqui, there are seven other members on the Sunni Waqf Board.

Earlier this month, the Uttar Pradesh government gave the allotment letter to the board for the plot in Dhannipur village in Ayodhya’s Sohawal tehsil.

It is on the Ayodhya-Lucknow highway, about 20 km from the district headquarters. Based on the SC verdict, the Centre had asked the Uttar Pradesh Government to allot five acres of land to the Sunni Waqf Board.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/waqf-board-accepts-alternative-site--will-decide-on-monday-how-to-use-it.html
130,22-2-20,Koregaon-Bhima judicial panel urged to summon Pawar,"The Koregaon-Bhima judicial inquiry Commission has received an application seeking summoning of NCP president Sharad Pawar in view of certain statements made by him in the media about the 2018 caste violence near here.

Sagar Shinde, a member of the Vivek Vichar Manch, a social group, on Thursday filed the application before the panel through his advocate Pradip Gawade, seeking that Pawar be asked to depose before the two-member commission.

In his plea, Shinde cited a press conference of Pawar held on February 18. As per the application, at the press meet Pawar alleged that right-wing activists Milind Ekbote and Sambhaji Bhide had created a “different” atmosphere in Koregaon-Bhima, located on outskirts of Pune city, and its vicinity.

“In the same press conference, Mr Pawar also alleges that the role of Pune city police commissioner is doubtful and must be investigated.These statements are within the purview of the terms of reference of this commission and therefore they are relevant,” Shinde said the plea.

The applicant said he has reasons to believe Pawar has relevant and additional information, apart from what he has already shared in his earlier affidavit filed before the panel regarding the violence and other related matters.

“Therefore, in the interest of justice, this applicant makes a prayer to the commission to issue a summon to Mr Pawar and require him to depose in person and furnish additional information he has so that the commission can arrive at its findings in a just and fair manner,” he said.

Pawar had, on October 8, 2018, filed an affidavit before the commission, headed by former Bombay High Court Chief Justice J N Patel. Former Maharashtra chief secretary Sumit Mullick is the other member of the judicial panel.

The former Union minister, in his affidavit, had stated, “I would not be in a position to factually point out the chronology of the said events as that would be the domain of the existing Law andOrder machinery.”

He had also stated, “I would not be in a position to specifically make allegations against any particular organisation.

“However, it is unfortunate that the state government and law and enforcement authorities failed to protect the interest of the common man residing at Koregaon Bhima and its vicinity.” Pawar’s party is now a key constituent in the Shiv Sena-led government in the state. The commission was set up when the BJP was in power in Maharashtra.

The former chief minister had further stated the active role of “right-wing” forces behind the violence at Koregaon Bhima can not be ruled out.

However, concrete evidence in this regard can be gathered only by law enforcement agencies of the state, he had said in the affidavit.

Gathering of anti-social elements in large numbers at Koregaon Bhima indicated the failure of law enforcement agencies, the NCP leader had told the panel.

“Hence, thestate of Maharashtra has to own the responsibility of a failed law and order situation on January 1, 2018,” he had stated.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/koregaon-bhima-judicial-panel-urged-to-summon-pawar.html

The issue came to the notice of the apex court while it was hearing an appeal against the verdict of the Uttarakhand High Court which had held as ""illegal"" the strikes or boycotts of court work on all Saturdays by lawyers in Dehradun and in several parts of Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar. In its September 25, 2019 verdict, the high court had referred to the 266th report of the Law Commission, which had analyzed data on loss of working days on account of strikes by lawyers and had opined that it affects functioning of courts and contributes to the ever mounting pendency of cases.

As per information sent by the high court to the Law Commission with respect to Uttarakhand for 2012-2016, advocates were on strike for 455 days during this period in Dehradun district, followed by 515 days in Haridwar district.

Referring to the Law Commission's report, the high court had noted that strikes by advocates or their abstinence from courts varied from local, national to international issues, having no relevance to the working of the courts, and were seldom for justifiable rsons.""To mention a few, bomb blast in a Pakistan school, amendments to Sri Lanka's Constitution, inter-state river water disputes, attack on/murder of an advocate, earthquake in Nepal, condoling the death of near relatives of advocates, expressing solidarity to advocates of other state bar associations, moral support to movements by social activists, heavy rains.

134,22-2-20,SC larger Bench to revisit 2010 verdict in Lalu Prasad DA case,"The Supreme Court has decided to revisit its 2010 verdict in the disproportionate assets case of former Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav in which it had held that the State Government has no authority to file an appeal against acquittal in cases probed by central agencies.

The issue cropped up as the Chhattisgarh Govt had to rush to the apex court in 2011 challenging the acquittal of Amit Jogi, the son of former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi, in a 2003 murder case as the CBI had not filed the appeal within the stipulated period.

However, during the interregnum, the apex court's three-judge bench in 2010 had delivered a verdict in the Yadav DA case that the CBI, which was the prosecuting agency in the fodder scam, had the right to challenge the orders of the subordinate court and the State Government had no locus standi. When Jogi's matter came up last week in the apex court, the Chhattisgarh Government doubted the correctness of the 2010 verdict in Yadav's case and a bench of Justices SK Kaul and KM Joseph directed that the matter be referred to a larger bench.

""Counsel for the State of Chhattisgarh seeks to doubt the judgment of this Court in Lalu Prasad Yadav and others versus State of Bihar and others, which is of a three-judge bench,"" the bench said. ""We are thus of the view that it may be appropriate that the matters be placed before a three-judge bench itself so as to avoid further duplication of the hearing. The matters be thus, placed before Chief Justice of India for appropriate directions,"" it said.

Advocate Sumeer Sodhi, appearing for the Chhattisgarh Govt, said that the apex court's judgement in the Lalu Prasad Yadav case is per incuriam (bad in law).

Addressing a Press conference at the BJP office here, party spokesperson Sambit Patra said, ""I want to ask all the so-called liberals, who have been opposing CAA, why are they silent on his remarks.

It also vindicates that ladies who are sitting in Shaheen Bagh are just being used as a shield to further the cause of hatred.""

""No one from these liberal brigades is making an issue of the divisive comments made by Waris Pathan. All of them are the same. Haath mein Samvidhaan, dil mein Waris Pathan (Constitution in hand, Waris Pathan in the heart),"" Patra said.

137,22-2-20,Kerala Guv: Forcing opinions on others a form of terrorism,"In an indirect criticism of Shaheen Bagh protesters, Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan on Friday said people sitting on roads and disrupting normal life to force their opinion on others is a form of terrorism.

Speaking at the 'Bharatiya Chhatra Sansad', Khan said that aggression was reflected not just in violence but in other forms too. He said people blocking roads and disrupting normal life to voice their opinion is another form of terrorism. ""Dissent is the essence of democracy. There is no problem with that but five people sit outside the Vigyan Bhawan and say we shall not move from here unless this parliament of students adopts a resolution which we would like them to adopt-- that is another form of terror0ism,"" Khan said.

Since Parliament passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in December last year, a number of protests have taken place across the country, including the one at Shaheen Bagh in the national capital, against the contentious law and a proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC). On Monday, the Supreme Court observed that the blockade of road at Shaheen Bagh was ""troubling"" and suggested that the protesters go to another site, where no public place would be blocked. The top court, however, upheld their right to protest.

Referring to anti-CAA protestors reading the Preamble of the Constitution across the country, Khan said, ""Honestly, I am very happy that people have started reading the Preamble of the Constitution. What does the Preamble say? It talks of liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship. Do not confuse things. Do not try to impose your thoughts in the name of (freedom of speech and) expression on to others.""

Acknowledging that one had every right to express how one felt about a subject, he said, ""Everyone of us must respect that right. But will you say that I shall disrupt normal life?"" Even the term ""dharma"", although most of the times used to mean religion, actually meant duties, Khan asserted, adding, ""Before you claim rights, do your duties. When you claim a right, then respect the similar right of others as well.""

On the issue of the Centre abrogating Article 370 of the Constitution and bifurcating the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir into Union territories, Khan said, ""There is nothing left in Article 370. Just read about it a little. But when the house gets empty and there is no one to live in it, many ghosts wander in that house. This is how the ghost of terrorism has come in.""

""Article 370 has been abrogated. I do not want to make any big claims from here. But the way things are getting normal (in Kashmir), I do not have an iota of doubt that we will be able to finish off terrorism to a large extent,"" he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/kerala-guv--forcing-opinions-on-others-a-form-of-terrorism.html

141,22-2-20,India paying price for not sending Muslims to Pak: Giriraj,"The country is paying the price for failure to send Muslims to Pakistan and bring Hindus to India after the Islamic state came into being at the time of Independence, Union Minister Giriraj Singh has said, triggering a fresh controversy.

The BJP leader made the remark in Purnea district in the Seemanchal region of Bihar which has a sizeable Muslim population and where the Begusarai MP was canvassing in favor of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Highlighting the need for such a legislation, he told reporters late Thursday “when our forefathers were fighting for Independence from British rule, Jinnah was pushing for the creation of an Islamic state”.

“Our forefathers, however, committed a mistake. Had they ensured that all our Muslim brothers were sent to Pakistan and Hindus brought here, the need for such a move (CAA) would not have arisen. This did not happen and we have paid a heavy price for the it,” the outspoken BJP leader said.

The CAA, which seeks to fast-track granting citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who might have fled their home countries because of religious persecution, has become a major bone of contention since it is feared that a country-wide National Register for Citizens (NRC) may follow.

The Narendra Modi government, which had formerly hinted that a country-wide NRC was on the anvil, seems to have put it on the backburner though a section of citizens across the country, especially Muslims, have been organizing protests out of fear that, if implemented, the NRC may result in a large number of people becoming stateless. Singh has often been in the crosshairs of the opposition for placing his foot in the mouth. This time, however, his words were frowned upon even by NDA ally Lok Janshakti Party, founded by his cabinet colleague Ram Vilas Paswan and now headed by his son Chirag Paswan.

The young LJP chief, who kicked off a state-wide “Bihar First-Bihari First” yatra here Friday morning, to project the NDAs progressive face ahead of the assembly polls due later this year, expressed strong disapproval of Singh's utterance and noted the coalition had to suffer in the Delhi polls because of “divisive” remarks by BJP leaders.

“We are an NDA constituent but many times our coalition partners say things which the LJP does not at all agree with. This one (Giriraj Singhs statement) is such an example. Had a person of my party spoken in this fashion, I would have taken responsibility and acted,” Paswan said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/india-paying-price-for-not-sending-muslims-to-pak--giriraj.html

The K Palaniswami Government has also written to the Centre that certain information and documents like Aadhaar should be avoided in the upcoming Census, the party said, in an apparent reference to apprehensions being raised over certain aspects of the National Population Register process.

“No injustice will be meted out to any minority brother and sister in Tamil Nadu. The government will not allow any activity against minorities. AIADMK will be a true friend for the Muslim community forever,” a party statement said appealing for maintaining communal harmony.

The statement by top AIADMK leaders Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam and Chief Minister K Palaniswami comes in the backdrop of latest round of protests here and some other parts of the state against the amended citizenship law, NPR and the national register of citizens.

Among others, a massive protest was held here on Wednesday in which thousands of Muslims, including women, took part and urged the state assembly to adopt an anti-CAA resolution in the session that ended on Thursday.

145,22-2-20,"After Didi ke bolo, BJP to launch bolo programme","The Bengal BJP is likely to match Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s ‘Didi ke bolo’ (tell the elder sister) programme with a similar ‘BJP ke bolo’ (tell the BJP) initiative apparently to reach out to the masses ahead of the civic elections likely to be held sometime in April-May this year.

The elections to 107 municipalities and corporations are being considered as the semi-finals before the next year’s Assembly elections.

When contacted the State BJP leaders said the proposed ‘BJP ke bolo’ was not similar to ‘Didi ke bolo’ curriculum as the first one was being organized to read the people’s mind and their issues while the second one was launched basically to handle the corruption charges against the State’s numerous Trinamool Congress cadres.

The BJP leader said the people will be provided with a helpline number so as to enable them to call and register their grievances. A senior BJP leader said the party will work towards resolving those issues.

The programme will start as ‘a pilot project’ where only BJP workers in the 107 municipalities will be asked to register feedback of the masses. Subsequently a statewide toll free number will be launched for the people, sources said.

Being the second such mass outreach programme after the “cha chakra Diliper songe (tea party with Dilip Ghosh)” the “BJP ke bolo” initiative is likely to expand the party’s public outreach. Through this programme the party will be able to understand the people’s problem and promise them solutions in its manifesto sources said.

“Ours is a public relations exercise whereby we will try to understand the people’s problems and their demands whereas Didi ke bolo was launched to deflate the grievances from the people’s minds that had piled up against the corrupt hierarchy of the TMC.

“It was also used as a device to segregate Mamata Banerjee as a cult from the TMC workers apparently with a message that the workers were thieves and the TMC chief was honest,” said a State BJP leader.

Apparently conceived by TMCs’ poll consultant Prashant Kishore, Didi ke bolo was a handle to assuage people’s ruffled feelings against the TMC Government by providing them instant relief from their problems.

For this telephone numbers were given to the people to contact the Chief Minister with their grievances which were then to be addressed within days if not hours. Incidentally Didi ke bolo had become a huge hit in the State the result of which was witnessed in the three Assembly by-elections in the where the TMC bounced back with huge margin defeating the BJP.

The saffron outfit had won 18 out of 42 seats from Bengal in the last year’s parliamentary elections. With anti-incunbency factor playing a major role in the TMC debacle Didi ke bolo clearly played a big role for the ruling party to stage a comeback, experts said. When contacted TMC general secretary and Minister Partha Chatterjee alleged that BJP was trying to copy the Chief Minister adding “howsoever they copy they will because Mamata Banerjee is a mass leader with credibility and the BJP has no public face.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/after-didi-ke-bolo--bjp-to-launch-bolo-programme.html

Meghwal, along with party legislators Madan Diwalar and Mohan Ram, reached Nagaur on Friday and met with the victims. He also visited the spot where the incident took place on Sunday.

“The Chief Minister is holding the portfolio of home minister but there is no control over crime and the Government is responsible for the incident,” Meghwal, the minister of state for heavy industries and public enterprises, said.

“There was also a failure on part of the police because they could not get to know about the incident when it happened,” he added.

The Dalit men were beaten up, stripped and tortured by staffers of a motorcycle service agency in Karanu village after accusing them of committing theft.

The brutal incident came to light after a video of the assault went viral. In the video, a group of men is seen thrashing two persons with rubber belts. They later dipped a piece of cloth wrapped on a screwdriver in petrol and inserted it in the private parts of one of the victims.

Meghwal, the MP from Bikaner, accused police of manipulating the case. He also alleged that the victims were under pressure.

“We met the victims and also visited the place where the incident occurred,” he said.

The delegation of the BJP leaders also visited the Panchodi police station where an FIR regarding the incident has been registered.

Meghwal said an inquiry report of the party delegation, which he was heading, will be submitted to the BJP’s state president in Jaipur on Saturday.

Police have so far arrested seven persons in connection with the case. “Seven people have been arrested after registering a case against them under various sections of IPC and the SC/ST Act.

Addressing reporters here, the Minister of Health and Tourism accused Bedi of intimidating IAS officers, particularly Tamil IAS officers.

Referring to the recent findings of the CBI that none of the six officers of the territorial administration had committed any wrong in the selection and admission of students to privately managed medical colleges in 2017, he said, “The six had suffered mental agony because of the allegations the Lieutenant Governor had made against them to the CBI through the Medical Council of India.

“What is her answer to the harassment the officers had suffered because of her authoritative stance,” he asked.

Bedi had also sent allegedly adverse reports against ‘honest’ officers to the Union Home Ministry, he said without disclosing their names. Rao said his departments were not able to implement any centrally sponsored schemes or schemes evolved by the territorial government because of the alleged intervention of Bedi.

“I will never compromise and I have seen several Kiran Bedis in my career and I will file a case against her in the next one week to bring justice to the people and to ensure Bedi’s intervention does not continue,” Rao said.

151,22-2-20,Sedition charge slapped against woman,"A young woman who raised pro- Pakistan slogans at an anti-CAA rally here last evening has been booked for sedition and remanded to judicial custody, police said on Friday.

Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa said the woman had links with Naxals.

In a related development, security was provided at the home of the woman, Amulya Leona, in Chikkamagaluru district, after it was attacked, allegedly by right wing workers.

Officials said some people had targeted her home on Thursday evening and the window panes were damaged.

Amulya had raised ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans thrice after the organisers, under the banner of “Save the Constitution”, invited her to address the gathering in the presence of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi, on Thursday.

After being removed from the stage, she was arrested on charges of sedition and produced before a magistrate's court, which remanded her to 14 days judicial custody.

Her father Wazi also called for action against her as per the law, saying she has made an “unforgiveable mistake.”

On Friday, Yeddiyurappa said: “Importantly, the organisations that are behind people like Amulya and nurturing them, if we don't take action against such organisations, such things won't end.”

Speaking to reporters in Mysuru, he said prima facie it was clear there was an conspiracy going on to disturb law and order with such incidents.

“If organisations that are behind her are inquired into, things will come out. It is clear she had links with Naxals in the past. In this backdrop, she should be punished and action taken against organisations that are behind her,” he said.

The Chief Minister noted that the girl's father himself has said she should be punished and not get bail and that he would not seek protection for her.

City Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao said “making a statement somewhere is different, but calling someone for a stage event and for them to make divisive comments, is it right?”

Action would be taken against the organisers, he said, Adding that those calling people for such events should take responsibility and them playing a 'drama' about their non- involvement in such incidents, is not acceptable.

“Because the matter is so sensitive, anything can happen any time,” he said.

“We have been trying to maintain peace for three months in that it has become a competition to create a law and order situation,” he added.

Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said all angles, including the woman's posts on Facebook, would be looked into, including if any organisation was behind her.

“Let's look into what comes out of the investigation and accordingly action will be taken...” he said, as he hit out at the opposition for “supporting” such elements and asked them to function responsibly.

Amulya's father Wazi said action should be taken against her in accordance with law, so that she corrects herself.

“It is an unforgivable mistake, she has caused pain to Indians.I'm deeply disturbed....Action should be taken against her in accordance with law. She is around 19, we will have to find out why she said it and who is behind it,” he said.

“She is a bright girl....I have tried to tell her not to involve herself in such activities after I got to know she was involving in anti-CAA, anti-NRC protests and complete her education first,” he said.

Meanwhile, a video of a group of people, allegedly right wing activists, last evening, purportedly questioning Wazi about his daughter's conduct and making him raise “Bharat Mata ki Jai” slogans has gone viral. On the other hand a purported Facebook post of Amulya on February 16 has surfaced in which she has said 'Zindabad' to several neighbouring countries and that doing so does not make her belong to them.

“Hindustan Zindabad, Pakistan Zindabad, Bangladesh Zindabad, Sri Lanka Zindabad, Nepal Zindabad, Afghanistan Zindabad, China Zindabad, Nepal Zindabad... Whichever country it may be,Zindabad to all countries,”said the post in Kannada.

Some people who are said to be Amulya's friends have claimed she was about to raise Zindabad slogans naming various countries as mentioned in the Facebook post before she was stopped by people around her on the stage.

However, others rejected such claims, pointing out that she had said Pakistan Zindabad thrice.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sedition-charge-slapped-against-woman.html

Pathan had made the purported remarks while addressing an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) rally at Kalaburagi in North Karnataka on February 16.

154,22-2-20,"AIMIM, BJP two faces of same coin: Congress","All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader Waris Pathan’s ‘15 crore (Muslims) will prove to be too much for 100 crore (Indians)’ statement continued to dominate political discourse in Maharashtra on Friday, with the Congress condemning Pathan and charging that AIMIM and BJP ‘are two faces of the same coin’.

Five days after Pathan made controversial remarks at an anti-CAA rally at Kalburgi in north Karnataka, the Shiv Sena and Raj Thackeray-led MNS also hit out Pathan for his hate speech.

Condemning Pathan for his “15 crore...” statement, Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) general secretary Sachin Sawant said: AIMIM and BJP are two faces of the same coin. It has been repeatedly established that the two parties indulge in division of the society on religious lines. Extreme views held by the people of any religion are dangerous for the country. We have to oppose both the AIMIM and BJP”.

Sawant compared Pathan’s statement with the “divisive statements” made deliberately from time to time Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, BJP leaders Giriraj Singh and Parvesh Verma.

“Per se it appears like both the AIMIM and BJP have come together and chalked out the divisive agenda. Their agenda is aimed at eroding the foundation of social amity and secularism enshrined in the Constitution. Even in the past organisations like Muslim League, Hindu Mahasaabha and RSS used to work in tandem to accomplish their common agenda,” Sawant said.

“Despite speaking against each other in open forums, Hindu Mahasabha and Muslim League shared power. They had also opposed Quit India movement and supported the British,” he said.

Shiv Sena MP and spokesperson Sanjay Raut warned Pathan that despite being in power in Maharashtra, his party was party was capable of giving a befitting reply to Pathan and AIMIM.

Alluding to a pro-Pakistan slogan raised by by a woman at an anti-CAA rally in Bengaluru, Raut said: “The matter does not end someone (Asaduddin Owaisi) disowning someone's slogans. On your (Asaduddin Owaisi) stage, if a woman comes and raises a slogan then it means that you have contributed to vitiating the environment in your way”.

In a recorded statement, MNS leader Bal Nandgaonkar said: “Waris (Pathan) had become an MLA by mistake. You have not made your Rs 15 crore crore..’ statement after applying your mind. If you continue to indulge in this kinds, we will smack you in your back and you will not know whathas happened to you”

“Hindustan ke Musalman is mitti se pyaar karne wala hai aur Woh hamare hain (the Muslims who love this country are ours). You are talking about Muslims who have illegally immigrated to India. How these Muslims are related to you?, If you talk like this, we will not allow to live Byaculla or anywhere in Maharashtra.In that case, you will have to go and livewith Owaisi,” Nandgaonkar said.

It may be recalled that at an anti-CAA rally held at Kalburagi in north Karnataka on February 16, Pathan had said: “We have to move together. We have to take Azadi (freedom), things that we don't get by asking, we have to take it by force, remember it”.

“Now time has come, we are told that we have sent our mothers and sisters in the front and were sitting covered in blanket... Only our lionesses have come out and you are already sweating. Understand what will happen if we come together. (We may be) 15 crore, but we will prove to be too heavy on 100 (crore), remember it,” Pathan had said. A video clip of this portion of Pathan’s speech has gone viral media since then

On his part, Pathan defended himself by saying that his remarks made at Kalburgi rally five days ago have been quoted out of context. “I wish to reiterate that I can never say intentionally or unintentionally things that hurt the sentiments of any caste, community or gender. I am a proud Indian and respect the plurality of the country,” he said in a statement.

159,22-2-20,Govt should fill CDPO posts earliest for success of Poshan Abhiyan: Niti,"Government think-tank Niti Aayog has made a strong case for urgently filling vacancies at Child Development Project Officer (CDPO) and Lady Supervisor levels for ensuring success of Modi Government’s flagship nutrition scheme Poshan Abhiyan.

In a report titled ‘Transforming Nutrition in India: Poshan Abhiyan’, the Aayog said the government is committed to improving the nutritional status of children and women through Poshan Abhiyaan.

“At a national level, the vacancy rates are in the range of 25 per cent at both the CDPO and Lady Supervisor levels. This is the aggregated national scenario that varies from State to State; however, it is a clear indication of the relatively higher number of vacancies at the Supervisor level,” the report pointed out.

It also said that for positions sanctioned under the Poshan Abhiyaan, State Project Management Units (SPMUs) have not been established in two of the 19 large States (Punjab and Karnataka).

“Even where SPMUs have been established, 10 States have vacancy rates in the excess of 30 per cent,” the report added.

Noting that the position in smaller states is even worse, it said with the exception of two States (Meghalaya & Mizoram), in the rest of the states either the SPMU has not been set up altogether, or even where it has been set up all positions remain vacant due to non-completion of the recruitment process.

The UTs are slightly better placed with four of them having greater than 75 per cent of the SPMU posts filled up, the report said, adding that none of the posts were filled in Puducherry and Delhi.

“Thus, it is recommended that these gaps need to be closed at the earliest and they are critical to ensuring support to the frontline workers,” it said.

There are huge gaps in the procurement and distribution of growth monitoring devices, the report noted.

As per the last update only 27.6 per cent of Anganwadi Worker(AWWs) across the country have been provided with Smartphones and about 35 per cent of AWWs have Growth Monitoring Devices (Infantometer, Stadiometer & Weighing Scales).

Observing that it is an urgent need to address challenges pertaining to connectivity and the software issues to ensure ICDS-CAS operations function smoothly, the report said,”Only few States like Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, and Daman & Diu have established helpdesks in all the Districts”.

Stating that utilisation of funds for any programme is one of the proxy indicators of its successful implementation, it said the cumulative utilisation rate is about 20 per cent in the large States.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-should-fill-cdpo-posts-earliest-for-success-of-poshan-abhiyan--niti.html

Out of total government expenditure of Rs 21.09 lakh crore, which is 76 per cent of the BE, revenue expenditure was Rs 18.54 lakh crore and capital expenditure Rs 2.55 lakh crore.

Fiscal deficit was pegged at Rs 8.07 lakh crore, which was 11 per cent of BE.

161,22-2-20,Yet to finalise trade deal with India: White House,"The United States on Friday said it was unlikely that a trade deal would be inked with India during President Donald Trump's upcoming visit to the country, saying that concerns that led to India's removal from the Generalized System of Preferences persisted.

""The concerns that led to the revocation, suspension of India's Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) access remains a concern for us. And to remind, it was really the failure of the Indian government to provide equitable and reasonable access to its markets in numerous sectors,"" a senior administration official told reporters during a conference call.

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are scheduled to travel to Ahmedabad, Agra and New Delhi on February 24 and 25. There have been talks about India and the United States agreeing on a trade package as a precursor to a major trade deal.

US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has been negotiating a trade deal with India, is not travelling with Trump on the India trip. In fact, he had cancelled his earlier trip to India as well.

""We continue to talk to our Indian colleagues about addressing these market access barriers. Our trade teams, led by the USTR, have been in touch with their counterparts over the past several weeks. That engagement will continue,"" the official said.

""The trade and economic relationship with India is critically important to the United States, and I think also access to the United States market is critical to the Indian government. We do want to make sure that we get this balance right. We want to address a bunch -- a lot of concerns, and we're not quite there yet,"" the official said in response to a question.

The high-powered American delegation led by Trump will likely have discussion with Prime Minister Narendra Modi about these concerns and continue the discussion beyond this visit, said the senior administration official.

The official said a number of announcements coming from India in the past several weeks, are making the discussions a bit more difficult perhaps.

""Recent announcements on Make in India have made the protectionism concerns in India even greater. So we will be discussing those concerns. And what we see as an increase in barriers, not a decrease, this will certainly come up among the leaders,"" the official argued.

""Whether or not there will be announcement on a trade package is, really, wholly dependent upon what the Indians are prepared to do. That said we have a number of significant commercial deals, which are of great significance that we're very pleased to announce in a number of key sectors,"" said the senior administration official.

The senior administration official said ""the Make in India push of the Indian government, has made the protectionism concerns"" even more of a concern to the United States.

""We've seen India's budget process recently used to raise tariffs on products of interest in the United States. We continue to see important divergences on e-commerce and digital trade. So it's a pretty wide scope, frankly, of important service and goods access barriers that we need to address,"" the official said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/yet-to-finalise-trade-deal-with-india--white-house-2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/yet-to-finalise-trade-deal-with-india--white-house.html
162,22-2-20,"Trump savouring scrambled Dem race, Bloomberg’s debate debut","Relishing in Democrats’ jumbled primary in the wake of a fractious debate, President Donald Trump offered stinging criticism of his rivals as he sought to take advantage of the moment.

Making a rare four-day swing through the West, Trump was exuding reelection confidence on Thursday at a campaign rally in Colorado, after taking in the prior night’s prize fight of a debate in Las Vegas. He reveled in the intra-party squabbling and the weak debut debate performance turned in by former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, according to aides and allies.

“I don’t know if anyone watched last night’s debate,” Trump told an arena of raucous supporters. “It got very big ratings, and you know what, Mini Mike didn’t do well last night. I was going to send him a note, saying it’s not easy doing what I do is it?” He offered other biting assessments of the Democratic contenders, contrasting them to his own performance in debates four years ago.

“I became president because of the debates because unlike Mini Mike I could answer questions,” Trump said.

Feeling reelection odds rising after his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial and his campaign’s record fundraising, Trump seized on the deep divisions and personal tiffs on display in the Democratic field. But his preoccupation with the scrambled nomination race for the Democrats seeking to replace him has been clear throughout the trip.

When Trump woke up Thursday morning in his gilded Las Vegas hotel, his base during the four-state western trip, he tuned in to the post-debate coverage and displayed his glee.

Repurposing one of Bloomberg’s own quotes about the Democratic infighting, Trump tweeted: “The real winner last night was Donald Trump.” He tacked on his own coda: “I agree!”” The night before, after a campaign rally in Phoenix, Trump summoned reporters to his office aboard Air Force One to join him in watching a replay of the debate on the return flight to Las Vegas.

He was scheduled to hold a rally in the city — his third in as many days — Friday on the eve of the caucuses, as he did before contests in Iowa and New Hampshire.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump-savouring-scrambled-dem-race--bloomberg---s-debate-debut.html
163,22-2-20,"Another nun had accused Bishop Mulakkal of sexual harassment, claims SOS forum","The Save Our Sisters forum, which spearheaded the protests against rape accused Bishop Franco Mulakkal in 2018, on Friday alleged “cover up” by police after fresh reports claimed that another nun had given a statement against the top priest alleging sexual harassment.

The SOS alleged that the police failed to act in the sexual harassment charges levelled against the former Jalandhar diocese Bishop by the nun, who is also a key witness in the 'nun rape case.'

According to the media reports, another nun belonging to the Missionaries of Jesus congregation, who is the 14th witness in the rape case, had given a statement to the investigation team in September 2018 alleging that the Bishop had sent her lewd messages on her phone in 2015.

“Police did not register a case in the second case ofsexual allegations against the Bishop by the nun. Wesuspect the role of influential people in keeping the nun's statement secret so far.

Itis a mystery,” SOS convener Felix J Pulloodan and joint convener Shaiju Antony said in a statement here.

They demanded a thorough probe into the case.

The SOS expressed apprehension that the nun, who is currently with the Missionaries of Jesus congregation under Jalandhar diocese, will be forced to change her statement “yielding to the pressure tactics of the Bishop and his supporters.”

Police have not reacted to the reports of fresh allegations quoting the statement given to the investigation team by the second nun.

A statement issued by Fr. Peter, PRO to Bishop Franco Mulakkal, criticised the media for “propagating” a statement given by a witness in the case a year ago.

The priest said the statement of the witness-nun was part of the charge sheet submitted by the investigation team in the court.

“That statement of the nun is propagated through media with a wrong intention, that too on the eve of the Bishop's discharge petition to be considered by the court. It is seen as a bid to indirectly influence the court proceedings,” said the statement signed by Peter.

Sister Anupama, one of the nuns who took part in the public protest here demanding rape-accused Mulakkal's arrest, said she and her fellow nuns, who stood by the rape survivor, were not aware of the fresh sexual allegations levelled against the Bishop.

“We see it as a divine intervention. We are happy that more people are coming out openly against Bishop Franco Mulakkal,” Anupama told PTI when asked about the reports.

Meanwhile, a lower court in Kottayam will consider on Saturday a discharge plea filed by Mulakkal in connection with the rape case. In his plea filed before the Additional District and Sessions Court-I, Mulakkal has claimed that prima facie there was no case to frame charges against him.

The Bishop filed the discharge plea as the court was about to commence the preliminary hearing on the rape charges against him.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/another-nun-had-accused-bishop-mulakkal-of-sexual-harassment--claims-sos-forum.html
164,22-2-20,"Hyd varsity imposes `5,000 fine on three students for holding Shaheen Bagh night","The University of Hyderabad has fined three students Rs 5,000 each for organising a 'Shaheen Bagh Night' event against the Citizenship Amendment Act on the campus after 9 pm in violation of varsity regulations.

The students union has condemned the move.

The fine was imposed through an a university order dated February 18 as the students organised the event on January 31 after 9 pm at North Shopping Complex and also allegedly defaced the walls at the site, university sources said.

“The students are sternly warned to be cautious and focus on their studies in future.

Recurrence of such incidents or indulging in any act of indiscipline would have serious repercussions on their academic career with strong disciplinary action,” the order said.

Condemning the varsity action, the students union in a statement said the order or circular was arbitrary and they would not follow it and demanded that the fine imposed be withdrawn unconditionally.

“HCUSU (Hyderabad Central University Students Union) also assures the student community that we will not bow down to the administration at any cost and will take any and every possible step to safeguard the democratic interests of the students,” the note said.

A spokesperson of the University said the institution recognises the right of recognised student bodies to organise meetings or protests, in designated spaces without disrupting normal academic, administrative and residential life of a large number of teaching and non-teaching staff and their families who live on the campus.

“It is in that context that three students were fined for violating standing regulations of the University that no meetings and protests would be permittedin public spaces of the campus after 9 pm,” the varsity official said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/hyd-varsity-imposes--5-000-fine-on-three-students-for-holding-shaheen-bagh-night.html
165,22-2-20,"Virus may slash $29 bn from airlines’ revenue, says IATA","The outbreak of the new virus threatens to erase $29 billion of this year’s revenue for global airlines, mostly for Chinese carriers, as travel crashes worldwide, according to the International Air Transport Association.

The trade group for global airlines said Thursday that the virus causing COVID-19 has the potential for causing a 13% decline in demand for Asian carriers this year.

The contraction comes at a time when Asian airlines’ sales had been growing, the group said. Global air traffic will be reduced by 4.7% for the year, marking the first overall decline in such demand since the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, IATA said in a statement. How profits will be affected was still unclear, it said.

The estimates foresee a scenario where COVID-19 has a “V-shaped impact,” similar to what happened during the SARS virus outbreak in 2003, with a sharp dive followed by a quick recovery, according to IATA. The virus, which began in China late last year, has sickened more than 75,000 people in China, Some 2,000 people have died in China. More than 1,000 cases have been found outside mainland China.

International airlines including British Airways, Germany’s Lufthansa, Australia’s Qantas and the three largest U.S. Airlines have suspended flights to China, in some cases until late April or May. Cathay Pacific asked employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave to help it weather the crisis.

Travel restrictions inside China and fear of the illness have devastated demand for domestic flights in the fast-growing China market.

Many nations are warning people not to travel to China, or barring travelers from China, especially from the Wuhan area, at the center of the outbreak. People around the world are also voluntarily scaling back travel, while some governments and health experts are encouraging people to stay indoors not only in China but also South Korea and Japan to avoid getting infected.

“These are challenging times for the global air transport industry. Stopping the spread of the virus is the top priority,” said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO. “This will be a very tough year for airlines.”

Analysts at Cowen, a US investment bank and financial services company, noted IATA might be underestimating the impact on Asia travel outside of China, noting the recent reports of dozens of cases in South Korea.

“While still relatively small, and too early to tell if it will spread further, we see this as a material negative data point on the global containment of the virus,” the Cowen report said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/virus-may-slash--29-bn-from-airlines----revenue--says-iata.html

167,22-2-20,DGCA proposes testing of aviation personnel for psychoactive substances,"The Directorate General of Civil Aviation has for the first time proposed testing of aviation personnel for psychoactive substances such as cannabis, opioids and their variants, officials said on Friday.

The civil aviation watchdog stated that once the regulations are finalised, flight crew members and air traffic controllers (ATCs) would be subjected to this examination at six airports — Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad — in the first phase.

The tests would consist of screening test and a confirmatory test. Screening test will be carried out at the airport or the ATC complex and will be recorded on video.

If a person is found positive in the screening test, then the confirmatory test will be carried out in one of the DGCA-approved laboratories.

The testing would be done at random under the supervision of the DGCA officers of and will cover 10 per cent of employees of each organisation in a period of one year, the regulator noted.

For the testing, personnel’s urine sample would be used, it added.

If any person is found positive in the screening test, he or she will be removed from safety sensitive duties till the results of the confirmatory test are received, the regulator stated.

If the confirmatory test is also positive then the person will be subjected to rehabilitation and will return to active duties only after having undergone the tests for the consumption of the psychoactive substance, clearance by treating psychiatrist and the certification by the Chief Medical Officer of the organisation concerned.

“If after return to safety sensitive duties, a person again tests positive in the confirmatory test, the license of the involved person will be cancelled,” the DGCA asserted.

If a person refuses to undergo examination, he or she would be taken off the safety sensitive duties and will be required to clear “detailed drug testing profile” within a week, failing which his or her license will be suspended for three years.

This is in line with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) policy and procedures which has already been prescribed by other leading aviation agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the USA and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the DGCA stated.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/dgca-proposes-testing-of-aviation-personnel-for-psychoactive-substances.html
168,22-2-20,Jack Ma teams up with Columbia University to find cure for COVID-19,"China’s tech billionaire Jack Ma has pledged over USD 2 million to support the development of antiviral drugs to combat the new coronavirus which has killed 2,236 people in the country and infected more than 75,000 others.

The WHO has declared the epidemic as a public health emergency.

In accordance with a deal signed between the Jack Ma foundation and Columbia University, the 15 million yuan will be used for supporting a research project led by Dr David Ho, a world-renowned HIV/AIDS researcher with the university, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

The researcher will lead in setting project objectives, conducting research and tracking results, said a source of the foundation based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, with Wuhan as the epicenter, Ho and many researchers at Columbia University have been following the situation closely and started related work to combat the virus, the report said.

In support of the cooperation project, Columbia University has set up a multidisciplinary team involving professionals in virology, molecular biology and chemistry who proposed four different new solutions to tame the pathogen, according to the source.

169,22-2-20,Asian markets fall on fears over spreading virus,"A spike in new virus cases outside China spooked Asian markets on Friday after Wall Street pulled back from record highs as more companies warned earnings could be hurt by the epidemic.

More than 2,200 people have died from the novel coronavirus, which has infected over 75,000 people, mostly in China, and spread panic around the world.

While Beijing claims its epidemic control efforts are working, the rising death toll and number of new infections abroad have rattled investors.

A batch of warnings from companies over the impact of the virus on bottom lines -- including Danish ship operator Maersk and Air France-KLM -- and weaker manufacturing data in Japan also fanned anxiety.

Initial hopes that the virus would have only a short-term impact on earnings and economic growth have given way to the reluctant realisation that it could linger.

“It took Apple to do what the coronavirus couldn’t -- make stocks feel a little queasy,” said Stephen Innes of AxiCorp, referring to the tech giant’s warning Monday that it would miss its quarterly revenue forecast because of the disease.

“The market seemed to absorb the initial Apple shock in its typically pleasant manner, but it’s the aftershocks when corporate America starts waving the warning flags in tandem that could prove to be the biggest gut check.”

Seoul’s Kospi index fell 1.5 per cent. The country confirmed 48 more virus cases on Friday afternoon, adding to the 52 it announced in the morning, taking its total to 204.

Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed down 0.4 per cent as investors took to the sidelines ahead a long weekend.

Mainland China’s key Shanghai Composite Index closed up 0.3 per cent following central bank efforts to cushion the impact of the virus on the world’s second-largest economy, where manufacturing activity has been hit hard.

Elsewhere, Sydney, Taipei and Singapore all shed 0.3 per cent.

170,22-2-20,"Russia meddling in US election to boost Trump, lawmakers told","Russia is interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get Donald Trump re-elected, US intelligence officials have warned lawmakers in a briefing that infuriated the president, who then replaced his intelligence chief, US media reported.

Trump erupted in anger at acting director of national intelligence (DNI) Joseph Maguire when he learned of the February 13 session with the House Intelligence Committee, The Washington Post and New York Times said Thursday.

Maguire aide Shelby Pierson reportedly told lawmakers Russia was once again meddling in the US election on Trump’s behalf. Trump complained that the Democrats would use the information against him, the reports said. The president was also annoyed by the presence of Adam Schiff, the Democratic head of the investigation that led to Trump being impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, according to the New York Times.

Maguire had been a favorite to be nominated for the permanent DNI post but Trump soured on the official, The Washington Post said, when he heard about the classified election security briefing.

The president berated Maguire in an Oval Office showdown last week for the “disloyalty” of his staff, the Post reported, effectively thwarting his chances of becoming a permanent hire.

Trump announced on Wednesday he was replacing Maguire with Richard Grenell, 53, the ambassador to Germany and a Trump loyalist.

173,22-2-20,Love in the time of uncertainty,"Actor Gul Panag says that it’s an individual’s personality which determines the change in human relationships over time. By Team Viva

It’s not working between us anymore.’ ‘Things are not the same.’ ‘We are not compatible now.’ ‘It’s different.’ There are times when two people in a relationship might start feeling the pinch. They begin questioning each other’s love for themselves. They might also feel that things aren’t going the way they had imagined them to be. For actor Gul Panag, who is currently featuring in MX Player’s web series, Pawan & Pooja, apart from misunderstandings and a lack of time for each other, it is also a person’s individuality which gradually becomes a major reason of change in a relationship.

Giving a reference of her own marriage, Gul says, “A relationship keeps getting hard to maintain at every level. The definition of love keeps changing because people change. It’s an individual’s personality that changes the meaning of love for her/him as well. For instance, I have been with Rishi (Attari) for two decades now. I was a different person when I met him and so was he when he met me. But today, we are completely different because of our experiences and how we have grown. We have come a long way and have changed. How can then we expect our relationship to be the same?”

Her character, Pooja, and her relationship with Pawan Mehra (played by Sharman Joshi) showcase a similar thing. The series revolves around three couples with the same names but different age groups — old (60s-70s), mid (40s-50s) and millennial (20s-30s). For each couple, meaning of love, and the way of looking at their relationship, differs. The mid Pawan and Pooja are caught in a midlife crisis, where they have the plateau not just in their love life but as well their careers. Gul says, “Change in a relationship is inevitable. Why will it not change? That’s exactly my Pooja’s problem. She is carrying the burden of an unrealistic relationship. That is what most couples face. Our relationships change. And it is very obvious because you have changed with time. That is exactly the meat of mid Pooja’s character.”

She finds a connect with her character. Was this the reason she said yes to the role? She tells us, “I am stealing Mahesh sir’s answer here. When somebody reaches out to you for the character of Pooja in a show called Pawan & Pooja, it gives you a strong motivation because it is a crucial character. There are three stories and six protagonists. It’s a great character to play and yet, equally challenging because it is not some larger than life character. She’s not a classic army officer with a great body language. It’s about the smaller details and circumstances. It is about people in ordinary circumstances who are actually extraordinary. She’s not a gangster. If you were to ask me to define the mid Pooja, beyond the fact that she’s in her late 30s and early 40s, she has a child and she has been with her husband for 15 years. She is bored. Her relationship makes her feel stagnant. She is just a wife.”

The actor, recalling her own previous roles, says that Pooja is different and cannot be restricted to any particular label. “In Student Of The Year 2, it was a smart, fit coach. There were several adjectives to describe her personality. In Family Man, there are again multiple adjectives to define Saloni, my character. In Bypass Road, I play the antagonist, who has an attitude of her own. But Pooja can’t be labeled. It’s the reason why as an actor it is far more challenging to play her part. How do I make you want to watch Pooja? The only way I can make you see Pooja is by being as real as possible because it’s very much derived from real life.”

Talking about the millennial couple in the show, she points out that the essence of love hasn’t changed as it is perceived to be. It’s only the ways of looking at it that have changed. She says, “I think love has always remained the same. It’s only now that we are vocalising it through various media. If we talk in context of India, out of 135 crore people, not many people are actually in a live-in. The total viewership of English media is 20 crore. Out of that, 20 per cent is the conservative lot. Yes, it has always been complicated. And today, we are in an environment where there is a lot of pressure. People are compelled to put their best feet forward. They are constantly questioning, ‘Am I good enough?’ Social media is promoting that pressure and you are constantly measuring your worth with other people’s yardstick at each level. Relationships are the same. They should look good enough on social media to be labelled as ‘goals’, no matter how they are in reality. People hunting the spark which was there when they first met is not going to be there because the people have changed. And for millennials, a lot is defined through Instagram today.”

Gul says that apart from everything else, she was happy to see that the show doesn’t dramatise the love between the three couples. “They are very organic and straight out of reality. The stories do not uphold the cliché of any happily-ever-afters. Their problems are believable. They compel you to realise the fault lines in your own relationship.”

174,22-2-20,Peel the layers off,"Actor Josh Radnor say that his series Hunters is dark, scary, funny and thrilling. It has every element he was looking for in a project. By Team Viva

How did you get this role?

Well, I loved the script. A road gang of the 70s hunting Nazis hiding in New York City sounded terrific to me. And then the part description, Lonny Flash, film star, recovering coke addict, fallen onto hard times, joins this gang of Nazi hunters. And this is where you decide that I’d like to do that. That sounds great as it is something new and different. The whole idea was compelling, and it sounded like it would be dark, scary, funny and thrilling. It had every element I was looking for in a project.

Now that you know Lonny more, is it everything you’ve wanted and more?

Yes, it’s interesting because a pilot script is just a roadmap, it’s a suggestion. In a series, once the actor gets involved it changes the writing. So it becomes a collaboration between the actor playing and interpreting the role and the writers. And good writers notice your skillsets. Nikki and David said that they can push it with you because you always try to keep it grounded.

Even though he’s wacky and outrageous, I try to keep him like a plausible human being. So they found that they could write for me in a certain way because of how I would play the part. The whole persona of Lonny is a mask. His real name is Leonard Flagenstein, a theatre actor

So Nikki and David made him (Lonny) more outrageous knowing that you could keep him grounded?

Well, that’s what they told me. They said that they write the stuff for the character because they know I will try to keep it grounded. So it’s not going to seem that there is something unbelievable, which is a great thing because they pushed me to make it seem real. As an actor, it means a lot to me to make it look real.

David says that it’s like a superhero...

There’s a lot of myth, allegory and classic storytelling in The Hunt in terms of it being as a gang of superheroes, who have their bat cave, where they come together and plot what they’re going to do... It’s not good guys against bad guys ultimately. And you realise that when you get your hands bloody, when it comes to vengeance, you become a lot like the people you’re trying to kill. So there’s a lot of layers to it.

What does Lonny offer these hunt guys?

As the show goes on, as the series evolves, some of Lonny’s talents really come in handy, especially in a later episode where he is asked to draw his acting talents to save the day. So he’s dismissed initially as the most frivolous member of the gang. You’ve got bomb diffusers, tech geniuses, puzzle-solvers and all sorts of stuff, lock-pickers. And then by the end it’s revealed that he’s quite an indispensable member of the group.

How do you relate to your character?

Well, we’re both actors, which I think is something very specific about being an actor. And I think he’s very human in the sense that he’s battled a lot of demons, which we all have. And I also relate with his yearning to be a better person and to reinvent himself.

Who does Lonny pair up the most with?

He has a soft spot for Jonah. He’s one of the first one to see how awkward is Jonah feeling and goes up to him, gives him a pep talk, and tells him that even he’s scared of these people,. They’re crazy, but cool. And then they have a little tension that bubbles up which really hurts Lonny. So I think Jonah is kind of bud in the gang. On screen, there’s a lot of friction between Lonny and other characters. Off screen, we’re getting along terrifically.

Who do you think is most wary of Lonny?

I think sister Harriet is really tough on him. Joe rolls his eyes quite a bit. Roxy rolls her eyes, but you can see her smirking. She kind of gets a kick out of him.

What’s like working with Al Pacino?

It is like a peak career experience. It’s just being on set with someone who has specific hours logged in front of a camera and it’s interesting. I find this with great older actors. They have a beautiful combination of attentive kind of readiness, like athletic readiness but in total relaxation. So he’s relaxed and takes his time to rehearse. He loves doing that so he likes to figure out what he’s doing. He also tries lots of different stuff and is always on the hunt for the truthful moment. We sometimes get story time with Al where we ask him a hundred questions and he tells us some of these stories that you don’t get to hear unless you’re working with him very intimately. He a really dear person and I’ve learned a lot from him and adore him a lot.

What do you think people will be really excited about?

The show has many things. There are bursts of deep, super funny things. It’s a period piece, so you will get all great 70s stuff. There are harrowing concentration camp scenes. There are bursts of exciting but scary violence. There is snappy, hilarious, amazing dialogue and great acting. There are even terrific faces to look at.

Do you have any advice for any aspiring actors or creatives?

I feel it’s important to get used to failure and rejection and not think about the ends of the road. I’ve never had an experience artistically that was like a total, unqualified triumph. It’s always one step forward, two steps back, three steps forward, two steps back. It’s just about staying in the process and enjoying the journey because it will certainly lead to all kinds of bells and whistles that you think will make you feel good at the end, whether it’s awards or red carpet. That’s weird about artist life. It’s more about asking yourself I you can wake up and enjoy it? Which I certainly do.

175,22-2-20,‘It’s okay not to win everytime’,"Actor Riteish Deshmukh surprised the audience with his evil act in the 2004 film Ek Villain. He followed it up last year with Marjaavaan that presented him in a meaner role.

Talking about taking up negative roles in films, Riteish said: “Life is about positivity and being nice. I feel that at some point, we feel negative towards certain things. We might hate something, we might dislike someone, we might feel like punching someone and say ‘I don't want to see his face ever again.’ Killing is extreme though.”

“I am just saying that these are the feelings that we are all filled with. We feel love, humour, empathy, compassion, hatred...but in overall behaviour of ours because of education and our upbringing, we know how to differentiate between good and bad,” added the father of two kids.

The actor shared that he is currently at a stage where he is teaching this to his children. “Saying thank you is good, sharing toys is good, it's okay to be second and not to win every time. These are the things you teach your children and prepare them for life. But there are certain people... probably because of their own insecurities. We see that in the society, they take up different things... evil things. We have read about those people but on screen, to get an opportunity to play them and getting into their mind and getting that swag, I got to do that in Ek Villain where I was trying to get into the insecurities of a man, who was a serial killer,” he said.

The beauty of the character, he felt, was that he was just a common man who could be anyone — a lightman or electrician or anybody. “And he could kill anyone and disappear in the crowd. If he didn't kill, his insecurities would have been of a man in every building...those insecurities and depression. Not everyone resorts to taking lives though,” said the actor.

On the other hand, Vishnu in Marjaavaan is larger than life for Riteish. “He is three feet tall but is larger than life, evil and mean. He has a great sense of humour, an evil one and he puts other people down,” he explained.

The Milap Zaveri-directed film also featured Tara Sutaria, Sidharth Malhotra and Rakul Preet Singh. It will be aired on Sony MAX on February 29. Meanwhile, Riteish is looking forward to the release of his film Baaghi 3, which also stars Tiger Shroff.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---it---s-okay-not-to-win-everytime----2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/---it---s-okay-not-to-win-everytime---.html
176,22-2-20,Memories on the table,"An Australian chef of Sri Lankan descent, an advocate of sustainable seafood, author and television presenter Peter Kuruvita tells Ayushi Sharma that because Sri Lanka has been a colony of Portugal, Holland, England and close to Southern India, its cuisine has taken on the best of what was brought to it

Even though it has become a fad to be a vegan these days, you’re still likely to be the odd one out on the dinner table. However, chefs are actually creating a space for them by generating the best alternatives even if it’s not a vegan-friendly cuisine — here, seafood. Chef Peter Kuruvita, too, made sure that there were enough alternatives for the vegetarians on the table as he presented a flavourful island feast of Sri Lankan seafood at Table Stories, a dining concept by FoodInk Expeditions and Roseate Hotels and Resorts.

Food is an effective trigger of profound memories and it’s all about chasing them, believes the chef. Leaving his home in Colombo was one of the toughest decisions that chef Peter took in his life. He often finds himself reminiscing the sights, sound and smell of his home there. And Pol sambhal was one such recipe that has always helped revive that nostalgia. We began the meal with the dish and village bread. The dish, which is a mixture of grated coconut, dried chillies, Maldive fish, lime juice and salt, has forever managed to teleport him back to the village bakery next to his house in Colombo. As a ritual, he would find himself at the bakery every morning picking up a loaf of baked bread, slicing it and placing some Pol sambal into it. He says that it’s a memory he’ll cherish forever. The bread was sleek and crunchy to the core — almost like the crispy, thin-crust of a pizza.

Chef Peter believes that he inherited his passion for cooking from his grandmother. She has undoubtedly been a perennial source of inspiration for him. Her special egg curry was the only reason he would wait for Sundays to come as a child. The sauce that she prepared, brimmed with spices, was the next recipe that he served on the candle-lit dinner table — butter poached crab, sugar snap peas, egg curry and dill. He mixed his grandma’s secret egg curry sauce with sweet-tasting crabs, garnished it with peas, sugar snaps and Wasabi peas to create a dish that was a tribute to her. For vegetarians, it was soybeans, snap peas, kiri hoddy and dill on offer. Except for the Wasabi peas, which were roasted and coated in a mixture of starch, sugar, salt and oil and lemon, it failed to make a mark on my tastebuds.

Moving on, he presented the beetroot curry with pickled red onion, baby target beet, which is an iconic Sri Lankan dish. This curry represented the indomitable spirit of Sri Lankan countrymen. For us to understand how this dish came to be, he told us that he wandered through the markets of Hambantota, a town in Sri Lanka, which was destroyed during the tsunami of 2004. He chose to return there to pay his respect to the people, who never went home and showed how things can be regenerated and recouped after such a tragedy. That’s where he decided to recreate this curry, which is very popular in the country. If you thought beetroot was one of those bland vegetables that was difficult to coax flavour out of, this one by chef Peter was the perfect answer to it.

The next dish needs a background story first. What started in 2003 as an attempt to knock off one of his opponent’s dishes from favourites list, really had chef Peter to create something special. And yet again, his grandmother had a role to play in it. The dish, Sri Lankan snapper curry, aloo chop, tamarind chutney, steamed rice and condiments, was made using her favourite fish curry recipe. To layer this combination, he added beetroot to lend its vivid red colour and the tamarind chutney to up the punch the dish packed. But this chutney wasn’t the one you would traditionally find in the subcontinent. He learnt this particular version from an Indo-Fijian in one of his restaurants in Fiji. He feels that migrants are instrumental in shaping the culinary and cultural fabric of any place. This dish was an amalgamation of chef’s experiences and an ode to all the people he has met in his life. For vegetarians, he replaced the snapper curry with vegetable cutlets and the rest stayed the same. Due to the name, one might recall the usual cutlets one has in Indian homes for breakfast, but these were way beyond conventionality.

Ending the meal on a sweet note, chef Peter presented curds and treacle, for which he had collaborated with the farmers of Sri Lanka. “We made the curd with farmers and palm treacle from the palmyra palm. The combination is undoubtedly heavenly,” he says. This desert was an attempt to bring a smile on the faces of orphans of Hambantota. And it certainly brought a smile on my face, too.

After having a stomach-full of delectable delicacies with many stories and laughter around the table, chef Peter and I sat for a quick conversation over a few glasses of wine.

How did you conceptualise the meal?

The idea was to use the food from my heritage, travel experiences and my restaurant — Noosa Beach House, Australia. I was completely aware that the people of Delhi are not that into seafood. So I purposely chose to present that. It should be fresh, odourless and delicious. So the mission was to seek the highest quality ingredients from the best suppliers available. We achieved that goal with the help of the Table Stories team. I really like to challenge myself in the kitchen. The fusion of Sri Lankan flavours and food at my restaurant is what I did. But I also wanted to bring one Sri Lankan dish as it is and that’s why added the beetroot curry on the menu.

How unique do you find the Sri Lankan cuisine?

Too Indian? I would put it that we are distant cousins, who have grown up in two different countries. Spice-based, coconut-driven, occasionally searingly hot and others are slightly mild. It is heavily influenced by regions and availability, but being a small island, seafood is everywhere. Being a multicultural country, meat is enjoyed in all forms — be it Muslim, Singhalese, Dutch, Portuguese, Burgher or Tamil. We have combined it as one national cuisine. There are so many influences but if you took any of the dishes back to its origin, it would be unrecognisable. As a colony of Portugal, Holland, England and close to Southern India, the cuisine has taken on the best of what was brought to the country, but rather than just adding it onto the menu, the ideas and flavours have been absorbed and become Sri Lankan food. The concept of modern Sri Lanka is very new and for me, it was my French base that helped me to plate the cuisine in a modern style. The idea was to deconstruct the food, ensure all the ingredients are being treated with respect, and then present it in a modern style, while being true to the flavours.

How have you explored various food cultures across the globe?

I get to travel a lot with my job and I love to try everything. In my restaurant, we look at the ingredients rather than the nationality. We are blessed with the most amazing produce in Australia and I like to let the ingredients do the talking. But I focus on how do I use the Australian produce using modern techniques and a twist of Sri Lankan cuisine.

How do you think the Indian audience is accepting the global food trends?

India is being embraced. It has many celebrity chefs and this is a clear indication that the discerning Indian population is now looking for new flavours and textures. India is already ahead of the world — in probably the biggest shift in dining — veganism.

What is your signature dish and how did you come up with such an experiment?

The Sri Lankan snapper curry, tamarind chutney, aloo chop, rice and condiments. In India, when you traditionally eat curry and rice, you have upto six different curries on a plate with condiments, papadum, chilli and pickle. So that was the real challenge — how to serve a single dish and still call it Sri Lankan rice and curry? So here, the first part was to respect the fish because the idea of cooking a curry is to put everything into a pot with spices and cook it. But for me, that process ruined the fish. So I made the curry sauce with the fish scraps and kept the fish fillets aside. Then made a tamarind chutney and used it as the base. I took an idea from a Sri Lankan snack and adapted it to suit the fish curry by adding prawn, sweet potato and a roasted vine-ripened cherry tomato. Later, I added the vegetable component and then served the rice, condiments and coconut sambal separately. For me, being a seafood-orientated chef is that the fish is cooked perfectly and separated from any other flavours.

How do you adapt your dishes to local ingredients while travelling? Any Indian spices or dish that may have caught your fancy?

In India, there are a few ingredients that are not readily available. It is a matter of being organised and ensuring you either order ahead or bring it with you. The Indian spices that are very unique and not used in Sri Lankan at all are — asafoetida, chaat masala, garam masala. Rest is shared but the uses differ.

Food is subjective for different people. Some may like a dish and some won’t. How do you deal with negative criticism to your food?

Take it on the chin and move on. If a guest has chosen a dish from your menu, you know it has to be executed well and if you don’t like it, that is completely fine, they have just chosen the wrong one because as you said, food is subjective for different people, some may like it and some won’t.

I do not let any food below mark leave the kitchen. But if a dish doesn’t make the cut, you go out, talk to the guests and take the comments. Constructive criticism is always good to learn from. Aggressive guests have their own issues, I feel sorry for them and don’t have time for them. If I make a mistake, I own up to it and will probably take it off the bill.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/memories-on-the-table-2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/memories-on-the-table.html
177,22-2-20,The heart will go on,"Actor Claire Danes says that her series Homeland not only entertains people but stimulates conversations too. By Team Viva

What would you say about taking a bit of Brody’s role this season?

Yes, that was very elegant storytelling and a perfect symmetry. It psychically fuses Carrie with Brody in a way that felt right. And she is very clear about her patriotism, she can be challenged in every way but if her patriotism is questioned, I think that is probably the most profound insult she could imagine. So that was also interesting to play and explore. It was a good entry point.

After doing Homeland, do you discuss about world news and what’s happening in the Middle East with your friends as your roles delves deep into this?

Yes, a little bit. All the knowledge that I had gained is through storytelling. Having direct interchange with actual policymakers, intelligence officers and people who are really building the world around us gave me a deep insight about the happenings in the Middle East. That is one of the things I will also miss the most.

Over these eight seasons, what were your favourite episodes?

Well, the first one that comes to mind is Q&A. This was the first time I met Mandy and it was like a play. It was very unusual in its structure and beautifully written. The fact that I’d never done that before, an hour long conversation opposite another actor, makes it more memorable. In fact, any scene with Mandy is memorable, I even remember my first scene but I don’t know what episode it was. It was in the first season when I was talking to Mandy about my frustrations with the job and loneliness. This is what first comes to my mind. There are many more.

The two people who have been there in most of the seasons are Saul and Carrie but it’s Max who is seen for the longest time. What would you say about that character?

I think he’s an incredible example of an actor who turned a part that could have been easily dismissed into something really specific and substantial. And he was playing somebody on the autistic spectrum, which was never overtly articulated but he was consistent with his choices. It is really interesting to see somebody who is an analyst and is working on the detailing of this technology. It is also interesting to see that Carrie had a bipolar condition and also a brain that worked a little differently.

You also understand that it does not take an exceptional person to devote themselves to this kind of work. This was something that just happened naturally, nobody designed it. But it was really valuable and revealing of how that world works.

Carrie was asked to go the field and she agreed even though she knew it would be hard for her emotionally. Is it similar with you?

Yes. I know it’s taxing but I am so intimate with this imagined person now. And I’ve been carrying her with me for almost a decade and have been in this incredible company that is so exquisitely talented.

It’s a rare combination to work with people whom I trust, respect and admire so much and to work with something which is challenging and make me question something urgent and worthwhile. So I feel very conflicted. I also feel that the show is such that we could go on. I think of it like origami. It just gets reconfigured every season. And I also think it is providing a service that isn’t being provided very readily. It entertains people only to a certain extent as it stimulates conversation too. This is unique. There will be an absence. I will miss it, personally.

We had one extra season beyond what we were contracted to do and we all had to dig deep in order to produce it. But I can’t say much now because I’ve never made anything for this long. I had my family over the course of filming this. It’s been so profoundly defining for me. I’m still doing ADR. I have to go back and record what we’ve mucked up in 11 and 12. And we are doing press too. So I still feel very immersed and tethered at the same time. It’s going to hit me that it’s over around April when we would shoot the next season.

186,22-2-20,Indian batsmen falter on challenging track,"India’s top-order batsmen performed woefully on a challenging track as the side crawled to 122 for 5 with New Zealand’s towering pacer Kyle Jamieson rattling the visiting big guns on his debut on a rain-hit opening day of the first Test at Basin Reserve.

Friday’s play was called off after tea due to a heavy downpour, the gloomy conditions typifying India’s batting blues with only Ajinkya Rahane (38 batting off 122 balls) matching wares when it came to winning the mental battle.

The 6”8’ Jamieson could not have asked for a better start, picking up 3 for 38 in 14 overs and his prized scalps included two of India’s best long-form batsmen — skipper Virat Kohli (2) and the dogged Cheteshwar Pujara (14 off 42 balls).

He also took a lovely catch in the deep to cap off a day he will remember forever. What Jamieson did wonderfully well was mix up the back of the length stuff with fuller deliveries in between.

He bowled the natural back of the length deliveries that climbed on the batsmen, pegging them on backfoot.

He also mixed it up with fuller deliveries when the batsmen were just a tad unsure of their footwork.

Bowling at barely 130 kmph, he troubled the visitors making it easier for senior pros Tim Southee (1/27 in 14 overs) and Trent Boult (1/44 in 14 overs) to bowl a more probing line.

“The last couple of weeks has been pretty surreal. Pretty pleased and from a team perspective we’re in a pretty good position as well,” said Jamieson at the end of the day’s play.

Such was the disciplined effort from the Black Caps bowlers that India managed only 43 runs in the second session.

Rahane played 122 balls, hitting four boundaries on a heavy outfield. Rishabh Pant was at the other end on 10.

Mayank Agarwal (34 off 84 balls), who did the hard work of surviving the first session, was out after lunch as he tried a pull shot off Boult just after surviving a tough caught and bowled chance.

Hanuma Vihari (7) was Jamieson’s third victim when he edged a pitched up delivery.

Once Kane Williamson called it right under the overcast conditions, it was a challenge for the Indian batsmen.

Young Prithvi Shaw’s loose technique and tendency to close the bat face was always going to cost him.

Southee bowled one that looked like angling in and Shaw closed the bat face as the ball moved a shade away after pitching, brushing his pad and then the off-stump.

Pujara was ready to show a lot of patience as he started leaving deliveries outside the off-stump.

However, Jamieson, coming in as the second change, bowled his back of length delivery on the off-middle channel and he had no option but to jab at the rising delivery which kissed the outside edge of his bat and was taken by BJ Watling.

Kohli was playing Jamieson for the disconcerting bounce that he generated from back of the length but in between, the bowler decided to slip one fuller delivery on the fourth stump channel.

Kohli lunged into the drive and the thick edge was taken by the ‘100 Test man’ Ross Taylor, standing at the first slip compounding India’s troubles.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/indian-batsmen-falter-on-challenging-track.html

“Ganguly sent in the names to the BCB after we checked on the availability of the players. Kohli, Shami, Dhawan and Kuldeep will represent us in the Asia XI team. It has been a while since we sent the names because the Bangladesh board needed the list from BCCI to be able to prepare the Asian squad,” the source said.

Initially there were serious doubts on who all would be part of the Asia XI squad as Pakistan players form an integral part of cricket in the subcontinent and cricketing ties between India and Pakistan have hit a roadblock in recent years.

But BCCI Joint Secretary Jayesh George had clarified that there would be no Pakistan players invited for the match.

“What we are aware of is that there will be no Pakistan players in the Asia XI. That is what the message is, so, there is no question of both countries coming together or picking one over the other,” he had said.

But the Pakistan Cricket Board had clarified that it wasn’t about the BCB picking BCCI over PCB and it was a case of the Pakistan players being unavailable as they would be busy playing in the Pakistan Super League.

“The T20Is between World XI and Asia XI were scheduled from March 16-20, while the PSL 2020 is likely to end on March 22. Since dates of both the series couldn’t be changed, we offered our regrets to the BCB, both verbally and in writing, which they understood and accepted,” a PCB spokesperson said.

“It is unfortunate that the facts were twisted to mislead Pakistan cricket fans and followers.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kohli--shami--dhawan---kuldeep-to-be-part-of-asia-xi.html

l’pool Henderson out for 3 weeks

Liverpool: Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson will be sidelined for up to three weeks after suffering a hamstring injury against Atletico Madrid. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp revealed the time-frame for Henderson's injury: “We heard of different hamstring injuries now around in the Premier League, Harry Kane, for example,” said Klopp. “It's not that bad. But he will be out, I think, for three weeks or so, which is not cool. But how we see it, we were still lucky. That's it.”

Women''s IPL matches likely in Jaipur

jaipur: Jaipur is likely to host the Women's IPL matches once again this year. “There would be seven matches between four teams in the women's IPL and Jaipur is likely to host them,” a senior official associated with the cash-rich T20 league said on Friday. Last year, too, Jaipur had hosted the matches of the Women's IPL, when three teams had featured in the tournament. Matches in Jaipur are played at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, though a final decision on it is yet to be taken. Meanwhile, the official also confirmed that the All Star match, which was scheduled to be held before the IPL, will now take place after it.

kante suffers injury setback

London: N'Golo Kante will be sidelined for three weeks after suffering a muscle injury against Manchester United, Chelsea coach Frank Lampard said. Blues boss Lampard does not expect to have the France midfielder back until March. “N'Golo is not fit, he has a muscle injury, similar to the one he picked up against Arsenal; hopefully three weeks, something around that,” Lampard told reporters. Kante's absence is a blow for Chelsea as they head into a crucial period featuring this weekend's showdown with top four rivals Tottenham and Tuesday's Champions League last 16 first leg against Bayern Munich. Chelsea also have an FA Cup fifth round date with Liverpool on March 3 and Kante will not be back for that.

Goian returns to end Mumbai dreams

Mumbai: Mumbai City FC suffered a heart-break in the most poetic form when Lucian Goian scored the winner against his former club to help Chennaiyin FC qualify for the Indian Super League playoffs after a tightly-contested clash on Friday. Clear-cut chances were few and far between in what was an intense contest that saw Mumbai City reduced to 10-men in the second half. But Goian's 83rd-minute strike was enough for Chennaiyin to win the contest 1-0 and complete the ISL play- off lineup. Mumbai City end the league stage in the fifth spot with 26 points.

189,22-2-20,Fighting India lose 3-4 to Aus,"India fought hard before losing 3-4 to defending champions Australia in their first match of the two-leg FIH Pro League encounter here on Friday.

Making their debut in the second season of the FIH Pro League, the Indians displayed their potential by claiming five points from a possible six against the Netherlands before claiming another three in a stunning 2-1 victory over Belgium, the reigning World and European champions. The Red Lions bounced back with a 3-2 win in the second match.

But the hosts were made to toil hard by the world No 2 Australia before eventually losing the match in a close encounter.

Dylan Wotherspoon (6th minute), Tom Wickham (18th), Lachlan Sharp (41st) and Jacob Anderson (42nd) scored four field goals for the winners.

India’s goals came from the sticks of Raj Kumar Pal (36th, 47th) and Rupinder Pal Singh (52nd).

By virtue of this win, Australia moved up to the third position in the standings with nine points from five games, while India are a rung behind with eight points from as many matches.

Australia showed why they are considered as one of most ruthless hockey teams in the world, taking the lead with the first chance of the match in the sixth minute with Wotherspoon deflecting home Sharp’s perfect pass from close range after an excellent break from skipper Aran Zalewski.

Wickham doubled Australia’s advantage with a cool finish from close range, tapping home a perfectly weighted pass from Eddie Ockenden in the 18th minute, much to the disappointment of the home team.

The Kookaburras went into the breather with a two goal advantage.

Five minutes into the third quarter, India earned a penalty corner but Rupinder’s drag-flick was brilliantly thwarted by Jake Harvie.

A minute later, the hosts pulled a goal back when Raj Kumar scored from a rebound after Rupinder’s initial flick from a penalty corner was blocked by Australia goalkeeper Andrew Charter.

But Australia kept up the pressure and scored twice in a span of two minutes to take a comfortable 4-1 lead.

The Indians didn’t give up and reduced the margin four minutes later when Raj Kumar scored a fine field goal, his second of the day.

Eight minutes from the final hooter, Rupinder gave India hope after converting a penalty corner to make the scoreline 3-4.

The Indians got a golden opportunity in the final minute of the game when they were awarded a penalty corner but a Rupinder Singh try went wide of the target.

Tendulkar’s final Test in Mumbai against the West Indies in November 2013 also became the last of the 33-year-old Ojha’s career and the one in which he was named man of the match.

He went out of favour after that but did not give any reasons for his decision to call it quits now. In all, he played 24 Tests between 2009 and 2013 in which he took 113 wickets.

“It’s time I move on to the next phase of my life...I am writing this letter to tender my formal retirement from international and first-class cricket with immediate effect,” Ojha posted on his Twitter account.

“To be an Indian cricketer and represent the country at the highest level was always a dream I cherished as a youngster.

191,22-2-20,Poonam spins Oz out,"Yadav’s 4/19 & Shikha’s 3/14 take India to resounding win over defending champions in T20 WC opener

Leg-spinner Poonam Yadav bowled a magical spell in her comeback game to steer India to a comfortable 17-run win over defending champions Australia in the opening match of the Women’s T20 World Cup here on Friday.

Put in to bat, India struggled to a below par 132 before Poonam (4/19 in 4 overs) foxed the Aussies with her googlies, turning the match decisively into her team’s favour.

Australia, who have won the competition four times in six editions, were all out for 115 in 19.5 overs

“A bowler like Poonam is someone who leads from the front. We were expecting a great comeback from her. Our team is looking nice, earlier we depended on two-three players,” India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur said after the match.

Poonam, who missed the preceding tri-series due to a hand injury, also got good support from other bowlers including pacer Shikha Pandey.

The 28-year-old from Agra was on a hat-trick but narrowly missed out as wicketkeeper Taniya Bhatia dropped a difficult chance.

The tournament-opener saw a record 13,000 plus attendance with a sizeable chunk supporting India.

India next play against Bangladesh in Perth on February 24.

“It was great for me to come back from injury and perform like this. It was the third time that I was on a hat-trick but satisfied that I was able to do the job for the team,” said Poonam at the post-match presentation.

Australia were off to a good start to their chase with opener Alyssa Healy making a 35-ball 51, laced with six boundaries and a six.

However, Indian spinners led by Poonam triggered a collapse as Australia suddenly slipped to 82 for six.

Poonam (4/19) snapped four wickets, two in successive deliveries in the 12th over, to break the back of Australia’s chase.

Ashleigh Gardner (34 off 36) tried her bit but didn’t get any support from the other end.

Earlier, India squandered a flying start to end up with a below-par total.

Sixteen-year-old Shafali Verma took India to 40 for no loss in four overs with a typically aggressive 29 off 15 balls but her fall derailed the innings as the other batters disappointed.

Deepti Sharma made a composed 46-ball 49 in the second half of the innings but the firepower that India needed in the death overs was badly missing.

India were cruising initially with Shafali taking the opposition to the cleaners, hitting five fours and a six.

However, left-arm spinner Jess Jonassen (2/24) snapped two quick wickets, Smriti Mandhana (10 off 11) and Harmanpreet (2 off 5) to reduce India to 47 for three.

Deepti then shared 53 runs with Jemimah Rodrigues (26 off 33) to bring up the 100 in the 16th over.

For Australia, Ellyse Perry (1/15) and Delissa Kimmince (1/24) were the other wicket-takers.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/poonam-spins-oz-out-2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/poonam-spins-oz-out.html
192,22-2-20,DeChambeau leads by one as birdies abound at WGC Mexico Championship,"Bryson DeChambeau put on a putting clinic on the way to an eight-under par 63 and a one-shot lead in the WGC Mexico Championship over Erik van Rooyen and Patrick Reed.

America's DeChambeau rolled in 143 feet of putts as he built a 36-hole total of 11-under par 131 at Club de Golf Chapultepec.

Former Masters champion Reed was also red-hot on the greens on the way to a 63 that put him at 10-under alongside South Africa's van Rooyen -- who had nine birdies without a bogey in a 62 on his 30th birthday.

World number one Rory McIlroy came alive late on the way to a two-under par 69 that put him two off the lead alongside Japan's Hideki Matsuyama and American Justin Thomas.

Matsuyama was 11-under for the tournament after posting nine birdies in his first 15 holes, but two late bogeys saw him sign for a seven-under par 64.

Thomas was atop the leaderboard at 10-under after his eagle at his 10th hole of the day -- the first -- but eventually signed for a 66.

DeChambeau's fireworks on the greens included a 46-foot birdie putt at the seventh, which followed a 26-footer at No. 6.

DeChambeau had teed off on 10 and rolled in a six-footer for his first birdie of the day at 11. He didn't miss a put from within 10 feet and strung together four birdies in a row from the 18th through the third.

""It was a lot of fun,"" said DeChambeau, a three-time winner on the US PGA Tour.

""When you have days like that you can't help but smile out there. Making those putts the way I did, striking the ball like I did, it was surely a joy out there.""

DeChambeau said his 13-foot birdie putt at the 18th was the real momentum-builder.

""When this putt rolled in perfectly I just felt super-confident on the greens,"" he said.

The monster on number seven -- which saw him tie his career best with nine birdies in the round -- was just a bonus.

""I just threw my hands in the air,"" DeChambeau said.

""I mean, come on -- who thinks I'm going to make this one?"" Reed was similarly impressive with the putter, posting a burst of four straight birdies on the front nine and notching five more birdies coming home.

Birthday birdies

Van Rooyen, who won his maiden European Tour title at last year's Scandinavian Open, admitted he was feeling ""really old"" when he woke up on his 30th birthday.

The mood was more celebratory when he walked off 18 having nabbed his ninth birdie of the day.

""What a way to kick off the 30s,"" he said, ""little bit of a gift to myself."" McIlroy never quite found his way onto the birdie bandwagon.

The overnight leader by two, McIlroy was one-over through nine and didn't make his first birdie of the day until the 12th.

He promptly gave the shot back, but birdied 14 to get himself back to even par for the day.

With a 16-foot birdie at 16 and a 24-footer at 17 McIlroy kept himself in the hunt for a title that saw him complete his collection of the prestigious World Golf Championships titles.

He won the WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai in November to go with the WGC Match Play he won in 2015 and the WGC Invitational he nabbed at Firestone in 2014.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dechambeau-leads-by-one-as-birdies-abound-at-wgc-mexico-championship-2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dechambeau-leads-by-one-as-birdies-abound-at-wgc-mexico-championship.html

194,22-2-20,"Jota, Kamada hit Europa hat-tricks","Diogo Jota of Wolves and Daichi Kamada of Eintracht Frankfurt hit hat-tricks, but the man at the heart of the most remarkable Europa League display had a familiar name: Ianis Hagi, who inspired an unlikely Rangers fightback.

In the first leg of the round-of-32 on Thursday, Wolves beat Espanyol 4-0, Eintracht beat Salzburg 4-1 and Rangers beat Braga 3-2 at Ibrox.

Arsenal won 1-0 at Olympiakos and, in early games, Manchester United drew 1-1 away to Club Brugge and Celtic’s visit to Copenhagen finished with the same score.

In a battle between two European heavyweights Bayer Leverkusen held off Porto 2-1.

Jota, who hit three in the last pool game in November and had not scored since, struck the first from close range, the second from a narrow angle and the third from outside the area.

Ruben Neves hit a typically spectacular volley and Wolves crushed the club struggling at the bottom of La Liga.

In Frankfurt, Kamada, a 23-year-old Japanese midfielder, hit the first after 12 minutes. Two minutes before the break he broke from the halfway line to score a second. He added a third with a header in the 53rd minute.

Also in the mixed doubles semifinals, Sharath and Manika Batra take on German duo of Patrick Franziska & Petrissa Solja.

On Thursday, Sharath and Sathiyan had beaten home favourites Nandor Ecseki and Adam Szudi in the quarterfinals, after having sent the Japanese pair of Shunsuke Togami and Yukia Uda packing in previous round.

As for Sharath and Manika, they got a walkover in the quarterfinals from the second-seeded Japanese pair of Jun Mizutani and Mima Ito after Mizutani pulled out because of a neck injury he suffered during his singles event.

196,22-2-20,Sakshi handed chance to book slot for Asian Olympic Qualifiers,"Sakshi Malik’s dream to compete at the Tokyo Games is still alive with Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) deciding to hold fresh trials in two categories to pick women wrestlers for the Asian Olympic Qualifiers.

Two-time Cadet World champion Sonam Malik had defeated Sakshi during the 62kg trials but since she could not win a medal at the Asian Championship, the WFI has given Sakshi one more chance to book her place in the Indian team.

The Asian Qualifying event will be held in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan from March 27 to 29. The event was originally scheduled to be held in Xian but was moved out due to outbreak of Coronavirus in China.

“We have made a decision. The trials will be held in 62kg and 76kg on February 26 in Lucknow for women. These are the only categories which could not win any medal. We have also decided to hold fresh trials for 60kg category in Greco Roman style,” said WFI Assistant Secretary Vinod Tomar.

The WFI had made it clear before the start of the championship that if required, it may hold fresh trials in categories where the performance will not be up to the mark.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sakshi-handed-chance-to-book-slot-for-asian-olympic-qualifiers.html
197,22-2-20,Sakshi settles for Silver; Vinesh takes Bronze,"Exploiting a weaker field, Sakshi Malik claimed a Silver while Vinesh Phogat dominated her Bronze medal play-off after losing to nemesis Mayu Mukaida as Indian women team registered its best-ever performance at the senior Asian Wrestling Championship, returning with eight medals here on Friday.

The Indian team had won only one Gold medal before this edition but Divya, Pinki and Sarita Mor won three on the opening day. Nirmala Devi came out second best.

On Friday, Sakshi (65kg, Silver), Vinesh (53kg, Bronze) young Anshu Malik (57kg Bronze) and Gursharan Preet kaur (72kg, Bronze) added to India’s tally.

Sakshi twice lost to Japan’s Naomi Ruike — in the opening round and the final — to win her second Silver at this event. She had grabbed a Silver in 2017 also.

The Rio Olympic Bronze medallist Sakshi, who has been struggling of late, lost her opening round 1-2 to Naomi and could not score a point in final, which she lost 0-2.

“She was not that strong but I just could not score many points against her. Initially I lost two points and that pegged me back,” she said.

Sakshi overcame two weak opponents to eventually reach the final. She outplayed Korea’s Ohyoung Ha in her second round, winning by technical superiority. In her semifinal against Uzbekistan’s Nabira Esenbaeva, she led 5-0 but her rival pulled off consecutive two-point moves to make it 5-4.

Sakshi has been losing in closing stages of late but this time she managed to hold on to her narrow lead, surviving anxious last two seconds.

All eyes were on Vinesh, who yet again fell to Muakida to go out of the Gold medal race but made a strong comeback to win then Bronze medal play-off against Vietnam’s Thi Ly Kieu, winning by technical superiority in the first period itself.

“Obviously I am not happy but I am making progress. It’s not easy to beat experienced Japanese in this category. I have lost but I tried a few things and it worked a bit. Earlier I had not even scored a point against her but this time I got two. The gap is not much now, it’s 70-100 between Mukaida and myself,” Vinesh said.

Vinesh had lost twice to Mukaida in 2019 — at World Championship and Asian Championships — and the trend continued as the gritty Indian yet again struggled to break the strong defence of the Japanese.

In a tough opening round, Vinesh tried single leg attacks a number of times but every time Mukaida blocked her move and eventually got the upper body lock to subdue the home favourite.

Vinesh has won a medal at every Asian Championship since 2013.

Out of India’s two brightest youngsters, it was Anshu who bagged a Bronze while Sonam Malik (62kg) , who was pitted against some heavyweights lost her Bronze medal play-off.

Anshu opened up her campaign against Kyrgyzstan’s Nuraida Anarkulova, winning by technical superiority but was outplayed by reigning world champion from Japan Riskao Kawai.

She then beat Sevara Eshmuratova from Uzbekistan to win her first medal at senior level.

“I had nothing to lose and every thing to gain. I now know where I stand when I am competing against seasoned wrestlers in this category. I have got richer in experience,” said the 18-year-old.

Sonam, who had defeated Sakshi in the trials, showed good tactical mind in her resounding win against Korea’s Hanbit Lee and also in the 2-5 defeat against world bronze medallist Yukako Kawai.

Up against world champion Aisuluu Tynbekova, it was a tough ask for her to get bronze but she fought well before losing.

Gujarat pacers then removed both the Goa openers on nought before the visiting team recovered to end the day at 46 for two.

Kalaria (118 not out off 185 balls; 14x4s, 1x6) and Axar Patel (80 off 113 balls; 11x4) built on the foundation laid by skipper Parthiv Patel, who scored his 27th first class hundred on the opening day of the match on Thursday to put the hosts in the driver’s seat.

Resuming at the overnight score of 330 for four, the home team suffered two jolts as Goa's right-arm medium-pacer Felix Alemao (3/86) struck with the second new ball, dismissing both the overnight batsmen (Patel and Chirag Gandhi).

The two wickets gave Goa a chance to fight its way back into the game, but Axar and Kalaria had other plans.

The duo put on 130 runs for the seventh wicket to dash the visiting team’s hopes of restricting Gujarat.

The hosts declared their innings at 602 for eight after Chintan Gaja (56) was dismissed.

Bengal make late inroads

Tangi: Odisha let the opportunity slip in the final hour, losing three wickets in quick time as Bengal took an upperhand.

Fighting half-centuries from opener Shantanu Mishra (62) and Debasish Samantray (68) frustrated Bengal bowlers after their first innings folded for 332.

But a lapse in concentration from Samantray, who chased a widish delivery, triggered the collapse as Bengal seamer Nilkantha Das finally ended their dogged 125-run partnership, which came off 317 balls.

Saurashtra post 419

Ongole: A dogged century by Chirag Jani (121 off 297 balls, 12x4s) and his 157-run seventh-wicket partnership with Perak Mankad (80) helped Saurashtra pile up 419 in the first innings against Andhra.

Skipper Jaydev Unadkat removed Andhra opener D B Prasanth (1) and Jyothisaikrishna (17) to leave the host at 40 for two from 22 overs at stumps, still trailing by 379 runs.

Resuming at the overnight score of 226 for six, Jani (on 53) and Mankad (80, 177 balls, 8 fours) frustrated the Andhra bowlers and were still at the crease at lunch.

They defied the attack led by Y Prithvi Raj (3/51) and scored whenever presented with the opportunity.

Jani reached his ton from 249 balls. Though it was a slow knock, it helped Saurashtra recover from 140 for five to post a big score.

This season, Jani has scored 427 runs in eight matches with two centuries and one fifty.

Mankad too complemented Jani well and helped the visitors’ cause.

For the home team, left-arm medium-pacer Prithvi Raj and right-arm medium-pacer K V Sashikanth picked up three wickets each.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kalaria---s-ton-puts-gujarat-in-command.html

200,22-2-20,'China delaying permission to India to send flight carrying relief materials to Wuhan',"China is delaying grant of clearance to India's proposal to send an Indian Air Force flight to carry relief material for people affected by coronavirus in the neighbouring country and bring back Indians from its city of Wuhan, official sources said Saturday.

India was to send a C-17 military transport aircraft to Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, on February 20 but the plane could not take off as permission was not granted for the flight.

""China is deliberately delaying grant of clearance for the evacuation flight,"" a high-level source said.

The aircraft was to carry a large consignment of medical supplies to China and bring back more Indians from Wuhan.

Sources said the Chinese side continued to maintain that there was no delay in granting permission for the flight to go, but ""inexplicably"" the clearance has not been given.

In a letter to President Xi Jinping earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveyed India's solidarity to the people and government of China in meeting the challenge of the coronavirus outbreak and offered to provide assistance to the country.

India then put together relief supplies in pursuance of Modi's commitment as a token of India's solidarity, particularly in the 70th year of the anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

""These supplies have been offered even as India faces tremendous shortage itself, given our ethos of helping others in their hour of need,"" said a source aware of the issue.

The items being supplied are gloves, surgical masks, feeding pumps and defibrillators based on the requirements as indicated by the Chinese side.

India's national carrier Air India has already evacuated around 640 Indians from Wuhan in two separate flights.

According to estimates, over 100 Indians are still living in Wuhan. A sizeable number of countries have evacuated their citizens from China and restricted movement of people and goods to and from the country in view of the massive outbreak of coronavirus there.

Indian nationals in Wuhan continue their long wait for the flight. The delay is causing them and their family members in India tremendous mental anguish, said the sources.

They said relief and evacuation flights from other countries including by France are allowed to operate by China but the permission has not come through in India's case.

""Are they not interested in Indian aid provided as our token of support? Why are they creating roadblock in evacuating our nationals from Wuhan and putting them under hardship and mental agony?"" said a person aware of the issue.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-china-delaying-permission-to-india-to-send-flight-carrying-relief-materials-to-wuhan--2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/-china-delaying-permission-to-india-to-send-flight-carrying-relief-materials-to-wuhan-.html
201,22-2-20,Hindi connects large part of India together: Adityanath,"Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said Hindi has connected large parts of the country together and has become a big medium of employment.

""Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, understood the importance of Hindi and advocated its promotion across the entire world,"" he said, addressing the inaugural ceremony of 'Bhasha Mahotsav -2020"" programme at Lucknow University here.

""Prime Minister Narendra Modi today addresses people in Hindi on global platforms. He emotionally connects the entire world to India,"" said the chief minister.

Talking of the growing importance of Hindi, the Chief Minister said, ""People from different countries come today to India and learn Hindi for communication. Earlier we had to communicate to them only in English. This is a new beginning.""

""Hindi today has become a big medium of employment. It has also connected together large parts of the country,"" he said.

""With the help of Sanskrit and practical knowledge of Hindi and English, we can generate employment opportunities for many people,"" he said.

The chief minister also talked of the need of setting up a 'Bhasha University' for Indian languages, saying the university ""needs to prepare courses and supply chains according to the demand"".

202,22-2-20,Trump aims high in India,"Will make tremendous trade deal, says US President

Days ahead of his India visit, US President Donald Trump on Thursday said the two countries could make a “tremendous” trade deal.

“We’re going to India, and we may make a tremendous deal there,” Trump said in his commencement address at the Hope for Prisoners Graduation Ceremony in Las Vegas.

Trump, accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump, is scheduled to travel to Ahmedabad, Agra and New Delhi on February 24 and 25.

Ahead of the visit, there have been talks about India and the United States agreeing on a trade package as a precursor to a major trade deal. During his commencement address, Trump indicated that the talks on this might slowdown if he did not get a good deal.

“Maybe we’ll slow down. We’ll do it after the election. I think that could happen too. So, we’ll see what happens... But we’re only making deals if they’re good deals because we’re putting America first. Whether people like it or not, we’re putting America first,” Trump said.

Bilateral India-US trade in goods and services is about three per cent of the US’ world trade. In a recent report, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) said the trading relationship is more consequential for India — in 2018 the United States was its second largest goods export market (16.0 per cent share) after the European Union (EU, 17.8 per cent), and third largest goods import supplier (6.3 per cent) after China (14.6 per cent) and the EU 28 (10.2 per cent).

“The Trump Administration takes issue with the US trade deficit with India, and has criticised India for a range of ‘unfair’ trading practices,” the CRS said.

“Indian Prime Minister Modi’s first term fell short of many observers’ expectations, as India did not move forward with anticipated market opening reforms, and instead increased tariffs and trade restrictions,” it said.

“Modi’s strong electoral mandate may embolden the Indian Government to press ahead with its reform agenda with greater vigour. Slowing economic growth in India raises concerns about its business environment,” CRS said.

As per a fact sheet issued by the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), trade in goods and services between the two countries from 1999 to 2018 surged from $16 billion to $142 billion.

India is now the United States’ eighth-largest trading partner in goods and services and is among the world’s largest economies. India’s trade with the United States now resembles, in terms of volume, the US’ trade with South Korea ($167 billion in 2018) or France ($129 billion), said Alyssa Ayres from CFR.

“The United States for two years now has set out in stone pretty clearly the things that they wanted to see to try to get an agreement, and it’s basically then on India’s doorstep on whether they want to take those steps,” said Rick Rossow, Wadhwani Chair in US-India Policy Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank.

“The list of US asks has been pretty static all throughout. Not to say that any of these things are easy for India to do, but the United States to my knowledge didn’t change the goalposts just because we now consider India to be a middle-income country. The things that we wanted to see happen to get this trade agreement have been pretty static all throughout, no matter how difficult they are,” he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-aims-high-in-india-2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/trump-aims-high-in-india.html

204,22-2-20,Shaheen Bagh blinks,"Protesters agree to open parallel road if security is guaranteed

The talks between the Supreme Court-appointed interlocutors and the Shaheen Bagh protesters yielded partial results on Friday, the third day of the negotiation, as the protesters agreed to open the parallel road if the SC can guarantee their security at the protest site.

The interlocutors — senior advocates Sanjay Hegde and Sadhana Ramachandran — resumed talks with the protesters on the third day on Friday evening.

A woman protester said, “We want in writing that if there is a single incident of attack or firing, the police officials, from the SHO to the police commissioner, should be shunted out. Home Minister Amit Shah has said the NRC is not coming soon, so ask him to issue a circular, saying they are not bringing the NRC now. We want the SC to pass an order on our security if the road adjoining the protest site is opened.”

Hegde said, “Today is Shivratri. If somebody uses a cuss word, it becomes a blessing today. It is your right to speak. Speak up. Say everything you want to say. Let us take a joint decision for all the affected parties here.”

The protesters told the interlocutors that the police had first barricaded the road parallel to the sit-in site, and then they occupied the parallel road erecting “India Gate” replica and a huge map of India.

The Delhi Police admitted that initially they had blocked the road opposite to the sit-in road for safety and security of the protesters. “We barricaded the parallel road to ensure security to the protest site. If the road is opened to commuters, we will ensure double security to the protesters,” the police official said.

As the interlocutors called the police to the spot to discuss the matter with the protesters, a woman stood up and told the mediators, “The Government thinks women are uneducated. All of us are educated women who know what we are fighting for. The students from Jamia Millia Islamia, who were teaching us more on CAA and NRC, are being beaten up. If the police could not stop the men who fired at us, how are they claiming that they will protect us if the parallel road is opened?”

Another woman protester said, “When several adjoining roads are open, why are they insisting us to move from this road? This is not the only road connecting Delhi to Noida.”

Ramachandran said, “When we checked on the roads, we noticed that you (protesters) were right. Many roads are open, which were blocked by the police. I am very upset to say that the Noida-Faridabad road, which was opened on Friday, was again closed by the police. Whoever has done this is now answerable to the SC.”

The restrictions are a “conscious” decision of the Noida Police and are continuing as it is, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Noida Traffic) Rajesh S told PTI. He added that the day, the Delhi Police decides to lift the restrictions, “We will also do it on our side”.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shaheen-bagh-blinks-2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/shaheen-bagh-blinks.html
205,22-2-20,"Uddhav allays CAA, NPR apprehensions after meeting Modi","Against the backdrop of his simmering differences on a host of issues with the Congress and the NCP, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday, his first visit to Delhi after taking up the reins of the State.

Uddhav’s son Aditya Thackeray, who is a Minister in his Cabinet, accompanied him, during his meeting with Modi.

After the meeting, Uddhav said, “I had a good discussion with the Prime Minister over issues concerning Maharashtra. I also discussed the CAA, NPR and NRC with the PM. No one needs to fear about the CAA. The NPR is not going to throw anyone out of the country,” Uddhav said.

He also denied that there was any friction among the constituents of the Maha Aghadi, while asserting that the Maharashtra Government will complete its five-year term.

The Congress and the NCP are reportedly miffed over the Chief Minister’s stand on NPR and CAA. He also said the Prime Minister had assured him of extending all cooperation to the Maharashtra Government.

After Modi, Uddhav met Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi at her residence at 10, Janpath.

In his meeting with Sonia, Udhhav is believed to have told the Congress president not to pay any heed to rumour about stability of the Government and assured her that the Shiv Sena-NCP and Congress alliance regime will last full five years.

Sources said Sonia also sought to know the Shiv Sena views on CAA, NRC and wanted that there should be clarity on them.

Udhhav also conveyed to the Congress leadership about the berths going to fall vacant in the Rajya Sabha and that there should be a separate meeting of top leaders to discuss the representation of the alliance in the upper house.

Before the meet, senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut played down Thackeray’s interaction with Modi. “Yes, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will meet PM Modi. This is only a meeting, nothing else should be read into it. Jai Maharashtra,” he tweeted in Marathi.

Barely months after the Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP formed a Government in Maharashtra, rifts among the three alliance partners have come to the surface. Contrary to the NCP and Congress’s stand on the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Population Register, Uddhav Thackeray earlier this week extended his support to the two exercises.

“The CAA and the NRC (National Register of Citizens) are different and NPR is different. No one has to worry if the CAA gets implemented,” he had said.

“The NRC is not there and will not be implemented in the State... The Centre has not discussed NRC as of now,” he added.

Nationalist Congress chief Sharad Pawar, who had a crucial role in bringing together the Sena and the Congress, said on Tuesday they will discuss the matter with Uddhav Thackeray’s party and bring it on the same page. “We will convince the Sena,” he said. Another point of disagreement in the Maharashtra alliance is the Elgar Parishad case, which has been handed over to the National Investigation Agency. Pawar has claimed the case was transferred the day State Ministers met police officers.

Shortly after Pawar’s remarks, Thackeray tweeted that he will ensure a related probe into the Koregaon-Bhima violence is not taken over by the Centre.

Over the last few weeks, there have been some awkward moments in the Maharashtra coalition after Chief Minister Uddhav asserted that he did not see anything wrong with implementing the national population register. It is a stand that contradicts the Congress position, which counts the population register as the big step towards the National Register of Citizens.

Several States ruled by non-NDA parties have already declared that they will not implement the population register. Congress leaders have indicated that it would be embarrassing if the Maharashtra Government goes ahead to implement NPR.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/uddhav-allays-caa--npr-apprehensions-after-meeting-modi-2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/uddhav-allays-caa--npr-apprehensions-after-meeting-modi.html
206,22-2-20,VHP model to be tweaked for grandeur Ram Mandir,"Height of temple to be raised to 160 feet, it will be 3-storey now

The map prepared by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) some 30 years ago for building a grand Ram temple at Ayodhya could be altered slightly to raise the height of the proposed structure from 125 feet to 160 feet and add an additional third floor.

Nripendra Mishra, the head of the temple construction committee, will hold discussion with experts to finalise the temple’s design, plan for all construction-related works, including its start date.

For his part, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked members of the newly constituted Ram temple trust to ensure that construction work is conducted harmoniously and without any bitterness, Trust’s general secretary Champat Rai said on Friday.

On Thursday, members of the Ram Janmabhoomi Teerath Kshetra Trust, including general secretary Champat Rai, Vimlendra Mohan Pratap Mishra and Anil Mishra, met Nripendra Mishra during which they discussed various issues related to the construction of the proposed temple.

Earlier, the VHP insisted for the model based on the old design. In 1987, architect Chandrakant Sompura had prepared a model of the proposed temple on being asked by then VHP international president Ashok Singhal. “The temple will be built on the basis of the VHP’s map. There can be changes to its proposed shape and scale,” Swami Govind Dev Giri, a member of the Trust, told PTI.

Another member of the Trust said, “We have received suggestions to make changes to the old map in order to give an ever grander form to the proposed temple. Now, we are brainstorming on building a three-storey structure instead of the two-storey proposed earlier, as well as adding a pavilion and detailing to the 35-feet-high ‘shikhar’.”

The height of the proposed temple could also be increased to 160 feet from 125 feet decided earlier by the VHP, he said.

The proposed Ram Temple is expected to be built in Lord Vishnu’s favourite octagonal shape and its structure will be made completely with stone without the use of iron in the elevation. Approximately 1.75 lakh cubic feet stone will be required to build the temple. The temple construction work can take over three years, the sources said.

The VHP’s map proposes the temple to have a length of 270 feet, breadth of 135 feet and height of 125 feet. Every floor will have 106 pillars and will be supported by 185 beams. The temple doors will be made of wood and will be attached to marble frames. While the ground floor will have a Ram idol, the first floor will house a Ram Darbar. There will also be a garbha graha (sanctum sanctorium) with a sitting area for the priests. The temple will have five entrances -- the Sinh Dwar and at the Nritya Mandap, Rang Mandap, pooja kaksh (prayer area) and garbh graha (sanctum sanctorum).

President of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Mahant Nritya Gopal Das and three other members called on the Prime Minister at his residence here on Thursday and invited him to visit Ayodhya for the ‘bhumi pujan’.

Though a date for the ceremony is not finalised it is widely believed that construction ceremony (bhumi pujan) is expected to be conducted on Ram Navami day - April 2.

Describing it as a courtesy meeting, Rai said the Prime Minister also said nothing should be done to disturb the atmosphere of the country.

The Vishwa Hindu Parishad is also working on celebrations for a ‘RamoUtsav’, in the run-up to Ram Navami, from March 25 till April 8. VHP workers will reach out to all 2.75 lakh villages which had contributed for the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, the organisation’s members said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/vhp-model-to-be-tweaked-for-grandeur-ram-mandir-2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/vhp-model-to-be-tweaked-for-grandeur-ram-mandir.html
207,22-2-20,ITBP boss starts 100-km march to promote Fit India,"Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) chief SS Deswal, undoubtedly one of the most physically fit paramilitary bosses, began a 100-km speed march on Friday with senior officers from Bikaner district’s Mehrasar to Jodhpur in Rajasthan.

The route includes more than 25 km desert and many other stretches, including undulating terrains and off-track routes. The march is aimed at promoting “Fit India” movement and fitness among masses in general. Deswal, 58, has undertaken dozens of long route and speed marches in the Himalayas and on seaside of the country in the last one year.

The routes undertaken on the Himalayan range by him include Lipulekh Pass, Sangla Valley (103 KM), Auli Tapovan and Gangotri Tapovan, among others.

“The march is aimed at spreading the ‘Fit India’ mission and to promote the youth to engage in more physical exercises to remain fit,” said ITBP spokesperson Vivek Pandey.

The trek record of Deswal includes 30 km around Bhrigu Lake in Himachal Pradesh and touched the highest point at 14,100 ft, Amarnath Yatra route (42 km, highest point: 14,500 ft), Lipulekh Pass (30 km, highest point: 17,060 km), Sangla Valley, Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh (103 km, highest point: 15,000 ft) and Mussoorie (Distance covered: 42 km, highest point: 6,800 ft).

Other trekking areas covered by Deswal are Auli Tapovan (Highest point: 13,000 ft, Distance: 35 km), Puri-Konark Sea Beach (52 km), Gangotri-Gaumukh-Tapovan- (15,000 ft, 46 km), Dhanushkodi, Tamil Nadu (32 km) and Alwar (42 km).

The rural trek route in Bikaner and Jodhpur districts being covered by Deswal on Monday and Tuesday will entail a journey of 100 km in 24 hours.

Deswal’s accomplishments in the last one year range from over a dozen long route trek routes from the Himalayas to the sea shores. He walks with short time staging points. He walks at a speed of 4 to 5 KM per hour.

“The DG never uses lift in multi-storey buildings at Force Headquarters and motivates others for the same. He walks with the in-service courses of Inspectors General and Deputy Inspectors General throughout the stretch of 42 km around the training academy,” a senior official said.

The DG is undeterred by the forces of nature. He started his trekking in Mussoorie at 5 am in the morning when the temperature was minus one degree. He is known to begin the trekking sessions in the Himalayas early in the morning around 4 am, Pandey said, adding such a case of leading by example by the Force’s chief is an important motivational factor for the rank and file of the paramilitary.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/itbp-boss-starts-100-km-march-to-promote-fit-india-2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/itbp-boss-starts-100-km-march-to-promote-fit-india.html

Apparently mindful of the dissidence that comes to the fore ahead of the elections with many aspirants not being considered for tickets, Nadda said, ""Always do remember, politics is a serious full-time job where there is an entry point but no exit.""

215,22-2-20,US planning to ink peace deal with Taliban on February 29,"The United States is preparing to sign a deal with the Taliban on February 29, building on an agreement on reducing violence across Afghanistan, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday.

“Upon a successful implementation of this understanding, signing of the US-Taliban agreement is expected to move forward,” he said in a statement released after visiting Saudi Arabia.

A week-long “reduction in violence” between the Taliban, the US and Afghan security forces will commence shortly, Afghanistan’s National Security Council spokesman Javed Faisal told AFP on Friday.

The partial truce will mark a historic step in more than 18 years of gruelling conflict in Afghanistan and would pave the way for a deal that could, ultimately, see the war end.

Pompeo said that intra-Afghan negotiations would begin shortly after the February 29 signing, expected to take place in Doha.

They will “build on this fundamental step to deliver a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire and the future political roadmap for Afghanistan,” he said.

The US top diplomat said that challenges remain, but that progress made so far “provides hope and represents a real opportunity. The United States calls on all Afghans to seize this moment”.

Meanwhile Pakistan on Friday welcomed the proposed US-Taliban agreement, hoping that all parties would now seize this historic opportunity to bring a comprehensive and inclusive political settlement for durable peace and stability in the war-torn Afghanistan and the region.

Pakistan’s Foreign Office said the country has consistently supported direct negotiations between the US and Taliban. “From the outset, Pakistan has facilitated this process and contributed to its progress thus far. We look forward to the signing of the agreement on February 29, 2020,” it said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/us-planning-to-ink-peace-deal-with-taliban-on-february-29.html
216,22-2-20,"South Korea reports 142 more coronavirus cases, total 346","South Korea reported 142 more coronavirus cases Saturday, the sharpest spike in infections yet, with more than half of the new cases linked to a hospital in a southern city.

The national toll of 346 is now the second-highest outside of China, with the jump in cases at a hospital in Cheongdo following a similar spike among members of a religious sect in the nearby city of Daegu.

Among the new cases, 92 were ""related"" to patients or staff at the hospital in Cheongdo, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

Authorities reported another death on Saturday, taking the toll to two. Both victims had been inpatients at the hospital.

More than 150 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus have also been infected, starting with a 61-year-old woman who developed a fever on February 10 but attended at least four services at the church's Daegu branch before being diagnosed.

The mayor of Daegu -- South Korea's fourth-biggest city, with a population of over 2.5 million -- has advised locals to stay indoors, while access to a major US military base in the area has been restricted.

Cheongdo, some 27 kilometres south of Daegu, is the birthplace of Shincheonji's founder Lee Man-hee.

County officials said Friday that a three-day funeral was held for his brother three weeks ago at a hall owned by the hospital.

Shincheonji is often accused of being a cult and claims its founder Lee has donned the mantle of Jesus Christ and will take 144,000 people with him to heaven on the day of judgement.

But with more church members than available places in heaven, they are said to have to compete for slots and pursue converts persistently and secretively.

President Moon Jae-in on Friday called for a ""thorough investigation"" of everyone who attended the funeral and Shincheonji services.

The central government on Friday had declared Daegu and Cheongdo ""special management zones"", with Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun saying the region would be supported with medical personnel, beds and equipment and the cabinet will meet three times a week to discuss the outbreak.

Authorities in Seoul banned public rallies at three main locations on health and safety grounds.

The US army garrison in Daegu -- where around 10,000 soldiers, civilians and family members live or work -- has restricted access and instructed any American troops who recently attended Shincheonji services to self-quarantine.

Shincheonji offered an apology, suspending its worship services and gatherings worldwide.

""We are deeply sorry that because of one of our members, who thought of her condition as a cold because she had not travelled abroad, led to many in our church being infected and thereby caused concern to the local community,"" it said in a statement.

But its leader Lee told his followers the outbreak had been ""caused by the Devil"" and compared it to the biblical testing of Job, Yonhap news agency reported.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/virus-cases-swell-in-south-korea-as-outbreak-shifts--spreads-2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/south-korea-reports-142-more-coronavirus-cases--total-346.html
217,22-2-20,"China's coronavirus death toll crosses 2,300, WHO team to visit Wuhan","The death toll in China's novel coronavirus climbed to 2,345 with 109 more deaths reported, while the confirmed cases rose to 76,288 as a team of WHO experts, currently in the country to investigate the COVID-19 outbreak, is expected to visit the worst-affected Wuhan city on Saturday, Chinese health officials said.

A total of 397 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported on Friday, while 109 deaths were reported from 31 provincial-level regions, Chinese health authority said on Saturday.

By the end of Friday, a total of 2,345 people died of the disease and 76,288 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection had been reported from all over the country, a daily report from the National Health Commission (NHC) said on Saturday.

Among the deaths, 106 were from the Hubei Province, the epicentre of the virus, one each from Hebei province, Shanghai and Xinjiang, it said.

Hubei Province reported 366 new confirmed cases and 106 new deaths on Friday, the provincial health commission said Saturday.

The latest report brought the total confirmed cases in the hard-hit province to 63,454, it said.

All over China, 20,659 patients infected with the virus have been discharged from hospital after recovery by the end of Friday, NHC said.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told media in Geneva on Friday that the WHO-led team of international experts, currently in China to investigate the coronavirus outbreak, will travel Wuhan on Saturday.

The 12-member team, which arrived in China on Monday, was initially designated to visit only Beijing, Guangdong and Sichuan provinces, while the worst-affected Hubei province and its capital Wuhan were missing from the list.

However, the team was finally given permission to visit Wuhan by the Chinese government.

Besides controlling the spread of the virus, a major task of the WHO team along with their Chinese counterparts was to come up with a standard medicine to cure the disease.

Tedros said WHO is also working with partners to safeguard the health of the members of the team and take appropriate measures when they return to their countries of origin.

The WHO team includes US specialists, according to Chinese officials.

Chinese President Xi Jinping warned the ruling Communist party officials on Friday that the virus is yet to peak as it has spread to prisons across the country.

The coronavirus epidemic had not reached its peak despite a drop in the daily number of infections, state broadcaster CCTV quoted Xi as saying at a meeting of the Communist party's Politburo on Friday.

He said that the situation in Hubei was still serious.

""The battles to defend Hubei and Wuhan should be well fought, and measures should be taken to contain the spread of the outbreak,"" Xi was quoted as saying by the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.

It is expected that once the virus peaks, it will begin to abate.

Also, much to the horror of health officials, the disease has now spread to five Chinese prisons in the provinces of Hubei, Shandong and Zhejiang where 447 cases of the virus have been reported, He Ping, an official in-charge of the Bureau of Prison Administration of the Ministry of Justice told media here on Friday.

This led to the sacking of officials in nearly a dozen prisons and the justice department, state-run Global Times reported.

He pledged all-out efforts to quarantine suspected cases and their close contacts and timely treatment for all of those confirmed of the virus.

Prisons across the country were also ordered to step-up monitoring track records of all prison guards and officers to prevent the spread of the virus, He added.

On Friday, Beijing saw a sudden spike in the cases after the central city hospital reported 36 novel coronavirus infections, a sharp increase from the nine cases two weeks earlier, leading to fears of a potential explosion of number of infection cases in the city, the Global Times reported.

Beijing has so far reported 396 cases of novel coronavirus infection, with four deaths.

Meanwhile, China has postponed the Boao Forum for Asia, its most prestigious annual meeting held in the picturesque Hainan province where it would invite top world leaders, CEOs to discuss economy, trade and related issues.

The forum was expected to take place from March 24-27.

China also hinted at postponing the annual parliament session to be held in the first week of March.

Plans are also afoot to postpone the National People's Congress -- the country's parliament -- and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) -- China's top political advisory body, official media reported.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-s-coronavirus-death-toll-crosses-2-300--who-team-to-visit-wuhan-2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-s-coronavirus-death-toll-crosses-2-300--who-team-to-visit-wuhan.html

""I think what you'll hear from the President is very much encouraging a reduction in tensions between India and Pakistan, encouraging the two countries to engage in bilateral dialogue with each other to resolve their differences,"" a senior administration official said, when asked whether Trump would offer to mediate on the Kashmir issue again during his upcoming Indian visit.

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will lead a 12-member American delegation to Ahmedabad, Agra and New Delhi on February 24 and 25.

""We continue to believe a core foundation of any successful dialogue between the two (Indian and Pakistan) is based on continued momentum in Pakistan's efforts to crack down on terrorists and extremists on its territory. So we continue to look for that,"" the official said.

""But I think the president will urge both countries to seek to maintain peace and stability along the Line of Control (LoC) and refrain from actions or statements that could increase tensions in the region,"" said the official who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity.

Responding to a question on the Afghanistan peace process, the official said the United States would just encourage India, as it does with regional countries, to do whatever it can to support this peace process so that it can be successful and can potentially end 19 years of military, diplomatic, economic engagement.

""You know, that we can end the military engagement. We will be continuing our diplomatic and economic engagement, which has been there over the last 19 years. But we certainly would look to India to support this peace process -- an important country in the region, important to the overall stability of the region.

219,22-2-20,Iran reports one death among 10 new coronavirus cases,"Iran on Saturday reported one more death among 10 new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths in the Islamic republic to five and infections to 28.

""We have 10 new confirmed cases of COVID-19,"" health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said on state television.

""One of the new cases has unfortunately passed away,"" he added, noting that eight of them had been hospitalised in Qom and two in Tehran, without specifying where the death occurred.

The COVID-19 outbreak first emerged in Iran on Wednesday, when officials said it killed two elderly people in Qom, a Shiite holy city south of the capital.

They were the first confirmed deaths from the disease in the Middle East.

Since then, Iran has carried out tests on 785 suspected cases, Jahanpour said.

""Most of the cases are either Qom residents or have a history of coming and going from Qom to other cities,"" the health ministry spokesman said.

Qom is a centre for Islamic studies and pilgrims, attracting scholars from Iran and beyond. An official said the first two victims, who were Qom residents, had not left Iran.

Following the announcement of the deaths, neighbouring Iraq on Thursday clamped down on travel to and from the Islamic republic, with its health ministry announcing people in Iran were barred from entering the country ""until further notice"".

Earlier this week, Zee Studios had announced that they have signed Zafar to helm a trilogy: ""Mr India"", based on the 1987 Shekhar Kapur-directed movie, which featured Anil Kapoor as Mr India and late Sridevi as a journalist.

""A lot of people have been asking me about the 'Mr India' remake. Honestly my father didn't even know the film was being remade, we found out about it through social media when @aliabbaszafar tweeted.

""It's quite disrespectful and underhanded if it is true, since no one bothered to consult my father or Shekhar uncle, two people who played a major role in making the film what it was and is,"" Sonam wrote on Instagram.

The actor said the original creators should be respected and one shouldn't encash on the popularity of ""Mr India"".

223,22-2-20,Kejriwal to redeem another pledge: Mohalla Marshals,"After the successful implementation of the bus marshals scheme in the DTC run buses, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Government has decided to deploy mohalla marshals to create an atmosphere of safety and security for women and children at the very grassroots.

The marshals drawn from the “Civil Defence” unit of the Delhi Government will be deployed in the streets, residential societies and mohallas and other vulnerable points across the national Capital.

The Women and Children Department (WCD) in a pilot project explored the idea of mohalla marshals in Burari last year where the Civil Defense officers conducted regular visits and surprise checks in the vulnerable points, during which they received a maximum number of complaints from the residents.

“Following the results of this pilot project, the WCD has decided to implement the idea across the city for the safety of woman and child,” said Rajendra Pal Gautam, Minister of WCD and the brains behind mohalla marshals projects.

The Minister is also planning actions and steps to strengthen the Mahila Panchayats across all the 70 Vidhan Sabha. “The role of mohalla marshals will be a revolutionary step in ensuring the overall security and safety at the grass-root level,” the Minister said.

Gautam also held a meeting with Delhi Woman Commission (DCW) and chairman of Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) on Friday to discuss the work done by the department for women and child in the last three years and formulate an action plan to ensure safety of women and girls at the grassroots level.

“The DCW team has done exemplary work in the last three years. In our Guarantee Card, women safety is the topmost priority. The plan is to set up mohalla marshals and strengthening Mahila panchayats in the upcoming months,” the Social Welfare Minister said.

Gautam also directed the DCW to set up a special welfare cell for Schedule Caste (SC/ST) in the Commission that will work towards the welfare of women and girls from the community.

“Seeing the atrocities on women from the SC/ST community, we welcome the idea of WCD Minister and will add a special cell which will work towards the welfare and offer protection to women from the SC/ST community,” DCW chief Swati Maliwal.

The Social Welfare Department is also working on to set up a special board for transgender community to provide protection and welfare facilities such as job and education for the members of community.

Further, the Minister also met the members and chairman of DCPCR Ramesh Negi to take a stock of work done in the previous years. “Women and children are the most vulnerable groups in our society. Special attention should be given on child - protections as these innocent minds are most prone to child - labor and drug - abuse,” said Gautam.

“Children who are in homes or are under institutional care need support and protection by the system. Since they are usually abandoned or have fled from their homes, it is our responsibility that their overall social, mental and physical well being is taken care of. Since the past five years, we have offered all legal support and support to these children,” said Anurag Kundu, member at DCPCR.

Apart from children in the institution, Kundu also highlighted the issues of child labour in Delhi and suggested effective community - based solutions to tackle the problem of child labor in Delhi in the upcoming years.

Emphasising on children with disabilities and special needs, the Minister also decided to focus on early identification, prevention and early intervention in disabilities. Priorities will be given in screening, evaluation and vocational training programs for persons with disabilities in the State, they added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kejriwal-to-redeem-another-pledge--mohalla-marshals-2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/kejriwal-to-redeem-another-pledge--mohalla-marshals.html

""The president is going to India as a demonstration of the strong and enduring ties between our two countries,"" a senior administration official told reporters less than 48 hours before Trump departs for his maiden presidential trip to India.

""These are ties based on shared democratic traditions, common strategic interests, and enduring bonds between our people. And, in part, this has been exemplified by the very close relationship between the President and Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" said the official, requesting anonymity.

The visiting American delegation includes Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and National Security Advisor Robert O' Brien.

""The visit will focus on several key areas. First, we'll focus on building our economic and energy ties,"" the official said, noting the two-way trade in goods and services exceeded USD 142 billion in 2018.

Observing that India is the fifth-largest economy in the world with massive energy needs, the official said the US is ready to help India meet those demands.

In 2016, energy exports from the US to India grew by 500 per cent to nearly USD 7 billion.

During the trip, the two countries will focus on defense and security cooperation to fight terrorism and promote a free and open Indo-Pacific.

The US wants an India that is strong with a capable military that supports peace, stability, and rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific region, the official said.

225,22-2-20,Fat around arteries may be good for health,"Researchers have found that fat around our arteries may play an important role in keeping those blood vessels healthy.

The fat, known as perivascular adipose tissue, or PVAT, helps arteries do what scientists call ""stress relax,"" or let go of muscular tension while under constant strain.

This is similar to the bladder, which expands to accommodate more liquid while at the same time keeping it from spilling out.

""In our study, PVAT reduced the tension that blood vessels experience when stretched, and that's a good thing, because the vessel then expends less energy. It's not under as much stress,"" said study researchers Stephanie Watts from Michigan State University in the US.

The findings, published in the journal Scientific Reports, could affect how researchers test for treatments related to plaque buildup in our arteries, or atherosclerosis, an issue that can often lead to a heart attack, which is currently a leading cause of death in the US.

What made the finding so exciting, Watts said, is that PVAT has largely been ignored by researchers who have thought its main job was to store lipids and do little more.

Right now, scientists only divide blood vessels into three parts, the innermost layer called the tunica intima, the middle layer called the tunica media and the outermost layer called the tunica adventitia.

Watts would like scientists to recognise PVAT as the fourth layer, which others have called tunica adiposa - tunica means a membranous sheath enveloping or lining an organ and adiposa is a synonym for fat.

Other investigators have shown that PVAT plays a role in the functioning of blood vessels, finding that it secretes substances that can cause blood vessels to relax as well as substances that can cause it to contract.

But Watts and her colleagues wanted to test whether PVAT itself, rather than the substances it secretes, might play a role in how blood vessels perform.

So, they decided to test whether PVAT provides a structural benefit to arteries by assisting the function of stress relaxation.

To do that, they tested the thoracic aorta in rats and found those with intact PVAT had more stress relaxation than those without.

""My mind was blown,"" Watts said when she saw that the pieces with surrounding fat had measurably relaxed more than those without.

The research team also tested other arteries and were able to duplicate the same response.

""So, this tells us, it's not just a one off, it's not something you see only in this particular vessel or this particular species or this particular strain. But that maybe it's a general phenomenon,"" Watts added.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fat-around-arteries-may-be-good-for-health-2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/fat-around-arteries-may-be-good-for-health.html
226,22-2-20,Meditation may be associated with specific brain connection changes: Study,"The subjective feeling of well-being experienced by many people with the practice of meditation is associated with specific changes in the brain, according to a study which may lead to better clinical recommendations of the practice.

The study, published in the journal Brain and Cognition, examined the effects of the technique known as Transcendental Meditation (TM), which consists of the silent repetition of a meaningless sound.

In the study, the researchers from the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca in Italy, enrolled 34 healthy young volunteers and divided them in two groups.

They said the first group practised TM 40 minutes per day in two sessions of 20 minutes each, one in the morning and the other in the evening.

The second group, the scientists said, did not change its daily routine.

Using questionnaires, they also measured the anxiety and stress levels of all the participants at the beginning of the study, as well as the subjects' ability to manage stressful situations.

According to the researchers, the participants were also subjected to a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scan, in order to measure the organ's activity at rest, and changes in the excitation among different cerebral areas.

They repeated the tests after three months, at the end of the study.

According to the study, the levels of anxiety and stress perceived by the subjects who followed the meditation program were significantly reduced in comparison with those of the volunteers who did not practice TM.

""Magnetic resonance imaging also shows that the reduction of anxiety levels is associated with specific changes in the connectivity between different cerebral areas, such as precuneus, left parietal lobe and insula, which all have an important role in the modulation of emotions and inner states,"" said study co-author Giulia Avvenuti from the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca.

""In the control group, instead, none of these changes was observed. The fact that Transcendental Meditation has measurable effects on the 'dialogue' between brain structures involved in the modulation of affective states opens new perspectives for the understanding of brain-mind relationships,"" said Pietro Pietrini, IMT School's Director, and co-author of the study.

""It also extends the results of recent research suggesting that drugs therapies and psychotherapy leverage on the same biological mechanism,"" Pietrini said.

According to the researchers, even a few months of practice of TM can have positive effects which can be correlated with measurable changes in the brain.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/meditation-may-be-associated-with-specific-brain-connection-changes--study-2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/meditation-may-be-associated-with-specific-brain-connection-changes--study.html
227,22-2-20,EU nations end summit without agreement on budget,"European Union nations broke up a marathon budget summit without a deal Friday and will have to reconvene for another meeting on the matter in the coming weeks.

After 28 hours of talks the leaders could not find a compromise, with a half dozen wealthy member states insisting they would not stump up more funds for the bloc's next long-term spending package, worth around one trillion euros ($1.1 trillion).

EU Council President Charles Michel said that “unfortunately today, we have observed it was not possible to reach an agreement."" He added that “we need more time."" “As my grandmother said, to succeed you have to try,"" he said. It was not clear yet exactly when a new summit would be set.

The so-called “Frugal Four” of Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden, and a few others, believe the EU's 2021-2027 budget, which is meant to fund ambitious climate change and digital economy policies, should amount to 1% of the 27-nation trading bloc's gross national income.

On the other hand, many of the poorer member states and the European Parliament wanted to stick with a bigger budget of 1.3 percent.

229,22-2-20,Weinstein jury indicates it is split on most serious counts,"The jury deliberating in Harvey Weinstein's rape trial indicated Friday that it is deadlocked on the most serious charges.

In a note sent to the judge during their lunch break, jurors posed a question asking if it were permissible for them to be hung on two counts of predatory sexual assault while reaching a unanimous verdict on other charges.

After consulting with prosecutors and Weinstein's lawyers, Judge James Burke told the jury of seven men and five women to keep working toward a unanimous verdict on all charges and sent them back to continue deliberating.

Weinstein's lawyers said they would accept a partial verdict, but prosecutors said no and Burke refused to do so.

The jury, in its fourth day of deliberations, has been particularly focused on the key aspect of both predatory sexual assault counts: ""Sopranos"" actress Annabella Sciorra's allegations that Weinstein raped and forcibly performed oral sex on her in the mid-1990s.

Jurors started the day Friday by listening to a reading of Sciorra's cross-examination and follow-up questioning by prosecutors. About 90 minutes into the reading, the jurors notified the judge they had “heard enough” and resumed their deliberations.

Sciorra testified nearly a month ago. She was the first accuser to testify in the closely watched #MeToo trial.

The jury has already focused on emails that Weinstein sent regarding Sciorra, including ones to the private Israeli spy agency he allegedly enlisted to dig up dirt on would-be accusers as reporters were working on stories about allegations against him in 2017.

Sciorra, now 59, was the first accuser to testify and took the witness stand nearly a month ago, telling jurors how the once-powerful movie mogul showed up unexpectedly at the door of her Manhattan apartment before barging in and raping and forcibly performing oral sex on her in late 1993 or early 1994.

On cross-examination, Sciorra was grilled about why she opened her door in the first place and didn't find a way to escape if she was under attack.

Weinstein lawyer Donna Rotunno asked: “Why didn't you try to run out of the apartment? Did you scratch him? Try to poke him in the eyes?”

Prosecutors say Sciorra weighed only about 110 pounds in those days, making her no match for the 300-pound Weinstein.

“He was too big” to fight off, she told the jury. “He was frightening.

Weinstein, 67, is charged with five counts stemming from the allegations of Sciorra and two other women — an aspiring actress who says he raped her in March 2013 and a former film and TV production assistant, Mimi Haleyi, who says he forcibly performed oral sex on her in March 2006.

Sciorra's accusations are key to the most serious charges that jurors are weighing in the case — two counts of predatory sexual assault, which carry a maximum penalty of life in prison.

The charge requires prosecutors to show that a defendant committed a prior rape or other sex crime, but doesn't have the statue of limitation constraints that would bar her allegations from consideration on their own.

Weinstein has maintained any sexual encounters were consensual.

The Associated Press has a policy of not publishing the names of people who allege sexual assault without their consent. It is withholding the name of the 2013 rape accuser because it isn't clear whether she wishes to be identified publicly.

Sciorra went public in a story in The New Yorker in October 2017 after one of the few people she says she told about the incident, actress Rosie Perez, got word to reporter Ronan Farrow that he should call her.

Sciorra didn't get involved in the criminal case until later. Her allegations weren't part of the original indictment when Weinstein was arrested in May 2018, but after some legal shuffling they were included in an updated one last August.

Weinstein's lawyers fought to get her nixed from the case in the run-up to the trial, arguing to no avail that prosecutors shouldn't be allowed to use her claims because they predated the enactment of the predatory sexual assault charge in 2006.

Weinstein's lawyers have also argued that it's plainly unfair to make the producer defend himself against something alleged to have happened more than a quarter-century ago. They contend prosecutors shoehorned Sciorra into the case to get a marquee name on the witness stand.

“Annabella was brought into this case for one reason and one reason only,” Rotunno said in her closing argument last week.

“She was brought in so there would be one witness who had some star power, one witness you may recognize and one witness whose name may mean something.”",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/weinstein-jury-indicates-it-is-split-on-most-serious-counts-2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/weinstein-jury-indicates-it-is-split-on-most-serious-counts.html
230,22-2-20,Never been in a hurry to do films: Rana Daggubati,"Rana Daggubati's upcoming trilingual film ""Haathi Mere Sathi"" will be his first major release since 2017's ""Baahubali: The Conclusion"", but the actor says the long gap between his films doesn't bother him.

The 35-year-old actor said as an artiste his aim is to serve ""unique"" content to the audiences.

""I'm not your popular culture hero to have releases in quick succession. I'm someone who likes to take up new subjects and it takes a lot of my time,” Rana told PTI.

""When we started 'Baahubali', we'd planned it as a two-three year project but it ended up taking 5 years of our time. But the experience taught me so much. Similarly, 'Haathi Mere Saathi' took about two years. I think it's quite becoming a norm with my films even though I don't wish,"" he added.

Rana said if he believes in a story he doesn't mind investing time in the project.

""I was never in an urgency of doing films. Whatever time I invest in a film, it has to be worth it when audiences watch it on screen. Unless I come with something really unique, people are not ready to accept my work. I've seen it with a small scale films like 'Ghazi Attack' and later with a mega budget project like 'Baahubali'.""

Directed by Prabhu Solomon, ""Haathi Mere Saathi"" is about ""a man who fought for the jungle, the animals and against the society"". It will release across the country in three languages -- Hindi, Tamil and Telugu -- on April 2.

The actor said working on the film was both exhausting and exciting.

""Working with real elephants may sound exciting on paper but it was extremely exhausting. Ten days into the shoot, I called SS Rajamouli sir and told him how challenging this project had already become. It was equally exciting because we were doing something different; we were telling the story of a much bigger issue.""

The film was shot in three languages consecutively, and Rana said the routine gave him a better understanding of his character.

""When you're performing the same scene thrice, you get much deeper into the character. As I was doing my scenes in three languages, I was starting to understand my character better. It felt like I knew this guy (Rana's character) like the back of my head. It helped in enhancing my performance,"" he said.

The actor added that the film taught him the importance of co-existence.

""When we started this film, it was just another story we wanted to bring on screen. But what happened through the course of the shoot is that I realized the world is just not for us.

""A decade ago, if poaching of tigers and elephants was a pressing issue, urbanisation has become a major threat to forests today,"" he said.

""Haathi Mere Saath"", which will release as ""Kaadan"" in Tamil and ""Aranya"" in Telugu, also features Pulkit Samrat, Shriya Pilgaonkar and Zoya Hussain.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/never-been-in-a-hurry-to-do-films--rana-daggubati-2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/never-been-in-a-hurry-to-do-films--rana-daggubati.html

Ayushmann's reply to Trump's tweet was one filled with hope.

He said: ""It was great to see a reaction from US President Donald Trump. I certainly hope and wish that this comment is President Trump's gesture of outreach towards the LGBTQ community and that he will persistently and constantly work towards upholding LGBTQ rights in his country.""

Trump's praise came after a tweet by human rights campaigner and LGBTQ+ activist Peter Tatchell posted praise for the Ayushmann Khurrana-starrer.

""A new #Bollywood rom-com featuring a gay romance is hoping to win over older people, following the decriminalisation of homosexuality. Hurrah!"" tweeted @PeterTatchell.

232,22-2-20,Private WhatsApp group chat links available on Google Search,"Google has indexed invite links to private WhatsApp group chats, meaning anyone can join various private chat groups (including several porn-sharing groups) with a simple search.

According to a report in Motherboard, invitations to WhatsApp group chats were being indexed by Google.

The team found private groups using specific Google searches and even joined a group intended for NGOs accredited by the UN and had access to all the participants and their phone numbers.

Journalist Jordan Wildon said on Twitter that he discovered that WhatsApp's ""Invite to Group Link"" feature lets Google index groups, making them available across the internet since the links are being shared outside of WhatsApp's secure private messaging service.

""Your WhatsApp groups may not be as secure as you think they are,"" Wildon tweeted on Friday, adding that using particular Google searches, people can discover links to the chats.

According to app reverse-engineer Jane Wong, Google has around 470,000 results for a simple search of ""chat.whatsapp.com"", part of the URL that makes up invites to WhatsApp groups.

WhatsApp spokesperson Alison Bonny said: ""Like all content that is shared in searchable public channels, invite links that are posted publicly on the internet can be found by other WhatsApp users.""

""The links that users wish to share privately with people they know and trust should not be posted on a publicly accessible website,"" Bonny told The Verge.

Danny Sullivan, Google's public search liaison, tweeted: ""Search engines like Google & others list pages from the open web. That's what's happening here. It's no different than any case where a site allows URLs to be publicly listed. We do offer tools allowing sites to block content being listed in our results.""",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/private-whatsapp-group-chat-links-available-on-google-search-2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/private-whatsapp-group-chat-links-available-on-google-search.html
233,22-2-20,Next MacBook Pro may feature Intel's 10th Gen Ice Lake chips,"Apple is reportedly planning to launch a refreshed version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro in the first half of this year and now a new report claims that the new 13-inch machines could adopt Intel's 10th-generation Ice Lake chips.

The upcoming 13-inch MacBook Pro would equipped with Intel's 10th-generation i7-1068NG7 Ice Lake 2.3GHz chip with 4.1GHz turbo boost capabilities, Mac Rumors reported on Friday.

As per reports, with this the new 13-inch machine Pro will be approximately 12 per cent faster than the current 13-inch MacBook Pro when it comes to CPU speed and close to 30 per cent faster when it comes to GPU performance.

Additionally, known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently revealed that the iPhone maker is expected to release new iPad Pro models with rear 3D sensing in the first half of 2020.

Kuo in a research note with TF International Securities said the iPad Pro models will gain 3D sensing through the rear-facing camera system.

As per report, Apple is expected to use a time-of-flight system, which measures the time that it takes for light to bounce off of objects in a room to generate a 3D map.

Additionally, Kuo also reiterated that Apple plans to release its low-cost iPhone ""SE 2"" in the first half of 2020 too.

234,22-2-20,"Ishant picks up two, Williamson looks solid as NZ reach 116","Fast bowler Ishant Sharma claimed two wickets but New Zealand still held the upperhand, reaching 116 for 2 at tea after bundling India out for a paltry 165 on the second day of the first Test here on Saturday.

New Zealand captain Kane Williamson comfortably reached 46 off 84 balls with milestone man Ross Taylor (22 bating off 40 balls) also looking good, having hit Ravichandran Ashwin for a six.

Ishant (2/17 in 10 overs) was the best Indian bowler on view. He was lucky to get Tom Latham (11) immediately after lunch as the left-handed opener gloved one down on the leg-side after being cramped.

Williamson along with the stodgy Tom Blundell (30, 80 balls) added 47 runs before the lanky speedster, playing his 97th Test, bowled one on length, which breached the opener's defence.

New Zealand went into the final session with only 50 runs required to surpass India's modest first innings total.

Williamson looked good as he hit some delightful strokes square off the wicket. The square drive on the rise off Jasprit Bumrah (0/37 in 11 overs) followed by a cover drive showed his class.

Bumrah, in particular, was punished by Williamson, who also back-cut him for a boundary and Taylor then punished another half volley through the covers.

There were quite a few loose deliveries on offer from the Indian pacers and in between a few did beat the bat. With the 'Basin' baked in sunshine, batting became lot more easier and the Black Caps seized the initiative.

Shami (0/34 in 9 overs) and Bumrah didn't exactly look menacing during that second session, while Ravichandran Ashwin (0/26 in 9 overs), despite being hit for a six, showed a big heart in bowling attacking lines as he got the deliveries to drift.

Earlier, New Zealand's debutant Kyle Jamieson and veteran Tim Southee took four wickets apiece as Indian innings folded in 68.1 overs.

Jamieson (4/49 in 16 overs) and Southee (4/49 in 20.1 overs) took four of the five wickets that fell on the second morning with India adding only 43 runs to their overnight score of 122 for 5.

Rishabh Pant (19) started with a six but then a horrible mix-up with senior partner Ajinkya Rahane (46) resulted in a run-out and the little chance of recovery was gone for good.

Ravichandran Ashwin got a beauty from Southee, pretty similar to what Prithvi Shaw got, while Rahane inside edged one while trying to leave it alone.

With India reduced to 132 for 7, Rahane knew that time was running out as he played a square drive off Trent Boult to get a boundary.

Southee got rid of Rahane soon when he tried to shoulder arm a delivery that made a late inward movement.

Mohammed Shami's entertaining 21 then enabled the visitors to cross the 150-run mark.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ishant-picks-up-two--williamson-looks-solid-as-nz-reach-116-2-at-tea-2020-02-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/ishant-picks-up-two--williamson-looks-solid-as-nz-reach-116-2-at-tea.html

Kane Williamson (89) top-scored, while Ross Taylor (44) too chipped in with a useful contribution.

BJ Watling (14) and Colin de Grandhomme (4) were at the crease as New Zealand took a 51-run lead.

India pacer Ishant Sharma (3/31) took three wickets, dismissing both the openers -- Tom Blundell (30) and Tom Latham (11) and milestone man Ross Taylor (44), while Mohammed Shami (1/61) and Ravichandran Ashwin (1/60) snapped one each.

Earlier, resuming at an overnight score of 122 for 5, India lost the rest of the five wickets adding just 43 runs.

Tim Southee (4/49) and Kyle Jamieson (4/39) claimed four wickets each, while Trent Boult (1/57) snapped one.
