0,07-3-20,Coronavirus suspect Irish man hospitalised in City,"A missing Irish businessman, suspected of having been afflicted by coronavirus, was traced in a Bhubaneswar hotel on Friday morning and was admitted in the Capital Hospital of Bhubaneswar in the evening.

Along with his local associate, he would be kept in the isolation ward for 14 days as per the protocol and their blood and swab samples would be sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune for test, said Hospital Director Dr Ashok Patnaik.

The man from Ireland on a business trip to India since February 26 was staying in a hotel in Bhubaneswar and on Thursday, he went to the Capital Hospital along with his associate for a checkup and advice after having mild fever and running nose for two days.

“When the consulting doctor suggested the 37-year-old Irish man to remain in isolation for 14 days, the accompanying associate wanted him to be referred to the SCB Hospital in Cuttack where better facilities are available by dedicated doctors and paramedics”, Hospital Director Patnaik said.

Surprisingly, the Irish national and his associate were sent to the SCB Hospital without any proper escort.

“After arriving here, when the associate learnt that he was also supposed to be admitted in the isolation ward, both escaped from the Cuttack hospital without informing the doctors,” said SCB Hospital Emergency Officer Dr BN Moharana.

When the matter was brought to the notice of local police, an alert was sounded to trace the suspected patient and his associate as their mingling with others could create further troubles.

However, the tizzy hospital authorities realising their mistakes finally located them in the same hotel where they had been staying for past few days.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/coronavirus-suspect-irish-man-hospitalised-in-city.html

2,07-3-20,SUM Hospital conducts rare liver transplantation,"Registering a first in Odisha’s medical history, the Institute of Medical Sciences and SUM Hospital under the SOA University here on Thursday successfully conducted a living donor’s liver transplantation.

A team comprising surgical experts from the Hyderabad-based Yashoda Hospital and IMS and SUM Hospital conducted the nine-hour-long surgeries on the donor and the recipient.

The surgeries were conducted on 55-year-old Jayanta Biswal, a resident of Nilagiri in Baleswar district, and his young son Saumya Ranjan Biswal, a BCom student, who donated a portion of his liver. Both the father and son are doing fine and are kept under observation in the ICU.

Biswal had been suffering from a non-alcoholic fatty liver.

Prof P Balachandran Menon, Chief Liver Transplant surgeon from Yashoda Hospital assisted by Dr GV Prem Kumar, Director, Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Dr Krishna Chaitanya, transplant surgeon, Dr Manoj Kumar Sahu and Dr Premananda Pattnaik, gastroenterologist and gastro-intestinal surgeon, respectively, of IMS and SUM Hospital, led the team during the surgery.

IMS and SUM Hospital had signed an MoU with Yashoda Hospital one and a half years ago for the purpose.

Dr Sahu described the transplantation as a milestone in Odisha’s medical history.

“This first such procedure conducted in IMS and SUM Hospital has been done free of cost including pre- and immediate post-transplant care. Such transplant surgeries cost anything between Rs 20 lakh to Rs 25 lakh in other hospitals, but it can be done at Rs 10 lakh in SUM Hospital,” he said.

Jayanta’s wife Anita said her family would remain indebted to SOA President Prof Manojranjan Nayak for the institution’s gesture.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sum-hospital-conducts-rare-liver-transplantation.html
3,07-3-20,12-hour Nayagarh bandh cripples life,"Normal life was hit in several parts of Nayagarh district on Friday when farmers and workers under the banner of Nayagarh Sugar Mill Kriyanusthan Committee held a 12-hour bandh demanding revival of the Nayagarh Sugar Complex Limited (NSCL) that has been lying defunct from 2015.

The farmers and workers have been staging protests since January demanding reopening of NSCL.

Due to the bandh, train and bus services were affected as the agitators staged road blockade on the National Highway 57 and Rail Roko at the railway station.

Besides, shops and other business establishments remained closed in eight blocks with the protesters staging picketing at different places, said Committee coordinator Shibaram Mahapatra.

The agitators also demanded payment of arrears of farmers and workers of the sugar mill.

Notably, the NSCL that was operating from 2004 was closed in 2015. Livelihood of hundreds of farmers and workers has been badly affected due to its closure.

Among others, Nayagarh Sugar Mill Workers Union president Jogendra Khuntia, Nayagarh Sugar Mill Kriyanusthan Committee convenor Biswanath Mohapatra, general secretaries Santosh Kumar Pradhan and Manoj Kumar Sahu and many other office-bearers of the organisation were present.a",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/12-hour-nayagarh-bandh-cripples-life.html

On February 29, the Intelligence wing of State Police had directed Railways ADGP Pranabindu Acharya to conduct a probe into the allegation and take stringent action against the errant official.

As per the complaint lodged by Havildar Dinanbion Sahu, on the night of August 3, 2019 APR forces, including him were deployed at Bhubaneswar Railway Station. They spotted three bags containing ganja weighing around 21 kg from platform-1 at the railway station.

Sahu alleged that the contraband was supposed to be transported to New Delhi in the Utkal Express by GRP ASI NP Jena. However, the APR forces seized the ganja bags from the ASI and took the same to GRP police station.

“The IIC ordered us to keep the bags in his chamber. Then we went back to platform to perform night duty. After two to three days, all the three bags were shifted by ASI Jena, from whose possession we had seized the ganja.

8,07-3-20,Let them show the way,"The way forward may be to take survivor leaders of human trafficking as partners in anti-trafficking policy-making and not to treat them as hapless victims

Twenty seven-year-old Nilofer is a single mother to one girl, a vegetable vendor and an activist. She became an activist in the course of survival, when a few years ago, she found herself ostracised by her family and community. She was being punished for having been a “corrupt woman” who eloped with her lover, got sold by him to a brothel in Pune and subsequently managed to escape after three failed attempts.

Far from finding respite, Nilofer found herself incarcerated in a shelter home for “rehabilitation” where she was told to learn bookbinding, tailoring, knitting and basic computer skills so that she could find a job after she went back home.

When she returned home after non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the shelter home set her free on the Government’s order, she found that her battle for rehabilitation had just begun. For her family, Nilofer was a source of endless shame and stigma and to make matters worse, her newly-acquired skills did not bring her any employment. While some Panchayat members and officers in public administration offices sympathised with her, others were apathetic or even stigmatising.

Months later, she was approached by another woman, who had a past like hers. She introduced Nilofer to a survivors’ support group, which also became a band of activists fighting for their survival and punishment of their traffickers. Today, her support group is part of a federation of collectives of survivors of human trafficking called Indian Leadership Forum Against Trafficking (ILFAT).

ILFAT’s membership is 2,500 and counting as more and more survivors join from Odisha, Jharkhand, Bengal, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh. Other collectives from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka have also reached out to ILFAT after the organisation was written about in various newspapers and online media.

What is common between them is their experience of being promised safe and good employment, being entrapped and forced into various kinds of labour, being physically and sexually tortured, being intimidated and threatened into submission and even if they found an escape, their ordeal with State protection systems or the lack of it.

What is distinctive between them is that they were trafficked into different contexts — some into brick kilns, some into bangle factories, some as agricultural indentured labour and others forced into sex work. They are young and old, women and men, girls and boys, and they were mostly landless, caste-disadvantaged and of minority identities.

The Government has largely remained immobile when it comes to anti-trafficking policies and laws. Legal reform efforts have been embroiled in controversies and the State’s attempts to get the Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2018 passed lapsed in the Rajya Sabha.

There are diverse perspectives on how human trafficking should be looked at and addressed. For many, the issue is not one that can be addressed through the criminal justice system and requires a structural adjustment approach. For others, anti-trafficking policies and laws are a guide for the State and its moral guardians to aggress upon sex workers. And yet, for others, it is a crusade against traffickers, against male sexual privilege (the social legitimisation of indomitable male sexual appetite that must be met through prostitution of women or trans-women). And in these ideological and political battles are left out people like Nilofer, Rajeev (a 28-year-old man who had been trafficked from western, drought prone Odisha to brick kilns in Tamil Nadu) and Sukma (a young girl from Jharkhand who had been trafficked into indentured domestic labour in Delhi).

That they never received any rehabilitation services, that they are yet to receive compensations, that they have no legal aid from the Legal Services Authority, that they are incarcerated in shelter homes, that they have not received any treatment for depression or anxiety disorders or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and that public health, law enforcement, welfare and the private service providers, mostly NGOs, have little accountability for their non-responsiveness, are matters relegated to conferences and workshops for funders and NGOs.

Their voices only find expression in news reports showing them with covered faces talking about their ordeal. They are never taken on board to draft policy, monitor its implementation and inform the State about what works and what does not work.

Therein lay the genesis of ILFAT, in how survivors of trafficking came together and advocated the passing of the anti-Trafficking Bill. Though the Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha, to the disappointment of ILFAT members, it was never tabled in the Rajya Sabha. Hence IILFAT’s primary demand once again, as a forum of survivor leaders is that the comprehensive law like ToP Bill 2018 come back, be passed and made into a law.

ILFAT members believe that a comprehensive law against trafficking must be inclusive of all forms of trafficking, right from forced and bonded labour, sex trafficking to begging and servitude. Currently there is a multiplicity of laws, which deals with different forms of trafficking under the different laws in silos. Some laws define and penalise only one part of human trafficking and punishment of our traffickers is weakened by fragmented prosecution of this organised crime under different laws. It has been observed that multiplicity of laws is indeed weakening the implementation of these laws on the ground. Some parliamentarians say, quite rightly, that the anti-trafficking policy must not try to curb inter-State migration. Others feel that focus needs to be put into making enforcement stronger and more robust.

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) Amendment Bill recently made NIA the nodal agency to combat human trafficking. The Ministry of Women and Child Development is working on a new draft of the Bill to address previously-expressed concerns over the last Bill and the NITI Aayog expressed interest in the new draft Bill after meeting with ILFAT members.

The way forward may be to take survivor leaders of human trafficking as partners in anti- trafficking policymaking and its monitoring, not to treat them as hapless victims but as people who have lived the phenomenon and trust their wisdom and commitment for a future that is safer for their children, for all children.

9,07-3-20,Armageddon over migrants nigh,"There will never be another year like 2016, when the EU, led by Germany, let more than a million refugees in out of pity over their plight

Turkey has opened the floodgates and soon Europe will be drowning in immigrants. “Hundreds of thousands have crossed and soon it will reach millions,” Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently claimed on television. And it must be true because you can see it live on your medium of choice.

Look at a clip of Greek frontier guards firing tear gas canisters into angry, stone-throwing crowds of refugees, who are right up against the border fence. Look at a shot of other Greek paramilitary troops shooting into the water right beside a rubber raft filled with refugees. Millions and millions of refugees. The migrant Armageddon is at hand.

It’s ugly but it’s not really what it seems. Erdogan says he has opened Turkey’s border with the West because the country has already taken in 3.6 million refugees, mostly from Syria. There’s just no room for the several million more now trying to get out of Idlib, the last Syrian province held by jihadi rebels. So he’s sending them West. That is not true. There are no more Syrian refugees coming into Turkey from Idlib because Turkey has closed the border against them. Indeed, most of the people now trying to storm the borders of Greece and Bulgaria — 13,000 at last count, not “hundreds of thousands” as Erdogan claims — are not Syrians at all. They are Afghans, Eritreans, Iraqis, West Africans, some genuine refugees and others “economic migrants”, who are already living safely in Turkey but would rather be in some country in the European Union (EU).

They didn’t walk 800 km from Idlib, either. The Turkish Government is bussing them to Greece’s land and sea frontiers from wherever they have been living in Turkey, telling them (falsely) that the Europeans will let them in. Erdogan just wants to put pressure on the EU.

Pressure to do what? Good question. He may not know himself but he is desperate because his bluff in Syria has been called and he was facing a potential military confrontation with Russia till he reached an agreement with the Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 5 for an immediate cease-fire in northwestern Syria. For now he has averted a crisis on that front as escalating fighting had threatened to put forces from the two countries into a direct military conflict. However, it is not clear how putting the Europeans into play will change that, but he is definitely at the “do something! anything!” stage of desperation.

Erdogan’s problem is that for the last three months, the Syrian Army has been taking Idlib province back from Turkey’s Syrian jihadi allies, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (formerly an al-Qaeda franchise), in a slow, grinding offensive. Turkey has troops in Idlib and has gradually been committing them to combat to help the jihadis but still, the Syrian advance continues. Erdogan threatened to launch a full-scale war. However, the Syrian regime hasn't even blinked. More than 50 Turkish soldiers have already been killed, so what does he do now? I don’t know and I suspect he doesn’t know either. The whole refugee thing may just be a displacement activity, not part of a cunning plan. We’ll probably know more soon enough now that Turkey and Russia have come to an understanding, weakening Syria in the process. But in the meantime, look at those clips again because that’s what the future, or at least a big part of it, will look like.

This is the first time that we have documented evidence of European border guards shooting at, or at least very near, illegal migrants. Yes, there are special circumstances, the migrants are being sent as part of a political ploy — but it will not be the last time. The Syrian civil war is stumbling to an end but migrants from all the other countries south and east from Europe will keep coming and their numbers will swell.

All of the Middle East and West Africa is going to be hit early and very hard by global warming, which will cause a steady fall in food production. The rule of thumb is that you lose 10 per cent of food production for every rise in average temperature of 1°C.

To make matters worse, these regions also have the highest population growth rates in the world: Doubling times for most countries are 25 years or less. Now it’s poverty and war that drives the migrants; in the future it will be actual hunger (and war, of course). They will head for Europe in ever-increasing numbers because there’s no other safe haven in reach. But it will not remain a safe haven. There will never be another year like 2016, when the EU, led by Germany, let more than a million refugees in out of sheer pity for their plight.

In fact, the political backlash to that act of generosity has already driven politics sharply to the right all over the continent. Europe’s external borders are already closing down. However, in years to come, the dirty little secret that everybody refuses to acknowledge will finally become public knowledge. It’s quite easy to shut borders, really. You just have to be willing to kill people who try to cross them without permission.

10,07-3-20,Is biological warfare raising its ugly head?,"Going by the suspicions over the origin of the Coronavirus, we cannot rule out that other countries are also engineering new bioweapons, the likes of which have never been seen before

History tells us that bio-agents were restrictively used in both the World Wars (WWs). However, since then, biological warfare (BW) has largely been avoided and though a few attempts were made by some non-State actors during the 1970s-80s, by and large BW has been kept in abeyance. But of late, covert and clandestine research and development by various countries and the production of bio-agents during the post WW-II era have brought it closer to, if not at par with its close cousins — nuclear and chemical weapons. Known by different pseudonyms such as the “poor man’s atom bomb” or “germ warfare”, BW is broadly defined as, “The use of biological toxins or infectious agents like bacteria, virus and fungi, with the intent to kill or incapacitate humans, animals or plants as an act of war.” These are primarily meant to cause mass casualties, infect a large number of people, natural resources and above all, spread panic among the rival armed forces. Devastating agents like Bacillus Anthracis, Botulism and Variola are used to spread epidemics like anthrax, cholera, plague and smallpox.

Mustard gas, a primitive bio-agent, was used during the WW-I, leading to a global outrage, which culminated in an unratified treaty banning bioweapons in 1925. Similarly, during WW-II, the Japanese allegedly used bio- agents against Chinese prisoners, while the Russians did the same with the Germans. Thereafter, no major use of bio-agents was reported, except for the Sarin gas attack in 1995 by the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo in a Tokyo subway. A few treaties banning the use of BWs were initiated but did not make any headway as some countries refused to sign on the dotted line. The result is that a number of countries, to be precise 16, including major powers like Canada, Cuba, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria and North Korea are reportedly maintaining and expanding their BW inventory. As per Steven Block, a bio-physicist, the US and Russia are reportedly keeping frozen stocks of smallpox along with conventional bio-agents like anthrax and typhus.

China, under its advanced bioweapons programme launched a few years ago, is not only trying to gain parity with the US and Russia but is aggressively working towards engineering new virus spores. One may call it a coincidence but the sudden outbreak of Coronavirus, perhaps the most potent and devastating in recent times, from Wuhan, China in December 2019, has given credence to these claims.

This pandemic has already spread to 85 countries and claimed 3,400 lives with over 1,00,000 confirmed cases that are growing by the day. India, too, has seen 30 cases and this has led to cancellation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Brussels for an India-European Union summit.

In the meantime, US Republican Senator Bob Cotton has asserted that the Coronavirus originated from a high security laboratory in Wuhan. This claim further substantiates global fears against Chinese designs as the country is also said to be working on gene editing technology — a targetted bio-weapon that was successfully tested in 2018.

To coin a new terminology, the “geo-biological” scenario is becoming alarming and of late virus outbreaks have become rampant. First it was the Ebola in Kenya followed by the Zika virus attack in Nigeria in October 2019 and then came the Nipah virus in Asia, particularly Kerala. Going by the suspicions over the origin of the Coronavirus, we cannot rule out that other countries are also engineering new bioweapons, the likes of which have never been seen before.

Take for instance, the recent locust clouds that originated from West Asia and struck part of Pakistan and India — particularly Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat — causing extensive damage to crops in an area of 1.70 lakh hectares. It looks like a perennial affair and there are fears that the next attack during the monsoon would be of greater magnitude. However, it is believed that locust larvae can be genetically engineered and if this happens, this menace will add a new dimensions to BW.

So far, there are no reports to corroborate that rogue elements or non-State actors have got access to bio-weapons. But one cannot sit complacent because keeping in mind the current fragile global security scenario, such assumptions are short-lived. In the meantime, a new concept, “black biology” is doing the rounds. This is a shadowy science in which organisms are genetically engineered for the sole purpose of creating bio-terrorism. Keeping in mind the devastating effects of BW, there is a need to have a ratified global treaty banning research, production and the use of bio-agents and virus spores and also instituting stringent sanctions against its pilferage for use by terrorist outfits. Closer home, due to the peculiar climatic conditions, vast land mass, the high density of population and lack of primary healthcare, we are highly vulnerable to BW. Thus, India needs to evolve and institute a exhaustive mechanism by harnessing both military and civil resources. In fact, the late Manohar Parrikar, the then Defence Minister, cautioned the nation against BW and stressed that we need to be fully prepared against it.

Keeping this in mind, we must create awareness, both at the research and operational level. At the national level, the Ministry of Home Affairs should be the nodal Ministry to oversee operations. Foremost, the concept of “national bio-defence” must be evolved to encompass threat assessment; effective surveillance and early detection, leading to specialised treatment, including protective vaccines right up to the primary healthcare level. Bio-containment labs both at the national and regional level are required to isolate and arrest threatening bio organisms. Accordingly, the armed forces should also reappraise and upgrade the medical support infrastructure to ensure, protection and treatment of troops.

11,07-3-20,Violence and astral presence,"Given the abject failure of our political class in preventing and/or controlling riots in the national capital, has the time come for the idea of a new politics?

The clutch of recent developments centred round the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the stomach-turning communal rioting in north-east Delhi raises a couple of fundamental questions: Have India’s politics and politicians failed the country? What is the future of politics in the country? The questions are relevant given the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) claim that its victory in the recent Delhi Assembly elections heralds the advent of a new kind of politics in the country — kaam ki rajneeti or the politics of work.

AAP’s work in improving schools, healthcare services in the form of mohalla (neighbourhood) clinics, providing up to 20,000 litres of water free to each household and drastically reducing electricity bills has brought it 62 out of the 70 seats in the Delhi Legislative Assembly. Nevertheless, the conduct of its leaders and legislators during the recent communal riots in Delhi has launched a thousand arguments.

Two things require attention. The first is their claim that they are not responsible for the Delhi Police’s abysmal performance as the force is controlled by the Union Home Ministry. The second is their overwhelmingly perceived absence from the scenes of violence. Both require critical examination.

As to the first claim, the fact is that the Union Home Ministry directly controls the Delhi Police. The question of the latter’s as well as the Delhi Government’s respective roles, however, comes up in the context of preventing and/or controlling violence. While police action is critical in the matter, the fact is that the police act in a social, political and administrative context and the Delhi Government might have been able to compel it to act even though the Union Home Ministry controlled it. The presence of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and AAP Ministers and leaders in troubled areas might, for example, have put policemen on the ground under pressure to act, particularly if the netas had stepped forward and confronted the mobs. Otherwise, the men and women in uniform would have been held responsible if anything had happened to them.

Chief Minister Kejriwal visited the hospitals. He also visited some of the riot- affected areas along with Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia. But that was after the violence had more or less subsided. He had also called for curfew to be imposed and the deployment of the Army besides announcing a slew of measures, including the payment of various amounts of compensation, ranging from Rs 10 lakh to the kin of those killed to Rs 25,000 for each rickshaw destroyed. All this, however, is what any Government is expected to do in the aftermath of a serious communal riot and the AAP Government should have been seriously remiss if it had not. Neither is it the same as visiting affected areas when violence is raging; nor does it make up for failure to do so.

Had they been present, AAP leaders might have confronted the mobs with their followers and halted them in their tracks. If groups of common people in some localities could do it and save lives, homes and places of worship, there is no reason why they could not do so. AAP spokespersons have waxed indignant on television and elsewhere, saying that their MLAs and leaders were very much on the ground, forming peace committees, asking people not to resort to violence, providing relief and solace to the disconsolate and those rendered destitute. Since one does not want to believe that what they were saying was not true, and given that the overwhelming majority of the people seem to hold that AAP leaders were conspicuous by their absence, one can only conclude that they were present but not visible.

This writer can only speculate on how this could have happened. One possibility is that those in the higher echelons of AAPs hierarchy have received pills that make them invisible for pre-determined periods. These might have been originally given to them to inspect unseen the effectiveness of the Government’s delivery systems on facilities provided to the people but were now put to use during the riots. The other possibility is that they have achieved a level of spiritual elevation that enables a person to leave his/her corporal body behind and traverse the cosmos in his/her invisible astral self. Only they did not travel millions of light years in seconds to explore distant galaxies but visit riot-torn areas offering solace in subsonic voices that most people did not hear.

Of course, as invisible as them were leaders of most other political parties. Did they also have the invisibility pill and the capacity for travelling in their astral bodies and speaking subsonically? Whatever the reason, their invisibility shockingly underlines their lack of concern for the people and political inertia. All this leads us to the sentiment whose relevance has not been withered by the years — politicians and political parties in India have failed the people.

This lack of faith in politicians and parties has clearly led to spontaneous protests like the Shaheen Bagh sit-in and meetings, rallies and processions by students’ and citizens against the Citizenship Act. The question is whether the development would prove ephemeral or the protests would coalesce, widen their concerns and transmogrify themselves into a new political formation with a well-defined ideology and programme.

One must go beyond kaam ki rajneeti for this to happen. Work gets done in a political, economic, social and cultural environment and a moral universe. It will not benefit the people if a Government prioritises crony capitalist interests; liberty will not be realised on the ground if sections remain in economic bondage and/or suffer discrimination. One would need a philosophy of freedom based on compassion, humanity and a commitment to liberty, cradling a programme to further social and economic justice and India’s cultural and religious diversity, to realise the goals of the Constitution. Also, one would need money to build up such a political formation. Corporate entities would not provide it; they would bet on parties in power. One would have to depend on crowd-funding, which will not be easy. Finally, the architects of such a movement must have the wisdom to keep their ambitions on hold and weave an intricate tapestry of plural relationships to make a nation-wide political structure possible. But then, as Victor Hugo said, “Nothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come.” Has the time come for a new and very different political formation in India?

12,07-3-20,House row over riots,"The Govt can’t turn away and must allow a debate on who is guilty of the Delhi violence

The confrontationist positions taken by the ruling BJP and the Congress-led Opposition in Parliament over the Delhi riots cannot be simply dismissed as a breakdown of decorum or institutional morality. It is an indication of helplessness when the glorious tradition of debate and discussion that characterises parliamentary democracy is at stake, when dictated silence replaces Question Hour as the real national agenda. It is a desperation of the representative legislature to make itself heard when a determined executive brooks no opinion and has its way. It signifies the erosion of another institution where citizens could express their angst through their representatives. And when the Speaker stays away from a session upset over what he claims is legislators’ pillorying behaviour, then he is abdicating the huge responsibility of the Chair in ensuring debate in the first place. The Opposition wants an immediate discussion on the riots while the Government wants to postpone it after Holi. Frankly, Delhi, which has been ripped apart by unprecedented violence in decades, with more generational damage to people and their way of living than just the toll of 53, is an issue burning enough. And even on the extreme end of the polarised arc, the Government could have appeared “muscular” enough to take questions than appear fragile in its evasiveness. In the end, it is Delhiites who are forlorn in a cross-fire of narratives that obfuscate the real provocateurs and perpetrators. First, the Delhi Police is at its worst crisis of credibility with allegations and videos ranging from it being a mute spectator to acting in a partisan manner. And although the tipping point of the riots was the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which privileges religion as an eligibility criterion and has both defenders and protesters, it is only the latter who are being demonised selectively. In such circumstances, the nation does need to know facts as they are and not propaganda that has acquired the stamp of officialese. Even a Government driven by the ideological push of majoritarianism cannot survive a hitback if it doesn’t attempt some sort of an outreach to the people. Courtesy its segregatory policies, it has hurt and alienated the enlightened “Indian Muslims” whom it is so desperate to reassure through grandiose statements and who have not stirred up major separatist protests that you would associate with minorityism in other nations. Yet, with the latest brand of “otherisation” politics and by predicating legacy data and religion as proof of identity, the Muslim community is vulnerable. If the law and order machinery now fails minorities and there is no perceived sense of justice, then we may end up radicalising them. The public parade of anti-CAA protesters in Uttar Pradesh, presenting them in a rogue’s gallery and recovering costs of damage to public property from them, legitimises this hatred for dissent as mainstream. The cost of creating a new enemy within our own and transferring our non-functioning abilities to “termites” and “viruses” detected after 70 years of incubation may just be too unmanageable.

People can mount pressure only in Parliament through their legally elected voices. For civil society has found no solace even in the judiciary, which has doubted its intentions instead of granting it a listen. Former civil servant and activist Harsh Mander, who assumed a humanitarian role to calm the blaze of fury, helping and rehabilitating abandoned survivors, is now an enemy of the State, guilty by suspicion. It doesn’t matter he has had a clean record so far, he is just as bad simply because he had questioned the judiciary’s emaciated role in restoring civic discourse over CAA. It is deeply distressing that the Supreme Court should deny him a hearing over an egoistic tit-for-tat battle about his earlier remarks instead of hearing his plea for registering FIRs against those who made hate speeches. In the end, this action has diluted the seriousness of the plea itself. The hand-out executive has tamed all institutions into submission no doubt. But it still owes accountability to the people who voted it, not the other way round.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/house-row-over-riots-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/house-row-over-riots.html
13,07-3-20,Train wreck,"We have heard it before, one man’s oversized ambition ruins thousands of innocent lives. Yes Bank reveals just that

One of the English metaphors often used to describe a disaster is “train wreck.” This is because train wrecks, particularly in the older steam-driven era, led to masses of piled and twisted metal. Added to this term is the expression, “you could see it coming” as often, accidents were inevitable. The Yes Bank crisis is a perfect example of the above-mentioned idiom. Not only is it a train wreck but one that almost everyone saw coming — the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Ministry of Finance, the Prime Minister’s Office, financial analysts and even Rana Kapoor, the one-time promoter of Yes Bank. For the last couple of years, the bank has been in a state of crisis. It had extended a series of dodgy loans, its financial position was in a shambles as it failed to raise market funds even as deposits began to thin out. A turbulence at the top, too, ensued. A fight between Rana Kapoor and his sister-in-law, Madhu Kapur, over control of the bank gradually degenerated into it being run into the ground. Madhu Kapur, as the courts have said, was concerned that Rana Kapoor, a visible face of the bank, was trying to shaft her and her daughter out of what her husband, Ashok Kapur, had jointly founded with Rana Kapoor. Ashok Kapur was one of the high-profile victims of the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks. To complicate matters, Yes Bank remained non-serious about finding an investor.

There is little doubt that the board of Yes Bank, when it was under Rana Kapoor’s control, failed in its fiduciary duties. Like several other companies that have been run to the ground, such as Kingfisher Airlines and Jet Airways, the board’s failure to rein in the ego and the grandiose plans of its promoters played an oversized role to land it in trouble. Independent and nominee board members seemed happy to pocket their attendance and fees while shirking any sense of responsibility. But unlike the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank’s failure, which blindsided the Government and the Central Bank, the authorities are not wanting to take any chance now. The RBI had been questioning Yes Bank’s asset allocation and classification of bad debt ever since 2017. It was also in talks with bank officials and deliberated on ways to strengthen its balance sheet and liquidity. While the Central bank wasn’t running Yes Bank, for the past six months, it was fully aware about the day-to-day developments. The decision to supersede the board must not have been taken lightly. However, one should really question those who put their money in the bank. This was something that even a casual reader of the financial media would have known. Appropriate action should have been taken. The RBI has now initiated a rescue plan with the State Bank of India investing in it. But in the process, existing shareholders have found their holdings slashed. It is also rich that former Finance Minister P Chidambaram, under whose watch the bad loan crisis grew, is trying to pin the blame on the current Government, which has been trying to clean up the profligacy of the UPA years.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/train-wreck-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/train-wreck.html
14,07-3-20,SP slams govt for ‘name & shame’ posters of anti-CAA protesters,"Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has slammed the Uttar Pradesh government for “name and shame of anti-CAA protesters” by putting up posters of 57 protesters at public places in state capital.

The authorities in Lucknow have put up roadside banners with photographs of people asked to pay compensation for damage to public property during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

UP government spokesman and cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh defended the move saying “the name and shame of rioters will put a deterrent in the Yogi Adityanath rule and is as per the law of the land”.

“It is an affront to the democratic rights of the common citizens by the Yogi Adityanath government, which is bent on trampling on the democratic rights of the citizens. Such act of divesting the citizens of their democratic rights can never be done by the government and amounts to declaring them as criminal without judicial adjudication,” Yadav said.

He added, “The Yogi Adityanath government, in a unilateral decision, has unleashed repression against the anti CAA protesters.”

The SP chief said the government’s act of putting up the posters of the anti-CAA protesters and asking the common people to identify them could not be justified on any ground.

“The protesters cannot be vilified and declared criminal by the government without any charge sheet and judicial trial,” the SP chief said. He warned that the people could also put up hoardings and posters of Bharatiya Janata Party leaders against whom deep resentment prevailed among the common man.

Yadav said, “The Yogi Adityanath government must conduct itself within the framework of democracy and dignity.”

The SP chief said the BJP represented the ugly face of democracy where the core obligation of a political party was to terrorise democracy. He said India was a constitutional democracy but BJP had no faith in democracy, adding that dissent was a right enshrined in the Constitution.

Yadav said it was most insensitive on the part of the chief minister statement to say “if someone is willing to die, will ultimately die”.

The SP chief said that the UP government, instead of initiating dialogue with the people, had adopted dictatorial attitude.

Yadav had earlier accused Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath of inciting violence in the state “to save his chair”.

Yadav had said the violent protests against the CAA in Lucknow and other parts of the state were incited by Yogi Adityanath and the BJP and it was done deliberately to divert the attention after more than 200 MLAs of the ruling party sat on dharna inside the state assembly.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sp-slams-govt-for----name---shame----posters-of-anti-caa-protesters.html
15,07-3-20,JNU sedition: Delhi Govt’s nod for prosecution flawed,"Recently, the Delhi Government gave its nod to prosecute Kanhaiya Kumar in JNU sedition case pertaining to alleged raising of anti-national slogans inside JNU campus on February 9, 2016.

In this matter, the Delhi police had filed a charge sheet against Kanhaiya Kumar, former president of the JNU Students' Union and other former students like Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya on January 14 2019. However, it was pending approval and sanction of the Delhi Government.

As per Section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the sanction of State Government is required to the prosecution for the offence of sedition under Section 124A in Chapter VI of the Indian Penal Code. The prior sanction for prosecution in cases of sedition is a vital procedural safeguard, to ensure that the initiation of prosecution in such matters is subject to Government’s scrutiny so that these provisions are not unlawfully used against free speech.

Without speaking on merits, it is appropriate to hold that, the sanction given by Delhi Government in the JNU sedition case is flawed, owing to the fact that such sanction is given as a part of the State Government ’s blanket policy to grant sanction in all such cases and to let it be decided by the judiciary. But this absurd idea of Delhi Government hits at the very heart of the legislative intent of prior sanction. Jurisprudentially speaking, sanction in such cases cannot be mechanical but may be given or rejected only after thorough application of mind and should be well reasoned.

There are plenty of such instances when sanction is rejected after due consideration of the individual cases and the facts and circumstances involved therein. In July 2018, sedition charges against the 41 persons accused of the violence that followed the conviction of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, were dropped after the Haryana Government denied sanction to prosecute them under Section 124A IPC.

In another instance of 2012, a case was filed for sedition and defamation against Bharat Desai, Resident Editor of The Times of India, Ahmedabad for writing articles linking the then Police Commissioner with underworld, but the Government only granted sanction for defamation. Here the High Court had quite interestingly opined that, it was “really absurd to say that articles in question amount to sedition”.

The law relating to sedition is well settled. In digging up the judicial history of India, one can find that, in as old as, Kamal Krishna Sircar vs Emperor [AIR 1935 Cal 636] a two-Judge Bench of the Calcutta High Court over-turned the conviction handed over by the trial court in a case of sedition. It is worth citing another interesting instance, as in the matter of Niharendu Dutt Majumdar v. The King Emperor [1943] F.C.R. 38, the Federal Court held that, ""Public disorder, or the reasonable anticipation or likelihood of public disorder, is thus the gist of the offence. The acts or words complained of must either incite to disorder or must be such as to satisfy reasonable men that that is their intention or tendency.""

In Romesh Thappar vs The State of Madras ,AIR 1950 SC 214, on the issue of 'sedition' Patanjali Sastri, J, held that criticism of Government exciting disaffection or bad feelings towards it is not to be regarded as a justifying ground for restricting the freedom of expression and of the Press, unless it is such as to undermine the security of or tend to overthrow the State.

In Kedarnath Singh vs State of Bihar, AIR 1962 SC 955, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of Section 124A, IPC. Here the court was hearing four appeals - three of conviction of the petitioners of sedition committed in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and the fourth one was against the judgement of a Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court holding Section 124A ultra vires of the Constitution vis-a-vis Article 19.

The Court held that, ""The Court, has, therefore, the duty cast upon it of drawing a clear line of demarcation between the ambit of a citizen's fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution and the power of the legislature to impose reasonable restrictions on that guaranteed right in the interest of, inter alia, security of the State and public order.""

Besides, in Nazir Khan & Ors. vs State of Delhi [AIR 2003 SC 4427], the apex court recognised that the test for 'sedition' was indeed strict.

In a relatively recent matter, in the case of Arun Jaitley vs State of U.P. [2016 (92) AllCC 352], a Judicial Magistrate took suo motu cognizance of an article written by the Arun Jaitley, then Finance Minister of India, which contained a critical view of a judgement of the Supreme Court of India issued in the National Judicial Commission Act case. Here the court while quashing the case observed that, ""Now for words written or spoken to fall within the meaning of sedition, the words would have to be held to have the effect of subverting the Government by violent means or tend to bring about public disorder or the use of violence or incitement to violence.”

The judicial history of India has umpteen number of antecedents regarding proper and judicious approach in dealing with cases of sedition and other offences against State, which certainly beckons towards a just application of mind and well reasoned decision while giving sanctions. While it is nowhere opined on the merit of giving sanction or not giving sanction in the JNU sedition case, but it is reiterated that, the Delhi Government ’s universal policy to grant sanction for prosecution is unconstitutional and flawed, especially when an opinion is getting emboldened with maturity of the constitutional law that, sedition law is an relic of the colonial past and is still in vogue as it has given an upper edge to all the ruling regimes so far and its agents to muzzle opposition and conveniently abridge freedom of speech and expression by exploiting the exception clause in Article 19(2) of the Constitution.https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif

18,07-3-20,Poll notification for 4 State Rajya Sabha seats out,"The notification for the biennial elections to four Rajya Sabha seats of Odisha was issued by the Election Commission of India on Friday fixing March 26 as the poll date.

Nomination papers may be delivered by a candidate or by any of his/her proposers to State Assembly Secretary Dasharathi Satapathy, who is also the Returning Officer, or to Assembly Deputy Secretary Shishir Kanta Swain, the Assistant Returning Officer, between 11 am and 3 pm on any day by March 13, 2020.

The nomination papers will be taken for scrutiny at 11.30 am at the Assembly building on March 16. The last date for withdrawal of candidatures is March 18. The polling will be conducted between 9 am and 4 pm at Committee Room No. 54 of the Assembly building on March 26. Counting of votes will take place at 5 pm on the same day.

Notably, the elections will be held to fill up the vacancies of four Rajya Sabha members, Anubhav Mohanty, Narendra Kumar Swain, Sarojini Hembram (all BJD) and Ranjib Biswal (Congress), whose term will expire on April 2, 2020.

Following the notification, speculations as to who would be candidates for the four seats have now intensified further. While the ruling BJD is sure to get three seats because of its strength in the State Assembly, talks about the fourth one have assumed intensity in political circles.

Observers are not sure whether the BJD would try for the fourth seat for itself or, like last time, concede it to the BJP in view of its leadership’s apparently growing closeness towards the saffron party high command. Notably, in the last polls, the BJD had supported BJP nominee Aswini Vaishnaw’s election to the Rajya Sabha.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/poll-notification-for-4-state-rajya-sabha-seats-out.html

23,07-3-20,"Ex-principal, two docs reinstated by govt","



|

The Yogi Adityanath government has reinstated three doctors who were suspended following the alleged oxygen scarcity at BRD Medical College hospital in Gorakhpur that had led to the death of over 60 children, 23 of them in one night, in August 2017.

Another doctor, Dr Kafeel Khan, who was also suspended, was initially absolved of all charges in the departmental enquiry, but he is in jail after being booked under National Security Act for his alleged hate speech during a protest against the Citizenship (Amendmant) Act.

On March 4, Governor Anandiben Patel signed the government order reinstating former principal of BRD Medical College, Dr Rajiv Mishra, anesthetist Dr Satish Kumar and Dr Purnima Shukla, Dr Shukla has retired and all her retirement benefits have been cleared after the Governor signed the order.

Dr Khan, who was pediatrician at the BRD Medical College hospial at that time, was suspended along with these doctors, is still facing an enquiry in this case. At present he is lodged in Mathura jail after being booked under NSA.

Interestingly, in August 2019, Dr Khan was absolved of the charges of medical negligence, corruption and dereliction of duty on the day when the children died due to oxygen shortage.

Investigating officer Himanshu Kumar, Principal Secretary (Stamps & Registration Department), had submitted the report of his probe into the deaths to the Medical Education department on April 18, 2019. But neither the UP government take any action on it, nor did it make the report public. It came to light only in September.

Of the four charges levelled against him, Dr Khan was found guilty of indulging in private practice and being attached to a private nursing home in Gorakhpur till April 2017.

A few days after Dr Khan was absolved of the charges of negligence, the Yogi government had ordered a fresh probe into allegations of indiscipline, corruption and gross negligence while on duty against him.

An official told this reporter that Dr Khan’s suspension was not revoked because an enquiry was still pending against him.

“Moreover, he is facing NSA charges for hate speech. So, as per government rules, his suspension continues,” the official said.

The death of children at BRD Medical College hospital due to alleged shortage of oxygen in August 2017 had become a major issue for the Yogi government, which had been sworn in barely five months before the tragedy. Subesequently, the state government had suspended nine people, including four doctors.

Dr Rajiv Mishra and Dr Satish Kumar returned to work on Thursday after the government order, current principal of BRD Medical College, Dr Ganesh Kumar, said on Friday.

Dr Mishra has been posted as faculty in the pathology department and Dr Satish Kumar as faculty in the anaesthesia department.

Though they have joined the medical college, a departmental inquiry against them will continue, the principal said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ex-principal--two-docs-reinstated-by-govt.html

While the UP government is studying best labour-related practices in other states, it is also in the process of implementing the ‘reform action plan’ framework of the Centre.

UP Labour Minister Swami Prasad Maurya said the government was already working on the labour reforms agenda and it would soon be placed before the state cabinet for approval.

He said labour reforms was an ongoing process and the state Industrial Development and Labour departments were proactively engaged in resolving the irritants faced by the industry.

As the Yogi Adityanath government has set the target of UP hitting a $1-trillion economy by 2024 in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of making India a $5-trillion economy by that year, the state has been working on a slew of measures, including tweaking its policies to attract investment.

At the recent CII’s ‘UP Economic Summit’ here, industrialists had urged the UP government to expedite labour reforms, especially with regards to the beleaguered small and medium enterprises (SME), so that they could better face market competition, especially during the economic slowdown.

The key demands of the MSMEs are provision of fixed-term and contractual labour so that they may exercise control on their fixed costs and pare expenses and production according to the market demand.

At the same time, the process of collecting statistics pertaining to labour and employment in the state has traditionally been sloppy.

However, the state government has so far taken some steps to liberalise labour laws, including the raising of the ceiling from 100 to 300 workers for the sick units to exit without seeking a special certificate from the Labour department.

Besides, the ceiling has also been raised from 10 to 20 workers and from 20 to 40 workers for units without and with power supply respectively for mandatory registration with the Labour department.

Another major reform is the increase in ceiling for mandatory registration of firms for ESI and pension records from 20 to 50 contractual labour. According to an estimate, UP has nearly 15,000 industrial units employing more than 25 workers each, while nearly 85 per cent of the units have less than 300 workers.

However, there are labour related issues which have yet not been addressed, such as the provision of overtime to workers. The current state laws restrict workers to work overtime beyond a certain limit even if they are willing to earn additional income. Although, the state has relaxed the overtime norms to some extent, yet the industry has been seeking greater flexibility.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-govt-working-on-labour-reforms.html

27,07-3-20,CBI takes over probe into UPPCL PF scam,"More trouble is in store for some senior officials of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) as after waiting for over four months, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has finally decided to take over probe into the Rs 4,122-crore scam in which provident fund money of the power employees was invested in the tainted Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL).

The UP government had sent a letter to the CBI on November 2, 2019, asking the central agency to take over the investigation of the power employees’ PF scam from the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of UP Police.

Official sources here on Friday confirmed that the EOW case (number 540/2019) registered against the accused under sections 409, 420, 467, 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code at Hazratganj police station had been transferred to the CBI police station on Thursday.

As per the fresh FIR of the CBI, lodged on behalf of CBI Anti-Corruption Bureau’s Superintendent of Police Raghavendra Vatsa, CBI-ACB inspector Sabhajeet Chauhan will be the investigating officer in the case.

The CBI investigating officer would take all the documents of the case from the EOW in a day or two, sources said.

The EOW has already arrested 17 accused, including UPPCL’s former Managing Director AP Mishra, and all are in judicial custody at present.

The government had lodged a FIR on November 2, 2019 in the scam after it came to light that UPPCL employees’ PF trust had deposited the provident fund money in the DHFL, a company which was in deep trouble after facing several scam charges.

On the same day, the investigation was recommended to the CBI but the EOW was asked to continue with the probe till the central agency took over the probe.

In the EOW investigation, it was found that share brokers were involved in the scam along with some senior UPPCL officials.

On the other hand, the Enforcement Directorate had also started investigation in the alleged money laundering of UPPCL employees’ provident fund which was parked with DHFL. The EOW investigation report said that Rs 4,122 crore was parked with DHFL between March 2017 and December 2018. The funds were allegedly invested in connivance with officials managing the two UPPCL PF trusts via 28 brokerages or bogus firms. Funds were also parked in LIC Housing Finance and PNB Housing Finance, taking the total investment to Rs 6,600 crore. As of now, Rs 2,267 crore is still pending with DHFL.

The Bombay High Court had barred the DHFL from making fresh repayments on account of a different money laundering probe by the ED.

However, when the UPPCL employees staged protest over the scam, the Yogi Adityanath government had made a commitment that the government would bear all the loss and the employees would not suffer.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cbi-takes-over-probe-into-uppcl-pf-scam.html

34,07-3-20,Jha slams NDA Government,"All India Congress Committee (AICC) spokesperson Sanjay Jha here on Friday drew links between growing unemployment in the country and the recently reported communal riots in Delhi.

Hitting out at the NDA Government, Jha here on Friday, told media persons, “Currently we are in the phase of all-time lows, GDP (11 years), Investment ( 17 years), Manufacturing (15 years), Private demand (7 years), and Agriculture (4 years).”

The only staggering number is the record 45-year-high unemployment, claimed Jha adding, “That is the reason why the BJP is successful in quick mobilisation of mobs that indulge in arson, looting and violence like what transpired in Delhi recently.”

He went on to claim that joblessness has destroyed India’s competitive advantage of the demographic dividend. “The social cost of unemployment is huge, resulting in the exploitation of the youth for nefarious purposes which could lead to social anarchy,” he added.

He also cited an example when 28 million youths had applied for 16,000 clerical jobs in railways and applicants included highly qualified as PHD holders, MBAs and Engineers.

Alleging a 400% rise in NPAs in NDA rule than what was there during the UPA government, Jha said, it more seems NPA Government than a Government of NDA.

He alleged that foreign investors were withdrawing their money from India due to dismal economic situation.

While the world is feeling the negative repercussions of Coronavirus which has disrupted supply chains amidst falling demand, India has a major internal problem, the virus of hate, claimed Jha.

Social harmony is a pre-requisite for economic growth. How can the Indian economy grow amidst a fractured society, riots, lynching, attacks on Dalits, public intellectuals and young students? The BJP forgets that before we live in an economy, we live in a society.”

The Indian economy which has just had seven successive quarterly declines, the latest being the GDP at 4.7% for October-December 2019, is not in the ICU but in coma, alleged the leader.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jha-slams-nda-government.html

This lecture was chaired by DS Rao, Head of the office, IGRMS.

At the beginning, the speaker and the chairperson were welcomed by presenting the Bouquet. Thereafter, Dr SK Pandey (Asst. Keeper, IGRMS) apprised to all from Dr Raka Arya and gave the welcome address.

Dr Arya said that, have you ever seen, playing drums or flageolet around your neighborhood or vicinity at the birth of a daughter? May not have seen and you must have seen it somewhere. In fact, we are proud to be Indians of the 21st century, celebrate happiness when a son is born, and be quiet if a daughter is born. Our society is a double standard society where our thoughts and preaching are different from ours works. The root cause of gender inequality in Indian society lies in this patriarchal system.

She gave an example of Vishakha Guidelines, Bhanwari Bai Case, Nirbhaya Case and said that, The laws of the country are designed to protection, safety and empower of the women, there is a need to implement them properly. The drawback in our society is that there is a need to change civic sense and mindset among the people and if the laws are implemented properly there will definitely be a change. Domestic Violence Act-2005 also helps of women’s in these situations. Women are deprived of these rights due to sexual discrimination in male-dominated society. Socially, women have been crowned of sacrifice, tolerance and shyness, under this pressure women are often unable to use these laws despite being aware. Article 14 of the Indian Constitution states: the men and women both are equal. Under Article 15, women have the right to justice against discrimination.

Dr Arya emphasised on the need to promote gender equality and said that, Nothing will change unless change mindset in people. She can never be infirm, weak and helpless. Society and family understand the value of her power, use his energy properly and respect her expression that is good for everyone's. It will also be necessary for women that, they should decide that they will pay attention to the moral values in their children and set examples of moving forward.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/spl-lecture-to-mark-women---s-day-at-igrms.html
38,07-3-20,Shreemandir money in Yes Bank safe: Govt,"In the wake of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) placing the Yes Bank under the moratorium and capping money withdrawal limit, there is now much concern about the safety of the funds of the Puri Jagannath Temple deposited in this cash-strapped private bank.

With a whopping deposit of Rs 545 crore of the temple in the bank, there is apprehension among servitors and devotees about the fate of the funds.

Expressing anguish over the issue, the devotees opined that the centuries old shrine’s money should not have been kept in a private bank.

Former Puri MLA Maheswar Mohanty termed the deposit in the Yes Bank as a ‘mistake’ and held the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA) responsible for it.

“The SJTA had deposited the funds in the private bank to get more interest. Now, the temple administration should take initiative to bring back the deposit from that bank and keep it safe in a nationalised bank by consulting with the RBI,” Mohanty said.

However, Law Minister Pratap Jena said the deposits of the temple are safe in the bank. The money would be transferred to a nationalised bank after maturity of the deposits on March 16 and 29.

“The amount in the Yes Bank is in form of fixed deposits. The Managing Committee of SJTA has decided to transfer the money to a nationalised bank after the deposits mature this month,” Jena told reporters.

The RBI also assured all the Yes Bank depositors that there would be no loss of their money. The RBI has a scheme to revive the beleaguered bank, said RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das.

The RBI said the Yes Bank faced financial crisis as it failed to raise capital to address loan losses which resulted in a decline in its ratings and invocation of bond covenants by investors and withdrawal of deposits.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/shreemandir-money-in-yes-bank-safe--govt.html

43,07-3-20,‘Chakravyuh' staged at MP State Tribal Museum,"A folk play ‘Chakravyuh' in the Yakshagana style was presented at the Madhya Pradesh State Tribal Museum Auditorium on Friday.

The folk play was staged under the direction of Sanvij Swarna (Karnataka) in the weekly series 'Abhinayan'.

The play focuses on Veer Abhimanyu in which Abhimanyu, son of Arjun and Subhadra, is a wonderful character in the epic Mahabharata. Abhimanyu is a superior archer like Arjuna who is like Yudhishthira in policy, similar to Bhima in karma and like Nakula and Sahadeva in humility.

The play centers around the revenge that fuelled the fight between Kauravas and Pandavas in Mahabharat. It beautifully depicted the revenge harboured by Dronacharya for being let down by friend king Drupad, revenge in the heart of Karna for being slighted as Sutaputra by Draupadi at her swayamvar, and also revenge in the heart of Draupadi when she has to undergo ‘Cheer Haran’ after being lost by the Pandavas in the game of dice.

It is the determination of many such slighted hearts nursing revenge that eventually results in the Mahabharat. Through eight scenes, the ballet presented a compact story of Abhimanyu, how the secret of breaching a Chakravyuh is revealed to him while he was in his mother’s womb, how he succeeds in replicating it as a young lad in the Mahabharat and eventually his death at the hands of the senior warriors fighting the war.

It was a mass treat for the audience to watch the epic story on stage. The theatre lovers of the city were mesmerised to have witnessed such a wondrous performance.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---chakravyuh--staged-at-mp-state-tribal-museum.html

69,07-3-20,CBI review plea at SAD’s behest to subvert justice: CM,"Taking strong exception to CBI’s review petition on the Bargari sacrilege case, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday charged the Central probing agency with trying to subvert the course of justice at the behest of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), a part of the Central Government.

The Chief Minister described the move as a “delaying tactic”, aimed at scuttling the probe into the Bargari case, which the State Government had decided to hand over to the Special Investigative Team (SIT) of Punjab Police through a resolution in the Vidhan Sabha in August 2018.

Expressing full faith in the judiciary, the Chief Minister said that he was confident that the courts would uphold the law at all costs and give the much-needed closure and justice to the victims in the case.

Notably, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has intimated the Special Judicial Magistrate at SAS Nagar (Mohali) of its intent to file a review petition in the Supreme Court for review of its order dated February 20, by which the Apex Court had dismissed the central agency’s Special Leave Petitions on the ground of delay, while leaving open the question of law.

“Not only is the CBI’s decision to move a review petition a blatant attempt to delay the investigation further, it is a clear endorsement of the Akali involvement in the incident, which had shaken Punjab back in 2015,” the Chief Minister said.

With this action, the Akalis had clearly proved their involvement in the entire ugly affair, he added. Pointing out that the then SAD-BJP Government had entrusted the probe into three cases filed in the matter to the CBI in November 2015, Capt Amarinder noted that the agency had failed to make any headway in its investigation all these years – a fact duly noted and recorded by the court during hearings in the matter.

The entire drama of filing closure report, refusing to give copy of the same to the State Government, then taking a

U-turn on it after nearly two months, was enacted by the CBI on the directions of the Akalis, who did not want the truth in the matter to come out, said the Chief Minister.

But the people of Punjab wanted to know the truth, and wanted justice, and would not rest till they get the same, said Capt Amarinder, vowing to fight the central agency tooth and nail in the courts to ensure that the investigation in the case is taken to its logical conclusion.

By using such cheap tactics, the Akalis might be able to buy some more time but they cannot evade justice forever, he declared.

CM TRYING TO COVER MISDEEDS OF HIS OWN MINISTERS

Terming the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s allegations that the SAD was trying to subvert justice by influencing the CBI as “a bundle of lies”, SAD on Friday asked him to request the Chief Justice of India to depute a sitting Judge to probe the Bargari sacrilege incident if he was really serious about delivering justice in the case.

Stating that the Chief Minister could not cover his own government’s failure to give justice in the Bargari sacrilege case with mischievous statements which did not have any basis, SAD spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said that Capt Amarinder did not find it fit to call on the Prime Minister or Home Minister on this issue for the last three years.

“Even now, the Chief Minister is playing a desperate gambit to divert attention from his failures after Congress Ministers have been accused of saving policemen in the related Behbal Kalan police firing case…The family of a prime witness has detailed, even in the State assembly, how Minister Gurpreet Singh Kangar and Faridkot legislator Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon intimidated and harassed the witness to shield the guilty police officers,” he said.

Cheema said that the family of another witness has also detailed to the Punjab and Haryana High Court how names of seven out of 11 police officers, accused of firing at innocent Sikhs, have been dropped from an FIR at the instance of Cabinet Minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa.

It was justifiable that the Chief Minister did not want the CBI to probe the matter as his own party leaders and ministers would be placed in the dock for pressuring witnesses to withdraw their statements. “That is why the CM is getting panicky and issuing completely false and baseless statements,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cbi-review-plea-at-sad---s-behest-to-subvert-justice--cm.html

While Rs 1.13 crore was recovered by the Tarn Taran police, the remaining Rs 53 lakh was seized by the Amritsar police, disclosed the state Director General of Police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta on Friday while congratulating Tarn Taran SSP Dhruv Dahia and his team, along with Amritsar Police Commissionerate, for their outstanding work in cracking the case in such a short time.

“Extensive research, intelligence inputs, and technical analysis has worked together to help the police solve the case so quickly,” he added.

The accused have been identified as Sukhwinder Singh alias Baba Bhondi, Tarsem Singh alias Grota, Balwinder Singh alias Billa, Sukhchain Singh alias Chaina (all residents of Khurmanian village in Amritsar district), along with Satnam Singh alias Satta and Ravi (both residents of Sangha village, Sadar police station Tarn Taran).

After the robbery on the night of February 24, the police had registered an FIR under sections 379 B, 342, 459, 506, 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Police Station City Tarn Taran, against unknown persons based on the statement of Baba Mohinder Singh. Another section, 395 (dacoity) of IPC, was added in the FIR on March 1, 2020.

Based on the analysis of the CCTV footage, the police accurately identified the accused, who escaped towards Amritsar. While Sukhchain Singh was arrested on February 28, Satnam Singh was nabbed the next day.

Investigations revealed that they had planned and masterminded the entire robbery, as Satnam Singh used to work as a driver in Dera of Baba Jagtar Singh, located near Guru Nanak Multispecialty Hospital in Tarn Taran. Satnam had detailed knowledge of the location of the cash, as well as the locations of various personnel at the Dera during the night.

Satnam contacted Sukhchain for planning and putting a team in place for execution of the robbery, since he knew Sukhchain to have a strong criminal background. Sukhchain, who had recently come out of Amritsar Jail, then roped in the other accused, said the DGP. Barring Sukhchain, all other five accused came to the Dera in a Swift car on the night of the robbery. Two of them had stayed in the car.

Further, during investigation, it became clear that no weapon had been used to commit the robbery. The Swift car which was used during robbery was recovered from Balwinder Singh.

According to the DGP, the Tarn Taran Police recovered Rs 12 lakhs of the stolen cash from the house of Sukhchain Singh and around Rs 5.65 lakhs from the house of Satnam Singh. Based on further questioning of Sukhchain Singh, around Rs 95.5 lakhs of stolen cash was recovered on March 5 by a team led by DSP/Crime against Property, Tarn Taran.

The accused Sukhchain had confessed that he had converted the stolen cash into US Dollars from a shop named Sethi Money Exchanger, near Railway station, Amritsar, and deposited the converted 1.30 lakh US Dollars and remaining Rs 4.5 lakhs stolen cash in a locker in Punjab and Sindh Bank, Tarn Taran road, Amritsar. Subsequently, the total amount was recovered from the bank on March 5.

“While Diwan Todar Mal had forsaken everything for the cause of righteousness and humanity, the unparalleled bravery and courage of Chhotte Sahibzade of Dasmesh Pita Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji has been gratefully acknowledged and remembered by Punjabis across the globe,” said the Chief Minister in a letter to Modi.

Capt Amarinder further underlined the need for people outside Punjab, especially across the globe, to also draw inspiration from this unique act recorded in the annals of our history. The Chief Minister further pointed out that the supreme sacrifice and martyrdom of the Sikh Gurus which had always inspired generations of Indians and formed a glorious part of the country’s history. Sikhs’ tenth master, Guru Gobind Singh, sacrificed his entire family in his struggle against injustice and oppression perpetrated by the Mughals and is, therefore, rightly regarded by history as ‘Sarbans Daani’, the Chief Minister said.

While the 10th Guru’s two elder sons, Sahibzada Ajit Singh and Sahibzada Jujhar Singh, were martyred in the battle at Chamkaur Sahib, the two younger sons, Sahibzada Zorawar Singh and Sahibzada Fateh Singh, were buried alive at Sirhind in a most cruel and inhuman manner, he noted.

The two Chhotte Sahibzade, despite being of such tender age, showed exemplary courage and fearlessness to stand up against the might of the Mughal Governor of Sirhind, said the Chief Minister in his letter.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/capt-writes-to-pm-for-bravery-award-in-name-of-baba-fateh-singh-ji.html

Mother's hope is that if the daughter is treated in a big hospital, she can be cured. On getting the information of the case, the CM has given the above direction to DC Gumla.

Soren has also asked DC, Saraikela to provide proper health and medical facilities to a rape victim. The CM directed Superintendent of Police Saraikela to arrest and prosecute the accused for committing such incidents at the earliest.The CM was told that the tribal girl was raped at a distance of two km from Seraikela police station.

Until a few years ago, loco engines had neither toilets nor ACs. Loco engine personnel had to travel for hundreds of kilometers in a cabin with no toilet facilities, while facing severe heat or harsh cold. The Modi government has made loco engines equipped with toilets and AC facilities and has also made the running rooms meant for the relaxation of the locos highly convenient. The Minister of Railways, Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal gave this information while answering a question of Poddar in Rajya Sabha on Friday.

It is noteworthy that Poddar had raised the issue of AC and toilet facilities for loco workers earlier too. At that time, the government had accepted the lack of these facilities and soon assured of an initiative in this direction. Poddar has expressed his gratitude to Railway Minister Piyush Goyal for honoring the suggestion.

Goyal informed that toilets have been provided in loco engine cabs on trial basis. Drinking water facilities have been provided to the employees in the running rooms and crew lobbies. Cabin-wise arrangements have been made in Zone-wise 1914 Adal locomotives till January 2020. Cab ACs are being fitted in new rail locomotives being manufactured by production units and factories have been asked to arrange cab ACs during periodic overhauling of electric rail locomotives.

Goyal informed that the facility of wash rooms and toilets has been started in new electric locomotives. All new electric locomotives will be provided with washrooms / toilets based on the test results.

Apart from this, all the new electric rail locomotives have more space cabs, which are ergonomically designed for the comfort and convenience of the crew. More than two-thirds of the running rooms already have air conditioning. Desert coolers are currently being provided for the rest of the running rooms. Separate rooms and running rooms are provided with toilet facilities to the female running staff.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/poddar---s-suggestions-prod-railways-to-improve-facilities-for-loco-pilots.html

A cautious Government has already deferred the Adventure Summit slated to start at Ramnagar from March 20 and the Wellness Summit which was to be held in Dehradun on April 17-18. The authorities here are anxious as the world famous, Char Dham Yatra is commencing from last week of April. Lakhs of pilgrims from all parts of the country visit the state during the Yatra season. An estimated 38 lakh pilgrims had visited the state in the last year’s Char Dham Yatra.

The Tourism and Culture minister Satpal Maharaj accepted that the Char Dham Yatra would be a major challenge for the state. He said that scanning facilities to check and isolate suspected patients of the disease would be set up at various places along the Char Dham Yatra route.

The minister added that the health department teams would be deployed on the Yatra route and the special measures would be taken to combat the disease. The health department teams are already deployed at all airports and major railway stations to scan suspected patients of viral infections. Special vigil is being taken along the Indo-Nepal border.

The symptoms of the Coronavirus are similar to that of normal influenza. The symptoms include incessant fever, cough, irritation in throat, difficulty in breathing and pneumonia.

The medical experts advice that people should cover their mouth and face while sneezing and should wash their hands and face regularly to prevent spread of the disease.

People should avoid going to crowded places and refrain from shaking hands with others. Those suffering from fever and cough should immediately take medical advice. People are also being asked not to eat raw or semi cooked meat and egg.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-govt-prepared-for-coronavirus-threat--min.html
78,07-3-20,Nipping nefarious designs before Holi in Palamu,"Palamu police in a swift and prompt preemptive measure ‘diluted and defused’ the growing chasm between the Hindus and the Muslims at village Loinga under Paton police station today where under the stewardship of SDPO Sadar Sandip Kumar Gupta the Paton police held a peace meet where signatures of people coming from the two communities the Hindus and the Muslims were duly obtained for the vows of the maintenance of law and order and peace and harmony this coming Holi festival which falls on March 10.

The signature obtaining cum peace meet was going on smoothly when a couple of people there raised the issue of some piece of gair majrua land at Loinga charging the other community, who they said had an intent to grab and encroach it for their own community’s benefit.

One person from a community wanted to install a long size idol of a deity in open. Before this man could have finished his line or added some lines to it SDPO Gupta interrupted him asking “Then you will ask for a temple to be built there. Lord Hanuman in open without roof. Your design is something different. This cannot be allowed at all.”

Sensing the tough stand of Gupta the man who had raised the issue of installing the idol of Lord Hanuman there in open at Loinga the man changed his tone and text when this man suggested this gair majrua land be demarcated there which will be used by the Hindus and the Muslims too.

The Muslims sitting in this signature meet for peace immediately hailed this suggestion and thus a resolution was adopted there to get this piece of gair majrua land demarcated after Holi for the benefits of both the communities.

Gupta had to tongue beat one Jay Mistri of Loinga village when this youth asked the SDPO as to when this demarcation will be done. SDPO retorted, “Should you give us date line? Be within your limits.” The man sunk in to his chair thereafter.

SP Palamu Ajay Linda said, “This Thursday I held a meeting with my police officials over Holi and I have directed my men to ensure peace and harmony do not get broken at all.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/nipping-nefarious-designs-before-holi-in-palamu.html

81,07-3-20,"Homeopathic, Ayurvedic remedies galore amid Coronavirus fear","The fear of Coronavirus has caused a sudden surge in the demand for Homeopathic and Ayurvedic immunity-enhancers in Ranchi – a trend that has led to long queues of hopeful customers outside smalltime shops, waiting to get their hands on ‘antidotes’ that could keep the lethal virus at bay.

While medical science does not believe in Homeopathy and refers to it as pseudo-science, hundreds of Ranchiites have bestowed their trust upon homeopathic drugs to save them from the virus that has wreaked havoc in the world. Shiva Homeo Hall at Sainik Marked on Mahatma Gandhi Road is one of the many homeopathic medicine stores in Ranchi that has successfully marketed its products as remedy against the virus.

This shop is selling Arsenic ALB30 as a drug that can prevent the spread of Coronavirus. In fact, the shop has also put up a poster which says, ‘Prevention of Coronavirus’ and carries the names of two medicines that are sold at the shop. “Our Arsenic ALB 30 and Arsenic ALB 200 are effective in protection against Coronavirus. The medicines are not very expensive and can be bought by people from all economic classes,” said Dr. Santosh, who runs the homeopathic shop.

Besides Homeopathy, the demand for Ayurvedic pills has also witnessed a surge in Ranchi soon after the Coronavirus fear gripped India. Social media pages run by Ayurvedic doctors have helped in spreading awareness among Ranchi-ites about the virus and also informed them about the Ayurvedic line of treatment and prevention. “Ashwagandha is a natural immunity enhancer. Since any virus affects you when your immunity is low, consuming Ashwagandha can be a great preventive measure,” said Shushil Kumar, an Ayurveda expert who runs a shop in Bariatu.

Medical practitioners, however, say that believing in any form of pseudo-science may do more harm than good. “I will not comment on the effectiveness of Homeopathy and Ayurveda. But they may cause more harm than good, and people should ideally seek proper medical treatment if they witness any of the symptoms similar to that of Coronavirus,” said Superintendent of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), Dr. Vivek Kashyap.

At least 80 residents of Jharkhand are under observation amid Coronavirus fear, but none of them have tested positive in the tests so far, officials from the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) have said. As many as 21 persons are under observation for Coronavirus in Jamshedpur – the highest among all the major cities in Jharkhand, IDSP officials said.

The team also arrested three persons, including the trader involved in collecting illicit country-made liquor from various pockets from the rural pockets in the East Singhbhum district and selling them in the city. Those arrested have been identified as Nagendra Shao, the illicit liquor trader, Sahjada Ansari and Amar Kumar Mahto.

Revealing about the breakthrough, an official said that total quantity of illicit liquor was 750 litres. ""Acting on a tip-off we acted against those involved. The country-made liquor was stuffed in truck tyres and was being carried in an auto-rickshaw from MGM police station area's Bhilai Pahari to Ulidih in Mango. As we stopped the vehicle, the three accused tried to flee, but we nabbed them,"" said the official.

""In view of Holi we have started patrolling the area and are conducting such raids to nab those involved in the racket. While patrolling, a villager in Bhilai Pahari locality tipped off that an auto-rickshaw carrying country-made liquor stuffed in tubes will pass through the place. As we received the information, we were waiting for the vehicle, and as it appeared from a muddy road in Bhilai Pahari, we intercepted it. The information was correct. We made the seizure and arrested the accused,"" said the official.

Notably, the steel city has a history of manufacturing of duplicate liquor as the district police had in the past busted several rackets of duplicate liquor manufacturing units, especially from the localities like Bagbera, Jugsalai and Kadma. Knowledgeable sources maintain that the racketeers of duplicate liquors use to do the rebottling of the brand which has the maximum demands, and when the liquor shop owners do a brisk business on such occasions, they tend to sell the duplicate stuff.

""Even during Holi sale of liquor from the retail shops goes up manifold. It has been seen from the records that just during 48 hours before the festival of colour, the liquor shop owners sell stuff worth over Rs 5 crores, which is during ordinary time hardly cross the Rs 1 crore within the same period of time. Taking advantage of the craze for liqour among the people, some unscrupulous shop-owners tend to sell duplicate liquor,"" said the official.

90,07-3-20,MCD levies penalty on commercial bodies,"The penalty of about Rs 500 to Rs 5,000 is being imposed on all the commercial bodies that litter nearby their buildings by Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) under the new campaign ‘Main Besharam Vyakti Hun’ (I am a shameless person).

MCD has begun its new sanitation campaign in which the team of the corporation inspects the commercial enterprises like restaurants, cafes, stores and shops of the city. If there is no dustbin outside the building and any kind of garbage is found in or near any of these sites, the team pastes a certificate outside the building that states the management as a publically dirty person. The certificate states, “I certify that I am a shameless person, I live in filth and it is my habit to spread filth. I will soon receive the first prize for being a publically dirty person.” Through this campaign, MCD has pasted such certificates in more than eight commercial properties so far that include Domino’s, KFC, Soup Bar, Ginger Grapes Restaurant and some small shops.

Informing about the campaign, the municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey said, “Our team carries out on the spot inspection across the city and if any garbage is found lying around near the commercial building, a penalty is levied on the management besides pasting the certificate declaring it a ‘shameless person’. Some pay the penalty immediately and some submit it in the corporation later.” Talking about the penalty levied on the management Pandey said that the penalty imposed is from Rs 500 to Rs 5,000 according to the litter spread by the management. Regarding the state of the ‘certificate’ pasted after the penalty is paid, Pandey said, “They are free to do whatever they choose to do with it. It is not our duty to look after the certificate. We intend to spread awareness among all the commercial bodies of the city about the importance of sanitation which is generally neglected by them.”

He further added that the administration of commercial bodies should put the garbage in garbage collection vehicles of MCD rather than throwing it on the streets or nearby. If the garbage collection vehicles are not coming to their area, they should complain on the helpline number of the corporation but in no way is the littering on the roads justifiable, said Pandey.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mcd-levies-penalty-on-commercial-bodies.html

Sharing his experiences of the Supreme Court, he said that at times, both sides present legally logical arguments in a case but it is mediation which can help in resolving many cases. The opportunity to acquire the knowledge of law is gained either with a tacher or from observing senior advocates and judges, he added. Earlier, the university vice chancellor welcomed the supreme court justice and other guests on the occasion.

The man, identified as 55 year old Ramkrishna, was sleeping in a residential area adjacent to the forest when the incident occurred.

People present at the site averred that the elephant had attacked the man. Before that, the elephant broke a temporary shop nearby. Police station officer Rakendra Kathait said that the monk Ramakrishna had been living in the Swargashram area for the long time.

At around 2 AM, an elephant arrived outside the Bhootnath temple in the Swargashram area. The pachyderm first broke a kuccha construction being used as a shop. The jumbo then entered the Bhootnath temple compound and reportedly killed the man sleeping there. Hearing the screams of the man, the people living nearby reached the spot and immediately informed the forest department staff of the Gauhari range. The forest workers who reached the spot fired a round in the air and drove the elephant into the forest.

The injured monk was taken to AIIMS in Rishikesh where he was declared dead by the doctors.

According to the forest department, an elephant has been roaming in the Swargashram and nearby residential area for the past several days.

97,07-3-20,‘3-layred mask as good as N95 against Coronavirus’,"Three-layered surgical masks are as effective as N95 masks in protection against Novel Coronavirus, authorities at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) said on Friday. The overwhelming surge in the demand for N95 masks and its subsequent crisis in the market amid Coronavirus fear are outcome of panic and rumours, they added.

“It is a misconception that only N95 masks can protect against Coronavirus. The three-layered surgical masks, which doctors use in almost every medical facility, are as effective as N95 masks, if not better,” said RIMS Superintendent Dr. Vivek Kashyap. He added that some companies were using social media platforms to spread such misconceptions in order to increase the demand for N95 masks.

The demand for N95 masks has skyrocketed across the country, including Jharkhand, since the fear of Novel Coronavirus gripped Indian citizens. While social media and websites are flooded with unchecked information about the mysterious virus and ways to prevent it from spreading, N95 masks have disappeared from the shelves of surgical stores and medicine shops across the State. Many medicine shop owners say that there is no supply of N95 masks in Jharkhand and the old stocks have been sold out. These masks have also disappeared from online shopping portals lately.

“There is no supply of N95 masks in Ranchi. The demand for these masks has increased in the metros, especially Delhi, and the suppliers do not have enough stock to supply to other States,” said OP Singh, staff at a medicine store on Kanke Road in Ranchi.

Meanwhile, reports about lack of preparedness of RIMS in fighting Coronavirus due to crisis of N95 masks have caused panic among residents of the State capital. “We have more than 1 lakh three-layered surgical masks. They can be used in protection against Coronavirus. All patients and attendants coming to RIMS are safe,” said RIMS Superintendent Dr. Kashyap.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a health regulatory body in the United State of America (USA) where Coronavirus has affected more people than in India, says that N95 respirators are not recommended for use by common public. The official website of FDA says, ‘For the general American public, there is no added health benefit of wearing a respiratory protective device (such as an N95 respirator).’

At least eight patients were kept under observation at RIMS’ Isolation Ward in the past one month or so and seven of them have tested negative for Coronavirus. The report of the eighth patient is likely to reach RIMS by Saturday. “We have an 18-bed Isolation Ward especially for patients who complain of symptoms similar to that of Coronavirus. There is no need to panic,” said RIMS Director Dr. DK Singh.

At least 80 residents of Jharkhand are under observation amid Coronavirus fear, but none of them have tested positive in the tests so far, officials from the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) have said. As many as 21 persons are under observation for Coronavirus in Jamshedpur – the highest among all the major cities in Jharkhand, IDSP officials said. As many as eight people are under observation in Capital Ranchi and 16 in Saraikela, they added. Around eight people are under observation in Bokaro too.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---3-layred-mask-as-good-as-n95-against-coronavirus---.html
98,07-3-20,Decision elicits mixed response from people in Dehradun,"During the ongoing Vidhan Sabha session at Bharadisain in Gairsain, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat announced that Gairsain will be the summer capital of the state. This decision has elicited considerable praise from various quarters but has also resulted in criticism and questions being raised by some.

The locals of the provisional state capital Dehradun expressed mixed opinions on the announcement made by the chief minister on making Gairsain the summer capital of Uttarakhand. Some people think that this decision by the State Government will help in the development of mountainous rural areas whereas a few believe that it will not achieve much.

“I am glad that finally the place which actually deserves to be the capital of Uttarakhand got the approval and recognition of the government. Though I am not sure why they did not make Gairsain the permanent and only capital of the state, I am with the decision of making it a summer capital because now it will hopefully garner the attention of officials and public which will help in the growth and progress of mountainous rural areas,” said a school teacher Anju Rawat.

According to a retired army officer Sanjay Binola, “The proposal for making Gairsain the capital of Uttarakhand was long awaiting a decision. Many successive governments have come and gone in about 20 years since Uttarakhand was created but at last the Trivendra Singh Rawat led government finally took this historic decision.”

According to a post graduate student Deepak Khansali, “Our government is just trying to distract the citizens from the major issues facing the State. The government has reduced the price of alcohol but made the cooking gas expensive. Such a big fraud in the Forest Guard recruitment exam has come to light in the state, but the chief minister has still not annulled the exam.

The State Government should work on the things and issues that already exist at the surface rather than making such announcement just to distract and cheer up the people.” Meanwhile, the protesting members of Gairsain Rajdhani Nirman Andolan said that this is only half the battle won; they will continue their protest untill the State Government announces Gairsain as the permanent capital of Uttarakhand.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/decision-elicits-mixed-response-from-people-in-dehradun.html

He said that when the JMM and Congress were in the opposition, they had accused that dozens of starvation deaths took place during the tenure of the Raghubar government and did fierce politics on the issue.

“Similarly, the Hemant government, which came to power by promising to amend the local policy, has written in the Legislative Assembly that there will be no amendment in the local policy,” he said.

Pratul said that at the time when the ruling parties were in opposition, the local policy was called anti-tribal and they had said before coming to power, the local policy will be amended through the Cabinet. Now, they have proved that they just wanted to come to power by any means.

101,07-3-20,Coronavirus scare hits Holi items sale in Doon,"With just a few days left for Holi to be celebrated on March 10, the sale of the Holi colours and water guns has not reached even 50 per cent due to the Coronavirus factor.

The outbreak of Coronavirus in China and some other parts of the world has affected the market of Holi items in Dehradun. According to the local shopkeepers and vendors, every year about 60 per cent items used in Holi are imported from China.

Due to the low cost of items, the shopkeepers as well as the customers prefer the Chinese items. However, the threat of Coronavirus has compelled the sellers as well as the buyers to avoid these items.

According to a shopkeeper in Hanuman Chowk Anmol Gupta, “We generally sell made in India items during the Holi festival as people have been asking for Indian made colours and other items for the past two to three years.

However, this year the people are checking each and every article to see if it is made in India or not to ensure that no Chinese products are being sold to them. Not just water guns and balloons, people are also checking the moulds used to make gujiyas for their safety.

Those who have imported the Chinese Holi items at wholesale rates during December will be facing great loss this year.”

“This year the number of people coming to buy balloons and water guns is very low. Due to coronavirus, we cannot sell the leftover stock of Chinese Holi items from the last year. Not that they are infected, but this year people are more inclined to the Indian items. However, some people are buying the Chinese items who are more concerned about the money than Coronavirus risk but the number of such people is very low,” said Amitash Maheshwari, a shopkeeper in Paltan Bazaar.

The shopkeepers opined that exams of children and consistently changing weather are also responsible for the low sale of Holi items and they hope that the sale will be better in the last two days ahead of Holi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/coronavirus-scare-hits--holi-items-sale-in-doon.html
102,07-3-20,Govt institutions delay in paying property tax,"While many private institutions are frequently submitting the property tax in Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD), several Government institutions have not done the same so far.

Property tax is one of the important revenue sources for the MCD, especially the property tax on non-residential buildings. The non-residential properties generate a lot more revenue than residential properties and contribute substantially to the overall collection of the property tax by the corporation.

According to Dehradun municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey, the private institutions are regularly submitting the property tax whereas the management of very few government buildings has actually deposited the tax. “The corporation is receiving more property tax from private institutions than from the government organisations.

Many private institutions have deposited the property tax like DIT University submitted Rs 65 lakh, Uttaranchal University submitted Rs 45 lakh and the Pacific Mall submitted Rs five crore whereas the property tax received from the Government properties is negligible so far. Property tax amounting Rs eight to nine crore is pending from the government organisations,” said Pandey. He also added that after the due date, penalty will be imposed on the properties of the government organisations too.

Besides, Pandey also confirmed that the municipal corporation has revised the target of Rs 50 crore which was initially set at Rs 75 crore just to set the bar high for the team. Last month, MCD had issued notices to about 92 government, semi-government and aided institutions of the city following which some of them have paid the property tax.

Reportedly the property tax of some major buildings like State Infrastructure and Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (SIIDCUL), Forest Research Institute (FRI), Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority (MDDA), Inter State Bus Terminal (ISBT) and Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) hospital is reportedly pending which is collectively more than Rs Four crore. The delay in the submission of the property tax by these institutions is posing hindrance to the MCD in meeting its target of collecting Rs 50 crore in property tax by the end of this month. However till now more than Rs 42 crore has been collected by MCD and Pandey is optimistic that the set target will be achieved by the end of March.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-institutions-delay-in-paying-property-tax.html

Srivastava further said that the society does not show much interest in women’s sports and related news, while it should give due respect to women by providing them the appropriate platform and opportunities to increase their participation in sports.

Speaking on the occasion Professor Rekha Singhal said on women empowerment that women are born strong. “If society changes its thinking and attitude towards them, then we do not need to do anything more, and she will achieve her desired position on her own. Society must accept and learn how to treat that strong girl. Women empowerment is not to be done by women but by society,” she added.

MECON’s GM MM Dasgupta said, “We have seen that women are more forward and ready for voluntary work in any organization. At present, the institutions are providing equal opportunities to a woman as well; it is up to you to use it for yourself through your work and hard work. Trouble comes when a woman misuses something like taking unnecessary holidays with children, etc. In an organization, they should be ready to work and work at par with men.”

Ending the round table discussion, PIB Additional Director General Arimardan Singh discussed the efforts being made by the Government for the all round development of women in various fields and the changes that have taken place at all levels.

In this event, the students of IIM Ranchi, especially the large number of students present, cleared their doubts and queries from experts.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pib-holds-discussion-on-women---s-empowerment.html

Hussain is accused of killing of Intelligence Bureau (IB) official Ankit Sharma during the recent violence in North-east Delhi’s Chand Bagh.

""Duty Magistrate Rakesh Kumar passed the order after Hussain was produced before him by Delhi Police which said that his custodial interrogation was required to unearth larger conspiracy,"" said Hussain's lawyer, Mukesh Kalia.

Hussain was produced before the duty magistrate amid tight security late in the evening and neither the media nor any lawyer, other than those connected with the case, was allowed inside the courtroom.

Hussain was arrested on Thursday after a court here dismissed his plea seeking to surrender before it in connection with the case. The court rejected his plea saying that the relief sought by him was outside its jurisdiction. Hussain moved the surrender application before the court saying that he was willing to join the investigation and wanted to surrender in the case.

Advocate Kalia argued before the court that there was a grave apprehension of threat to his life and therefore he has not surrendered before competent court as there is ""charged environment"" in Karkardooma District court.

The lawyer said Hussain has been falsely implicated in the case and sought protection for his life and property. As the court dismissed Hussain's plea, a Delhi Police team, which had already arrived, arrested him and took him into custody.

Meanwhile, a police official said that Special Investigation Teams (SITs) are interrogating Hussain and they are trying to ascertain his role behind the murder of Ankit Sharma (26) whose body was found in a drain near Chand bagh with multiple stab wounds on February 26.

120,07-3-20,UP govt working on labour reforms PNS,"The Uttar Pradesh government, with the objective of improving the ranking of the state in ease of doing business (EODB), is working on key labour reforms to bring it at par with other industrialised states like Maharashtra and Gujarat.

While the UP government is studying best labour-related practices in other states, it is also in the process of implementing the ‘reform action plan’ framework of the Centre.

UP Labour Minister Swami Prasad Maurya said the government was already working on the labour reforms agenda and it would soon be placed before the state cabinet for approval.

He said labour reforms was an ongoing process and the state Industrial Development and Labour departments were proactively engaged in resolving the irritants faced by the industry.

As the Yogi Adityanath government has set the target of UP hitting a $1-trillion economy by 2024 in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of making India a $5-trillion economy by that year, the state has been working on a slew of measures, including tweaking its policies to attract investment.

At the recent CII’s ‘UP Economic Summit’ here, industrialists had urged the UP government to expedite labour reforms, especially with regards to the beleaguered small and medium enterprises (SME), so that they could better face market competition, especially during the economic slowdown.

The key demands of the MSMEs are provision of fixed-term and contractual labour so that they may exercise control on their fixed costs and pare expenses and production according to the market demand.

At the same time, the process of collecting statistics pertaining to labour and employment in the state has traditionally been sloppy.

However, the state government has so far taken some steps to liberalise labour laws, including the raising of the ceiling from 100 to 300 workers for the sick units to exit without seeking a special certificate from the Labour department.

Besides, the ceiling has also been raised from 10 to 20 workers and from 20 to 40 workers for units without and with power supply respectively for mandatory registration with the Labour department.

Another major reform is the increase in ceiling for mandatory registration of firms for ESI and pension records from 20 to 50 contractual labour. According to an estimate, UP has nearly 15,000 industrial units employing more than 25 workers each, while nearly 85 per cent of the units have less than 300 workers.

However, there are labour related issues which have yet not been addressed, such as the provision of overtime to workers. The current state laws restrict workers to work overtime beyond a certain limit even if they are willing to earn additional income. Although, the state has relaxed the overtime norms to some extent, yet the industry has been seeking greater flexibility.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-govt-working--on-labour-reforms----pns--.html
121,07-3-20,CBI takes over probe into UPPCL PF scam,"More trouble is in store for some senior officials of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) as after waiting for over four months, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has finally decided to take over probe into the Rs 4,122-crore scam in which provident fund money of the power employees was invested in the tainted Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL).

The UP government had sent a letter to the CBI on November 2, 2019, asking the central agency to take over the investigation of the power employees’ PF scam from the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of UP Police.

Official sources here on Friday confirmed that the EOW case (number 540/2019) registered against the accused under sections 409, 420, 467, 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code at Hazratganj police station had been transferred to the CBI police station on Thursday.

As per the fresh FIR of the CBI, lodged on behalf of CBI Anti-Corruption Bureau’s Superintendent of Police Raghavendra Vatsa, CBI-ACB inspector Sabhajeet Chauhan will be the investigating officer in the case.

The CBI investigating officer would take all the documents of the case from the EOW in a day or two, sources said.

The EOW has already arrested 17 accused, including UPPCL’s former Managing Director AP Mishra, and all are in judicial custody at present.

The government had lodged a FIR on November 2, 2019 in the scam after it came to light that UPPCL employees’ PF trust had deposited the provident fund money in the DHFL, a company which was in deep trouble after facing several scam charges.

On the same day, the investigation was recommended to the CBI but the EOW was asked to continue with the probe till the central agency took over the probe.

In the EOW investigation, it was found that share brokers were involved in the scam along with some senior UPPCL officials.

On the other hand, the Enforcement Directorate had also started investigation in the alleged money laundering of UPPCL employees’ provident fund which was parked with DHFL. The EOW investigation report said that Rs 4,122 crore was parked with DHFL between March 2017 and December 2018. The funds were allegedly invested in connivance with officials managing the two UPPCL PF trusts via 28 brokerages or bogus firms. Funds were also parked in LIC Housing Finance and PNB Housing Finance, taking the total investment to Rs 6,600 crore. As of now, Rs 2,267 crore is still pending with DHFL.

The Bombay High Court had barred the DHFL from making fresh repayments on account of a different money laundering probe by the ED.

However, when the UPPCL employees staged protest over the scam, the Yogi Adityanath government had made a commitment that the government would bear all the loss and the employees would not suffer.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cbi-takes-over---probe-into-uppcl-pf-scam.html

Accompanied by his wife and state minister son and other Shiv Sena leaders Thackeray will reach the temple city by a special flight on Saturday morning, a Shiv Sena leader said here.

He said that a train load of Shiv Sainiks had reached Ayodhya by a special train from Mumbai.

The special train having 18 coaches reached Ayodhya on Friday evening. It had left for Ayodhya from Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT) on Thursday. The train will return to Mumbai on March 9.

123,07-3-20,PM: For us nation-building is conviction to do right things,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday hit out at 'right talking' critics of his Government's decisions such as the new citizenship law and scrapping of special status for Jammu & Kashmir, saying they have hatred for people who walk the path of 'doing the right things' and break the status quo.

Speaking at the ET Global Business Summit, he said the global economy has been going through a difficult phase but the fundamentals of the Indian economy are strong and policies are clear that will aid in reaching the target of nearly doubling the size of the economy to USD 5 trillion.

In his strongest attack on critics yet, Modi said the 'right talking' gang advocates for rights of migrants world over but are opposed to India giving citizenship to persecuted minorities of neighbouring nations.

This gang talks of the protecting the Constitution but opposes the removal of temporary provision of Article 370 and full implementation of the Indian Constitution in Jammu & Kashmir, he said.

“There is nothing wrong with talking the right things. But these people have a particular hatred for people who are doing the right things,” he said. “So when changes are brought in status quo, they see this as disruptions.”

“People who project themselves as the messiah of gender justice are against triple talaq law,” he said. “People who talk of justice don't hesitate to question the intention of the highest court of the land when one judgment of the Supreme Court is not in their favour.”

The Prime Minister said when his party first won elections in 2014, it had the option of walking down the beaten track or take a new route with a fresh approach.

“We opted for the new road that gave priority to aspirations of people,” he said. “For us, nation-building is not about development, good governance, and convenience but about our conviction - conviction to do the right things, the conviction to break the status quo.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pm--for-us-nation-building-is-conviction-to-do-right-things.html
124,07-3-20,Concern over Jagannath's `545 crore deposit,"Devotees of Lord Jagannath and priests at the centuries-old temple in Puri are worried following RBI restrictions on Yes Bank where Rs 545 crore is deposited in the deity's name.

The RBI has capped withdrawals from Yes Bank at Rs 50,000 for the next one month and imposed strict limits on operations after the cash-starved lender faced “regular outflow of liquidity” following an effort to raise new capital failed. The RBI restrictions on Yes Bank have caused panic among the devotees, said senior

'Daitapati' (servitor) Binayak Dasmohaopatra. “We demand a thorough probe and action against the persons responsible for depositing such a huge amount in a private bank for a little more interest,” he said.

“It is illegal as well as unethical to deposit the lord's funds in a private bank. Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA) and the Temple's Managing Committee should be held responsible for the uncertainty,” said Jagannath Sena convenor Priyadarshi Patnaik.

He said a complaint was filed at a police station in Puri demanding probe over depositing the money in a private bank, but no action was taken.

Allaying concerns, Law Minister Pratap Jena said the money is with the bank as fixed deposits and not in a savings account. “The Government has already decided to transfer the funds from Yes Bank to a nationalised bank after tenures of the fixed deposits end this month,” he said.

Asked whether the government has taken up the matter with the RBI, the Minister said, “I have not talked to the bank authorities so far. I am sure, we will be able to transfer the money from Yes Bank without any problem.” Former law minister and ex-Puri MLA Maheswar Mohanty said it was not proper to keep the money with a private bank for more interest.

“The SJTA should immediately take up the matter with the RBI and ensure that the money is safe,” Mohanty said.The law minister last month told the assembly that of the lord's total Rs 626.44 crore, Rs 592 crore was kept in Yes Bank.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/concern-over-jagannath-s---545-crore-deposit.html
125,07-3-20,"Tirupati Temple withdrew Rs 1,300 crore last year","Authorities at the richest temple here withdrew Rs 1,300 crore from crisis-hit Yes Bank late last year.

Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), which manages the affairs of Tirumala temple, on Friday said the money was withdrawn in October and it had nothing to do with the crisis in the bank.

The clarification came following the moratorium imposed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on withdrawals from Yes Bank till April 3.

A spokesperson of the temple body clarified that the money was withdrawn on maturity of the deposit term in October. “We have officials who monitor deposits in banks and the maturity periods. It's not that we suddenly withdrew the amount,” he said.

TTD officials said that they act as per the decisions of the board with regard to depositing money or gold in banks. They pointed out that in November last year, the board decided to deposit money only in nationalised banks.

The temple body earlier deposited funds in private banks because of the higher interest rates offered by them.

TTD's cash deposits in the banks crossed Rs 12,000 crore in April last year. The board recently projected Rs 706 crore income from interest on deposits for 2020-21.

The body that governs the shrine last week approved a budget of Rs 3,309 crore. The income from deposits is the second highest source of income after offerings made by the pilgrims (Rs 1,313 crore).",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/tirupati-temple-withdrew-rs-1-300-crore-last-year.html

Yes Bank has over 1,000 branches and 1,800-plus ATMs across the country which are under severe stress after the crisis erupted last night.

Earlier in the day, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the bank was put under watch since 2017 and developments relating to it were being monitored on a day-to-day basis. “Since 2017, the central bank noticed governance issues and weak regulatory compliance at Yes Bank, besides wrong asset classification and risky credit decisions,” the Finance Minister said.

Certainly, cleanliness is a major issue and there isn't enough NGO staff, Anthony said. ""They are already doing so much. In such a case, there's always the risk of infection and diseases,"" he said.

Firdaus, 39, said she remained awake the entire night as her tent was leaking.

This court room, created for the first time, will teach, train and work towards curbing road accidents and traffic snarls in Delhi and across the nation.

The court room was inaugurated by the lieutenant Governor (LG) of Pondicherry Kiran Bedi on Friday.

The main agenda behind the court room is to train the traffic police officials in dealing with road accidents and the judicial and prosecutors to deal the accident case, traffic fines cases and announcing punishments in the matter of road safety issues.

""If we see in foreign countries for instance United Kingdom (UK), they have a proper management to deal with an accident.

132,07-3-20,SP slams govt for ‘name & shame’ posters of anti-CAA protesters,"Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has slammed the Uttar Pradesh government for “name and shame of anti-CAA protesters” by putting up posters of 57 protesters at public places in state capital.

The authorities in Lucknow have put up roadside banners with photographs of people asked to pay compensation for damage to public property during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

UP government spokesman and cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh defended the move saying “the name and shame of rioters will put a deterrent in the Yogi Adityanath rule and is as per the law of the land”.

“It is an affront to the democratic rights of the common citizens by the Yogi Adityanath government, which is bent on trampling on the democratic rights of the citizens. Such act of divesting the citizens of their democratic rights can never be done by the government and amounts to declaring them as criminal without judicial adjudication,” Yadav said.

He added, “The Yogi Adityanath government, in a unilateral decision, has unleashed repression against the anti CAA protesters.”

The SP chief said the government’s act of putting up the posters of the anti-CAA protesters and asking the common people to identify them could not be justified on any ground.

“The protesters cannot be vilified and declared criminal by the government without any charge sheet and judicial trial,” the SP chief said. He warned that the people could also put up hoardings and posters of Bharatiya Janata Party leaders against whom deep resentment prevailed among the common man.

Yadav said, “The Yogi Adityanath government must conduct itself within the framework of democracy and dignity.”

The SP chief said the BJP represented the ugly face of democracy where the core obligation of a political party was to terrorise democracy. He said India was a constitutional democracy but BJP had no faith in democracy, adding that dissent was a right enshrined in the Constitution.

Yadav said it was most insensitive on the part of the chief minister statement to say “if someone is willing to die, will ultimately die”.

The SP chief said that the UP government, instead of initiating dialogue with the people, had adopted dictatorial attitude.

Yadav had earlier accused Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath of inciting violence in the state “to save his chair”.

Yadav had said the violent protests against the CAA in Lucknow and other parts of the state were incited by Yogi Adityanath and the BJP and it was done deliberately to divert the attention after more than 200 MLAs of the ruling party sat on dharna inside the state assembly.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sp-slams-govt-for----name---shame-----posters-of-anti-caa-protesters.html
133,07-3-20,"Ex-principal, two docs reinstated by govt","The Yogi Adityanath government has reinstated three doctors who were suspended following the alleged oxygen scarcity at BRD Medical College hospital in Gorakhpur that had led to the death of over 60 children, 23 of them in one night, in August 2017.

Another doctor, Dr Kafeel Khan, who was also suspended, was initially absolved of all charges in the departmental enquiry, but he is in jail after being booked under National Security Act for his alleged hate speech during a protest against the Citizenship (Amendmant) Act.

On March 4, Governor Anandiben Patel signed the government order reinstating former principal of BRD Medical College, Dr Rajiv Mishra, anesthetist Dr Satish Kumar and Dr Purnima Shukla, Dr Shukla has retired and all her retirement benefits have been cleared after the Governor signed the order.

Dr Khan, who was pediatrician at the BRD Medical College hospial at that time, was suspended along with these doctors, is still facing an enquiry in this case. At present he is lodged in Mathura jail after being booked under NSA.

Interestingly, in August 2019, Dr Khan was absolved of the charges of medical negligence, corruption and dereliction of duty on the day when the children died due to oxygen shortage.

Investigating officer Himanshu Kumar, Principal Secretary (Stamps & Registration Department), had submitted the report of his probe into the deaths to the Medical Education department on April 18, 2019. But neither the UP government take any action on it, nor did it make the report public. It came to light only in September.

Of the four charges levelled against him, Dr Khan was found guilty of indulging in private practice and being attached to a private nursing home in Gorakhpur till April 2017.

A few days after Dr Khan was absolved of the charges of negligence, the Yogi government had ordered a fresh probe into allegations of indiscipline, corruption and gross negligence while on duty against him.

An official told this reporter that Dr Khan’s suspension was not revoked because an enquiry was still pending against him.

“Moreover, he is facing NSA charges for hate speech. So, as per government rules, his suspension continues,” the official said.

The death of children at BRD Medical College hospital due to alleged shortage of oxygen in August 2017 had become a major issue for the Yogi government, which had been sworn in barely five months before the tragedy. Subesequently, the state government had suspended nine people, including four doctors.

134,07-3-20,Sena roots for representation in Ram Temple trust,"A day ahead of Shiv Sena president and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s visit to Ayodhya, the Shiv Sena on Friday reiterated its demand for representation on the 15-member autonomous trust set for the construction of Ram temple at Lord Ram’s birthplace of Lord Ram in Uttar Pradesh.

In a letter written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the eve of Uddhav’s visit to Ayodhya, senior Shiv Sena leader and MLA Pratap Sarnaik said: “The Union Government recently announced the formation of a 15-member trust to undertake the work of construction of a Ram temple at Ayodhya. We regret that you have chosen to ignore the contribution of the Shiv Sena in the campaign for the construction of Ram Temple at Ayodhya”

“You will recall that after the Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992, late Balasaheb Thackeray had taken responsibility for the development. His stand had sparked a controversy in the country. Despite the angry reactions from different quarters, late Bala saheb had stuck to his stand. No one can forget the stand taken by late Balasaheb then and the contribution of thousands of Shiv Sainiks in the prolonged agitation for Ram temple,” Sarnaik wrote.

Sarnaik went onto urge the Prime Minister to nominate a fervent “Ram bakt” from the Shiv Sainik as member on the Ram temple construction trust formed by the Centre.

Uddhav is visiting Ayodhya on Saturday on the occasion of Shiv Sena-headed Maha Vikas Aghadi government completing the 100 days in office.

As per the schedule drawn up by the ruling Shiv Sena, Uddhav – along with Shiva Sainiks –will have darshan of Lord Shriram on Saturday afternoon. He will perform Aarati on the ghats of Sarayu river in the evening.

Ahead of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s visit to Ayodhya on Saturday, a special train carrying Shiv Sena activists had on Thursday afternoon left from Mumbai’s Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT) to the temple town in Uttar Pradesh.

Uddhav’s visit is being seen as attempt to send a message across to the Sena cadres as well the Opposition BJP that the there is no erosion in his party’s Hindutva credentials even after forming a government with “secular” Congress and NCP.

Uddhav, who had announced after the Supreme Court verdict in the Ayoidhya dispute case that he would go once again Ayodhya on November 24, 2019, had postponed his visit then, owing to the impasse in the government formation in the state. The public perception was that the Sena would soft-peddle its Hindutva agenda as long as it is running the government in the state with the Congress and NCP.

It may be recalled that Uddhav had on November 25, 2018 – along with his wife Rashmi and son Aditya, had visited Ayodhya. On June 16, 2019 year after the Lok Sabha polls, he once again visited Ayodhya and offered prayers at the makeshift Ram Lalla

shrine.

The stand taken by Sarnaik is line with the stand taken by the Shiv Sena in an editorial published in its official mouth-piecre “Saamana” which that the then to-be appointed temple trust should have representation of all the organisations which campaigned for the temple construction, if it is an “autonomous body”.

The Shiv Sena, which had long campaigned for the temple construction, said that it was active in the campaign for temple construction from day one.

“The BJP itself had then admitted that the Shiv Sainiks landed hammers on the Babri (mosque) and the (then) Shiv Sena chief (late Bal Thackeray) said he was proud of the Shiv Sainiks who brought down the Babri,” the editorial had averred.

Maintaining that hundreds of Shiv Sainiks “laid their lives” in the violence after the Babri mosque demolition, the editorial had said: “Those who gave the slogan of 'Jai Shri Ram' should keep this in mind .Recalling L K Advani's role in the campaign, the Shiv Sena said the BJP would not have attained the current position in country's politics had the veteran leader not taken out a 'rath yatra' in the name of Shri Ram (in 1990).

The Modi government, the Shiv Sena - a partner of the BJP till last year - called for bringing an ordinance for temple construction, but the government did not do so, the editorial recalled. “Eventually, hearing took place in the Supreme Court on the Ram temple issue for 40 days in a row and the it gave verdict in favour of the Ram temple (construction)...the trust is being formed due to that court order,” the editorial said.

“It is binding on any government to implement the courts order. Prime Minister Modi followed that order,” the editorial had said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sena-roots-for-representation-in-ram-temple-trust.html
135,07-3-20,"No Yes Bank, Modi, his ideas destroyed Indian economy: Cong","Taking a dig at the BJP-led Government over the moratorium placed on Yes Bank, the Congress on Friday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his “ideas” had destroyed the country’s economy. The party also tweeted from its Twitter handle, saying the customers of Yes Bank were going to face tough times ahead due to the withdrawal limits. “BJP has successfully managed to sink the economy without any remorse, regret or even a plan to put it back on track,” it said.

While party leader Rahul Gandhi took a jibe on the Government by his one liner on social media “No Yes Bank”, former Finance Minister P Chidambaram hit out saying its “ability to govern and regulate financial institutions stands exposed”.

“No Yes Bank. Modi and his ideas have destroyed India’s economy,” the former Congress chief said in a tweet. Yes Bank was placed under a moratorium on Thursday, with the Reserve Bank of India capping deposit withdrawals at the bank at Rs 50,000 per account for a month and superseding its board.

“BJP has been in power for six years. Their ability to govern and regulate financial institutions stands exposed. First, it was PMC Bank. Now it is YES Bank. Is the government concerned at all? Can it shirk its responsibility? Is there a third bank in the line?,” Chidambaram said.

He also wondered if the BJP-led government would confirm that YES Bank’s loan book had grown under its watch from Rs 55,000 crore in FY 2014 to Rs 2,41,000 core in FY 2019. “When overall bank credit during the above period grew by about 10 per cent, how did YES BANK’s loan book grow by about 35 per cent?,” Chidambaram asked.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/no-yes-bank--modi--his-ideas-destroyed-indian-economy--cong.html
136,07-3-20,SC asks Harsh Mander to respond to allegations of hate speech scorn for court,"The Supreme Court on Friday asked activist Harsh Mander to file response to the allegations of Delhi Police that he made hate speeches, including certain objectionable remarks against the top court during anti-CAA protests here.

A Bench, comprising Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices BR Gavai, made clear however that it has not issued a contempt notice to Mander on the plea of Delhi Police alleging “derogatory remarks”, making insinuations against the apex court and its judges and said that the plea would now be heard on April 15.

Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for the activist, alleged that the government was trying to “brow beat” Mander and there was nothing “objectionable” and “contemptuous” in his speeches.

“There is nothing contemptuous, disparaging or inflammatory in his speeches”, Dave said, adding, “I am concerned that the Government is willing to shoot the messenger, while not taking action against the real perpetrators”. At the outset, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Delhi Police, referred to another speech of Mander and said its contents are also “contemptuous”. The Bench then asked the top law officer to file the contents of the other speech also by filing another affidavit which can be responded to by Mander as well.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sc-asks-harsh-mander-to-respond-to-allegations-of-hate-speech-scorn-for-court.html

The arrested accused are Waiz ul Islam, 19, resident of Baghe Mehtab, Srinagar and Mohammad Abbas Rather, 32, of Hakripora, Pulwama.

“During initial interrogation, accused Waiz ul Islam has disclosed that he used his Amazon online shopping account to procure chemicals for making IEDs, batteries and other accessories on the directions of the Pakistani JeM terrorists.

138,07-3-20,Parl panel backs Aadhaar linking with electoral roll,"In a move to bring more transparency in the electoral system, a department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice has supported the Election Commission’s move to link voters’ Aadhaar numbers with the electoral roll to clean up data of duplicate entries.

The EC has also informed the committee that it is also exploring the possibility of using block chain technology which would enhance the credibility of the electoral system in the country.

The committee, headed by Bhupendra Yadav, recommended that the Government may undertake appropriate actions for the purpose of linking unique Aadhaar Card number with Voter ID Card to purify the electoral roll which is in larger interest of democratic polity.

In August last year, the commission had asked the Government to give it statutory backing to collect Aadhaar numbers of new applicants and existing voters to check multiple entries in electoral rolls.

The EC had proposed that provisions of the Representation of the People Act be amended to allow the Election Commission (EC) to seek Aadhaar numbers of those applying to be voters and also those who are already part of voters’ list.

On the block chain technology, an EC official said that the concept is a “two-way electronic voting system, in a controlled environment, on white-listed IP devices on dedicated internet lines, enabled with biometric devices and a web camera”.

He, however, made it clear that voters will have to reach a designated venue during a pre-decided period of time to be able to use this facility. After a voter’s identity is established by the system, a block chain enabled personalised e-ballot paper will be generated. When the vote is cast , the ballot would be securely encrypted and a block chain hashtag (#) will be generated. This hashtag notification would be sent to various stakeholders, in this case—the candidates and political parties.

The EC has also submitted that several countries including USA, Canada, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Italy, Switzerland, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Armenia, Namibia, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh have been using fully or partially Electronic Voting Machines. Some of the countries also have started electronic counting by using technology. Those are Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Belgium, Australia, South Korea, Philippines, Mangolia, Bhutan, Namibia.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/parl-panel-backs-aadhaar-linking-with-electoral-roll.html

“We want to tell the people that there is no need to panic at this point of time. Instead of panicking it is better to remain alert about the safety formula,” the Chief Minister said adding a task force had been created to monitor the situation arising out of possible Corona-infected cases.

When asked as to whether the Government was keeping extra vigil on the Bengal-Nepal and Bengal-Bhutan borders considering the fact that an American tourist had been diagnosed with Corona infection the Chief Minister said her Government was already screening people in the borders adding the district hospitals had been directed to take additional measures wherever necessary.

“The hospitals have been kept ready with isolation wards and rapid action teams have been formed to respond quickly to any situation of emergency,” Banerjee said taking serious note of reported cases of black-marketing of face masks to prevent the virus.

“We have also come to know about such reports that some unscrupulous traders are hording masks and medicines and selling them for a premium.

These camps will come up at Suratgarh, Jaisalmer, Secunderabad, Chennai and Kolkatta besides one quarantine facility already functioning at Manesar near Gurugram.

143,07-3-20,CBI takes over probe into UPPCL PF scam,"More trouble is in store for some senior officials of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) as after waiting for over four months, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has finally decided to take over probe into the Rs 4,122 crore scam in which provident fund money of the power employees was invested in the tainted Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL).

The UP Government had sent a letter to the CBI on November 2, 2019, asking the central agency to take over the investigation of the power employees’ PF scam from the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of UP Police.

Official sources here on Friday confirmed that the EOW case (number 540/2019) registered against the accused under sections 409, 420, 467, 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code at Hazratganj police station had been transferred to the CBI police station on Thursday.

As per the fresh FIR of the CBI, lodged on behalf of CBI Anti-Corruption Bureau’s Superintendent of Police Raghavendra Vatsa, CBI-ACB inspector Sabhajeet Chauhan will be the investigating officer in the case.

The CBI investigating officer would take all the documents of the case from the EOW in a day or two, sources said. The EOW has already arrested 17 accused, including UPPCL’s former Managing Director AP Mishra, and all are in judicial custody at present.

The government had lodged a FIR on November 2, 2019 in the scam after it came to light that UPPCL employees’ PF trust had deposited the provident fund money in the DHFL, a company which was in deep trouble after facing several scam charges.

On the same day, the investigation was recommended to the CBI but the EOW was asked to continue with the probe till the central agency took over the probe.

In the EOW investigation, it was found that share brokers were involved in the scam along with some senior UPPCL officials. On the other hand, the Enforcement Directorate had also started investigation in the alleged money laundering of UPPCL employees’ provident fund which was parked with DHFL. The EOW investigation report said that Rs 4,122 crore was parked with DHFL between March 2017 and December 2018.

The funds were allegedly invested in connivance with officials managing the two UPPCL PF trusts via 28 brokerages or bogus firms. Funds were also parked in LIC Housing Finance and PNB Housing Finance, taking the total investment to Rs 6,600 crore. As of now, Rs 2,267 crore is still pending with DHFL.

The Bombay High Court had barred the DHFL from making fresh repayments on account of a different money laundering probe by the ED.

However, when the UPPCL employees staged protest over the scam, the Yogi Adityanath government had made a commitment that the government would bear all the loss and the employees would not suffer.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cbi-takes-over-probe-into-uppcl-pf-scam.html
144,07-3-20,Coronavirus scare dampens Holi mood,"The Central paramilitary forces like the CRPF and the BSF have decided to call off official events to celebrate Holi in the wake of the Coronavirus scare. The BSF has also decided to hold the beating retreat ceremony at Attari border minus the spectators amid the global concern over the pandemic.

For its part, the CISF has postponed its anniversary parade and related celebrations scheduled for next week across the country. In a similar move, the CRPF has also postponed an event scheduled to be held at the India Gate in the national capital to mark the International Women’s Day on March 8. With these cancellations, the CRPF anniversary parade scheduled to be held later this month in Gurgaon remains uncertain.

The paramilitary forces engaged in a variety of internal security roles and border guarding duties have issued directives to cancel events to collectively celebrate Holi at their formation across the country.

The paramilitary forces’ strength is about 10 lakh and includes the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the Border Security Force (BSF), the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) force, the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and the National Security Guards besides Assam Rifles. They function under the operational command of the Union Home Ministry.

“No Holi Milan celebrations to be organised in CRPF in view of the threat of Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19). It is also desirable to avoid mass public gatherings and congregations,” reads an advisory issued by CRPF headquarters to its field formations on Thursday.

The festival of colours is scheduled for celebrations on March 10.

This is the third straight year that these forces will not be celebrating Holi on an official level.

In 2018, the celebrations were called off after 25 CRPF personnel were killed in a Naxal attack in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma district and last year. Likewise, the festivities were cancelled in order to express solidarity with the 40 CRPF personnel who were killed in the Pulwama terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir on February 14 last year.

“As per the government guidelines to counter COVID-19, congregations are to be avoided, hence visitors/spectators to the Beating Retreat ceremony at Attari will not be entertained. The ceremony will be conducted without spectators,” a senior BSF official said.

As for the CISF, its main event entailed a mega parade and martial drills display, involving thousands of troops and their families, was to take place on March 13 at a CISF camp in Ghaziabad near here to mark the 51st raising day of the Force.

All the formations of the force in the country also hold various events to mark the day in scaled down manner.

“The CISF day parade in Ghaziabad and related events to be held all across the country on March 13 have been postponed in view of the Coronavirus scare,” a senior official said, adding the move comes following instructions from the Union Home Ministry.

An order issued by the paramilitary force said the event was being cancelled due to “administrative reasons and until further orders”.

Troops from all over the country converge here for the main event and are hosted at various camps of the force in the National Capital Region (NCR), with elaborate measures made for their stay and meals. The main event in Ghaziabad was to be presided over by Union Home Minister Amit Shah and senior officials of the security establishment.

The banners came up at major road crossings in Lucknow late on Thursday night on the directions of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, an official said.

They bear photographs, names and addresses of those accused of vandalism during protests in December against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

Some activists who figure in the posters have said they will go to court over the “public humiliation” when the charges against them are yet to be proved.

A government spokesman said the posters have been up on the chief minister's directive at important intersections, including the main crossing in the busy Hazratganj area and in front of the Assembly building.

The spokesman said the people on the posters are those who had damaged public property under the pretext of protests, and notices have already been issued seeking compensation from them.

The posters say that property of the accused will be confiscated if they fail to pay the compensation.

Activist-politician Sadaf Jafar, who is among those whose photo appears on the posters, termed the move unethical and vowed to take legal recourse.

“How can we be publicly humiliated for something that has not yet been proved in court,” she said.

“This is not Afghanistan. Legal issues cannot be brought into public like this. Our bail order says there is no adequate evidence against us,” Jafar told PTI.

She was arrested after the violence in Lucknow and later granted bail. “We are not absconding,” she said, adding that they have appeared before the court and police whenever asked.

“Why are we being targeted like this? Did they put up posters of Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi at all airports? Had they done it they would have not fled with the country's wealth,” she said, referring to the two absconding businessmen. Former IPS officer, S R Darapuri claimed that the move is illegal. “Our life, property and freedom have been put in jeopardy by putting up these posters and our reputation has been damaged,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/banners-in-lucknow-carry-photos-of-anti-caa----vandals---activists-outraged.html

147,07-3-20,Speaker-led panel to look into MPs’ suspension,"A committee, chaired by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, will look into the incidents that took place in the House between March 2 and 5, leading to suspension of seven Congress members which the Opposition wants to be revoked. In the meantime though, proceedings in both the Houses of Parliament were disrupted for the fifth consecutive day on Friday due to sloganeering by Opposition members seeking an immediate discussion on the riots in Delhi, which claimed at least 53 lives.

While the Lok Sabha passed two Bills amidst pandemonium , in the Rajya Sabha its Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu termed the turn of events in both the Houses “unfortunate” before adjourning the Upper House of Parliament for the day barely 15 minutes after it assembled at 11 am.

Both the Houses will reassemble on March 11 after the Holi break when the discussion on the issue is slated.

The Lok Sabha, which has been for last three-days functioning in the absence of a “hurt” Speaker Om Birla who has chosen to stay away from presiding the House due to the ruckus, managed to pass in between the spell of adjournments, two Bills -- the Mineral Laws (Amendment) Bill and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill -- amidst continuous protests by the Opposition.

As soon as Lok Sabha assembled at 11 am, some members of the Congress and other Opposition parties such as the DMK and the Indian Union Muslim League trooped into the well of the House, seeking discussion on the riots and raising slogans demanding Home Minister Amit Shah’s resignation. Many Opposition members also wore black bands on their arms in protest.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was among those who sported black bands. However, he did not join the members protesting in the well.

Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha, was also in the Well. He was seen picking up a book, apparently the rule book of Parliament, and showing it to the chair.

As the commotion continued, Kirit Solanki, who was presiding the proceedings, announced adjourning the House till 2 PM. He later revised the adjournment time to 12 noon. When the House reassembled at noon, the protests and sloganeering by the opposition continued.

However, amidst the noisy scenes, the House passed the Mineral Laws (Amendment) Bill. The chair again adjourned the House for about 10 minutes till 12.45 pm.

When the Lok Sabha resumed business, it took up the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill amidst the Opposition protests and declared as passed before the house was adjourned for the day.

The committee, chaired by Lok Sabha Speaker , will look into the incidents that took place in the House between March 2 and 5, the house was informed by the Chair after the Opposition demanded revocation of the suspension of seven Congress MPs.

The House had witnessed uproarious scenes on March 2 as the Opposition demanded a discussion on Delhi riots. On Thursday, after papers from the table of the Speaker were torn amidst bedlam seven Congress MPs were suspended.

On the same day an RLP member made some controversial remarks relating to cornonavirus against Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her family members triggering a strong reaction from Congress.

While protesting the remarks, Congress member Gaurav Gogoi pulled papers from the Speaker’s table and flung them in the air.

149,07-3-20,TN to emerge as medical capital of India?,"The Opposition DMK and its president MK Stalin allege on a daily basis that Tamil Nadu is the most corrupt State in India and there has been no development since the Karunanidhi-led Government was voted out in the 2011 Assembly election. Despite these charges, Tamil Nadu has emerged as a benchmark for other States in the country in sectors like healthcare and social development during the last nine years, say official records. The State is on its way to become the medical capital of the country.

Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswamy is busy traveling across the State to lay foundation stone for the 11 medical colleges sanctioned by the Centre to the State in a single calendar year. Once the new medical colleges become functional, students in Tamil Nadu would get an additional 1650 MBBS seats in addition to the existing 3250 seats, said the Chief Minister on Monday while laying the foundation stone for Krishnagiri Government medical College.

Last week so the World Bank signing a deal with the State Government to launch Tamil Nadu Health System Reform Programme (TNHSRP), a mission to provide the common man healthcare on a par with developed nations. “Tamil Nadu is already a leader in health care in India and our immediate aim is to raise the quality of service to global standards,” said the Chief Minister while signing the Memorandum of Understanding with the World Bank.

Junaid Kamal Ahmed, country director, World Bank, congratulated the Tamil Nadu Government for the ‘excellent’ health care system in the State. “We hope Tamil Nadu becomes the light house for supporting health reforms across India. Tamil Nadu is World Bank’s biggest partner,” said Ahmed.

The TNHSRP costing Rs 2857 crore, out of which the World Bank’s share would be Rs 1,999 crore, will see the quality of health care in the State goes up by leaps and bounds. Once the TNHSRP is in place, the State will have the best health care delivery as well as a strong management programme in place to deal with Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) and further reduction of inequities in reproductive and child health services, said the chief minister.

“The immediate priority is to improve the facilities available in government hospitals and primary health centres across the State. By 2030, we want to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 30. Right now we have the best maternal mortality rate in the country but we want to improve it further,” said Palaniswamy.

Health Minister C Vijayabhaskar said that once the TNHSRP is implemented all government run hospitals and PHCs in the State would provide health services on a par with the best private hospitals. Tamil Nadu will also be the first State in the country to boast of medial colleges in all the districts.

The government -run super speciality hospital in Chennai has become a role model for other States in the country thanks to the services provided by it. “We will have more such hospitals across the State,” said S Muthukrishnan, a businessman based in Tirunelveli who says that the government deserves kudos for opening medical colleges in all the districts in the State. “There has been a considerable increase in the quality of health services offered by the State hospitals since 2011. If the tempo is sustained like this for the next one year, the AIADMK Government would be in a strong wicket when they face the electorate in 2021,” said Muthukrishnan.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/tn-to-emerge-as-medical-capital-of-india-.html
150,07-3-20,‘WikiGap Edit-a thon’ set to start at IIT Bombay,"In a novel initiative undertaken in the run-up to the Women’s Day 2020, a WikiGap edit-a-thon is being organised at IIT Bombay as a step towards making a more gender-equal Wikipedia, a more gender-equal internet and a more gender-equal world.

The “WikiGap edit-a-thon” – hosted jointly by the Consulate General of Sweden, Mumbai will be hosting a WikiGap edit-a-thon at IIT Bombay in association with WikiMedia India, Idobro Impact Solutions, Centre for Policy Studies and several departments from IIT Bombay – got off to a start on Friday, with an introductory and technical session on March 6th. The event will conclude on March 9.

“Women’s representation on Wikipedia is quite low compared to that of men. Globally, there are 4 times more articles about men than women on Wikipedia. Nine out of 10 Wikipedia editors are men,” an IIT-B spokesperson said.

WikiGap is a global initiative that aims to take a step towards making a more gender-equal Wikipedia, a more gender-equal internet and a more gender-equal world. It involves inviting people to ‘edit-a-thons’ to strengthen women's rights, representation and resources on Wikipedia.

“Equality between women and men is a fundamental aim of the Swedish feminist foreign policy. Through WikiGap, Sweden aims to bridge the gender gap on Wikipedia. Since young citizens are decision-makers of tomorrow, they have been the focus for this initiative. We are glad to host WIKIGAP at IIT Bombay in partnership with WikiMedia India and Idobro,” Bjorn Holmgren, Consul, Consulate General of Sweden, Mumbai said

“The theme is in line with Sweden’s Tekla initiative that encourages young women to take up STEM sciences. IIT Bombay, being a leading Science university globally, is an ideal partner for WikiGap,” Holmgren

Rahul Deshmukh, President of WikiMedia India said, “Currently, Wikipedia is available in 301 languages, of which the English edition is the largest with over 5.8 million articles. The female (47%) to male readership ratio (53%) is approximately the same. However, only 16% females convert themselves to editors. To bridge this gap, several initiatives have been undertaken worldwide”

“Since 2014, Wikimedia India has also been striving to bridge this gender gap through its annual ‘Women’s Edit-a-thon’ activity around World Women’s day,” Deshmukh said.

Prof. Swati Patankar, Dean (International Relations) and Faculty in Department of BioSciences and Bioengineering, IIT Bombay, said: “Women have made enormous contributions in sciences, politics and social empowerment and continue to do so. Yet the recognition for these women is not as widespread as it should be. Today, Wikipedia is one of the most widely used online tools. WikiGap is an exciting initiative to strengthen women's rights, resources and representation online and IIT Bombay is delighted to be a part of this initiative together with the Consulate General of Sweden in Mumbai and Idobro Impact Solutions.”

Karon Shaiva, Managing Director, Idobro Impact Solutions said, “Idobro and Rise Infinity Foundation seeks to co-create solutions by bringing the 4 key stakeholders together - Government, Academia, Industry and Civil Society. International Women’s Day helps to increase the awareness around women issues and the gaps that exist in society at multiple levels.”

Prof. Shishir Jha, Professor and Head of Department, Centre for Policy Studies said, “Our world views are shaped by our daily experiences, which in turn is molded by the societal structures and positions that we occupy. Both rationality and logic are not entirely invariant. There are, in other words, many possible ways to logically engage with the world. A woman's viewpoint could arguably be more inclusive and comprehensive, in many areas of life, because of her daily experiences.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---wikigap-edit-a-thon----set-to-start-at-iit-bombay.html

“As a fellow public broadcaster of global repute, it is dismaying that the BBC has filed such a singularly one-sided version of the incidents of violence in Delhi which rather than help break the cycle of violence has only contributed to further vitiating the atmosphere while insinuating the brave men and women in uniform who are charged with the onerous responsibility of maintaining law and order,” he wrote in the letter dated March 4.

I discussed with him a variety of issues,” Dhankar told reporters here.

The meeting complex comes a within a week of Shah's visit to Kolkata. At a rally in the city, the Union minister had expressed “anguish” over the law and order situation in West Bengal.

I had sought this meeting under the background that over the (past) seven months I have been able to appreciate the situation on the ground with respect to the critical issues of governance,” he said.

Dhankar said during his tenure so far, he has noticed issues of law and order in the State which were highly disturbing and antithetical to democracy.

“I have been to various parts of the State and have got reports from several areas of severe political victimisation by the police. False cases against innocent people have been filed based on political considerations.

“I have apprised the Home Minister of the various areas in the State that call for the attention of the Central Government in the interest of the people,” he said

Dhankar said no action has been taken against those who accosted him at Jadavpur University and University of Calcutta and this is a “serious reflection” of the adverse law and order situation in the State.

162,07-3-20,"Maha Budget: Petrol, diesel to be costlier by Rs 1","Presenting a Rs 9,511 crore revenue deficit Budget for the year 2020-21, the debt-trapped Maharashtra Government on Friday proposed to increase the Value Added Tax (VAT) on the sale of Petrol and Diesel by One rupee per litre, in addition to the existing rate of VAT, a measure which will bring in an additional revenue of Rs 1,800 crore to the State exchequer.

A day after the Economic Survey of Maharashtra estimated the State’s debts would rise to alarming Rs 4.71,642 crore during 2019-20, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar—presenting the Budget for 2020-21 in the Assembly — proposed to increase VAT on the sale of Petrol and Diesel by one rupee per litre over and above the existing rate of VAT — to create a special dedicated fund for implementation various environmental projects.

“This (additional taxation) will enrich the State exchequer by an additional rupees 1800 Crores per annum. The Government will create a special dedicated fund called ‘ Green Fund ’ and the additional collection of Value Added Tax from proposed levy will be transferred to a ‘Green Fund ’,” Pawar

Pawar, who holds the Finance and Planning Portfolios, said that the Green Fund would be utilised by the Government for the conservation of environment, specifically for the projects related to sewage disposal and waste management and such other projects.

The deputy chief minister announced a major tax concession for home buyers in the form of one per cent rebate for the next two years in the Stamp Duty and other related charges applicable on registration of documents in the area of Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority and in the areas of Municipal Corporations of Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Nagpur.

In an effort to promote industries in the state, Pawar proposed to reduce the Electricity duty on Industrial use from 9.3 per cent to 7.5 per cent of the consumption charges

Blaming the Narendra Modi Government for the delay in the State getting GST compensation from the Centre, Pawar said: “Every two months, the State Government receives the GST compensation from the Central Government in accordance with the Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. However, there is delay in getting GST compensation from Central Government to the State. As a result, timely funding the expenditure on development works in the State is becoming difficult”.

Pawar said that his government was bearing direct and indirect liability of loans raised by the previous Devendra Fadnavis dispensation during the last five years. “During the last 5 years, State has raised loans of Rs 2,82,448 crore and a total amount of outstanding debt and liabilities at the end of January 2020 is Rs 4,33,00,901 crore.... The cost of infrastructure projects undertaken by the State Government is Rs 2,78,271 crore and the State Government has also to bear direct and indirect liability of these projects,” he said.

Among other things, Pawar said that the State Government had made a provision of Rs 15,000 crore for the much-discussed loan waiver scheme “Mahatma Jotirao Phule Shetkari Karjmukti Yojna 2019” during the year 2019-20, while it had proposed Rs 7,000 crore allocation for the same scheme during 2020-21, “so that the total of Rs 22,000 Cr. will be available for the scheme”.

The scheme covers the short term crop loan taken by farmers from the nationalised banks, private banks, rural banks, district co-operative banks and various primary agricultural co-operative societies. “Till today, Rs 9,035 Cr. have been transferred to the accounts of 13.85 lakh farmers. The remaining amount will be transferred to the accounts of the eligible farmers before the kharif season 2020, so that they will be eligible for new crop loans,” the DCM said.

Pawar also announced two additional schemes— one for farmers having arrears more than Rs 2 lakh in respect of principle and interest of crop loan / restructured crop loan taken during the period 1.4.2015 to 31.3.2019 in the form of a benefit of Rs. 2 lakh in respect of loan outstanding on 30.9.2019 as one time settlement and second one for farmers who have regularly repaid up to 30.6.2020 in the form of a maximum Rs. 50000 as incentive for the amount of crop loan taken during the year 2018-19.

On the health front, Pawar proposed an outlay of Rs.5,000 crore, of which 50 percent will be set aside for medical education like construction of new hospitals, revamping existing hospitals, medical colleges, buying new ambulances, etc.

The DCM said that an amount of Rs.1000 crore would be spent on revamping all roads leading to major urban markets in all cities in the state, and Rs.1,300 crore for higher and technical education.

Pawar said a whopping 500,000 solar power pumps would be distributed to farmers in the next five years.

163,07-3-20,MVA Govt completes 100 days in office,"Training guns at the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in Maharashtra as it completed 100 days of formation, the BJP on Friday labeled the Shiv Sena-led Government as confused and one which stayed works the previous dispensation had undertaken.

Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly and BJP legislator Devendra Fadnavis alleged MVA constituents Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress do not trust each other and that their government is the one which makes announcements only to retreat later.

Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray was sworn-in as chief minister on November 28, 2019, along with six Ministers.

The three-party Government was formed after the Shiv Sena snapped ties with the BJP and joined hands with the NCP and the Congress, both its ideological opponents. There is absolutely no coordination among the ruling parties. Their Ministers make announcements which come to their mind, while the chief minister says nothing such (with regard to ministers announcements) has been decided.

It is a Government which just makes announcements and then retreats on it later, Fadnavis told reporters outside the State legislature building complex in south Mumbai. To drive home his point, the former chief minister said the MVA first announced complete farm loan waiver, free electricity up to 100 units usage and 100 per cent scholarship, but later retreated.

165,07-3-20,"Benchmarks bleed on Yes Bank crisis, global sell-off","The Sensex plunged 894 points while the Nifty crashed below the key 11,000-mark on Friday as regulatory curbs on Yes Bank triggered a crisis of confidence among domestic investors.

A heavy sell-off in global markets on coronavirus concerns took a further toll on risk sentiment, traders said.

After nosediving over 1,459 points during the day, the 30-share BSE Sensex settled 893.99 points or 2.32 per cent lower at 37,576.62 Likewise, the broader NSE Nifty tanked 279.55 points or 2.48 per cent to close at 10,989.45.

Banking counters wilted under selling pressure, with Yes Bank plummeting over 55 per cent, after the RBI placed the lender under a moratorium, capping deposit withdrawals at Rs 50,000 per account for a month and superseding its board.

The unusual move late Thursday evening came hours after finance ministry sources confirmed that State Bank of India (SBI) was directed to bail out the troubled lender, once a Dalal Street darling.

Tata Steel was the top laggard in the Sensex pack, cracking 6.51 per cent, followed by SBI, IndusInd Bank, HDFC, ICICI Bank and ONGC. Bajaj Auto, Maruti and Asian Paints were the only gainers.

During the week, Sensex plunged 720.67 points or 1.88 per cent, while Nifty sank 212.30 points or 1.89 per cent. According to analysts, investors took the Yes Bank episode very negatively, raising questions on the stability of the overall Indian financial system.

“Another bank bites the dust. This time its Yes Bank - one of the large private sector banks. RBI has stepped in and leading state-owned institutions are patching up a bailout plan for the bank and more importantly, safeguard the interest of depositors. However, the already weak sentiments have been dented further.

“The series of accidents in the Indian financial sector sends out a very poor message to the foreign investors. The negative bias is expected would sustain in the near term,” said Gaurav Dua, Senior VP, Head — Capital Market Strategy & Investments, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

Meanwhile, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das on Friday assured Yes Bank depositors that their money is safe and all steps will be taken to ensure stability in the financial sector.

All BSE sectoral indices ended in the red, with metal plunging 4.40 per cent, followed by bankex, finance, energy, realty, oil and gas, power and industrials.

The broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices too skidded up to 2.36 per cent. World markets sank deeper into red as the coronavirus outbreak stoked fears of a global recession. Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo sank over 2 per cent.

European benchmarks were also trading significantly lower in their morning sessions. Brent crude oil futures fell 2.54 per cent to USD 48.72 per barrel.

On the currency front, the Indian rupee depreciated 32 paise to 73.24 per US dollar (intra-day).",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/benchmarks-bleed-on-yes-bank-crisis--global-sell-off-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/benchmarks-bleed-on-yes-bank-crisis--global-sell-off.html
166,07-3-20,"Metal To Excellence, making of the all-new Hyundai Creta","The Hyundai factory lies around 90 minutes outside downtown Chennai, when ground on the factory was broken in 1996 with operations starting in 1997, no-one could have predicted the immense success that the Korean carmaker would go on to enjoy in India. In the 23 years of operation, Hyundai India’s assembly plants in Chennai have manufactured over nine million cars. If all the steel coils used in manufacturing all those cars were unfurled, they would go around the equator four times over, Ganesh Mani S, Director, Production, Hyundai Motor India Limited tells me. With two assembly plants and three engine plants on the premises today, Hyundai India can make 750,000 cars a year, “We manufacture 17 different cars in over 350 different variants and export vehicles to over 100 countries”, he adds.

With 650 fourth-generation robots and 13,000 employees, the factory works twenty-four hours a day, six days a week, totalling 295 days a year. Even when the factory is rolling cars out, a car rolls off one of the several final assembly lines every 33 seconds, engineers and mechanics are servicing and repairing the robots and equipment, so much so that the in-house kitchens at the facility work around the clock without a single day off. At full-load, the kitchens produce 26,000 meals daily.

But, The Pioneer has been given unprecedented access inside the Hyundai facilities not to see the kitchens but how a car is made. More specifically, we have come to see how the second-generation of Hyundai’s bestselling compact Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) the Creta is put together. The first-generation Hyundai Creta was a bonafide best-seller with the Chennai factory pleasing 663,817 customers in 78 countries to date. But production for the Indian market has shifted to the second-generation of the car. The new car that was showcased at the recently-held Auto Expo in Greater Noida is bigger than the outgoing model, features all-new BS6 engines including a 140PS 1.4 turbocharged petrol engine, also manufactured at Chennai, with this variant featuring steering mounted paddle-shifts for gears as well as a panoramic sunroof.

The process of manufacturing a car starts at the ‘Press Shop’. This has nothing to do with the media, but is where giant coils of automotive-grade steel are cut and then literally ‘pressed’ into shape by a huge amount of force, in the case of the roof panels on the all-new Creta a whopping 5400 tons of force is used. And not just any steel would do, the high-tensile, high-strength steel used actually means that the steel frame of the all-new Creta can support the weight of two full-grown African elephants. One roof panel emerges every 15 seconds from the press. There are three huge presses and each of them can be fitted with different dies for different parts. Each of the panels you see in a car is individually pressed, and the dyes are changed frequently depending on demand.

After the steel has been pressed into shape, they are stored in between the press shop and the second-stage of the process, the ‘Body Shop’. At Body Shop One, one of two at Hyundai’s facility, 220 robots do everything from manipulating the pressed metal parts to doing the critical spot welding and then a final robot even tests a random completed body shell for any defects. The robots manufacture bodyshells with a ridiculously low error rate and can do it repeatedly and fast, most bodyshells exhibit errors less than 1mm as compared to the 3D drawings, no matter it is a Santro or the all-new Creta. The dance of the robots as they get a car, is mesmerising but also has given Ganesh and his team at the factory to try out something new with big data. The robots at Hyundai’s facilities generate 11.7 billion data points every year, with better data management and algorithms in place, Ganesh told The Pioneer that they can now predict when a motor or a electro-welding gun is about to fail. “This has reduced downtime on these changes from about 40 minutes to under 17 minutes, a 100 percent plus improvement”, he says proudly. His work with data has won kudos from Hyundai Motors globally and the practice is being rolled out at other facilities as well.

After the body-shop, the empty shells go to the paint-shop. The paint is applied using electrostatic force to ensure an even finish. But we are not allowed inside the paint-shop as the chemicals and the low tolerance for dust means that few people are allowed inside any automotive paintshop. Instead we are taken to the Engine Shop 3, this is where Hyundai India is manufacturing the 1493cc (1.5 litre) four-cylinder U2 CRDi turbodiesel engine for the new Creta as well as the Verna. This 115PS engine has several changes compared to the previous generation, to make it BS6 capable including a new variable-geometry turbocharger, new catalysts and an higher-pressure fuel injector. These have not only reduced emissions, but have also improved the power output of the car.

Hyundai India remains bullish about diesel technology in the BS6 era despite other manufacturers exiting the segment. Again, much of the process of machining is automated, but employees assemble the various parts. The engine is tested using a cold-start system, which drastically reduces emissions inside the plant. And before the engine is sent to the plant, or often exported, a final robotic check, where a robot takes 45 photographs of various points of the engine and checks it against a database, all in just over a minute is done. The error rate is infintessibly small.

Finally, the car that you and I might call our own is ready to be put together. Hyundai has two assembly shops at Chennai, and the all-new Creta is being put together at the original line. There are three lines here, the first where the all-new Creta, and some first-generation cars for the export market and the Venue make up a a bulk of the models. This line has an output of 45 cars every hour, each car visiting almost one hundred different stations. But how do employees differentiate between different cars, since the Hyundai factory produces over 350 different variants and employees can easily be moved from one station to the next?

“We use computer simulation to ensure that everyone on the line knows his or her role. Electronic tablets give them a quick reference to what they have to do, and our parts management system ensures that they only receive the parts specific to the product in front of them”, Ganesh points out. The computer simulation ensured that everyone on the final assembly line knew exactly how to put together the all-new Creta even before the first one rolled off the line. Hyundai is anticipating heavy demand for the all-new Creta, thus every second vehicle on this assembly line is the new model.

The first thing workers do on the line is actually remove the doors on the vehicles. This is to ensure easy access to the inside as well as prevent inadvertent damage and scratches to the paint job. The doors, where the windows and speakers are fitted are actually finished on a separate line and Hyundai’s computer systems ensure that they perfectly meet their vehicle back a few stations down the line. Hyundai employees use gravity-assisting devices to help them manipulate heavy components such as the central console and tires. The factory is a perfect example of Henry Ford’s moving assembly line concept. The line is constantly moving, with each station knowing exactly what to do, it is almost perfect symmetry, a carefully choreographed dance that would make Bollywood, rather given where we are Kollywood, jealous.

After this, the cars undergo a pre-delivery check. In 800 seconds, twenty Hyundai India employees check everything on a 150-point checklist. From the interiors including the infotainment system, the horn, lights and the exteriors for any possible scratches under a brightly lit tunnel, to ensure that the car is dispatched to dealers with no flaws whatsoever. Again, a carefully choreographed dance ensures that the car that you might call your own one day, maybe the all-new Creta in this case is as good as it possibly can be as Hyundai India’s factory at Sriperumbudur assures both buyers in India and across the world that it is one of the best car manufacturing facilities anywhere in the world. Making this a ‘Make In India’ success story and while Indian buyers will enjoy the all-new Creta with its stunning new features before other buyers, it will will soon be sent to markets across the world.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/metal-to-excellence---making-of-the-all-new-hyundai-creta-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/metal-to-excellence---making-of-the-all-new-hyundai-creta.html
167,07-3-20,Govt invites bids for sale of BPCL,"In the country's biggest ever privatisation drive, the government on Saturday invited bids for sale of its entire 52.98 per cent stake in India's second biggest oil refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL).

Expressions of interest for the strategic sale of BPCL have been invited by May 2, as per the bid document by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM).

""The Government of India is proposing strategic disinvestment of its entire shareholding in BPCL comprising of 114.91 crore equity shares, which constitutes 52.98% of BPCL's equity share capital along with transfer of management control to a strategic buyer (except BPCL's equity shareholding of 61.65% in Numaligarh Refinery Limited),"" it said.

NRL stake will be sold to a state-owned oil and gas firm.

The bidding will be a two-stage affair, with qualified bidders in the first expression of interest (EoI) phase being asked to make a financial bid in the second round.

PSUs ""are not eligible to participate"" in the privatisation, the offer document said.

Any private company having a networth of USD 10 billion is eligible for bidding and consortium of no more than four firms will be allowed to bid, it said.

BPCL will give buyers ready access to 14 per cent of India's oil refining capacity and about one-fourth of the fuel market share in the world's fastest-growing energy market.

BPCL has a market capitalisation of about Rs 87,388 crore and the government stake at current prices is worth about Rs 46,000 crore. The successful bidder will also have to make an open offer to other shareholders for acquiring another 26 per cent at the same price.

Privatisation of BPCL is essential for meeting the record Rs 2.1 lakh crore target Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has set from disinvestment proceeds in the Budget for 2020-21.

BPCL operates four refineries in Mumbai (Maharashtra), Kochi (Kerala), Bina (Madhya Pradesh) and Numaligarh (Assam) with a combined capacity of 38.3 million tonnes per annum, which is 15 per cent of India's total refining capacity of 249.4 million tonnes.

While the Numaligarh refinery will be carved out of BPCL and sold to a PSU, the new buyer of the company will get 35.3 million tonnes of refining capacity.

BPCL also owns 15,177 petrol pumps and 6,011 LPG distributor agencies in the country. Besides, it has 51 LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) bottling plants.

The company distributes 21 per cent of petroleum products consumed in the country by volume as of March this year and has more than a fifth of the 250 aviation fuel stations in the country.

The government has appointed Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP as its transaction advisor for the strategic disinvestment process.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/govt-invites-bids-for-sale-of-bpcl-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-invites-bids-for-sale-of-bpcl.html
168,07-3-20,How can women grow their savings with Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit?,"Women today seek smart investment options that can help them accomplish their goals, which may include financing an overseas vacation with family, purchasing a house orcar, or simply building an emergency fund. While these goals aren’t out-of-the-ordinary, saving for them while managing household expenses can betricky.

Where to invest for high safety and attractive returns?

A common way to save is to park your finances in a savings account. However, amid the recent turmoil in the banking industry, along with the rising inflation rates, and the downturn in the investment market, it may get difficult to choose where to invest. There are risks of withdrawal restrictions on fixed deposit for banks, negative returns on market-dependent instruments and the interest rates on savings account is very low.

In such a scenario, you need an alternative to grow your savings without fear of delays, withdrawal restrictions or defaults. The lock-in period for most government savings schemes or PPF is very high, and interest rates on bank deposits have recently reduced, post announcement of LTRO (Long-Term Repo Operations). Hence, it is more profitable to invest in a low-risk avenue that offers generous, assured returnslike a Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit.

To know why you should do so in detail, read on.

High stability and profitable returns

With the economy on edge and the market witnessing a rapid downturn amid the coronavirus outbreak, stability is key factor to look for. So, instead of scouting for high interest rates alone, look for safety ratings as well.Bajaj Finance FDcarries CRISIL’s FAAA and ICRA’s MAAA ratings, which are the highest in their respective categories, and reflect the highest safety of your deposits in terms of timely interest payouts, assured returns at maturity without any delays. Further, Bajaj Finance prides itself on having ‘0 unclaimed deposits’, which indicates that all FD customers have received timely payouts without any delay or default.

Apart from rich yields, Bajaj Finance offers a flexible tenor and so, you can be sure that a lengthy lock-in period does not come in the way of you meeting your goals. You can invest your savings for a tenor ranging between 12 and 60 months and use the FD calculator to zero in on the right principal amount and tenor.

Allows for a minimum deposit of Rs.25,000

A benefit of choosing theBajaj Finance FD is that you aren’t required to accumulate a large corpus to begin investing.You can start investing with a minimum deposit amount of Rs.25,000 only. When you invest early,you can grow your savings more significantly over a longer tenor owing to the power of compound interest.

Extends value-added FD features

When it comes to growing your savings, the Bajaj Finance FD has a few additional features that make the process fruitful. Through the Multi-Deposit facility, for example, you can easily ladder your investments using a single cheque, thereby ensuring you enjoy liquidity for your various goals,periodically.

Enables supercharged savings through Systematic Deposit Plans

Bajaj Finance allows you to make monthly deposits via the Systematic Deposit Plan feature. All you need to do is save and contribute as little as Rs.5,000 each month. Each contribution counts as a new FD and earns interest at the rate prevailing on the day that the FD is booked. You can choose a tenor of 12 to 60 months and alsodecide upon the number of monthly contributions you wish to make. These range from 6 to 48 and you can stop making contributions any time you wish to.

170,07-3-20,Kabul: Gunmen kill at least 32 at ceremony,"Gunmen opened fire on Friday at a ceremony in Afghanistan's capital attended by prominent political leaders, killing at least 32 people and wounding dozens more before the two attackers were slain by police, officials said.

The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack on its website. Afghanistan's upstart IS affiliate has declared war on the country's minority Shiites. Many of those at the ceremony were Shiites because it was commemorating the 1995 slaying of Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of Afghanistan's ethnic Hazaras, who are mostly Shiite.

The Taliban said they were not involved in the attack, which came less than a week after the U.S. And the group signed an ambitious peace deal that lays out a path for the withdrawal of American forces from the country.

Interior Ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said 32 people were killed and 81 wounded in the attack in the Dasht-e-Barchi neighborhood of Kabul. The Health Ministry also reported 32 people were killed but said 58 were wounded.

Opposition leader Abdullah Abdullah, who is the country's chief executive and was a top contender in last year's presidential election, was among several prominent political officials who attended the ceremony but left before the attack and were unhurt.

Several TV journalists were covering the ceremony inside a walled compound when the gunmen began shooting, and a reporter and a cameraman for a local broadcaster were among the wounded.

Karim Khalili, the chief of Afghanistan's high peace council, was delivering a speech when the gunfire interrupted him. He was not hurt and later went on TV to denounce the violence.

Several witnesses said that, amid the panic, members of the security forces guarding the event had fired on civilians in the crowd.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/kabul--gunmen-kill-at-least-32-at-ceremony.html

Hossein Sheikholeslam, “a veteran and revolutionary diplomat” died late Thursday, IRNA said.

Iran has been scrambling to contain the rapid spread of coronavirus which so far has infected 3,513 people and killed at least 107 people in the Islamic republic.

Six of those who died from coronavirus are politicians or government officials.

Before his death, Sheikholeslam was advisor to Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.

A former ambassador to Syria, he also served as deputy foreign minister from 1981 to 1997.

Sheikholeslam was also one of the students involved in the 1979 Iran hostage crisis.

That year, and less than nine months after the toppling of the American-backed shah, Iranian students stormed the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 Americans hostage.

This prompted Washington to sever diplomatic ties with Iran in 1980.

Moody’s has also downgraded the bank’s long-term foreign and local currency bank deposit ratings. The downgrade “is a result of an event of default triggered by the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) 30-day moratorium, which prevents Yes Bank from making a full and timely payment to its senior creditors,” the rating agency said in a statement.

“Despite the event of default, the Caa3 rating takes into account Moody’s expectation that although recovery rates for the banks’ senior creditors may be high given the close involvement of the Indian authorities and stated intention to resolve the bank quickly, the ultimate timing and form of eventual resolution remains uncertain.

“Actions by the authorities to date have not reduced the probability of default as evidenced by the moratorium announcement, and highlights the continued uncertainty around private sector bank resolutions in India and the recovery prospects for senior creditors,” it said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/moody---s-lowers-bank---s-ratings.html

There were cases of heated exchange between bank staff and customers, who failed to withdraw money.

On Thursday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) superseded the board of Yes Bank and imposed a 30-day moratorium after the Rana Kapoor-promoted bank failed to raise capital to address potential loan losses.

The bank’s depositors are allowed to withdraw cash up to Rs 50,000 from their accounts during the 30-day moratorium period, according to a Government gazette.

The withdrawal limit, however, can be relaxed up to Rs 5 lakh in case of medical emergencies, higher education and for expenses related to marriages, it said.

The rush to withdraw money from the bank continued despite Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Chief Economic Advisor Krishnamurthy Subramanian and Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das trying to allay the fear among the depositors.

“Our salary gets credited on 21st of every month. I am a little worried about my upcoming salary as I have a salary account with Yes Bank. I am going to provide details of my other bank account to HR today so that my money doesn’t get blocked,” said an MNC employee who was standing in a queue at one of the branches in suburban Mulund.

Pradeep Kumar, an engineer by profession, working with a large real estate developer, said, “I have some money right now but I have come to withdraw more since it is the beginning of the month and there are some payments lined up.”

Kumar had tried to withdraw money yesterday night but ATM went dry before his turn came.

Yes Bank has 1,000 branches across the country. To streamline the withdrawal process, some of the branches are giving limited tokens to the customers.

“The branch manager has refused to give me a token since I reached late. They are giving tokens to up to 130 people,” said a customer who was seen fighting with the manager of the branch in suburban Mumbai. Security was also tightened at the bank’s headquarters, its branches and ATMs across the city. It’s not just salaried customers, but entrepreneurs and small businessmen are also affected.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/assurances-aside--yes-bank-customers-queue-up-outside-branches.html
178,07-3-20,"Yes Bank specific issue, not structural problem: SBI chief","State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Friday said the problem of Yes Bank is “lender-specific” and not a structural issue. He also said that there was no need for anyone to panic.

“The problem at hand is lender-specific and not sectoral,” he told reporters after meeting Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman here.

The SBI board on Thurday gave its “in-principle” approval to exploring investment opportunities in Yes Bank but he said there has been no negotiations yet. “The RBI has said they will come out with a restructuring plan (for Yes Bank),” he added.

The resolution will come “very shortly”, he said. “This is not a sectoral problem. It is a bank-specific problem. The RBI will take all steps to ensure financial stability,” Rajnish Kumar said. On SBI picking up a stake in Yes Bank, he said the lender already has an in-principle approval for doing so.

The SBI chief also said there is no need to panic on account of developments in the Yes Bank.

“What’s there to panic, no need to panic, all depositors are safe... RBI Governor has said also, just be patient, everything will be fine,” Kumar told the reporters.

Yes Bank shares were down to Rs 15.10 from Rs 21.70, a 58.97 per cent fall.

Earlier RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said that the Central bank will come out with a scheme very shortly to revive Yes Bank within 30 days.

“We took the step (of putting it under moratorium) when we found that Yes Bank efforts were not working. Depositors’ interests will be fully protected. A decision has been taken not only to deal with the problem in the individual entity but also to maintain the resilience of the Indian financial sector.”",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/yes-bank-specific-issue--not-structural-problem--sbi-chief.html
179,07-3-20,Trump signs $8.3Bn bill to combat virus outbreak in US,"President Donald Trump on Friday signed an USD 8.3 billion measure to help tackle the coronavirus outbreak that has killed 12 people in the US and infected more than 200.

The legislation provides federal public health agencies with money for vaccines, tests and potential treatments and helps state and local governments prepare and respond to the threat. The rapid spread of the virus has rocked financial markets, interrupted travel and threatens to affect everyday life in the United States.

Trump had planned to sign the bill during a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. But he told reporters Friday that concerns were raised about “one person who was potentially infected” who worked at the CDC. Trump said the person has since tested negative for the new virus and that he still hopes to visit the agency at some point.

The Senate passed the $8.3 billion measure on Thursday to help tackle the outbreak in hopes of reassuring a fearful public and accelerating the government’s response to the virus. Its rapid spread is threatening to upend everyday life in the US and across the globe.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump-signs--8-3bn-bill-to-combat-virus-outbreak-in-us.html
180,07-3-20,"She, the change","From conventional sectors to new-age businesses, women leaders are now venturing across different verticals such as technology, marketing, health, tourism and what not. Breaking stereotypes, these leaders are changing the business landscapes and making their mark everywhere. The International Women’s Day is the time to recognise some of them who are making a bigger impact across different industries. By Team Viva

Neha Bagaria, Founder & CEO, JobsForHer (Connecting portal that enables women on a professional break to restart their career)

“There has been a call for equality over the past couple of decades. The magnitude of the problem in corporate India has opened the doors to a dialogue on processes to increase the participation of women in the workplace across levels and verticals. Working women and men deserve to be treated equally and with dignity. Diversity and inclusion will be the call to action for India Inc for the next decade and increasing the number of women in leadership roles.

Training and sensitisation are important measures that companies should invest in to enable their employees — both men and women — to understand biases and the importance of having more women in the workplace”.

Puja Punj, Co-Founder, GyFTR-Vouchagram (A tech-enabled offline to online gifting startup that enables Brand Currencies)

“When it comes to women entrepreneurs, there are questions around priorities. It is always assumed that it’s difficult to manage both home and work. The mantra I follow to maintain the work-life balance is to unplug myself from the certain things that can be managed without my attention be it at home or office. It always gives a sense of responsibility and accountability to the other person. I always make sure to keep some time of the day for myself to plan and analyse my goals. I believe in excelling at work through delegating the tasks to people as per their strengths which would not only lead to good results but will also be done with positive energy on time. To work with a team of people, the key is self-motivation and letting go of perfection to a certain extent to keep the spirits high.”

Roma Priya, Founder of Burgeon Law (India’s leading boutique law firm)

At Burgeon Law, we have a team of cognisant women lawyers some of who come from smaller cities. With our collaborative synergies, we pro-actively contribute to India’s booming start-up ecosystem by supporting other women entrepreneurs in achieving their goals. It is our mission to support and enable women entrepreneurs with leveraging opportunities while getting rid of any financial and legal roadblocks.

The need for skilled talent may just be the opportunity we need to finally usher in a meaningful change in the long struggle for gender equality. It will drive companies to move more women into good jobs, keep them in the workforce and bring back those who have left as it will make more business sense than recruiting new talent and training them from scratch.

Meenal Arora, Founder Director, Shemford Group of Futuristic Schools (India’s leading school chain)

Besides being a human right, gender equality is imperative for women to realise their self-worth, take control of their decisions and fill the gap to access equal opportunities and resources as men. The impact of this parity is far beyond a particular section of the society, it sways the nation as a whole. Empowering women and giving them equal standing is the need of the hour to pull off sustainable development and economic upswing. Our battle against gender-bias is for equal respect, rights and stature in the society. The seeds of gender awareness need to be sown right from the young age of children that will make them responsible citizens with a mindset to create a nation free from discrimination.

Neha Kaul, Marketing and Brand Head, Shine.com (India’s second-largest job search platform)

“With organisations becoming more serious about cultivating diversity, the trend of building women-friendly policies and programmes is becoming more mainstream. With the shortage of skills in the tech sector, tech firms are leading the way in incentivising women to re-join the workforce. This includes programmes to support women with young children, flexible work options, and technology-enabled systems to help women navigate their careers while balancing their role as the primary caregiver for children. The need for skilled talent may just be the opportunity we need to finally usher in a meaningful change in the long struggle for gender equality. It will drive companies to move more women into good jobs, keep them in the workforce and bring back those who have left as it will make more business sense than recruiting new talent and training them from scratch”.

Dipali Mathur, CEO & CO-Founder, Super Smelly (India’s only 100% toxin-free personal care brand for GenZ)

“I am raising a GenZ daughter and as I step out of the house each day to go to work, I do that with a dream in my eyes that my little girl and many more little girls are watching me march to work knowing that working women are normal. They watch me being ambitious, voice my opinion, look after myself by exercising every day and eating nutritious food. They watch me questioning traditional patriarchal conventions, my quest for equality in more ways than one and would know that it is not an aberration to do all this, but its normal. I grew up watching my mom sacrificing her career, only looking after her children and in laws and often ignoring her own health and nutrition, never resting. I knew I had to be a part of the change to ensure the generation after me inherits an equal world.

In 2017 I realised that my daughter is a part of that massive 30 per cent of India’s population called GenZ for which not a single brand makes toxin-free products that are clinically tested specifically for their age. My friend Milan and I took things in our hands and triggered a toxin-free movement for the next-gen which was so far exposed to more harmful chemicals through personal care products as there were no options available for them. We launched India’s first and only zero toxin certified brand of personal care products for the youth with our dream of a toxin-free world for them. With Super Smelly now they have a choice to use safe and effective products which are specifically tested for their age”.

While growing up, I saw a lot of health problems faced by people could have been easily avoided, only if they just had a better lifestyle. This motivated me to start OZiva. For me the challenges I faced as an entrepreneur had nothing to do with the gender, it was similar to what every entrepreneur goes through. Today, more than 80 per cent of our customers are women and we are working towards building the community of 10k women entrepreneurs who are living a healthy lifestyle and inspiring others to do the same thing.

181,07-3-20,Expression of soul,"Indian classical vocalist Smita Rao Bellur, who performed at the Jahan-e-Khusrau festival, says that Sufi music has a unifying and healing potential, much needed in a society that is torn apart. By Sakshi Sharma

Kaale gore ka bhed nahi,

Har dil se humara naata hai,

Kuch aur na aata ho humko,

Humein pyar nibhana aata hai...

No two people of any religion, caste, colour or any other kind of differentiation that you can think of, would ever stand against each other unless they are deliberately set up like that. This song from Purab aur Paschim released in 1970 but holds true even today. Indian classical vocalist Smita Rao Bellur emphasises on the idea as she says, “No religion stands for violence or propagates a scarcity model, which says that if the Hindus feed from it, the Muslims can’t or vice versa. People can never hate each other, it’s the politicians who create artificial scenarios.”

Smita, specialises in Hindustani Classical Khayal and traditional Sufi music, performed at the Jahan-e-Khusrau festival. She sang a few kalaams (verses) written by Hyderabadi poets. “My tryst with the poetry of Hyderabad began a few years ago and has made me an ardent fan ever since. It has also been life changing in many ways. Makhdoom Mohiuddin, Shaaz Tamkanat, Saeed Shaheedi, Amjad Hyderabadi, Nawab Sadiq Jung Bahadur are some poets whose poetry I enjoy singing. Mujh me har rang is a new kalaam which has been composed fresh for this festival,” says she.

However, when one talks of Urdu poetry, the recent controversy around Urdu poet and author, Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s Hum Dekhenge comes to mind. Smita believes that art should not be influenced by religious differences as it is a medium that promotes peace and harmony. Says she, “Muzaffar Ali ji’s A Leaf turned Yellow often resonates with the Krishna-Radhika-Gopika love whose motifs are present in the music of every Indian language/region. Sufi music has a universal appeal because of its inherent ability to resonate with people across demographies, religion and language. It has a great unifying and healing potential.” In a society that is torn apart with religious divisions, she feels that the spiritual verses can help.

For Smita, music started out as an exploration but soon became the purpose of her life. “Little did I know that it would one day be my best companion, therapist, expression of my soul, connection to the divine and in more ways than one — my energy footprint. Remember the old Hindi song... meri aawaaz hi meri pehchaan hai?,” says she.

As a musician, initially, her goal was to learn the ragas, then master and perform them. But soon she realised that it was more about the connect, healing power and love. Smita now understands the meaning of “vision” and its significance in her journey. “When I was a child, all I knew was the image of a woman in a crisp cotton sari, singing to a large audience, with a vertically-held tanpura (somewhat like the images of Meerabai),” says she. She never thought she would one day live her dream. Recalling how it all started, she adds it was her first guru’s words that motivated Smita to choose this profession, “You could be just another among thousands of engineers or choose to be one in a million with your talent.”

For her, though the market for Bollywood songs is bigger, the charm of Sufi is still intact. Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Nooran Sisters and many such artists are celebrated here. However, despite being popular, the artists are struggling because of the pay scale. Says she, “Only people from Mumbai and Delhi actually pay to hear Sufi music. There is no government patronage and the corporates are not interested much in uplifting the traditional art.”

But we cannot afford to lose our traditional art or replace them with anything Western. “We will then regret it. I am thankful to such festivals who call artists from across the platform and encourage them,” she adds.

Scriptures, nature, poetry, goodness, purity, love, fragrance, good food and music has been her source of inspiration. The everyday ordinariness attracts her more rather than something extraordinary.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/expression-of-soul-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/expression-of-soul.html
182,07-3-20,Edge of precipice,"Andrew Cohen’s series, Climate Change: The Facts, beams the moments of transformation of the planet and what we can do to halt the change right into our living rooms. By Team Viva

rHow did you conceptualise the series, Climate Change: The Facts?

The big science unit has got a long track record of journalism around climate change. And I think, over the last couple of years, the intensity of interest in this area has become greater. The world is changing. Hence, it felt like a perfect time to be making less of a definitive film which is more focussed on the moment because climate change keeps fluctuating all the time. This captures some moments of the changes in climate, brings together some of the leading climate change scientists, stories that really reveal how our planet is changing, and present solutions that may ultimately help us solve the problem.

Some of your key takeaways from the show.

I think one of the most overwhelming things that comes through in making a film like this is the question — how long have we really known about climate change? I was really surprised to see some archives from the ‘60s that talk about climate change in a way that feels very familiar to today’s time. So we have known about this for a very long time but it’s difficult to bring the world together and make them look at it in the same way to actually change our behaviours and the way we tackle the problem. But I think, it’s still clear that we do have potential solutions and that science and technology can lead us in that direction. So for all the shock that the journalism of the show brings, there’s also hope.

How can global climate change be tackled at individual level?

The first question here is — the balance between what you can do as an individual and what governments should be doing. It’s a really difficult one and has been debated a lot. And I think, it’s not for me to say what an individual shouldn’t be doing. Our film was there to show you where we stand in our understanding of climate change, how we have got here and what can potentially be done to tackle it. If you as an individual want to make your contribution, then it is in all of these ways combined — looking at your lifestyle, at your carbon footprint and thinking of how can you reduce it individually and that of your family? And the most interesting thing for me is that if it is even a miniscule amount of carbon in the big scheme of things, there’s something about the collective and about the fact that we are all realising what we need to do to bring the changes we want to see.

Can you throw some light on the damage caused due to climate change and the stories being shown in the series?

The film sheds light on many potential problems that the planet could face in terms of climate change. I think the ones that really struck me are the stories of the first climate refugees, people who are living in an area of Louisiana for a very long time and without having to completely evacuate because of the rising sea levels in that area. You get a sense of the depth of impact on humans when you see people literally leaving their homes. It has been there for centuries as a ghost town.

Do you think any technological breakthrough can help us prevent the issue of climate change?

It’s difficult to be completely optimistic at the moment, but it’s also difficult to be completely pessimistic. There are no technological options. We’re saying that just in Britain alone we can see the growth of renewable energy sources and massive wind farms. Britain is a world leader in wind farms. I think the whole question of carbon capture is a really interesting one that is looked at in the programme. There’s lots and lots of technology that is coming through your testing of electric jet engines that is something else that’s coming down the road. So, technology is moving in a direction that is far better for the planet. And it’s about working out which are the right ones to prioritise and push first.

What are some of the challenges faced and what kind of research was done in order to deliver some powerful facts on climate change?

The journalism of a film like this is incredibly challenging because in a fast moving area of scientific research, you want to make sure that you are absolutely up to date, and that you are revealing the best journalism to a global audience. So, we’re very careful to work very closely with some of the leading climate change scientists on the planet, people who’ve been involved in research on the subject for many decades. We have a team which is extremely experienced in this area and work through the journalism very slowly and methodically. And you’re adjusting it right up to the moment that the programme is delivered. But it’s a complicated subject. And you must be careful that while you want to deliver powerful messages, the interplay between where we are and what solutions can be are important. And you know, what we need to do next is incredibly complex and involves Government, economics, politics and individual choices. And so, we can only give you an insight. We’re not here to tell you what to do. We’re trying to use the very best science journalism to give you an insight that can help inform your decisions.

The show premieres in India in March. What’s your message to the audience on how can we fight this alarming issue?

I think my message to the audience would be the same in a lot of areas of science where people are worried or concerned, which is that the more you know, the more you understand about the subject. Then the more capable you are of making decisions that are right for your life, your family and hopefully for the communities and countries of the world. And so, you can really engage with this by understanding it, by understanding what the consequences are and what the reasons behind it are. And so, I’d encourage you not just to watch this series but to, to read, to listen and to really engage with why is this one of the biggest challenges facing our planet at the moment.

183,07-3-20,Ighalo double denies Rooney,"Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has challenged Manchester United to compete on three fronts after they moved into the FA Cup quarter-finals with a 3-0 win at Wayne Rooney’s Derby on Thursday.

Solskjaer’s side were never in danger of a shock fifth round exit against the second tier Rams as Luke Shaw’s opener and Odion Ighalo’s double booked a quarter-final trip to Norwich.

Rooney, United’s record goalscorer, is back in English football after moving to Derby from DC United in January and he was twice denied by Sergio Romero in his first meeting with his old club since 2018.

But United were always on top and extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to nine games ahead of Sunday’s derby showdown with Manchester City at Old Trafford.

They remain in the hunt for the FA Cup, the Europa League and still have a chance of qualifying for the Champions League via the Premier League.

United are fifth, three points behind Chelsea, and Solskjaer has urged his players to keep their foot on the gas as they look to turn a troubled season into a memorable finale.

“Today was the highest priority because we’re not going to pick and choose games or competitions. We have to go for everything, that’s what it is to be at Manchester United,” Solskjaer said.

“I’m very pleased with the performance and to go through. You never know, away from home, being the favourites and having City on Sunday how it’ll affect their mindset, but it was professional. “We’ve found form and defended well, we’ve had seven clean sheets in those nine games.”

United are chasing a record-equalling 13th FA Cup triumph.

They took control at Pride Park after 33 minutes when Shaw scored just his second career goal, his volley bouncing over Kelle Roos via a deflection off Jesse Lingard.

Nigerian striker Ighalo, signed on loan from Shanghai Shenhua in January, got the second goal seven minutes later.

Martyn Waghorn went close for Derby after the break but Ighalo ended the contest when he fired home to complete his double with 20 minutes left.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ighalo-double-denies-rooney.html
184,07-3-20,Liverpool hit by Alisson’s injury,"Jurgen Klopp has urged Liverpool to “fight” as the runaway Premier League leaders battle to end their mini-slump against relegation-threatened Bournemouth today.

Liverpool have lost three of their past four matches in all competitions but remain 22 points clear of Manchester City at the top of the league table.

Tuesday’s FA Cup defeat at the hands of Chelsea followed a shock Premier League loss against Watford last week.

In February they lost 1-0 to Atletico Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie.

The 3-0 defeat at Watford brought an abrupt end to a run of 18 straight victories in the Premier League but they need just four more wins to guarantee winning the title for the first time in 30 years.

Klopp said his team’s approach would not change despite their rocky run. “Of course winning gives you confidence, losing costs you confidence, that’s completely normal,” the Liverpool boss told his pre-match press conference on Friday.

“You start thinking about different things. It’s a long while ago (since a bad spell) but one defeat feels like two defeats — it’s not a massive difference.

“It’s how you get back on track immediately and you can do that not by hoping that things are now clicking even better than the game before so we have just to work really hard. We have to fight back on track.”

Liverpool momentum

Klopp said rediscovering momentum was important ahead of the second leg of the Champions League tie against Atletico next week and he expects a strong response against Bournemouth. “In a lot of moments we could have done better,” he said, referring to recent matches.

“We know that 100 percent and that’s what we are working on but we don’t take it for granted from now on that we will not score any more and they will score with each chance that they have. That’s not like it is.

“We know if we perform at our highest level, and there’s nothing else we want to do tomorrow, it will be difficult for Bournemouth. We should not forget that.”

Goalkeeper Alisson Becker has been ruled out of the Bournemouth match after suffering a muscle injury ahead of the midweek FA Cup tie at Chelsea. Earlier, Sadio Mane has also urged Liverpool to use the worst week of their season as fuel to power the Premier League leaders a step closer to the title when they face Cherries.

“Unfortunately Ali is out. He had a little incident in training before the Chelsea game,” Klopp told reporters on Friday.

“We all thought it was nothing and it was clear he would not play anyway, the plan was he was on the bench.

“There, we thought, ‘Come on, we don't have to take any risks' so left him out of the squad.

“We have another important game on Saturday and then on Wednesday, so we will be ready and we will be back again,” Mane said.

“This can happen in football and we are used to it.

“We just have to keep working hard and keep going if we want to be great champions.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/liverpool-hit-by-alisson---s-injury.html
185,07-3-20,Dier ready to play: Mourinho,"Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho says Eric Dier will be selected against Burnley today after declaring the England midfielder has recovered from his astonishing row with a fan.

Dier climbed into the stands at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to confront a supporter following Wednesday’s FA Cup fifth round defeat against Norwich.

The 26-year-old tried to approach the fan who was allegedly abusing his brother before being led away from the incident, which is likely to trigger a Football Association probe.

Dier was reported to be unflustered once he returned to the dressing room and Mourinho insisted he is in the right frame of mind to feature at Turf Moor.

“Eric is in the right frame of mind to play tomorrow, of course. The only thing that matters is: first of all, that nothing really big happened,” Mourinho told reporters on Friday.

“Secondly he played so, so well in the last two matches. Of course he is going to play.

“I would never do that (rest him). The player played so well. Nothing happened, nothing to be afraid of, nothing to be ashamed of.

“The football world is behind (him) and understands completely the circumstances.”

Mourinho acknowledged Dier, who has become a target for some frustrated Tottenham supporters this season, was wrong to confront the fan given he is supposed to set a professional example, but admitted he would have done the same thing.

“I look at myself and I am of course much older than Eric, and of course I have much more years in football than Eric,” he said.

“And as you know, I was born a footballer’s son, and I grew up as a football manager, and the only thing that I can say is that: if I see something happening with my son, I would do the same.

“I wouldn’t think two seconds about doing the same. So, that’s why I said I would do the same.

“But, as professionals, sometimes we have to go through difficult situations. And we have to try to cope with it.”

After the penalty shoot-out defeat to Norwich, Mourinho said he would only be able to prioritise one of the next two games, with a Champions League clash against Leipzig following the Burnley game.

Tottenham, hit by injuries to several players including star forwards Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, need Premier League points in the race to qualify for the Champions League.

They also trail Leipzig 1-0 ahead of the last 16 second leg in Germany on Tuesday.

Mourinho now says Tottenham will do their best to win both games. “We are in a situation where I think it is very hard to prioritise,” he said.

“But as I was saying after the match it was a discussion to have internally and especially the players feelings and the communication with the players is always the most important thing.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dier-ready-to-play--mourinho.html
186,07-3-20,"Stimac not happy with number of foreign players in ISL, I-League matches","National football team head coach Igor Stimac is not happy with more foreign players featuring in a match in Indian Super League and I-League, saying it was coming in the way of the country producing a future Sunil Chhetri.

Stimac said the ISL and I-League, the country’s first and second tier leagues, should follow Asian Football Confederation’s (AFC) policy of allowing a maximum of four foreign players in a match instead of the five permitted by them currently.

“My suggestion for top tier (league) in the country is to follow AFC rule of 3+1, that’s the basic rule for number of foreign players. It’s not strange that that most successful Asian countries are following that rule and that is why they are successful,” Stimac said at a media briefing.

“That is why they have option for national team to have strikers, offensive midfielders and the centre-backs,” he added.

Currently, ISL and I-League teams can field five foreign players at a given time in a match. On the other hand, AFC Champions League competition rules state that “each participating club may register four foreign players but at least one must have the nationality of an AFC member association”.

Stimac said in the current situation, it was difficult to get replacement for star striker Chhetri.

“We will never find a replacement for Chhetri if the situation is like this. We cannot take someone who has never played as a striker and put him in the national team. Where am I going to find a striker? Even in I-League, there are five foreign players.

“We don’t have (Indian) strikers in I-League. Only Indian Arrows is putting (striker) Vikram (Pratap Singh) to play. We are in a big problem. We need to start changing the things in favour of national team.”

The Croatian said “it would be ideal to merge the two leagues (ISL and I-League)”.

The Indian team is out of reckoning for a 2022 World Cup berth but Stimac said the country will have a chance to qualify for the 2026 edition.

“To wake up India in football, we need national team success. And there is a big chance in front of us, the 2026 World Cup. There will be 48 countries involved, which means there will be another 3-4-5 places for Asian countries to participate,” the head coach said.

“We have four years to prepare ourselves and be in the top 8 in Asia,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/stimac-not-happy-with-number-of-foreign-players-in-isl--i-league-matches.html
187,07-3-20,Suicide attackers hit outside US embassy in Tunis,"Suicide attackers struck outside the US embassy in the Tunisian capital on Friday, killing a police officer, wounding five other people and shaking a city repeatedly hit by jihadist violence.

The latest attack comes despite a state of emergency imposed in the North African nation in 2015 following a string of bloody assaults claimed by the Islamic State group.

An explosion rocked the Berges du Lac district where the highly fortified embassy is located at around midday Friday, causing panic among pedestrians and motorists in the area. “Two individuals targeted a security patrol... In the street leading to the American embassy,” the interior ministry said in a statement.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility.

Police at the scene said the assailants drove to the area on a motorcycle and detonated their explosive devices as officers deployed at a roundabout leading to the embassy approached them.

“The operation led to the death of two assailants, wounded five police and lightly injured a civilian,” the interior ministry said in an initial toll.

It later announced that one of the police officers, identified as Lieutenant Taoufik Mohammed El Nissaoui, had died of his injuries. “All the security units are on high alert,” the ministry said.

188,07-3-20,Biden gains new endorsements from moderate Dems,"Moderate Democrats are continuing to coalesce around Joe Biden following his strong performance in Super Tuesday primaries, which reset the 2020 Democratic race as a two-man contest between Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Biden’s campaign announced on Friday he had secured backing from Maggie Hassan, a first-term New Hampshire senator and former governor, who did not make an endorsement before her state’s early primary.

In a statement, Hassan said she voted for Biden, who she said has “the experience and character to lead our country forward.”

Former presidential hopeful John Delaney also released a statement reiterating his Super Tuesday endorsement of Biden, praising his commitment to “progress through pragmatism.”

Biden’s campaign says more than 50 elected officials and community leaders have signed on to support his bid since Super Tuesday, in which Biden won the majority of states over Sanders.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/biden-gains-new-endorsements-from-moderate-dems.html
189,07-3-20,Malaysia anti-graft chief who investigated 1MDB quits,"Lumpur: Malaysia’s anti-corruption chief, who had been investigating scandal-hit state fund 1MDB, said Friday she had resigned after a reformist government collapsed and a graft-tainted party took power.

The “Pact of Hope” alliance, which stormed to a historic victory in 2018 and ousted a long-ruling coalition, fell apart amid infighting last week and prime minister Mahathir Mohamad resigned.

Mahathir, 94, then sought to return as premier but unexpectedly lost to ex-interior minister Muhyiddin Yassin, who heads a coalition dominated by the multi-ethnic country’s Malay Muslim majority. Latheefa Koya, a leading human rights activist who had been head of the anti-corruption commission since June, said she had informed Muhyiddin she was quitting earlier this week but insisted she was not pressured.

“I also briefed the prime minister about our ongoing actions and efforts for the recovery of the stolen 1MDB monies from abroad,” she said in a statement.

“He was fully supportive of these actions.” Last week, Malaysia’s attorney general Tommy Thomas, who had brought corruption charges against ex-premier Najib Razak over the 1MDB controversy, also resigned.

Billions of dollars were stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad and spent on everything from a super-yacht to pricey artworks, in a fraud allegedly involving Najib and his cronies.

Najib’s coalition, which had governed Malaysia for six decades, was ejected from power in 2018 in large part due to the 1MDB allegations, and he is on trial for corruption.

Mahathir’s government had started recovering money from overseas allegedly looted from the fund.

But the new ruling coalition includes Najib’s United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party, and there are concerns his trial and others linked to the 1MDB scandal could be affected.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/malaysia-anti-graft-chief-who-investigated-1mdb-quits.html
190,07-3-20,US ready to collect DNA from detained migrants,"The US Government announced on Friday it is ready to begin collecting DNA from all immigrants it detains, to be saved in a federal police database.

The Department of Homeland Security first revealed the measure in October as part of President Donald Trump's efforts against undocumented migration, attracting strong criticism from civil liberties groups and migrants. A law adopted in 2005 authorizes certain federal agencies to collect DNA from foreigners who have been arrested, but Barack Obama's administration had asked for an exemption for migrants.

The government lacked the manpower to analyze hundreds of thousands of DNA tests each year, it argued at the time.

But technology has since advanced, making it easier to carry out the tests, the Department of Justice said.

""The proposed rule change would help to save lives and bring criminals to justice,"" said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. Human rights activists counter that the measure is a threat to personal data protection and blurs the line between criminals and migrants.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us-ready-to-collect-dna-from-detained-migrants.html
191,07-3-20,Bill Clinton says Lewinsky affair was to ‘manage anxieties',"Bill Clinton said he had an affair with Monica Lewinsky to help him deal with the stress of being president as he opened up in a documentary released on Friday about the scandal that led to his impeachment.

In the four-part Hulu series, Clinton describes his sexual relationship in the 1990s with the then 22-year-old White House intern as something he did ""to manage my anxieties for years.""

He said it had been motivated by life's ""pressure and disappointments and terrors, fears of whatever"" and said he felt ""terrible"" that the affair had defined Lewinsky's life.

""We all bring our baggage to life and sometimes we do things we shouldn't do,"" Clinton says.

""It was awful what I did,"" the 73-year-old added.

Bill and Hillary Clinton were interviewed separately about what they recall from that time for the series entitled ""Hillary,"" focused on the life of the former first lady.

Clinton's sexual relationship with Lewinsky and subsequent denial

about it under oath led to his impeachment in December 1998. He was acquitted by the Senate in February 1999 but the scandal came to define his presidency.

192,07-3-20,Shalom Namaste,"One naturally sees Israel through a prism of conflict. But if you go by photographer Idris Ahmed’s frames, then they present a timeless tribute to one of the world’s most soulful, resolute and news-worthy countries. Embracing moments on land, light, life and the soul of its inner spirit, his stunning images are about quiet moments of everydayness that anchor a restless world. Uma Nair brings a selection from the Kolkata International Photography Festival

Everyday idioms

Sitting at the mouth of the meandering Yarkon river, Tel Aviv has a six-mile beach popular with young, laid-back locals. Cyclists, joggers and dog walkers stroll the promenade, while sunbathers and surfers rule the beach, giving Israel’s second city a certain ‘Californian feel.’ “Israel has a tremendous history and legacy, architecturally speaking, much of which dates back to the architecture in Jerusalem which evolved over three millennia, formed by inspirations from the best Persian, Roman, Ottoman Turkish architecture, with a bit of colonial German architecture thrown in the mix,” says Idris who captures vignettes of the modern.

Jerusalem

No visit to the region would be complete without a trip to Jerusalem. With a history stretching back almost 5,000 years, and sights including the Dome of the Rock, the Western Wall, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and al-Aqsa Mosque, few cities resonate in the same way. Religion and rituals both come alive in images that reflect customs. The Jewish family during a bar mitzvah ceremony at Western Wall as well as the expressionist elegance of A young boy during his bar mitzvah ceremony are intense and inspiring. The black and white images have a resonance that talk to us about the mapping of life’s infinite greys. It is through the delicacy of details that shows us how Idris has a hand that is both experienced as well as restrained in its nuances of freezing the frame.

Time regained

Idris gives us a repertoire of the confluence of communities and their moments in everyday symbolism. Muslim woman walk towards Dome of the Rock and Muslim kids play in front of Dome of the Rock are two images that clearly signify the vitality of religion as well as a zest for living. The idea of the plurality of religions comes to the fore when we glimpse the images of Young orthodox Jews walking on the streets of Jerusalem as well as the nonchalant symbol of gay abandon when we look at Young Israelis skateboarding around old port at Namal, Tel Aviv.

We can gauge from these images the lifestyle that cruises in front of the camera — from colourful marketeers to families in prayer at the Western Wall, these incredible images move beyond the typical postcard images of the country to showcase the character of its people and the sanctity of the land they are so resolute in preserving. “While tourists flock to the salty waters of the Dead Sea, and the historic sites around its shores, most are unfamiliar with the Western Galilee region (the country’s most mountainous),” says Idris. “It calls itself the ‘Tuscany of the Middle East’, thanks to the lush greenery and Crusader sites, including the Montfort fortress, a ruined castle you can climb to enjoy spectacular views. The rolling landscape is perfect for a scenic day of cycling.”

Ultimately you must pause over the two images that echo the passion of the rituals in Christianity — Holy Fire, where an orthodox Christian pilgrim is holding candles during the Holy Fire ceremony on Easter and Divine Light, which has monks lighting up candles at Coptic Chapel on Good Friday. They transcend time and space.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shalom-namaste-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/shalom-namaste.html
193,07-3-20,Aping the gorillas,"Anjaly Thomas goes in search of the primate in DR Congo and discovers that many of its instincts are akin to humans

From Michelin-starred restaurants to hole-in-the-wall gems, awe-inspiring global cuisine to aromatic street carts, New York City has endless dining options. The cuisine of each borough and neighbourhood tells the story of the city’s history, culture and latest trends, making food tours the perfect way to experience authentic NYC. Visit the neighbourhoods that make each borough so special.

Two days after arriving in Goma, I huddled in an ageing Prado with a forest ranger and drove over roads that can best be described as difficult. We were headed to the headquarters of Virunga National Park. Here, we heard a lengthy explanation on gorilla conservation and how each of the families was different. The audience that had gathered there was urged to follow the rules and guidelines that would help preserve the apes’ diminishing population and set an example for future generations. After what seemed like an eternity, we were divided into groups and directed to follow the trained guides into the forest.

But let me give you a brief background before I relate the rest of the tale. Goma, the lakeside town of Democratic Republic of Congo, borders Rwanda. It is the United Nation’s biggest base for peacekeeping force and is the starting point of all adventures in the eastern side of DR Congo. The town is flanked by an active volcano and is the gateway to Virunga National Park.

When we reached an altitude of 1,300m after an arduous trek, the onslaught of humidity, heat and no signs of silverbacks weakened our morale. Despite that, we continued to drag our feet over wet and slippery earth, deep inside the park with only one aim in mind — sighting primates. Taking tiny sips of water, we plodded on, occasionally hacking away at bushes to create a trail, waiting for the moment when our rangers would give us the good news. We had been warned against wandering off the path but considering the non-existence of one, they needn’t have worried. We kept our heads down and focussed on our step.

We were in untouched territory. There were no tracks to follow and except for the rangers’ instincts honed by experience and vague clues along the track — like depressed bamboo thickets, there was little else to lead us to the primates. The walk was energy-sapping and we had lost all hope when suddenly, the rangers motioned us to pull on our surgical masks. And stay still.

“They are very close,” we were told. The evidence of it was in a fresh pile of gorilla poop that was currently under inspection by one of the rangers. He prodded the poop to check for freshness with a finger. It was warm. It might sound funny but the sight of gorilla poop elevated our spirits immensely. Suddenly, three words rang out sharply. “Down. NOW. Quiet.”

We dropped to our fours. Some of us pressed against the bamboo thicket, not daring to breathe. Masks in place, we waited. After what seemed like an eternity, less than 10 feet away, a scene straight out of the movies played out. A giant silverback was pulling himself up slowly, a sign that he was agitated and about to show it. Bloodshot eyes stared out of his black, hairy face. The closer he came, the greater was his fury.

From where we lay, he appeared bigger than his 1.5 metre height. My heart beat wildly as I watched this magnificent creature grow bigger and somehow more menacing right before my eyes. Strangely, I was not afraid. No one breathed. He had seen us.

Even before we could let the sight sink in, he let out a blood-curdling scream and began pounding his chest open-fisted and rhythmically — left, right, left — battering our confidence on the forest floor. It was the closest I have ever come to an ape and any bravado that we had carried, deserted us completely. He was so close, I could smell him.

It was a moment that every gorilla-tracker hopes to experience but it took everything we had not to react even though we shared about 90 per cent of our DNA with the ape, who looked determined to trample his intruding cousin. Out there, family bonding didn’t exist.

The pounding continued. We watched, transfixed. After the initial surge of fear, some of the confidence returned, just enough so that we scrambled for our cameras. The gorilla-world, we’d been told, was rather dramatic and loud and alternated between screams, hoots, growls and roars so they could be heard in the wild. The sounds they produced depended on their state of mind but none of that information helped when facing the real thing.

We had been extremely fortunate to see the gorilla’s most famous gesture — the chest pounding while standing on two legs where he hit the chest alternately with open hands — rather than with clenched fists as portrayed in most films. But much as we’d have liked to applaud our good luck, we still remained on the ground.

The silverback dropped to all fours, stared at us briefly before ambling away. No one moved till the rangers announced in jest. “It’s safe now. We can go to see the family. They are not aggressive and there are many babies. You will get your private time. You can take pictures.”

On that assurance, we crept into a clearing and there they were. The gorilla family — all seven of them, young and old, lost in their world of bamboo shoots — unmindful of intruders. We were given “time to connect” with them, provided we obeyed the seven metre distance rule.

At some point, I watched as mother gorilla grabbed her baby from its father and disappear into the bush. So like humans. I stopped photographing. I wanted to see their faces, noses and feet and maybe make eye contact. However, they didn't stay in one place for long, preferring to rest under thickets in each other's company.

We maintained a safe distance but the seven metre rule didn’t deter a little baby from hurtling himself at me — talk about family bonding.

Perhaps, just perhaps I could touch it? Inadvertently, I slipped off my mask; something like a maternal instinct gripped me, I wanted to pick him up and hold him close. But the smell hit me. There was a reason for the mask after all.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/aping-the-gorillas-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/aping-the-gorillas.html
194,07-3-20,Bilbao set up all-Basque final,"A goal nine minutes from time by defender Yuri Berchiche took Athletic Bilbao into an all-Basque Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad on Thursday when they edged Granada on away goals.

Athletic had led 1-0 from the first leg of the semi-final but fellow La Liga side Granada levelled the tie on the night through Carlos Fernandez in the 48th minute with a fine header from a cross by Venezuelan Darwin Machis. Granada, in their first semi-final since 1969, then took a 2-1 overall lead thanks to a goal from German Sanchez after 76 minutes, again with Machis the provider from a corner.

However, their hopes of making the final were dashed when left-back Berchiche scored with a low drive in the 81st minute after being set up by Mikel Vesga to secure his team a spot in the April 18 finale in Seville.

195,07-3-20,Russell show lifts Windies,"Andre Russell hit six sixes in a blistering 14-ball innings as West Indies smashed their way to a seven-wicket victory over Sri Lanka and seal the two-match Twenty20 series on Friday.

West Indies’ bowlers limited Sri Lanka to 155 for six and then Brandon King struck 43 off 21 balls and Russell made 40 off just 14 balls as West Indies raced to 158 for three in 17 overs.

The tourists also easily won the first game by 25 runs this week.

Though West Indies are reigning World T20 champions it was their first series win in the format in more than a year.

The 31-year-old frequently rubbed his shoulder during his smash-and-grab innings in which he hit one ball out of the Pallekele ground.

No batsman has hit six sixes in so few balls in a T20 international.

Young opener King also sparkled with the bat, making 43 off 21 balls, including eight boundaries..

197,07-3-20,IPL very much on: Ganguly,"The Indian Premier League (IPL) is “very much on schedule”, BCCI President Sourav Ganguly said on Friday, asserting that all measures will be in place to tackle the rapidly-spreading novel coronavirus threat which has wreaked havoc on sporting calendars globally.

The glitzy T20 event, featuring both Indian and international stars, gets underway on March 29 in Mumbai.

“IPL is very much on. Everywhere, the tournaments are going on. England are already in Sri Lanka. South Africa are here. There are no issues,” Ganguly asserted.

“County teams are travelling all over the world. They are travelling to Abu Dhabi, UAE to play. So there is no problem,” he added.

Asked about the precautionary measures to ensure that players and fans are not affected, Ganguly said a medical team is thrashing out the specifics.

“We will take all precautions. I don’t know exactly what are the extra measures. It’s only medical team which will tell us about that,” he said.

“The medical team is already in touch with the hospitals so that everything is available. We will do what the doctors say. They are the professionals.

“All medical issues will be addressed by the medical team. Every tournament will go on,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ipl-very-much-on--ganguly.html
198,07-3-20,Starc to cheer for wife Alyssa,"Top Australia pacer Mitchell Starc will miss the final ODI against South Africa to watch wife Alyssa Healy play the ICC Women’s Twenty20 World Cup final against India here on Sunday.

Wicketkeeper-batter Healy will be a part of Australia’s team which will take on an in-form Indian side at the MCG. The four-time champion home team would be aiming to defend the title against the first-time finalists.

There to support Healy would be Starc, who will miss the third and final ODI scheduled to be played in Potchefstroom today to be in Melbourne.

“It is a once-in-a-lifetime chance for Mitch to watch Alyssa in a home World Cup final and so we were happy to allow him to return home to support his wife and be part of a fantastic occasion,” Australia men’s team coach, Justin Langer said.

“It is something we have been talking about for a while and, given Mitch has had a considerable workload in all three formats, his heading home a couple of days ahead of the rest of the squad means he’ll have a chance to refresh ahead of our home and away ODI and T20I against New Zealand that will wrap up our season,” Langer added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/starc-to-cheer-for-wife-alyssa.html
199,07-3-20,Can Harman throw life’s biggest birthday bash in Sunday’s final?,"Just one win away from Women’s T20 World Cup glory, Harmanpreet Kaur could be about to throw the biggest birthday bash of her life.

Hosts Australia are used to big stage success — with 12 of this year’s squad having lifted the trophy in 2018 — and they will want the show to be theirs in front of a huge crowd at the MCG on Sunday, especially after losing to India in their opening game on home soil.

But if there’s one player with a track record of downing their hopes, it’s Harmanpreet.

On Sunday, India will no doubt be looking to release their not-so-secret weapon once again.

But regardless of whether or not she lifts the trophy on her 31st birthday, the India captain knows the occasion will be one to savour forever.

Kaur is on the brink of making history. When she leads India onto the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Sunday, she will become the first woman to ever captain India in a T20 World Cup final.

It’s not just her country’s first appearance in the showpiece, but also one that could break history in setting a world record attendance for a women’s sporting event.

But it’s not just about the history books, either. Sunday will be a special day for the skipper in more ways than one with her parents travelling from Moga to see her in action — her mother due to watch her play cricket for the first time.

If she was to mark the celebration with a win with them on International Women’s Day, it would be the most fitting of moments for a player who has revolutionised women’s cricket in her country.

As a kid, Kaur used to get teased for saying she wanted to be a cricketer when she grew up. But that clearly only fuelled her with more motivation to achieve new levels of greatness.

She featured in the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2009, but it took a while, and plenty of patience fine-tuning her game as a go-to batter and off-spinner, for Kaur to establish herself as a name in the side.

In the wake of a disappointing home World Cup, where India won just one game in the group stages, Kaur was handed the captaincy reigns in 2016 — and that’s where it all changed.

Kaur’s innings of an unbeaten 171 to flatten Australia in the 2017 World Cup semi-final sparked a new triumph for women’s cricket in India.

It did more than take them to the sold-out final at Lord’s. #Harmanpreet was trending on Twitter and suddenly she was the leading voice to take women’s cricket to the next level, both at elite and grassroots level.

When it comes to career milestones, Kaur’s got them aplenty.

In 2016, she became the first Indian woman to sign an overseas T20 contract when she signed for inaugural Women’s Big Bash League champions Sydney Thunder.

In her debut season, her aggressiveness saw her win plenty of games while finishing as the Thunder’s lead run-scorer, also offering an all-round show with the ball.

And later that year, she led India to their sixth straight Asia Cup crown.

In 113 T20I innings, she has shone on all fronts, scoring 2,182 runs and taking 29 wickets since her debut against England in 2009.

She may have been outshone on the batting front by the likes of Shafali Verma in the run-up to this year’s final, but there’s no doubting Kaur is capable of stepping up in the middle.

With 183 runs at the 2018 T20 World Cup, the captain has scored the second-highest number of runs for India at the tournament, 32 behind Mithali Raj’s 208 in 2014.

Kaur has only hit double-digits once in India’s four wins Down Under, but she will definitely want to finish off on a high as she is a big-stage player and knows exactly how important it is to step up in what will be the mother of all clashes.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/can-harman-throw-life---s-biggest-birthday-bash-in-sunday---s-final-.html
200,07-3-20,Schutt hates playing against India,"Clobbered by Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana recently, Australian pacer Megan Schutt says she hates playing against India and doesn’t want to bowl at the marauding duo during powerplay when the two teams clash in the Women’s T20 World Cup final.

Schutt, who took a crucial 2/17 in Australia’s five-run win over South Africa in the rain-hit semifinal on Thursday, has still not recovered from the drubbing she got at the hands of Verma in the tournament-opener.

She was hit for four boundaries by Verma in her opening over of the tournament, and Schutt admitted her concerns about bowling to Indian openers.

“I just hate playing India — they’ve got the wood over me,” Schutt was quoted as saying by the official website of the ICC.

“Smriti and Shafali have got me covered. That six Shafali hit me for in the tri-series was probably the biggest one I’ve ever been hit for.

“There are obviously some plans we’re going to revisit as bowlers. (But) clearly, I’m not the best match-up to those two in the Powerplay. They find me quite easy to play,” she added.

Schutt bore the brunt of Verma and Mandhana’s attacking fury in the very first over of last month’s tri-series as well. She was struck for four by Verma off the first ball and lifted for a six by Mandhana.

But both the sides will again meet each other in summit clash, where India will have an edge.

“We’re at that final we’ve been talking about for so long and against India, which is super fitting considering the tri-series we had. It couldn’t really be a bigger challenge for us,” Schutt said.

“It’s not really a bad thing, it’s good we’re going up against a team we’ve played a lot recently and it’s the same for them as well.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/schutt-hates-playing-against-india.html
201,07-3-20,Destiny is in India’s favour: Veda,"Senior India batter Veda Krishnamurthy says her team seems destined to win the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup in its maiden final appearance provided it keeps nerves in check against four-time champions Australia at Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Sunday.

India will have the psychological advantage going into the final as they had stunned the defending champions by 17 runs in the tournament opener.

“It’s all about destiny, and I’m a big believer in destiny. I feel like this is the way it was meant to be. There is a joke going around that this World Cup is made in such a way that it’s helping us, starting from the wickets to everything else,” she was quoted as saying by the tournament’s official website.

The Harmanpreet Kaur-led India reached the final on the basis of their unbeaten record in the tournament after their semifinal against England was washed out on Thursday.

Krishnamurthy, who was a part of the Indian team that finished runner-up to England in the 2017 Women’s ODI World Cup, understands the pain of missing out on a world title.

“Being in the final is just reward for the way we played in the group stages. There was an advantage to having won all our games with the weather not in our hands.”

The team’s first target of reaching the final having achieved, the 27-year-old player said the Indians now need to hold their nerves and remain focussed leading up to the big day on Sunday.

“We said the first aim was to get to the final and take it from there. We’ve crossed the first stage. We need to make sure we hold our nerves and we do what we need to do on the final day,” she said.

India’s recent rivalry with Australia has taken fascinating twists and turns, with Kaur’s outfit chasing down 173 in their recent tri-series and getting home by 17 runs in the T20 World Cup opener.

But all is not hunky-dory for Krishnamurthy on the personal front. Considered a great finisher, she has recovered from a series of single-digit scores in the tri-series to score 20 from 11 balls in a finishing role against Bangladesh.

Having amassed just 35 runs from four matches in the tournament so far, the Karnataka batter knows her role in the team.

“As an individual, the role given to me is very consistent in the last year. They’ve put effort in the last year to keep me there and I’ve been supported by every individual, not just one or two. The entire team, with all the support staff have shown faith in me,” she said.

“I know coming into the World Cup, I would play a crucial role to finish the innings well, which I felt I was unable to do in the last World Cup in the West Indies,” she added.

Krishnamurthy said specific roles have been set for every player of the squad and they all are trying to contribute as much as they can to help the team achieve its goal.

“I was very motivated to do my role and I’ve been working on that. It’s not just me, all 15 players involved know what their role is,” she said.

“I’m happy we’re all putting in efforts and executing our role properly. Even if it’s a smallish contribution of saving a couple of runs, it’s all panned out really well.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/destiny-is-in-india---s-favour--veda-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/destiny-is-in-india---s-favour--veda.html
202,07-3-20,Avoid putting pressure on shooters: Rana,"The shooting contingent is one of the strongest points for India going into the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and shooting coach Jaspal Rana feels that not putting pressure on the young shooters will go a long way in ensuring that they perform to their best later in the year.

Indian shooters have earned an unprecedented 15 Olympic quota places over the course of the qualification period.

“All 15 shooters are some of the best in the world,” Rana said. “They fought well and grabbed those quota places. It was not something that happened over the last few competitions, they fought much before that. Every now and then they beat shooters from countries like China, Korea and the European countries. This is not something small, it has never happened before.

203,07-3-20,Delhi shooting WC postponed due to Coronavirus,"The upcoming combined shooting World Cup in the national capital was on Friday postponed to May, while an Olympic test event in Tokyo stood cancelled due to the global novel Coronavirus outbreak.

The tournament, sanctioned by the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF), was to be held from March 15 to 25 in the capital’s Dr Karni Singh Shooting Range. The Olympic Test event was scheduled to be held from April 16.

The World Cup will now held in two parts before the Olympic Games.

“It is proposed to divide the World Cup in two parts and hold Rifle and Pistol competitions on May 5-12, 2020, while Shotgun competitions - on June 2-9, 2020,” the ISSF said in a statement.

The decision was taken after the tournament organisers National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) approached the ISSF with a proposal to postpone the event.

The development comes after the government imposed several restrictions on the entry of travellers from affected countries such as China, Italy, South Korea, Japan and Iran, in a bid to contain the coronavirus outbreak.

The organising committee has also requested the ISSF to restore ranking points in the tournament, which were taken away after withdrawals by multiple nations.

“The OC has also requested the (ISSF) President to accord his consent so that both these World Cups would see the ISSF restoring full ranking points other than and including those for MQS,” the NRAI said in a statement.

“We are confident that this shall be deeply appreciated by all competing nations and their athletes. The ISSF has informed the OC that it has taken this forward with the IOC, and expects its decision in this regard very soon.”

Considering the extraordinary situation, the ISSF has also requested the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to prolong the internal Olympic qualification period in order to ensure all shooters get equal chances of making it to the Games.

“In case of the IOC approval, the World Cups in Munich, Germany, and Baku, Azerbaijan, can also influence the outcome of the Olympic Qualification,” the ISSF said.

“It must be noted that all Qualification Quota Places, as planned, will be allocated by May 31, 2020,” the sport’s apex body added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/delhi-shooting-wc-postponed-due-to-coronavirus.html
204,07-3-20,Goa seek to plot greatest-ever ISL comeback,"FC Goa face Chennaiyin FC in the second leg of their Indian Super League semifinals, looking to overturn a 4-1 deficit, at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here today.

FC Goa will be boosted by the return of Edu Bedia who missed the first leg game in Chennai — which they lost 1-4 — due to personal reasons.

There is more good news as Brandon Fernandes and Hugo Boumous, who were injured for last week’s tie, are back in contention for a start. Boumous, in particular, has been in spectacular form this season having scored 10 and assisted 11 in 14 matches.

With the return of Brandon, FC Goa would hope for better deliveries from wide positions, something which was missing from their game in the first leg.

Ferran Corominas will play as a number nine after playing as a withdrawn forward in the last game. The Spanish striker has 14 goals to his name this season and FC Goa need his goals now more than ever.

Interim coach Clifford Miranda will have a decision to make as to whether he would deploy an all-attacking line-up of Bedia, Boumous and Corominas or choose to go with two foreign centre-backs in Mourtada Fall and Carlos Pena.

“We have to win to overcome the deficit, but that does not mean we go all out from minute one. It’s 90 minutes and more and whatever football that I know, it is not decided in the first 10 to 15 minutes. It will be till the final whistle and we will take it minute-by-minute,” Miranda said.

Meanwhile, Chennaiyin FC would look to score first and make the task even more improbable for the home side. Should Chennaiyin find the back of the net, FC Goa would need at least five goals to move to the final.

Chennaiyin head coach Owen Coyle has mentioned that his players would not be lackadaisical in the second leg, despite enjoying a three-goal lead.

He would also ask for an improved performance from the front three of Nerijus Valskis, Rafael Crivellaro and Andre Schembri who had a quiet game by their standards in Chennai. FC Goa also need to keep a check on the Chennaiyin attackers who are more than capable of hurting the opponent through a quick counter-attack.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/goa-seek-to-plot-greatest-ever-isl-comeback.html
205,07-3-20,"Mary, Panghal begin quest for Tokyo berth","London Olympic Bronze medallist Mary Kom (51kg) and World Championships Silver medallist Amit Panghal (52kg) will begin their quest for a Tokyo Olympic berth when they enter the ring at the at the Asian/Oceanian Olympic Qualifiers in Amman, Jordan today.

Mary’s hunger at the age of 37 has been exemplary as she sets her sights on qualifying for the Olympic for a second time. Riding on a deep desire to bring Gold for the country, Mary Kom has been putting in the hard yards at training a few months after earning a Bronze at the World Championships, that made her the first boxer — male or female — to win a staggering eight medals from the prestigious world event.

The six-time world champion has been seeded second in her category and she will face New Zealand’s Tasmyn Benny in the first round.

Two wins will take her to Tokyo in what could realistically be her last appearance at the mega quadrennial Games and Mary will do everything possible to finish her Olympic career with the highly-coveted Gold medal.

“Mary knows that this is her last Olympics and wants to do her best to close her dream with a medal. She has worked hard especially the reactivity work on the legs as well and has been working hard to be in good shape,” said Foreign Coach for Indian women’s boxing Raffaele Bergamasco.

As for Panghal, he is currently enjoying a purple patch of his career. A Gold at the Asian Games was the start of his dominant show and he only soared to even greater heights in his next few elite tournaments. With a Gold at the Asian Championships and a historic Silver at the World Championships, sky is the limit for the 24-year-old, who give his all to fulfil his Olympic dream.

He starts off his campaign against Mongolia’s Enkhmanadakh Kharkhuu after a first-round bye as the top seed in his category and has a 1-1 record against his opponent.

Determined as ever, Panghal is upbeat to avenge his defeat in his last meeting with Kharkuu and get his campaign off to a flying start.

“Amit boxed against him before in Asian Games and beat him one-sided. And in the World Military Games, Amit lost by 5:0 to the same guy. Our plan is to create surprises in every round and am sure Amit would like to even scores as he faces his opponent tomorrow (Saturday),” said CA Kuttappa, India’s head boxing coach.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mary--panghal-begin-quest-for-tokyo-berth.html
206,07-3-20,Vikas in last 8,"Commonwealth Games Gold-medallist Vikas Krishan (69kg) entered the quarterfinals of the Asian Olympic Qualifiers of boxing with a thumping win over Kyrgyzstan’s Nursultan Mamataly here on Friday.

Krishan clinched a 5-0 triumph to make the last eight stage, where he will square off against third seed and Asian Silver-medallist Sewonrets Okazawa of Japan. Okazawa, who won a Gold medal at last year’s Olympic test event in Tokyo, defeated Taiwan’s Pan Hung-Ming in his pre-quarterfinal bout.

Krishan came into the event after claiming a Gold medal at the SAG in December last year. The SAG was his first amateur event after an undefeated stint in the professional circuit.

In a near-perfect display of his trademark defensive game, Krishan was consistently impressive. The Indian slowly built up the tempo and struck a particularly hard right hook in the second round to assert his dominance. The Kyrgyz boxer was left quite frustrated by Krishan’s control over the proceedings.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/vikas-in-last-8.html
207,07-3-20,Hardik smashes 158 off 55 balls,"Fit-again India all-rounder Hardik Pandya blazed his way to an unbeaten 158 off just 55 balls against BPCL in a semifinal match of the D Y Patil T20 Cup here on Friday.

Pandya, who returned to competitive cricket in this tournament, struck six fours and 20 sixes during his blitzkrieg to help Reliance 1 post 238/4 in 20 overs.

The BPCL bowlers — Sandeep Sharma (0/37), Sylvester D’Souza (1/56), India all-rounder Shivam Dube (1/40), Parikshit Valsangkar (0/28), Sagar Udeshi (0/45) and Rahul Tripathi (2/32) — were hammered by Hardik, who looks all set to make a comeback to the ODI team versus South Africa.

In response, BPCL were bowled out for 134 as Reliance 1 registered a 104-run victory.

While bowling too, Hardik took a wicket and conceded six runs in one over. India speedster Bhuvneshwar Kumar also picked up a wicket for Reliance 1.

But, Hardik’s side failed to win the tournament after they lose to Indian Oil later in evening by 11 runs in final.

India opener Shikhar Dhawan scored 69 during chase but that wasn’t enough for the side as Indian Oil restricted them to 183/7.

Earlier, Indian Oil scored 194/5 on the back of their skipper Aditya Tare’s unbeaten 75.

Dhawan (69 off 41 balls; 6x4, 2x6) single-handedly steered his team’s chase as all other Reliance 1 batsmen, including Hardik Pandya (0), faltered.

Dhawan was caught in a horrible mix up and was run out. This eventually led to Reliance 1's loss.

Hardik perished for a first ball duck in the final. Hardik gave a sitter off Siddhesh Lad.

Bhuvaneshwar Kumar was expensive with figures of 0/50 from his four overs in the final.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/hardik-smashes-158-off-55-balls.html

Ireland, in their 1,000th ‘capped’ match since 1855, made 172 for six as Paul Stirling smashed a quick-fire 60 and fellow opener Kevin O’Brien 35.

Indian Premier League spin star Rashid Khan took three wickets as he restricted the Irish after Mujeeb Ur Rahman and Shapoor Zadran leaked runs.

Hazratullah Zazai and Rahmanullah Gurbaz got Afghanistan off to a solid start before offspinner Simi Singh had both leg before for 23 and 28 respectively.

Karim Janat and Asghar Afghan were run out cheaply but Samiullah Shinwari and Shapoor Zadran steadied the ship before rain halted play at 133 for 5 off 15 overs.

209,07-3-20,"Nerves, habitual winners Australia stand between India and elusive ICC trophy","The Indian women's team will have to overcome big match pressure as it aims to exorcise the ghosts of the past in the T20 World Cup final against habitual winners Australia in front of a record crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground here on Sunday.

India go into the final unbeaten after topping the group stage where they had beaten the four-time champions Australia in the tournament-opener.

After the semifinal against England was washed out, the Harmanpreet Kaur-led squad advanced to their maiden summit clash, having finished first in Group A.

The refreshing firepower of 16-year-old Shafali Verma at the top and consistency of India's spin-heavy bowling attack has contributed massively to the team's success so far in the competition.

However, much more is needed from star batters Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet if India are to win their maiden ICC trophy.

The brittle middle-order too needs to deliver. And besides doing the right things on the field, India will also have to win the battle of nerves in the all important game.

Australia, who had beaten India in the preceding tri-series final, find themselves in familiar territory having made their sixth successive final in seven editions.

They know how to win the big moments in high-pressure games, while India have been found wanting on that front. The visitors had capitulated to England in the 2017 ODI World Cup final and 2018 World T20 semifinal.

It may be a tad unfair on the teenager but the team will expect Shafali to provide another flying start and hope this time the experienced Mandhana too fires. There can't be a bigger stage for Harmanpreet to be back amongst the runs and lead the team from the front.

If it was not for Shafali, India would have struggled to post competitive totals with the middle and lower-order doing precious little. The team did not cross the 150-run mark in the group stage but still managed to get over the line, thanks to a disciplined bowling effort.

Leggie Poonam Yadav has made a sensational comeback from a finger injury and is tournament's leading wicket-taker with nine wickets alongside Australia pacer Megan Schutt.

Pacer Shikhar Pandey too has been impressive, while left-arm spin duo of Radha Yadav and Rajeshwari Gayakwad has kept things tight.

It will be interesting to see how Australians play Poonam on Sunday as the leggie was all over them in the tournament opener.

More than 75,000 tickets have already been sold for the final and the figure could go as high as 90,000, unprecedented in women's cricket.

Australia, led by Meg Lanning, are backing themselves to win in front of the home fans though a sizable number of Indian fans too is expected at the iconic MCG.

Lead men's team pacer Mitchell Starc will also be in attendance, rooting for the home team and his wife Alyssa Healy after getting clearance to leave South Africa in the middle of the tour.

Australia's campaign has been hit by injuries to pacer Tayla Vlaeminck at the start and star all-rounder Elysse Perry was ruled out of the remainder of the tournament before the semifinal against South Africa.

Despite the twin setbacks, Australia have stormed into yet another title clash.

""We're not coming just to put on a good show. We're coming here to win and that's the attitude we're going in with. It's been a long time coming and the build-up to the game is something I've not experienced before. It will be the biggest moment of my career,"" said Lanning.

Squads:

India Women: Harmanpreet Kaur (c), Smriti Mandhana, Shikha Pandey, Poonam Yadav, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Veda Krishnamurthy, Deepti Sharma, Jemimah Rodrigues, Pooja Vastrakar, Taniya Bhatia, Radha Yadav, Harleen Deol, Arundhati Reddy, Shafali Verma, Richa Ghosh.

212,07-3-20,Coronavirus: Srinagar mayor calls for cancellation of Khelo India winter games,"Amid the coronavirus scare, Srinagar Mayor Junaid Mattu has called for cancellation of Khelo India's first winter games chapter, which starts in Jammu and Kashmir's Gulmarg town on Saturday.

Union Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju has reached Kashmir to inaugurate the event, which would continue till Wednesday. Around 800-900 sportspersons will be taking part in different events at the ski-resort in north Kashmir's Baramulla district.

""In view of the #COVID2019 situation, I personally believe the 'Khelo India' sports event in Gulmarg should be cancelled,"" Mattu tweeted on Friday evening. ""I have conveyed this to the administration as well as the Lieutenant Governor of J&K, Sh. G. C. Murmu. Precautions are vital.""

PDP president Mehbooba Mufti's daughter, Iltija Mufti, has also criticised the administration for allowing the sports event.

""At a time when Coronovirus (sic) has caused a global health crisis & EU - India summit deferred, J&K admin is organising a massive sports event in Gulmarg. Why should Kashmiris bear a staggering cost for showcasing 'normalcy'?"" Iltija, who uses her mother's verified Twitter handle, said.

A number of events related to Holi and Women's Day celebrations were cancelled while the UGC asked universities to avoid large gatherings as precautionary measures against coronavirus, as a man from Delhi tested positive on Friday, the 31st such case in the country.

The mayor also said that the weekly flea market, locally called as 'Sunday Market', should also not be allowed this weekend.

""I'm also of the FIRM opinion that we should not allow the Sunday Flea Market in Srinagar this weekend (for the nature of the weather, the source countries where the bulk merchandise is imported from AND the number of people who visit the market). Have conveyed this as well,"" Mattu posed on Twitter.

Jaishankar criticised the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for its criticism on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, saying its director had been wrong previously too and one should look at the UN body's past record on handling the Kashmir issue.

""We have tried to reduce the number of stateless people through this legislation. That should be appreciated,"" he said when asked about the CAA at the ET Global Business Summit. ""We have done it in a way that we do not create a bigger problem for ourselves.""

214,07-3-20,ED continues questioning Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor,"The Enforcement Directorate on Saturday continued questioning Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor in connection with a money laundering probe against him and others, officials said.

They said Kapoor was brought to the agency's office in the Ballard Estate area Saturday afternoon.

The ED had searched Rana's residence in the upscale 'Samudra Mahal' complex in the Worli area on Friday night and had grilled him there too.

The questioning of Kapoor is continuing, they said.

The case against Kapoor is linked to the scam-hit DHFL as the loans lent by the bank to the company allegedly turned non-performing assets (NPAs), they said.

Action against Kapoor is being conducted under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) by the ED.

The central agency is also probing Kapoor's role in connection with the disbursal of loans to some corporate entities and the subsequent alleged kickbacks reportedly received in his wife's accounts.

Other alleged irregularities are also under the agency's scanner, including the one related to the alleged PF fraud in the Uttar Pradesh power corporation, they added.

The CBI has recently taken over investigation into the Rs 2,267-crore Employees' Provident Fund fraud in Uttar Pradesh, where hard-earned savings of power sector employees were invested in Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL).

The ED action came after the Reserve Bank on Thursday imposed a moratorium on the capital-starved Yes Bank, capping withdrawals at Rs 50,000 per account and superseded the board of the private sector lender with immediate effect.

Yes Bank will not be able to grant or renew any loan or advance, make any investment, incur any liability or agree to disburse any payment.

As per the RBI's draft reconstruction scheme, State Bank of India will pick up 49 per cent stake in the crisis-ridden Yes Bank under a government-approved bailout plan.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ed-continues-questioning-yes-bank-founder-rana-kapoor-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/ed-continues-questioning-yes-bank-founder-rana-kapoor.html
215,07-3-20,CBI vs CBI: Court takes cognisance of charge sheet,"A Delhi court on Saturday took cognisance of the CBI charge sheet in a bribery case in which the agency recently gave clean chit to its former special director Rakesh Asthana.

Special CBI judge Sanjeev Aggarwal observed that there was no sufficient ground to proceed against Asthana and CBI's DSP Devender Kumar, who was arrested in 2018 and later got bail.

The court summoned ""middleman"" Manoj Prasad, who was arrayed as an accused in the charge sheet.

Besides, the court also summoned Prasad's brother Someshwar Srivastava and father-in-law Sunil Mittal, saying there was sufficient material to proceed against them.

Srivastava and Mittal's names had cropped up during the probe.

The court directed Prasad, Srivastava and Mittal to appear before the court on April 13.

The court also said that the CBI may file a charge sheet if it finds anything against Asthana in its ongoing probe.

The judge took cognisance of the charge sheet filed under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating) and 385 (extortion) of IPC and sections of Prevention of Corruption Act.

The court was earlier told by the former investigator agency of the case, A K Bassi, that there were ""clinching evidence"" against Asthana in the case.

The charge sheet, filed on February 11, had only arrayed Prasad as an accused.

Asthana and CBI's DSP Devender Kumar, who was arrested in 2018 and later got bail, were named in column 12 of the charge sheet in the case since there was not enough evidence to make them accused.

Suspended DSP Devender Kumar was the investigating officer in a 2017 case involving meat exporter Moin Qureshi.

Satish Sana, who was arrested for alleged links to Moin Qureshi money laundering case, had also claimed links to senior CBI and RAW officials.

The current case of alleged bribery was lodged on a complaint of Sana.

The court had on February 12 expressed displeasure over the Central Bureau of Investigation's investigation into the case and it had asked why the accused with bigger roles were roaming free while the probe agency had arrested its own deputy superintendent of police.

The CBI had registered the case against Asthana on the basis of a complaint from Hyderabad-based businessman Satish Sana, facing probe in a 2017 case involving meat exporter Moin Qureshi.

Kumar was the probe officer in the case involving Qureshi.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cbi-vs-cbi--court-takes-cognisance-of-charge-sheet-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/cbi-vs-cbi--court-takes-cognisance-of-charge-sheet.html
216,07-3-20,"As Uddhav visits Ayodhya,Sena says no change in party ideology","On a day Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray is visiting Ayodhya to commemorate 100 days in office, the Sena, which heads the tripartite dispensation in the state, on Saturday said there is no change in its ideology.

Launching a veiled attack on its erstwhile ally BJP, an editorial in the Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' also said that Lord Ram and Hindutva is not the sole property of any single political party.

The Sena also said the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government--which also comprises the NCP and the Congress-- has completed 100 days, much to the chagrin of those who were claiming that the new dispensation will not survive more than 100 hours.

""Those whose government lasted for 80 hours were claiming that the Thackeray regime will not last for even 100 hours. But this MVA government not only thrived but has instilled trust in the minds of people during this period with its performance,"" the editorial said.

The Sena was apparently referring to the second inning of the erstwhile Devendra Fadnavis government which lasted for only 80 hours in November last year.

""Hence, CM Thackeray's visit to Ayodhya has to be welcomed as he is offering the flowers of works (done by the government) at the feet of Lord Shriram,"" it said.

The Sena said Thackeray's visit to the temple town is out of devotion for Lord Shriram.

""The government in Maharashtra comprising three ideologically different parties is working as per Constitution and Thackeray is leading such government,"" it said.

The edit said on this background various questions were raised over Thackeray's visit to Ayodhya by his political opponents.

""The government maybe backed by anyone, but Uddhav Thackeray and the Shiv Sena remain the same from within and outside. There is no change in the ideology. Lord Shriram and Hindutva is not the property of any single party,"" it stated.

Referring to senior RSS leader Suresh 'Bhaiyyaji' Joshi's remark that the Hindu community is not synonymous with the BJP and that opposing the BJP does not amount to opposing Hindus, the Sena said similarly Ayodhya belongs to all.

""The political and cultural battle in Ayodhya is now over. The Supreme Court cannot be thanked enough for this (for its verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute case that allowed construction of the Ram temple),"" it said.

Hailing the Supreme Court's November, 2019 verdict, the Sena said the country had to fight a big battle to prove that Ayodhya belonged to Lord Shriram.

""In that battle, several (people) were unmasked. But only (late) Shiv Sena president Balasaheb Thackeray stood behind the Ayodhya (temple) campaigners like a mountain,"" it said.

Bal Thackeray created trust among Hindus from across the world about the creation of the temple, the Sena said.

The party further said late Thackeray's assertion that he was proud if the Babri mosque was razed by Sena workers and that the temple of Lord Ram would come up in Ayodhya was akin to the thunder of ""thousands of lightnings"" in the sky.

""The Hindu culture got lit up in the glow of that lightning. The resplendent rays showed the path of power to the Hindu community. Hence, no one can deny the contribution of the 'Hinduhridaysamrat' (Bal Thackeray) as good as that of Lord Shriram, in creating the current political order in the country,"" the Sena said.

""We have experienced several times that Balasaheb lives in the mind of Ayodhya. Now Uddhav Thackeray himself is going there with the same faith. He had gone there when not in power. He is going there now after becoming chief minister with the same humbleness. Lord Shriram is of everyone,"" the Sena said.

The party said Maharashtra is being run on the path shown by Lord Shriram and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

""A Ram Rajya entails fulfilling promises made to the people. This is precisely what Mahatma Gandhi wanted, and the government following this ideology is in place in Maharashtra. It will continue work on that line. Ultimately, Lord Shriram is there to support it,"" the Sena said.

217,07-3-20,Australia practising against slow spinners to tackle India's attack,"Australia are focussing not only on the wily Poonam Yadav but preparing to take on India's spin-heavy attack by practising against ""slow spinners"" ahead of Sunday's Women's T20 World Cup final.

Poonam had bamboozled Australia in the opening game, snapping four wickets to power India to a 17-run win but skipper Meg Lanning urged her side to brace up for other threats including the left-arm Indian bowlers.

""It's not just Poonam we need to worry about. They've got some really good left-armers too, such as Rajeshwari Gayakwad. They've got a really strong line-up right through their bowlers and they have spinners who can change their pace,"" Lanning said.

""We will be facing some slow spinners at training. We'll be as prepared as we can be and making sure we adjust to what's happening at the time.""

India's batting also boasts of young Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana besides all-rounder Deepti Sharma and Lanning said her bowling unit has to make the necessary adjustments when coming across India's good batting unit.

""Obviously Smriti Mandhana is a world-class player too and Deepti Sharma has also played well against us. We feel our bowling line-up can adjust to different things,"" she said.

""We are very well prepared for what the game will throw at us. It's going to be a tough, hard battle tomorrow against India but I feel we are as ready as we can be to take it on.""

Four-time champions Australia are no stranger to title wins. Lanning herself had guided the team to glory at the last edition in 2018 but the skipper said it will the ""toughest battle"" and ""biggest moment"" of her career when she walks out to a sold-out crowd at the MCG.

""We're not coming just to put on a good show. We're coming here to win and that's the attitude we're going in with. It's been a long time coming and the build-up to the game is something I've not experienced before. It will be the biggest moment of my career,"" she said.

""We haven't played in front of a crowd this big before and we need to deal with that the best we can.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/australia-practising-against-slow-spinners-to-tackle-india-s-attack-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/australia-practising-against-slow-spinners-to-tackle-india-s-attack.html

The country's highest civilian honour for women will be presented by President Ram Nath Kovind on International Women's Day, Kaur's 82-year-old son Gurdev Singh told PTI on Saturday.

""It is a matter of great pleasure to inform you that you have been selected for the prestigious Nari Shakti Puraskar, 2019, for your exceptional contribution towards women empowerment.

219,07-3-20,"Australia need to play mind games to stop Shafali, says Wyatt","Defending champions Australia need to play mind games to stop a rampaging Shafali Verma during Sunday's women's T20 World Cup final against India, believes England opener Danni Wyatt.

The 16-year-old Shafali has been the star of the tournament, having amassed 161 runs at a strike rate of 161, consistently providing India solid starts.

""It's obvious what her weaknesses are and Shafali knows what they are. The Aussies have tried to bowl to those areas in the past. You've got to play a few mind games with her and hope she spoons one up,"" said Wyatt.

She shared the dressing room with the Indian star at the 2019 Women's T20 Challenge.

""When she fails, she's so hard on herself. I just tell her to relax and that it's only cricket.

""When you're opening the batting in T20, it can be brutal because your role is to go hard and you're always going to fail. She's very hard on herself when she does,"" she added.

Wyatt said it was Shafali's brutal hitting against the pacers from the men's team during a net session which convinced her about the Indian's phenomenal talent.

""Even before the session, she'd go to the nets for extra practice against our quickest male bowlers,"" recalled Wyatt.

""She'd bat for about an hour. She'd say 'yeah, come bowl' and go 'bang, bang.' And I went 'who's that?'

""She had an extra 20 minutes to do some drills after. I couldn't believe she was 15 when someone told me. She knew exactly what she wanted to get out of that session.

The ban on Asianet News was lifted at 1.30 am, while the ban on Media One was lifted at 9.30 am on Saturday, a source at the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting told PTI.

Sources said the two channels had written to the ministry seeking revocation of the bans, following which it was lifted.

Following the lifting of the ban, Asianet News was back on air at 1.30 am and Media One at 9.30 am.

The channels were suspended for 48 hours over their coverage of last month's communal violence in Delhi, with the official orders saying they covered events on February 25 in a manner that ""highlighted the attack on places of worship and siding towards a particular community"".

""Channel's reporting on Delhi violence seems to be biased as it is deliberately focusing on the vandalism of CAA supporters,"" the ministry order on Media One had said. ""It also questions RSS and alleges Delhi Police inaction. Channel seems to be critical towards Delhi Police and RSS.""

224,07-3-20,PM turns emotional when Dehradun woman says she has seen god in him,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi turned emotional on Saturday when a woman beneficiary of his government's generic medicine programme told him that she had ""seen god in you"".

Dehradun-resident Deepa Shah, who suffered paralysis in 2011, was interacting with the prime minister through video-conference on the occasion of Jan Aushadhi Diwas.

""I have not seen god, but I have seen god in you,"" she said, tears rolling down her eyes.

Modi was visibly emotional as the woman repeated her remark.

She also thanked the Uttarakhand chief minister and others who had helped her all along and said doctors had once told her that she cannot be cured.

""But on hearing your voice I have become better,"" she told Modi while profusely thanking the prime minister for his efforts to reduce the cost of medicines.

An emotional prime minister paused for a moment before telling her that it was her courage that had won over her disease and that she must carry on with the spirit.

Shah was expressing her plight and how she had suffered due to high cost of medicines after she suffered from paralysis in 2011 and has now started saving Rs 3,500 every month after benefitting from the government's low-cost generic medicines programme.

Soon after Shah rose to express her views, Modi asked her to sit and speak as he said she was uncomfortable while standing.

""You have defeated disease with your own will power. Your courage is your god and that same courage has given you the strength to emerge from such a big crisis. You should carry on this confidence in you,"" Modi told her.

He said some people still keep spreading rumours about generic medicines, going by their past experience, wondering how can medicines be available so cheap and that there must be something wrong with the medicine.

""But, by seeing you countrymen would gain confidence that there is nothing wrong in generic medicines. These medicines are not at all of inferior quality than any other medicine. These medicines have been certified by the best laboratories. These medicines are made in India and is 'Make in India' and are cheap,"" the prime minister said.

He said there is demand for generic medicines from India across the world and the government has made it mandatory for doctors to prescribe generic medicines to patients, unless necessary.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pm-turns-emotional-when-dehradun-woman-says-she-has-seen-god-in-him-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/pm-turns-emotional-when-dehradun-woman-says-she-has-seen-god-in-him.html

226,07-3-20,Loneliness may increase inflammation in body,"Researchers have found that social isolation and loneliness could be associated with increased inflammation in the body, though loneliness and isolation should neither be used interchangeably nor grouped together.

For arriving at the findings, published in the journal Neuroscience & Biobehavioural Reviews, researchers analysed 30 previous studies to investigate the link between social isolation and loneliness with inflammation in the body.

""Our results suggest loneliness and social isolation are linked with different inflammatory markers. This shows how important it is to distinguish between loneliness and isolation, and that these terms should neither be used interchangeably nor grouped together,"" said study researcher Christina Victor, Professor at Brunel University in UK.

According to the researchers, inflammation is the body's way of signalling the immune system to heal and repair damaged tissue, as well as defending itself against viruses and bacteria.

Inflammation can eventually start damaging healthy cells, tissues and organs and lead to an increased risk of developing non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease.

Researchers found that social isolation, the objective state of being isolated from other people, was associated with the presence of C-reactive protein, a protein substance released into the bloodstream within hours of a tissue injury, and increased levels of the glycoprotein fibrinogen, which is converted into fibrin-based blood clots.

Interestingly, researchers also identified that the link between social isolation and physical inflammation was more likely to be observed in males than females.

Further work is needed to clarify why this might be, but previous work suggests that males and females might respond differently to social stressors, the said.

""The evidence we examined suggests that social isolation may be linked with inflammation, but the results for a direct link between loneliness and inflammation were less convincing,"" said study researcher Kimberley Smith, Professor at the University of Surrey in UK.

""We believe these results are an important first step in helping us to better understand how loneliness and social isolation may be linked with health outcomes,"" Smith added.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/loneliness-may-increase-inflammation-in-body-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/loneliness-may-increase-inflammation-in-body.html
227,07-3-20,Trump names Rep. Mark Meadows his new chief of staff,"In the midst of one of the most daunting crises of his administration, President Donald Trump on Friday announced he had made a major staff overhaul, replacing his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney with Republican Rep. Mark Meadows.

While much of the country was focused on the spreading coronavirus, Trump announced the surprise reshuffle by Friday night tweet, saying Mulvaney would become the U.S. Special envoy for Northern Ireland.

“I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one,” he wrote, thanking Mulvaney — who never shook his “acting” title — “for having served the Administration so well.”

The long-rumoured move comes as Trump has been pulling together a team of loyalists and allies ahead of what is expected to be a bitter reelection fight.

But the timing — as his administration was already facing criticism over its handling of the outbreak — threatened to exacerbate concerns about the government's ability to protect the nation from a virus that has now infected more than 100,000 people worldwide.

Mulvaney had been leading the administration's interagency response to the virus until Trump designated Vice President Mike Pence to lead the whole-of-government effort more than a week ago.

It was just one of a long series of downgrades for Mulvaney, whose relationship with Trump began to sour not long after he was named to the position in December 2018. Indeed, Trump had been eyeing the change for many months, according to people familiar with his thinking, but wanted to wait until after the impeachment saga was over to make his move.

Meadows, the onetime leader of the House Freedom Caucus, is a longtime Trump confidant and sounding board, whose political instincts Trump respects. He announced last year that he would not be seeking reelection for his North Carolina House seat, and said at the time that he expected to join Trump's team in some capacity. He will be Trump's fourth chief of staff in as many years.

He was officially offered the job Thursday, according to one of the people familiar with the matter, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the changes publicly. Mulvaney was informed Friday.

Some outside advisers had cautioned Trump that making such a high-profile switch during the coronavirus crisis would rattle markets craving stability, and his decision to make the announcement after Wall Street had closed Friday was partly informed by those concerns, the people said.

A former congressman from South Carolina, Mulvaney had portrayed himself as a happy warrior, satisfied with letting “Trump be Trump"" as he focused on boosting White House staff morale and wooing lawmakers at the Camp David presidential retreat.

And while he never grated on Trump or other White House staffers like the two men who had held the post before him, Mulvaney had been relegated to the sidelines even before a disastrous mid-October press conference in which he insisted quid pro quo was normal when it came to foreign policy, undercutting the president's position that there was no such thing in his dealings with Ukraine.

Trump was furious about Mulvaney's handling of the impeachment probe, and also faulted Mulvaney — who feuded with the White House counsel during the probe — for not mounting a more robust defense of his actions.

Still, his allies had repeatedly brushed off rumblings of his imminent departure and had said as recently as last month that he planned to stay at least through the election in November.

Ever since he was acquitted by the Senate on impeachment charges, Trump has been on a tear to rid his administration of those he deems insufficiently loyal. And he has been assembling a team of trusted confidants as he prepares for a tough reelection fight.

Meadows, a close ally and friend of the president, has made clear to the White House and those close to the president that he he has no plans to try to rein in Trump, as others — like Mulvaney's predecessor, retired four-star Gen. John Kelly — have tried and failed to do.

One person close to Mulvaney insisted he was pleased with the decision to bring in Meadows, noting the two were friends and had served together on the House Freedom Caucus.

Indeed, they said Mulvaney had raised the idea of Meadows as chief of staff before he even had the job and discussed the plan with Trump following his trip to India last week.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-names-rep--mark-meadows-his-new-chief-of-staff-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-names-rep--mark-meadows-his-new-chief-of-staff.html
228,07-3-20,"Italy reports 49 more coronavirus deaths, toll at 197","Italy on Friday reported 49 more deaths from the new coronavirus, the highest single-day toll to date, bringing the total number of fatalities over the past two weeks to 197.

The total is the second-highest in the world after China. Italy also saw its number of COVID-19 infections grow by 778 to 4,636, the fourth highest after China, South Korea and Iran.

The Italian government has been watching closely to see if the cases are spreading from the richer north, where infections had largely been contained during the first 10 days of the epidemic.

All 22 Italian regions have now registered cases, and one new death was reported Friday in the Lazio region that includes Rome and its outskirts.

But there were no new deaths reported in the south, which recorded its first and only fatality in the southeastern region of Puglia around the city of Bari on Wednesday.

229,07-3-20,21 positive for coronavirus on cruise ship off California,"Twenty-one people aboard a mammoth cruise ship off the California coast tested positive for the new coronavirus and 19 of them are crew members, Vice President Mike Pence announced Friday, amid evidence the vessel was the breeding ground for a deadly cluster of more than 10 cases during its previous voyage.

He said federal officials were working with California authorities around-the-clock to bring the Grand Princess, with more than 3,500 on board, to a non-commercial port over the weekend and test everyone for the virus. There was no immediate word on where the vessel will dock.

“Those that will need to be quarantined will be quarantined. Those who will require medical help will receive it,” Pence said.

In the meantime, everyone on the ship remained holed up in their rooms as they await word about the fate of the ship.

President Donald Trump, speaking at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said he would have preferred not to let the passengers disembark onto American soil but will defer to the recommendations of medical experts.

“I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault,” he said. “And it wasn't the fault of the people on the ship either. Okay? It wasn't their fault either. And they are mostly Americans.”

The ship was heading from Hawaii to San Francisco when it was ordered Wednesday to keep its distance from shore so 46 people with possible coronavirus symptoms could be tested. On Thursday, a military helicopter crew lowered test kits onto the 951-foot (290-meter) ship by rope and later flew them for analysis at a state lab.

Health officials undertook the testing after reporting that a passenger on a previous voyage of the ship, in February, died of the disease.

In the past few days, health authorities disclosed that at least 10 other people who were on the same journey also were found to be infected. And some passengers on that trip stayed aboard for the current voyage — increasing crew members' exposure to the virus.

“We know the coronavirus manifested among the previous passengers ... We will be testing everyone on the ship, we will be quarantining as necessary,"" Pence said. “We anticipate that they will be quarantined on the ship. They will not need to disembark.""

Princess Cruises said the ship's doctor began informing passengers and crew of their results after confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Another Princess ship, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined for two weeks in Yokohama, Japan, last month because of the virus, and ultimately about 700 of the 3,700 people aboard became infected in what experts pronounced a public-health failure, with the vessel essentially becoming a floating germ factory.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Death toll from the coronavirus climbed to 14, with all but one victim in Washington state, while the number of infections swelled to over 200, scattered across about half the states. Pennsylvania, Indiana, Minnesota and Nebraska reported their first cases.

On Wall Street, stocks swung wildly as fears mounted over the potential damage to the global economy from factory shutdowns, travel bans, quarantines and cancellations of events big and small — a list that grew to include the world-famous South by Southwest arts festival in Austin, Texas, which was set to begin next week.

Trump signed an $8.3 billion measure to help public health agencies deal with crisis and spur development of vaccines and treatments.

Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 100,000 people and killed over 3,400, the vast majority of them in China. Most cases have been mild, and more than half of those infected have recovered.

Most of the dead in the U.S. Were from suburban Seattle's Life Care Center nursing home, now the subject of federal and state investigations that could lead to sanctions, including a possible takeover of its management. Washington state has the nation's biggest concentration of cases, with at least 70.

Thirty medical professionals from the U.S. Public Health Service will arrive Saturday at the nursing home to help care for patients and provide relief to the exhausted staff, said Dow Constantine, executive in charge of Seattle's King County.

""We are grateful the cavalry is arriving. It will make rapid change in the conditions there,"" he said.

The nursing home was down to 69 residents after 15 were taken to the hospital in the preceding 24 hours, Constantine said.

Some major businesses in the Seattle area — including Microsoft and Amazon, which together employ more than 100,000 people in the region — have shut down operations or urged employees to work from home.

The University of Washington called off classes at its three Seattle-area campuses for the next two weeks and will instead teach its 57,000 students online. And a comics convention next week in Seattle that was expected to draw about 100,000 people was canceled.

California emerged as the center of the virus when a Sacramento-area man who sailed aboard the Grand Princess last month during a visit to a series of Mexican ports later succumbed to the virus. Others who were on that voyage also have tested positive in Northern California, Nevada, and Canada.

Three dozen passengers on the Grand Princess have had flu-like symptoms over the past two weeks or so, said Mary Ellen Carroll, executive director of San Francisco's Department of Emergency Management.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/twenty-one-on-cruise-ship-off-us-test-positive-for-coronavirus-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/21-positive-for-coronavirus-on-cruise-ship-off-california.html
230,07-3-20,Trump campaign files lawsuit against CNN,"The Trump Campaign has filed a defamatory lawsuit against CNN, accusing the cable news network of making false statements that the campaign ""assessed the potential risks and benefits of again seeking Russia's help in 2020 and has decided to leave that option on the table"".

After The New York Times and The Washington Post, this is the third lawsuit by the Trump Campaign against a major American media.

Trump, who is seeking his re-election, has often described these three US media outlets as ""fake media"".

The lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in Atlanta on Friday, seeks to hold CNN accountable for intentionally publishing false statements against President Trump's campaign.

The statements by the CNN, “were and are 100 per cent false and defamatory,” Jenna Ellis, Senior Legal Adviser to Donald J. Trump for President said in a statement.

The complaint alleges CNN was aware of the falsity at the time it published them (on its website), but did so for the intentional purpose of hurting the campaign, while misleading its own readers in the process.

Further, the campaign, through counsel, sent a written demand to CNN on February 25 to retract and apologize for the false and defamatory statements.

CNN refused, so the campaign was left with no alternative but to file suit to publicly establish the truth and seek appropriate remedies, he said.

Ellis said that the campaign filed this lawsuit against CNN and the preceding suits against The New York Times and The Washington Post to hold the publishers accountable for their reckless false reporting and also to establish the truth: that the campaign did not have an agreement, quid pro quo, or collusion with Russia, as the Mueller Report concluded.

“The campaign was motivated by the fact that the publications recklessly published false statements which caused harm and intentionally mislead their readers,"" he said.

231,07-3-20,"Coronavirus: Death toll crosses 3,000 in China, cases surpass 100,000 globally","China has reported 28 new fatalities from the deadly coronavirus outbreak, taking the death toll in the country to 3,070, Chinese health officials said on Saturday as the rapid spread of the epidemic hit a milestone, infecting more than 100,000 people globally.

The virus that first emerged in China in December last year has spread to 97 countries and has infected 102,180 people, including 80,651 in China, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus tracker.

China's National Health Commission (NHC) on Saturday said it received reports of 99 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus infection and 28 deaths on Friday on the Chinese mainland.

The 28 deaths were all reported in the virus epicentre Hubei Province and its capital Wuhan, the NHC said.

Meanwhile, 99 new suspected cases were reported it said, a significant milestone in China's over two-month-long fight against the dreaded virus as the cases have for the first time dropped below 100.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland have reached 80,651 by the end of Friday. This included 3,070 people who had died of the virus, 22,177 patients still undergoing treatment and 55,404 others who were discharged after recovery, the NHC said.

Also on Friday, 24 imported cases (people coming to China from abroad) of the novel coronavirus infection were reported on the mainland, including 17 in Gansu Province, three in Beijing, three in Shanghai and one in Guangdong Province. By the end of Friday, 60 imported cases were reported, the NHC said.

By the end of Friday, 107 confirmed cases, including two deaths have been reported in Hong Kong, 10 confirmed cases in the Macao SAR, and 45 in Taiwan, including one death have been reported.

While the cases of the COVID-19 in China are on the decline about 19,700 more cases were reported globally taking the overall total of the cases, including from China to over a lakh, state-run CGTN reported.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Friday that additional five countries -- the Philippines, New Zealand, Ireland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia -- have seen local transmission of the COVID-19.

Outside China, a total of 97 countries and regions have reported.

Bhutan, Cameroon, Serbia and South Africa have reported cases of the COVID-19 for the first time in the past 24 hours as of Friday morning, the WHO report said.

Meanwhile, Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme said there is no evidence right now suggesting the COVID-19 will disappear in summer, urging countries to fight the new virus decisively at the current stage.

""We do not know yet what the activity or behaviour of the virus will be in different climatic conditions,"" Ryan said, warning against the assumption that the virus would just disappear on its own in the summertime like influenza.

""We have to assume the virus will continue to have the capacity to spread,"" state-run Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying.

Besides, Ryan stressed the disease can emerge anywhere on the planet, for instance, Ebola very often emerged in Africa, while the last pandemic influenza H1N1 emerged in North America.

He called on countries and societies to avoid ""blame culture"" and to do all the things needed to save lives, he said.

According to the tracker, in the US, at least 299 cases of coronavirus have been detected and 14 people have died due to it.

In Italy, 4,636 have been detected and 197 have died.

233,07-3-20,"Coronavirus: PM holds review meet, asks officials to ensure sufficient quarantine, critical care facilities","Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed the coronavirus situation in the country at a meeting with officials on Saturday and directed them to identify locations for sufficient quarantine facilities and make provisions for critical care in case the disease spreads further.

At the meeting with all ministries and departments concerned, he said that in view of expert opinion, people should be advised to avoid mass gatherings as much as possible and made aware of the do's and don'ts.

While complimenting all departments for the work done so far, Modi stressed that as the coronavirus scenario evolves, India has to be prepared in its response.

""All departments should work in convergence and action should be initiated for creating awareness in community about the disease and the precautions to be taken,"" the prime minister was quoted as saying in an official statement.

""He exhorted the officers to identify the best practices for COVID-19 management from across the world and within the states, and ensure their adoption,"" it said.

The prime minister also highlighted the need for advanced and adequate planning, and timely response which is critical for managing this infectious disease.

According to the statement, the officials were instructed to plan for early testing and evacuation of Indians from Iran where, according to reports, 145 people have died so far due to COVID-19.

On Saturday, a flight from Tehran brought to Delhi swab samples of Indians in Iran who are suspected of having the coronavirus infection. The flight, operated by Mahan Air, then returned with many Iranian nationals.

At the prime minister's review meeting, Health Secretary Preeti Sudan made a presentation about the current scenario and action taken by Health Ministry and other supporting ministries regarding preparedness and response to COVID-19.

She emphasised on the core areas of surveillance at the point of entry and community, laboratory support, hospital preparedness, logistics and risk communication.

235,07-3-20,Bank says Yes to chaos,"As distress calls and long queues of customers were witnessed on Friday at various branches of the crisis-ridden Yes Bank whose control was seized by the RBI in a dramatic move late on Thursday, the Union Government rushed to assure depositors that their money is safe and the RBI has been asked to assess reasons for the crisis and fix responsibilities and resolve the crisis.

Soon after, State Bank of India (SBI) decided to pick up 49 per cent stake in Yes Bank under a Government-approved bailout plan.

A day after the RBI capped withdrawals at Rs 50,000 for the next one month and imposed strict limits on operations at the country’s fourth-largest private lender that faced “regular outflow of liquidity” after an effort to raise new capital failed, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, “I want to assure every depositor that their money shall be safe. The steps taken are in the interest of depositors, banks and economy. I am in continuous interaction with the RBI. The RBI is fully seized of the matter and has assured they will give a quick resolution.”

According to the RBI’s draft scheme of reconstruction for the crisis-hit lender announced on Friday, a strategic investor like SBI will have to pick up 49 per cent stake in Yes Bank and stay invested for at least three years. In its draft “Yes Bank Ltd. Reconstruction Scheme, 2020”, RBI said the strategic investor bank will have to pick up 49 per cent shareholding in the reconstructed bank at a price not less than Rs 10 (Face value of Rs 2) and premium of Rs 8, and it cannot reduce holding to below 26 per cent before three years from the date of capital infusion. From the appointed date, the authorised capital of the private sector bank would stand altered to Rs 5,000 crore and number of equity shares to 2,400 crore having face value of Rs 2 each, as per the RBI proposal.

Earlier in the day, SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar, who met Sitharaman on Friday, said the resolution to the Yes Bank crisis will come “very shortly”. “This is not a sectoral problem. It is a bank-specific problem,” he said. Yes Bank’s RBI-appointed administrator Prashant Kumar, an ex-chief financial officer of SBI, said, “A solution is being worked upon to revive the Bank well before the moratorium period of thirty days ends.”

Meanwhile concerns have been raised over the restructuring scheme for Yes Bank, which has 1,000 branches across the country.

One of the biggest losers in case the RBI’s restructuring scheme for Yes Bank goes through will be the additional tier-I bond holders who have bets totalling to Rs 10,800 crore on the lender. The investors in such instruments typically include mutual fund houses and bank treasuries, experts said.

“The instruments qualifying as additional tier-1 capital, issued by Yes Bank under Basel-III framework, shall stand written down permanently, in full, with effect from the appointed date,” said experts.

As chaos prevailed on Friday regarding the future of Yes Bank, its shares came under massive selling pressure, plunging 56 per cent at close as investors deserted the counter. During the trade, it nosedived 84.93 per cent to Rs 5.55 --- its 52-week low. Moody’s Investors Service on Friday downgraded Yes Bank Ltd’s rating to Caa3 from B2, saying, “The ratings remain under review, with the direction uncertain.”

Addressing a press conference here, Sitharaman said the RBI had been since 2017 closely scrutinising Yes Bank where “it noticed governance issues of serious concern, weak compliance, and wrong asset classification together with risky credit decisions”. Upon getting clear indications, the RBI took concrete steps including changing the CEO in 2018 and asking promoter to let go of their shares, she said, adding promoters sold down their shares in September last year. Investigating agencies also saw “malpractices of some of their chairman and top-order people,” she said without elaborating.

Sitharaman said the failure of attempts to get new equity infusion and the resignation of the chairman of the audit committee of the bank in January this year led to things getting serious. “I have asked the RBI now to go into assessing what actually has caused this difficulty in Yes Bank and also clearly identify the role played by various individuals in the problems --- in creating and not so comprehensively addressing the problem,” she said.

Sitharaman said the RBI has also been asked to act so that the due process of law takes its course with a sense of urgency. “The Government is committed to ensure the depositors’ interest is completely safeguarded and also RBI to ensure that due process of law is set to roll with a sense of urgency so that we should find out that who led to this problem of this size and magnitude in Yes Bank,” she said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bank-says-yes-to-chaos-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/bank-says-yes-to-chaos.html
236,07-3-20,Coronavirus sets off cancellation spree,"Fearing further explosion of coronavirus cases in the wake of rise in number from six to 31 this week in India, the Government and other authorities continued the spree of cancelling various events.

India’s total number of confirmed cases stands at 31, after a person from New Delhi with a history of travel from Thailand and Malaysia tested positive, an official from the Union Health Ministry said. His seven family members have been quarantined at their residence in west Delhi. The latest case is the third from the national Capital.

As part of the precautionary drive, the Government announced curtailment of civil aviation show ‘Wings India 2020’ to be held in Hyderabad later this month. The authorities also banned use of biometric system in all ministries and Central Government offices.

Taking a cue, the CRPF and the BSF too cancelled official events to celebrate Holi festivities. Also, daily retreat ceremony at Attari-Wagah border in Punjab will be conducted without public presence due to coronavirus.

Rashtrapati Bhawan, Prime Minister and various BJP leaders have already announced that they would not attend celebrations for the Holi festival. Modi has already cancelled travel plans to Brussels for an India-EU summit amid a rising caseload in Belgium.

The virus scare cast its shadow on the Bollywood too with the organisers of the International Indian Film Academy Awards, one the main ceremonies for the Bollywood film industry, announcing that they were postponing the event scheduled for later this month. The Lotus Makeup India Fashion Week (LMIFW), scheduled to begin on March 11, too has been postponed.

As a preventive measure, the upcoming combined shooting World Cup in New Delhi too has been postponed, while an Olympic test event in Tokyo stands cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The Government has asked people not to pay attention to false rumours that the novel coronavirus was spreading through non-vegetarian food like eggs, chicken, mutton and seafood while the UGC has directed universities to avoid large gathering in view of the coronavirus outbreak.

Besides the fresh case detected on Friday, the 30 other positive cases include a 45-year-old man from Delhi’s Mayur Vihar and six of his relatives from Agra whom he had recently visited. Another is a Paytm employee who works in Gurgaon and lives in West Delhi. They are all being treated at the Safdarjung hospital.

A middle-aged man from Ghaziabad, who tested positive for the virus, is being treated at the Ram Manohar Lohia hospital in the national Capital. A 24-year-old man from Hyderabad, who has also tested positive for coronavirus, has been isolated.

Besides, 16 members of a tourist group from Italy and their Indian guide have been found infected by the virus.

While one Italian man and his wife are being treated at Jaipur’s SMS hospital, 14 members of the group and their Indian guide, who were quarantined at the ITBP camp in Chhawla, have been admitted to the Medanta hospital in Gurgaon.

Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said that the Government is in discussions with Iranian authorities and a ferry flight, carrying around 300 swabs of Indians suspected to have coronavirus infection, from Tehran is coming to the national Capital.

The plane, to be operated by Iran’s Mahan Air, would not have any passengers and Iranians in India would be taken back in its return journey.

The Government said a 13-member group of tourists from Italy are under scanner after they reached Amritsar for being possible carriers of coronavirus while two employees of the Northern Railways have been sent to RML hospital for further treatment. Two cases reported to Northern Railway Central Hospital (NRCH) casualty ward on March 5, in whom there was a history of cough and fever. Since they had travelled abroad recently, they have been sent to RML Hospital. They are, however, yet to be confirmed for COVID-19, said Dr Anand E Barla, nodal officer, ACHD/medicine/NRCH in a statement here on Friday.

Till date, nearly 29,000 people have been put under surveillance, Harsh Vardhan said after holding a meeting here to review preparedness for managing coronavirus outbreak and stressed on the importance of states keeping quarantine facilities, isolation wards and testing labs in active readiness.

The coronavirus, which can cause respiratory illness that can lead to pneumonia, emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. But it has now spread in numerous countries. Globally, there have been more than 100,000 cases and more than 3,400 deaths.

Authorities are screening international travelers at 30 airports and have already tested more than 3,500 samples while the Indian Army is preparing at least five large-scale quarantine centres.

Following the increase in load of screening samples from suspected cases with symptoms and travel history to the affected countries, the Indian Council of medical Research (ICMR) has commissioned 51 laboratories for COVID-19 testing in the country. In addition, NCDC Delhi is also engaged in testing in its 57 laboratories which have an operational Real-Time PCR platform, said a statement here from the ICMR.

Additionally, 56 DHR/ICMR VRDLs and 1 facility at Leh have been designated to facilitate sample collection through government health authorities. Their role is to provide collection material (swabs & viral transport media) and facilitate transport of samples to the nearest testing laboratory, said the statement.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus-sets-off-cancellation-spree-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/coronavirus-sets-off-cancellation-spree.html

Due to intense western disturbance over south-west Afghanistan, country’s Western Himalayan region, north, east and north-east, and north-west expanse on Friday witnessed heavy rain accompanied by lightening hail and gusty winds. Widespread rain lashed several parts of Punjab and Haryana on Friday, triggering fear among farmers about damage to wheat crop.

Arrival and departure of several flights were affected at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport.

The IMD also predicted formation of fresh western disturbance which will affect the western Himalayan region and plains of northwest India from March 10 to 14.

Kuldeep Srivastava, head of regional meteorological centre at the IMD, said the wet spell that hit the region is due to a western disturbance.

“Four western disturbances are witnessed in March. Therefore, it is raining,” Srivastava said. “From the remnants of systems in westerlies, scattered to fairly widespread rain / thundershowers also occurred over east & Northeast India,” he added.

Rain also lashed the national Capital all through the day on Friday, affecting traffic movement with visibility dropping considerably in the afternoon due to dense clouds. Rain over the last two

days has brought the mercury down. The city recorded a minimum temperature of 12 degrees Celsius on Friday morning. The maximum temperature is likely to settle at 22 degrees Celsius.

According to Srivastava, Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), and parts of the northern plains could see thunderstorms and gusty winds till Saturday.

Scientists are expecting it to be one of the most intense western disturbances seen so far this year, and added that it will bring widespread snowfall to the hills and rain to the plains.

The western disturbance is currently over south-west Afghanistan. Under its influence, an induced low pressure area has formed over south-west Rajasthan. In addition, there is high moisture feeding from Arabian Sea at lower and mid tropospheric levels over north-west India. Due to it, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, parts of north Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, north Odisha and west Bengal, Sikkim and Uttarakhand will witness fairly widespread to widespread rain and snowfall on March 7. The situation will remain the same on March 8.

The IMD said scattered to fairly widespread rainm, thundershowers could also occur over northeastern States (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya and Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram & Tripura) between March 7 and 8.

Also, the IMD predicted rain and thunderstorm in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, interior Karnataka, Kerala, interior Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh mainly between March 7 and 8.

241,07-3-20,"'Justice League' was plagued by one problem after another, says Ben Affeck","Hollywood star Ben Affleck has reflected back on the failure of his big budget film ""Justice League"", saying it was tough making the film as it was plagued by many problems.

Released in 2017, ""Justice League"" was an ambitious bet by Warner Bros-DC Comics to expand their DC Extended Universe (DCEU) but the film fell really short of the expectations.

Affleck, who portrayed Batman in the film, told GQ in a video that he had ""better time"" working on its predecessor ""Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016).

""I really had a better time on 'Batman vs Superman' which I really enjoyed doing. 'Justice League' was unfortunately touched by some personal tragedy -- a death in (director) Zack's (Synder) family.

""And like I say, sometimes things sort of work and gel and sometimes you seem to be having one problem after another,"" Affleck said.

Snyder, who was directing the film after helming DCEU's previous two entries -- ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman vs Superman"", had to depart from the project following the demise of his daughter.

The studio had roped in ""The Avengers"" director Joss Whedon as Snyder's replacement and after that the film underwent massive reshoots. Upon its release, ""Justice League"" was panned by both the fans and the critics.

Affleck, who exited the franchise soon after, said he had his ""fill"" of the superhero genre.

""I had my fill of that. They said, 'Would you like to direct and star in a solo Batman movie?' And I found that, at some point, I had lost my enthusiasm or passion for it.

""And I thought this should really be made by someone who for whom it's their wildest dream come true. It was clear to me it was time to move on,"" the actor said.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-justice-league--was-plagued-by-one-problem-after-another--says-ben-affeck-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/-justice-league--was-plagued-by-one-problem-after-another--says-ben-affeck.html

""I thought you would see the humour. I apologise and my mistake if that wasn't recognized. I was a huge fan of your 'Blade Runner' appearance, I thought it went highly unappreciated compared to your other roles. Peace,"" he wrote.

""My Spy"", directed by Peter Segal and also featuring Chloe Coleman, will release in the US on March 13.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dave-bautista-slams-writer-over--my-spy--joke-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/dave-bautista-slams-writer-over--my-spy--joke.html
244,07-3-20,"SpaceX launches station supplies, nails 50th rocket landing","SpaceX successfully launched another load of station supplies for NASA late Friday night and nailed its 50th rocket landing.

The Falcon rocket blasted off with 4,300 pounds (1,950 kilograms) of equipment and experiments for the International Space Station. Just minutes later, the spent first-stage booster made a dramatic midnight landing back at Cape Canaveral, its return accompanied by sonic booms.

""And the Falcon has landed for the 50th time in SpaceX history!"" SpaceX engineer Jessica Anderson announced amid cheers at Mission Control. “What an amazing live view all the way to touchdown.” The Dragon capsule, meanwhile, hurtled toward a Monday rendezvous with the space station.

It's the 20th station delivery for SpaceX, which has launched nearly 100,000 pounds (45,360 kilograms) of goods to the orbiting outpost and returned nearly that much back to Earth since it began shipments in 2012. Northrop Grumman is NASA's other commercial shipper.

SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk said it was the windiest conditions ever — 25 mph to 30 mph (40 kph to 48 kph) — for a booster landing at Cape Canaveral, but he wanted to push the envelope. The landing was the 50th successful touchdown of a SpaceX booster following liftoff, either on land or at sea.

“Envelope expanded,” Musk tweeted following touchdown.

The company's first booster landing was in 2015, intended as a cost-saving, rocket-recycling move. Both the latest booster and Dragon capsule were recycled from previous flights.

Among the science experiments flying: an analysis of running shoe cushioning in weightlessness by Adidas, a water droplet study by Delta Faucet Co. Striving for better showerhead water conservation, 3D models of heart and intestinal tissue, and 320 snippets of grape vines by Space Cargo Unlimited, the same Luxembourg startup that sent 12 bottles of red wine to the space station last November for a year of high-altitude aging.

The Dragon also contained treats for the two Americans and one Russian at the space station: grapefruit, oranges, apples, tomatoes, Skittles, Hot Tamales and Reese's Pieces.

As for packing the capsule for launch, no extra precautions were taken because of the global coronavirus outbreak, according to NASA. The usual stringent precautions were taken to avoid passing along any germs or diseases to the space station crew. The doctor-approved procedures have proven effective in the past, officials noted.

This is the last of SpaceX's original Dragon cargo capsules. Going forward, the company will launch supplies in second-generation Dragons, roomier and more elaborate versions built for crews.

The company aims to launch NASA astronauts this spring. The California-based SpaceX also teaming up with other companies to fly tourists and private researchers to the space station, as well as high solo orbits in the next couple years.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/spacex-launches-station-supplies--nails-50th-rocket-landing-2020-03-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/spacex-launches-station-supplies--nails-50th-rocket-landing.html
