0,26-1-20,"Constitution sacred, but Bharat Mata more sacred","The 70th anniversary of the Indian Republic is, to my mind, an occasion for satisfaction more than celebration. Yes, there are always the celebratory facet, as befits a traditional national holiday. But that is only to be expected. What is far more important is the quiet satisfaction that comes with the awareness that the path we chose after Independence has, the occasional hiccup notwithstanding, worked reasonably well.

This is not to say that other systems of public life would have been less rewarding. There was a strong case for the Constituent Assembly to adopt a presidential system with in-built federal features. Adopting such a system would not have compromised stability. Indeed, given the type of challenges India faced in the first decades after Independence, a presidential system would probably have made policy choices more purposeful. It may even have worked to the advantage of Jawaharlal Nehru who often complained that his world view and his priorities were insufficiently understood by the other stalwarts of the Congress.

Counter-factual history is always an interesting intellectual game. However, it is also purposeless. The fact is not merely that India opted for a Westminster model and a bicameral Parliament but that other alternatives weren’t seriously considered. That is not surprising. In the aftermath of Independence and with the world just about recovering from a devastating World War, single point leadership was viewed with suspicion. Maybe rightly so. Many of the former colonies that won freedom after 1947 quickly shifted from a parliamentary to a presidential system, with consequences that were undesirable.

India didn’t change course — although Indira Gandhi tried to in 1976 at the height of the Emergency — and it hasn’t really suffered.

Maybe the policy choices under a presidential system would have been more emphatic and, consequently, economic progress would have been more marked. However, in hindsight, that had less to do with the parliamentary system than with the flawed policy options exercised. The alternative, less-statist options that were proffered by stalwarts, could well have been accommodated within a parliamentary system. More to the point, a parliamentary system encouraged the development and consolidation of a party system that has certainly added to the democratic spirit. A presidential system may have done quite the opposite.

In any event, the role of a Constitution should not be over-stated. A Constitution is a valuable and, indeed, indispensable document without which a country can be held hostage to individual flights of whimsy. However, a Constitution stipulates the rules governing public life. It is important to have these rules as they delineate a Lakshman Rekha and defines self-restraint.

A Constitution, in the case of India, however, has its limits. India isn’t a treaty state as many European and African countries are. There was an India before the Queen’s Proclamation of 1858 and there was an India even before the Moghul kings set up a mighty empire. The boundaries of the state may have been defined by conquest and treaties but India as a nation — and a civilisational entity — had an autonomous existence, independent of the multiple kingdoms that existed in the subcontinent. The term ‘sacred geography’ is just one version of an India that operated at the level of a cultural entity.

The importance of stressing this on the 70th anniversary of the Indian Republic is obvious. There is an intellectual and political current in the country that would have us believe that the Constitution is the first and final word defining our national life. Without undermining its colossal importance in any way, it is necessary to affirm that Indian nationhood existed well before a Constitution was even imagined. It is a nationhood that, unlike European nations, isn’t based on the commonality of either language or a structured faith. It is based on cultural assumptions.

The term Hindu has often been used to define India. If used in a sense that proceeds on the belief that Hinduism is a codified religion with an established church and hierarchy, it would be wrong. India possesses a broadly shared culture that is loosely speaking described as Hindu. But it is a culture that cannot and should not be codified. Secularism was sought to be codified in 1976 by including the term in the Preamble. The results have been disastrous. There have been more disputes centred on secularism after 1976 than there were in the period 1950-1976, when secularism existed as an understanding.

The challenge India faces today is not one of a dysfunctional Constitution. The worry stems from an attempt to detach nationhood from citizenship and reduce India to a juridical tract, a plaything for clever lawyers and those who want to take culture away from our public life. The trend should and must be resisted.

Bharat Mata holds the Constitution in one hand. What she carries is important and even sacred. But no more important and sacred that Bharat Mata herself.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/constitution-sacred--but--bharat-mata-more-sacred.html
1,26-1-20,Coronavirus: 7 more under observation,"Seven more people who returned from China have been kept under observation following screening for possible exposure to novel coronavirus. The Prime Minister’s Office on Saturday reviewed India’s preparedness to deal with the deadly syndrome and mounting global concern over growing number of cases in the neighbouring countries.

At a meeting chaired by PK Mishra, Principal Secretary to the PM, Health Ministry officials presented and updated about response measures being undertaken.

The meeting was held on the instructions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The Cabinet Secretary, Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary, Defence Secretary, Health Secretary, Civil Aviation Secretary and several other top officials attended the meeting. They said health Ministry officials briefed Mishra on the preparedness of hospitals laboratories as well as measures being taken for the capacity building of rapid response teams to deal with possible case of coronavirus.

Principal secretary to the PM also reviewed the various preventive measures taken by other Ministries like the Ministry of Civil Aviation.

The officials assured Mishra that the situation is being closely monitored by the Ministry of Health and Family affairs in coordination with various other Union Ministries as well as State Governments and Union Territories. The sources said the National Institute of virology labs are fully equipped to test the virus and that all State and district health authorities have been alerted.

So far 20,000 people from 115 flights at seven international airports in the country have been screened.

Much to the relief to the authorities, in Mumbai, two persons, who were admitted to a civic hospital for possible exposure to coronavirus, have tested negative for the infection, while the blood sample of another person will be sent for testing to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune on Saturday, officials said.

To review the situation at the State level , Union Health Minister Harshvardhan has directed for multi-disciplinary Central teams to be sent to the seven States where thermal screening is being done at the seven designated airports --- New Delhi Bangaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Kolkata and Cochin.

Vardhan, who held a review meeting to analyse the preparedness for prevention and management of noble coronavirus in India also spoke to the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand on screening at the border with Nepal where one confirmed case has been reported.

The Punjab Government has asked all district hospitals to put in place necessary arrangements to tackle any emergent situation in view of the outbreak of coronavirus in China, and said a team of doctors will be stationed at the Amritsar international airport starting Monday for screening passengers.

Nine people --- 7 in Kerala and one each in Bengaluru and Hyderabad who are among hundreds of passengers who returned from China in the recent days --- are under observation in hospital to check for possible exposure to the deadly novel coronavirus.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus---7-more-under--observation-2020-01-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/coronavirus---7-more-under--observation.html
2,26-1-20,Right-green coalition in Austria unviable,"Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has picked up where he left off, but this time with the Austrian Green Party. But how long the strange bedfellows can work together to stay in the Government is anybody’s guess as stakes are high for both, the People’s Party and the Green party

Sebastian Kurz, the youngest Chancellor of Austria at the age of 33, has just taken over as the Chancellor of the country for the second time. The People’s Party, known as Österreichische Volkspartei (OVP), he represents, is primarily a centre-right political party. However, it regards itself as a progressive centre party which is the successor of the Christian Social Party, established way back in the 1890s. In fact, the OVP came into being immediately after the reestablishment of the Republic of Austria in 1945.

Kurz became active in the politics of the OVP since the age of 16. As a law student in Vienna, he was elected to the post of the chairman of the youth wing of the party. By 2011, he left his studies to join as a junior Interior Minister and rose up to the rank of Foreign Minister in 2013, only at the age of 27. In 2015, when the whole Europe was plagued by massive immigration from war-torn nations of West Asia, he proposed a plan for immediate integration of these immigrant communities into the mainstream. But then he was all in praise for Hungary’s firebrand populist leader and Prime Minister Victor Orban. That was the time he was all against absorbing more immigrants from the troubled regions of West Asia and North Africa, such as Syria, Iraq, Libya, etc.

Also, Kurz credited Orban for closing the Balkan immigration route in 2016. It must be noted here that though the opposition in Hungary accuses him of backsliding when it comes to democratic freedoms, but he has remained undeterred in his shaping of a new polity what he likes to call as “illiberal democracy”. However the critics simply brand it as a semi-authoritarian state. With this kind of a liking, Kurz has fully endorsed a strong right turn in Austrian politics and of course change of tactics in coming elections.

Afterwards, he was elected chairman of the OVP in May 2017. Surprisingly he led the party to victory by garnering more than 31 per cent of the votes and became the Chancellor with the support from the far right FPO party from December 2017 to May 2019. His coalition government fell only when his coalition partner and its leader Heinz-Christian Strache were rocked by the historic Ibizagate scandal. Therefore, the party this time has dropped its former coalition partner, the FPO. The OVP was forced to stay away from this tie-up as the leader of the FPO, Strache, was caught offering bribe to a woman who posed as the niece of a Russian oligarch. And all these took place in Ibiza, one of the Balearic Islands of Spain located in the Mediterranean Sea. The Ibizagate trimmed down the voting share of the party to only 16 per cent, a sharp fall from 26 per cent in the last elections. The OVP has won 37 per cent of the votes, up from 31 per cent from the last election.

It is interesting to know the policies and programmes of the party as they are simply going to shape the future of Austria. The party is insisting on an immediate ban on the Identitarian Movement (also called as IBOe) once launched by the far-right. In fact, it came into light even before the general election in September. Further the OVP leader August Woeginger repeatedly reminded his party colleagues and the Austrian public that the ban on the Identitarian Movement would be a condition for making the next coalition Government of the country. The IBOe is famous for its anti-immigration agenda. But it has faced crisis as its leader Martin Sellner is accused of receiving money and exchanging e-mails with the suspected perpetrators of gun attacks on mosques in New Zealand, in which 51 people died.

Thus finally, the OVP has stitched an unlikely coalition with the Green Party, headed by Werner Kogler. Interestingly, the Greens achieved a historic win in this election by getting more than 13.9 per cent of the votes. But ironically, Kurz has been stressing for a proper centre-right coalition deal since the beginning of the snap poll that was held in September 2019. In that case, the FPO could have been the logical partner to deal with and form a government of their mutual interests. On the other hand, the FPO was seriously disturbed by internal differences. And the party also indicated in the recent past that it could very well go back and take the position of an opposition party.

Further, the old coalition i.e. OVP-SPO (Social Democratic Party) that survived the most parts of the post-World War II period seemed to be completely unviable today. This coalition is deeply unpopular among the Austrian electorate today, particularly among the youngsters. At the same time, Kurz, the new chairman of the party, has been criticising the new power-sharing system developed by both these parties as Proporz. Hence, there was no option left for Kurz, except aligning with the Greens.

For the first time in Austria, a female majority Government has come to power this month. And in the Cabinet of 17 Ministers in this Conservative-Green Government, 9 are women ministers. Kurz calls this coalition as the “best of both worlds”. But some say that it would be difficult for him to survive such an unusual tie-up. The reason behind is that how such a coalition of centre right and centre left would survive? It would be difficult for both the parties to further their own interests. There are high chances that their supporters and sympathisers would soon be disillusioned in the days to come. The ideological gap between the Greens and the OVP is too big. The OVP has a set agenda to cut taxes, deregulate, and reduce public expenditure whereas the Greens would like to go for new taxes on inheritance, carbon emissions and capital gains, want to engage in huge public infrastructure projects for building public transportation networks across the country. Again the Greens will find it really difficult to support Kurz on issues like tough stance on illegal immigration, slashing public funds for refugees and deporting asylum applicants upon receiving a negative notice even if they have jobs and successfully integrated with the Austrian society. Both the parties have strong differences over education and welfare reforms. His going with the Greens is a critical misreading of his long-term strategies. The ideological flexibility that he is displaying at the moment is simply overstated. He will simply pay for it in the near future. Many thought he is raising an illiberal democracy of Orban type in Hungary. But instead, it seems he is trying to cling to power even with the help of the Greens. His brand of politics may soon lose steam. And if cracks appear in the partnership, this will once again push Austria into a new uncertainty only.

Whatsoever it may be, people in Austria are just thinking ‘schau ma mal’ i.e. Let’s see. It is very apparent that it is a coalition that Kurz never wanted and many say that it is unlikely to last.

3,26-1-20,Desert Locust in Punjab: No immediate threat but vigilance needed,"In what could be an alarming sign for the farmers of Punjab, presence of locust hoppers in small numbers or groups (of five to 20 hoppers) have been found in districts of Fazilka, Sri Muktsar Sahib and Bathinda.

The surveillance by the scientists of Punjab Agricultural University at PAU Regional Research Station at Abohar and officials of the State department of Agriculture has revealed the presence of the locust hoppers, a Government statement said on Saturday.

The statement said these hoppers in small number or groups do not cause any economic damage to agricultural and horticultural crops unless they appear in swarms that comprise of hundreds of thousands of these hoppers.

“Recent surveys have confirmed the presence of locust hoppers in small numbers in Villages of Gumjal, Dangarkhera, Punjava, Panniwala Mahala, Arachiki, Bhangarkhera, Roopnagar, Bareka, Bakainwala, Haripura, Khuian Sarvar of district Fazilka and in Raniwala, Midda, Aspal, Virk Khera, Bhagsar and some other villages of Sri Muktsar Sahib,” the statement said.

Officials said the current excursions of desert locust hoppers are well monitored and suitable control measures are in place. They said these small non-breeding adult hopper groups do not carry serious threat and are not expected to cause economic damage to crops.

The farmers have been advised to be vigilant for the desert locust in their areas and need not to panic or opt for spraying of pesticides. “Whenever and wherever the population of desert locust is found exceeding the economical threshold level (10,000 adults/ha and 5-6 hoppers/bush), immediate control measures are pressed into operation by the LWO and State department officials,” the statement said.

Locust hoppers are easily identifiable; the young immature adults being pink in color while the old ones become dark grey or yellow with dark purple to black mandibles.

Dr PK Chhuneja, Head Department of Entomology at PAU Ludhiana, said the current spotting of locust hoppers in small numbers in Punjab do not carry serious threat but we need to guard against fresh incursions from across the border, in view of expected post-winter temperature rise and availability of crop vegetation over large contiguous area.

“The farmers of border districts of Punjab need to be more vigilant and inform the PAU or State department of Agriculture officials or the nearest Locust Circle office for any new incursions of desert locust, so that control measures, if required can be taken up to control the menace,” he said.

Officials said Locusts are the short-horned grasshoppers with highly migratory habit, marked polymorphism and voracious feeding behavior. India has not witnessed any full blown locust cycles after 1962, however, during 1978 and 1993, large scale upsurges were observed.

They said localised locust breeding has also been reported and controlled during the period 1998, 2002, 2005, 2007 and 2010. Since 2010, situation remained calm and no major breeding and swarm formation have been reported. However, solitary phase of desert locust has been reported from time to time at some locations in Rajasthan and Gujarat. The Locust Warning Organization (LWO) undertakes regular surveys in the scheduled desert area of Rajasthan and Gujarat to monitor the presence of desert locust and ecological conditions. During the survey, an assessment is made to determine, if the locust numbers have crossed the economic threshold level (ETL) which is 10,000 adults per hectare and 5-6 hoppers/bush that may require control.

Officials said immature/maturing adults/swarms of desert locust have been observed in some districts of Rajasthan and Gujarat since last month. “Appearance of locust in winter months is a new phenomenon and may be linked to climate change events,” the officials said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/desert-locust-in-punjab--no-immediate-threat-but-vigilance-needed.html

9,26-1-20,"Minor gangraped in moving car, 2 arrested in Panipat","Even as Haryana on Friday observed National Girl Child Day, the same evening a shocking news came to light from Panipat where a 15-year-old girl was allegedly gangraped in a moving car by two youths in Model Town area. Four persons are reported to be allegedly involved in this crime, two of them have been arrested. Talking to The Pioneer, the Panipat Superintendent of Police Sumit Kumar on Saturday said that as per preliminary inquiry, two accused who are adults, identified as Ashish and Vishnu were allegedly involved in gang rape of the minor and both have been arrested. After lodging an FIR, Police are investigating the case to find out the involvement of other two persons who were also allegedly involved in the same crime.

The SP said two accused Ashish and Vishnu have been booked under Section 365 (Kidnapping) and 376-D (Gang Rape) of IPC and also under Section 6 of the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The police have also recovered the car used in the crime. The Police officer said that she has been admitted in the hospital and her statement would be recorded before the magistrate on Monday. A team led by a woman sub-inspector has been formed and they are investigating the case thoroughly. “Things will become clearafter thorough investigation,” the Panipat SP said.

Police sources said in a state of unconsciousness, the minor was thrown near a park late on Friday evening. When the accused youth was throwing the minor student from the car, a few people saw it and caught the two youths in the car. She was then admitted to a local hospital. The victim did not return after attending a tuition class on Friday. The family members searched for her and later they came to know that she was found lying unconscious in the Model Town area.

Police sources said the victim went to her tuition at around 5 pm on Friday. One of the youths known to her called her near DAV park to celebrate a birthday. Four youths, who were having liquor in a car, forced her to take liquor and she fainted. She was later taken by two youths in a car and allegedly raped in the moving vehicle. After committing the crime, the accused left the girl near the park where her scooter was parked.

Ironically, despite claims of the State administration of taking measures to check crimes against women, it is only increasing. The Women’s Commission of the state received seven complaints of gang rape from various parts of the State over the last six months. As many as 99 rape cases were reported at Commission from April 15 to December 15.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/minor-gangraped-in-moving-car--2-arrested-in-panipat.html

Mishra said that the lexicon, literature and culture are soul of a civilization and the lifestyle of it as well. He requested the writers to heed a culture that relates to both old folks and present aristocracy following a growing modernity in the society.

Mishra on Thursday addressed a debate on ‘Odisha’s folk culture and Jagannath’ here as chief guest, sponsored by the Sri Gundicha Spiritual Trust.

Joining as chief speaker, former president of Odia Bhasa Pratistan Prof Haraprasad Mishra said, “The Jagannath culture is not only confined to Odisha; it is widespread.” He described Lord Jagannath to be biggest wonder on the earth.

17,26-1-20,Little response to Punjab bandh called by radical Sikh outfits,"The ‘’Punjab bandh’’ call given by radical Sikh outfit Dal Khalsa and SAD (Amritsar) against the CAA and the NRC evoked lukewarm response in most parts of the state barring Amritsar on Saturday.

Markets and commercial establishments remained opened in most parts of the state as protesters at a few places faced opposition from shopkeepers for trying to forcibly down the shutters of their shops.

The impact of the shutdown call was visible in Amritsar as traders kept their shops and commercial establishments shut.

The protest remained peaceful, officials said.

Carrying placards that read ‘’Punjab Rejects CAA, NRC’’ and raising slogans against the Union government, the demonstrators, led by Dal Khalsa president H S Cheema and spokesperson Kanwar Pal Singh assembled at Bhandari bridge and took out a protest rally.

Cheema said by observing the ‘’bandh’’, the people of the state had registered their protest against the CAA and NRC, the RSS’’ agenda of ‘’Hindu Rashtra’’ and also reiterated that Punjab would not be part of a “theocratic Hindu state”.

Terming the law as “divisive and discriminative”, Kanwar Pal Singh said accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah of “suppressing” the voices of protesters

“We are determined to contest and challenge the government’’s autocratic attitude,” he said. He added the Government had “betrayed” Sikhs by not releasing prisoners who had served their sentence.

23,26-1-20,State mulls K’nagar downstream cluster plan,"With Odisha becoming the highest producer of steel and stainless steel in the country, the State Government would undertake development of a first-of-its-kind downstream cluster in Kalinganagar.

Kalinganagar would come up as a major industrial park with focus on steelmaking. The Union Ministry of Steel is setting up the first integrated steel hub at Kalinganagar.

Odisha has been labelled as the highest producer of steel and stainless steel in 2019, which has come as an advantage. And the State Government is planning to create world class industrial infrastructure as there is a race among the State Governments to compete for investments.

While Kalinganagar will have the integrated steel hub, a greenfield steel plant is coming up in Keonjhar, so logistic support with rail and road connectivity is needed to carry raw materials from mines and evacuate products from the plants.

Industries and MSME Secretary Hemant Sharma discussed the issues with senior officials as the State Government has been working on a massive downstream cluster plan in the industrial region of Kalinganagar, said a senior official in the Department of Industries.

Kalinganagar has the natural advantage of major iron ore mines in nearby areas, while movement of metals and iron ore is smooth with rail and road linkage with Paradip Port.

Steel manufacturing has the advantage in Kalinganagar and increased road and rail connectivity between hinterland and major ports of Paradip and Dhamra.

Massive road, rail and waterway connectivity will be developed with establishment of East Coast Economic Corridor (ECEC), said sources.

The ECEC will be lifeline for the industrial park and steel hub, which has been identified as the major infrastructure network of the State.

The Ministry of Steel is continuously monitoring the enhancement of the capability of the infrastructure. Critical rail and road connectivity has been identified and third line Howrah-Chennai Rail Route is needed most, apart from doubling of Bansapani-Jakhapura rail line.

Timely completion of Paradip-Haridaspur and Angul-Sukinda Rail Projects has been identified as critical connectivity required for the integrated steel hub. Hijli to Narayangarh rail line completion and Narayangarh to Jakhapura third line establishment is very critical for Kalinganagar, said sources.

Doubling of Banspani-Meramundali rail link and Bhadrakh-Dhamra rail link has been stressed by the Ministry of Steel.

Eight laning of State Highway-20 and six laning of Duburi-Bamnipal-Keonjhar are on the top priority, sources said. Several other National Highways and State Highways require upgradation and a new corridor is planned. Now, the State Government is coordinating the entire efforts with the Union Ministries of Steel, Railways and Road Transport and Highways.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-mulls-k---nagar-downstream-cluster-plan.html

26,26-1-20,Khattar calls on management of pvt schools to assist in improving standards in Govt schools,"Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday called upon the management committees of private schools to assist in improving the educational standard of government schools by adopting the schools in their surrounding areas.

Addressing the gathering after laying the foundation stone of the new building of Lions Public School near village Dhankot in Gurugram, he said education has a major role to play in character building. He said the State Government is making conscious efforts to raise the educational standards in the State while the private institutions are also contributing to the same, so both the government and private institutions are partners in this task and have the same objective.

He said that the management of private schools should adopt neighbouring government schools and help them improve their standard of education. He made it clear that the resources at government schools will be provided by the state government while the pattern would be that of private schools. For this, he has instructed the officers concerned to sign MoUs with the management of the private schools. He said that some private schools in Karnal have also adopted 50 government schools and said that other institutions should also come forward to adopt government schools in other districts.

The Chief Minister said that the Congress Government’s ‘No Detention Policy’, according to which no student should be declared as failed until Class 9 had led to a decline in the standard of education in the government schools. He informed that the present government took cognizance of this and started conducting monthly tests, which has led to an improvement in students.

Khattar said loan will be provided to help children pursue higher education, adding that the education loan facility will be available soon to students for pursuing higher education without giving collateral guarantee.

He informed that two centers are being run in Jhajjar and Panchkula to prepare talented children of government schools for competitive examinations.

27,26-1-20,"BJP, BJD in blame game over airport mishap","Hours after a portion of the Link Building at the airport here collapsed on Friday night, major political parties got involved in a blame game on Saturday. While the BJP saw some connections between the ruling party and the contractor who was awarded the construction work, the BJD, while terming the incident as unfortunate, asked the BJP not to politicise the issue.

BJD spokesperson Sasmit Patra said, “We demand that the family of the man killed in the incident get adequate compensation and the injured get treatment free of cost. Unlike the BJP, the BJD doesn’t get involved in politics.”

Patra demanded that a detailed probe be carried out into the incident and action be taken against the persons responsible for it.

BJP State spokesperson Golak Mohapatra said, “Surprisingly when our party has not issued any statement on the mishap, the BJD has started pointing fingers towards us. When a portion of Bomikhal bridge collapsed a few years back, we had hit the streets. The then Works Secretary was given a BJD ticket to contest from the Sambalpur Lok Sabha constituency during recent polls.”

Mohapatra asked whether there is any connection between airport work contractor Dilip Khatai and the BJD or any bureaucrat is having links with the contractor. “It seems the BJD is trying to shield the contractor. A probe should be launched to find out the contractor’s connection with the ruling party and what other contracts he has bagged,” he said.

Congress MLA Suresh Routray demanded a CBI probe into the incident and Rs 20 lakh as compensation for the deceased’s family. He also demanded the contractor’s arrest. “The Centre is completely responsible for the mishap,” he said.

“Had the mishap occurred during daytime, the number of casualties would have gone up,” he added.

Behera and his wife Phulabati, who are parents of dreaded criminal Litua alias Bharat Behera. Litua, an associate of gangster Dhalasamant brothers, is now lodged in the Choudwar Circle Jail here for over 5 years.

Police said that Litua over telephone from jail had demanded Rs 50 lakh from a city-based businessman and asked him to hand over the money to their parents. Police also arrested 2 others in this connection who were following up the instructions sent by Litua. All the 4, including Litua’s parents, were produced in a court here, from where they were remanded to judicial custody.

Notably, police last month had also arrested two female friends of another jailed gangster, Md Shakil, for allegedly carrying out instructions of Shakil and giving effect to an extortion call made by him from jail. The 2 back-to-back cases have yet again proved that extortion calls and even death threats are made by notorious criminals regularly from Choudwar jail.

When contacted, the Jail Superintendent categorically denied that the UTPs or the convicts have any access to telephones in the jail. “Maybe, the duo (Shakil and Litua) might have made the calls with the telephones of their relatives during the time of interviews when the UTPs and convicts meet their relatives at the mulakat counters,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/parents-of-jailed-gangster-held-for-extortion.html

34,26-1-20,Contractor detained; engineers grilled by cops,"The Bhubaneswar Biju Patnaik International Airport (BPIA) authorities on Saturday began a probe into the collapse of the roof of an under-construction Link Building at the airport in which a person was killed and many others were injured on Friday night.

BPIA Director VV Rao said a slab of the building connecting the domestic terminal with the international terminal caved in at around 11 pm. “A 200-m concrete slab of the link building collapsed. Most of the workers had left the spot and only two workers were present,” he said.

Rao said a committee would be formed by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and a detailed probe into the technical drawbacks and other aspects which led to the mishap would be conducted.

Though a case is yet to be registered by the Commissionerate police, Dillip Khatei, owner of Dilip Constructions Private Limited which is executing the construction work at the airport, was detained. City DCP Anup Sahoo interrogated Khatei and the process of verifying documents have also begun.

“The concerned contractor and engineers are being interrogated. A special team comprising forensic officials and engineers of the Works Department has been formed to probe the mishap. Action will be taken based on its report,” he said.

One of the workers got crushed to death under the collapsed roof. The deceased was identified as Antaryami Guru, a helper of a truck engaged in the construction work. Though Guru was rescued and rushed to a hospital, he succumbed to the injuries.

As per the version of the injured workers, the construction work was going on in the night and around 10-12 persons were engaged in the work when the roof collapsed.

Getting information, NDRF, ODRAF and Fire Services teams rushed to the spot with the equipments and undertook conducted search and rescue operations, said Special Relief Commissioner Pradeep Jena.

The rescue operations continued for around four hours.

“We rescued the injured and brought them to hospital. One of them was declared brought dead by doctors. The condition of the injured person is out of danger,” said Khordha Collector Sitanshu Rout.

An official of the construction firm claimed that all safety measures had been taken and the workers were wearing all safety gears.

However, Odisha Contractors’ Association president Prabhat Das has questioned whether the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) was followed for centering work. “The reason behind the roof collapse could be mainly due to weak centering work, not to forget the labourers were still working on the roof. Two persons should be held accountable -- the contractor and the engineer of the construction agency or the department who is in charge to supervise the project,” said Das.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/contractor-detained--engineers-grilled-by-cops.html

45,26-1-20,‘Open minimum 10 registration counters in DHHs’,"The long wait to get registered, avail medicines and have various kinds of tests and diagnosis is a major challenge in the hospitals run by the State Government.

Similarly, lack of manpower, poor connectivity, both road and mobile, lack of information and awareness are also some of the challenges in the healthcare sector.

So, some district Collectors have opined that increase in number of registration counters, (at least 10 in District Headquarters Hospitals) will go a long way in sorting out the problem.

Similarly, Outpatient Department (OPD) services duration need to be increased from 9 am to 5 pm, so that more number of patients can be covered. Also, more diagnostic facilities under high ended pathology laboratories may be set up under Public Private Participatory (PPP) Mode to tackle the rush at counters.

And provision of 24X7 laboratory services at Sub Division and Community Health Centre level need to be made available.

So far as drug issues are concerned, fewer medicines are available and to overcome such problem, Essential Drug List (EDL) under Odisha State Medical Corporation Limited (OSMCL) is needed to be revised and the number of medicines should also be increased.

Supply chain management of drugs is needed to be strengthened and it has been advised that 20 per cent Budget limit for local purchase of drugs is needed to be increased.

In order to meet paucity of doctor, it has been proposed that there should be further relaxation of age of doctors based on physical fitness and creation of separate cadre for Specialists and Super Specialists.

Campus placement for recruitment of doctors is needed and transit quarters in clusters of 3-4 Blocks with vehicle provision for pick up and drop facility can be planned.

In order to overcome lack of universal access to healthcare, increase in bed strength of various hospitals as per the population served is needed. As the remote areas are not having improved roads and mobile connectivity, these issues are needed to be taken care of.

Improved roads and mobile connectivity to the unreached areas and Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and referral mechanism from remote areas and coordination of ‘Maa Gruhas’ to better facilitate institutional deliveries in remote areas are also needed.

Identifying vehicle points with empanelment of private vehicles is needed in remote areas. Besides, increase in number of 108 Ambulances and dedicated 108 for referral cases is required.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---open-minimum-10-registration-counters-in-dhhs---.html

53,26-1-20,Cong forms panel to probe Chaibasa killings,"The Congress party has constituted a special six-member team, headed by MP Geeta Koda, to visit Burugelikera village – a tribal-dominated hamlet in West Singhbhum where seven men were killed over an alleged dispute – on Monday and prepare a report on what triggered the massacre.

The team, which includes former Human Resource Development Minister Geetashree Oraon and other senior Congress party leaders, was constituted by Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee (JPCC) President Rameshwar Oraon on Friday.

The six-member committee will also meet the families of the murdered villagers and submit a final report to the JPCC within three days after their visit, JPCC Working President Keshav Mahto Kamlesh said. “The team will visit the village and investigate the incident independently in order to find what led to the gruesome killings,” he said.

On January 17, the seven deceased men had allegedly had a tiff with some Pathalgadi supporters. They were reportedly abducted for protesting the Pathalgadi supporters’ demand of surrendering their Government identity and welfare cards. The next day, police found their bodies with their throat slit from jungles near the village.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which now sits in the opposition bench in Jharkhand Assembly, had also constituted a special committee to independently investigate the incident. However, the members of the committee were not allowed to enter the village on Friday and resorted to staging a protest. The party workers also staged a protest on Saturday outside Raj Bhavan in Ranchi for not being allowed to visit the village.

The Pathalgadi movement in Jharkhand, which has its epicenter in Khunti, advocated the idea of having liberated lands in the interiors where the administration’s interventions were prohibited. In 2017, villagers in parts of Khunti district held Pathalgadi –a practice of demarcating the borders of a village and declaring it as liberated land through writings on stone plaques – and allegedly prohibited entry of the administration in their villages. Soon after coming to power in the end of 2019, Chief Minister Hemant Soren announced that sedition charges against Pathalgadi supporters will be scrapped.

However, while the opposition is holding Pathalgadi supporters responsible for the murders, the police have said that personal rivalry may have led to the killings. There is no clarity for now on what led to the killings in the village.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-forms-panel-to-probe-chaibasa-killings.html

59,26-1-20,Shaheen Bagh poisoning young minds,"Making a strong pitch against the ongoing protest at Shaheen Bagh against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar has termed the sit-in “politically motivated”. In an interview with The Pioneer’s Sapna Singh, Javadekar said the protest was deliberately being stretched and there was a vicious attempt to poison the young children who are calling out for the killing of PM Modi and Amit Shah. Javadekar, also the BJP’s poll in-charge in Delhi, spoke at length on issues like selection of candidates, the party’s strategies for the polls and the campaign to take on the ruling AAP Government. Excerpts from the interview:

How big the impact of CAA/NRC protest is going to have in Delhi polls. Will the ongoing protest in Shaheen Bagh backfire?

Protest against CAA is politically motivated and agenda-based. This will have no impact on Delhi polls as it is not going to polarise Hindu or Muslim votes. Even those opposing the CAA are well aware that the law has nothing to do with people of India. The protest is troubling lakhs of people every day. What we see is five-year-old children calling out for killing of Modi and Shah.

People in India are well aware about original 1955 - CAA which gives citizenship to anyone who fulfils the criteria. The recent amendment in the Act will give citizenship to those who are persecuted on religious bases in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. BJP is ensuring that no one's citizenship is in danger.

CAA is in limelight because a handful of people have been protesting in the Capital for the last 40 days. There are various confusions among people which will be definitely cleared and may take three or six months.

BJP is relying heavily on young or lesser known faces. What is the strategy behind this. Do you think fielding newcomers against sitting Minster of AAP will work for BJP?

This is the rule of our party (BJP) to give ticket to new faces. One third candidates will always remain new. Those who are relevant in today's time in his/her constituency, ticket will be given to him/her. In BJP, winnability is the only criteria. We ensure and promote equal participation of women candidate.

What is BJP's take on AAP's freebies?

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is giving benefits to lakhs of Delhiites. With the regularisation of unauthorised colonies in Delhi, with few registration charges, BJP is giving them the benefit in Lakhs instead of few thousands by providing free water/electricity.

It is Arvind Kejriwal, who is keeping away Delhi people from the Central Government benefit. For instance; we give six thousand rupees to farmers across India. However, Kejriwal deprived Delhi farmers of this benefit by not submitting farmers' list to us. In Ayushman scheme, he has done the same by not implementing it in Delhi.

Is this election a fight between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Delhi Chief Minsiter Arvind Kejriwal?

No. BJP is projecting PM Modi for his policies favouring every citizen of India. PM vs Kejriwal is an idea of good governance and bad governance. in previous Delhi elections, people came from outside to support AAP but this time, no one has come forward beacsue people feel betrayed from Kejriwal's governance where most of the party candidates are facing charges of corruption. There is a wave of deception about AAP which we do not want. That's why PM Modi is an example of good governance.

If BJP wins election in Delhi, will you support the idea of full statehood status to Delhi?

Well, full statehood status to the national Capital is a matter of debate across the globe. Our aim is to focus on development.

BJP is contesting elections in Delhi without a CM face for the first time. In 2008, VK Malhotra, in 2013 Dr Harshvardhan and in 2015, Kiran Bedi. Please comment.

The rule of law in party is: People vote for the party not to a face! We did not project CM face in Haryana, Maharashtra. This will go for Delhi elections as well.

What is BJP's strategy for Delhi election campaigining?

Yes, everyday, our Ministers are engaging with Delhi people in small gathering. The purpose of this engagement is to convey what BJP has done for people— be it abrogation of Article 370, triple talaq, Ram Mandir or CAA/NRC. From 27 January onwards, there will be thousands of meetings for the next 10 days and thus, there will be a carpet bombing with 10,000 meetings. From Cabinet Ministers to party workers, everyone is involved with masses at booth level. We are announcing our vision document soon.

Despite having old relationship with SAD, the party is not contesting elections. Is BJP anti-Sikh ?

Every party has a ideology or a line, BJP respects it. SAD was not agreeing to CAA. Our alliance will remain intact but SAD has refused to contest elections in Delhi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/shaheen-bagh-poisoning-young-minds.html

61,26-1-20,Do not make education part of dirty politics: CM to Shah,"Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP’s) national convener and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal told Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday not to make education a part of dirty politics or make fun of the hard work put in by students, teacher and parents of Delhi Government schools.

The Kejriwal Government could not spend 30 per cent of the education budget,” Shah tweeted.

Reacting to the allegation, Kejriwal invited Shah to see for himself the condition of Government schools in Delhi.

""Don't make education a part of your dirty politics. Please take out time and come with me to visit Government schools. You are surrounded by negativity the whole day, meet our students, you will get some positivity. Do positive politics over education,"" he said at a press conference.

63,26-1-20,Trust deficit is to be wiped out with communities’ support: IG Ops,"State police do concede there prevails trust deficit among the communities in the Jharkhand. IG (Operations) Jharkhand Saket K Singh, who handles STF, SIB ( special intelligence branch) and is the spokesperson for PHQ said, “ I do agree there is the trust deficit among the communities here. But let me tell you it is not an overnight malaise. It has solidified over a long period of time.”

Singh said, “Trust deficit cannot be wiped out within an hour or a month. It needs a prolonged interfacing session with the communities. Communities’ support in building trust is the biggest capital to over ride this kind of trust deficit.”

Reminded that this deficit saw peace and harmony fractured in Lohardaga he said, “All fractured things are repaired and made strong. Here too saner and sensible elements of both the communities must have realized by now that giving a miss to peace and harmony never means any good to any of the community.”

When asked that when Lohardaga communal eruption broke out police’s top brasses were far away in Chaibasa taking stock of the aftermath of massacre of 7 adivasis there by the adivasis to which Singh said, “This much I agree with your information that many of us were away in Chaibasa when Lohardaga erupted so badly and had we been in the headquarters then I understand there would have been a far better co ordination then.”

Since you handle SIB do you not agree that Chaibasa massacre was a failure of intelligence as there were brawls among the adivasis there already which were not at all handled by local police there to which Singh, “It is not the failure of the intelligence but the lack of promptness on the part of the local police.”

On being asked if Lohardaga communal convulsions would find receptive soil in the rest of the districts of the state as like Gumla where a right wing group has imposed day long bandh to which Singh said “ One has to be cautious so as not to play into the mesh of any false emotions and sentiments.

The MP govt in acknowledgement of his selfless services to humanity had conferred him with Indira Gandhi Social Service Award after his demise.

He was 27, did odd jobs including illumination of movie hoardings when the catastrophe had struck the city on the intervening night of December 2 and 3 in 1984. The city was asleep, so as Jabbar, on a chilly night when Methyl IsoCyante leaked from Union Carbide plant. After sensing the red chilli-like odour of the gas, Jabbar swung into action taking his mother to safety and rode around 40km to Obaidullaganj. After leaving his mother at Rajendra Nagar area, he returned to his colony — just 1.5 km away from the plant — to fulfil his duty towards local residents.

Jabbar, however, lost his mother and elder brother on the fateful night.

On the personal front, he lost almost 50% vision in his eyes and had serious lung ailments due to the gas leak.

He, however, took up the fight against Union Carbide in the courts for adequate compensation for around 5 lakh victims and 25,000 who died (as per official records).

In 1987, he had set up Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Udyog Sangthan, a survivors’ organisation demanding sustenance allowance and compensation for the victims, especially widows of the gas tragedy victims. In his lifetime, he imparted vocational training to around 5,000 survivor women so that they could earn a livelihood for their families.

Apart from several agitations organised in Bhopal, he organised protest marches in the national capital, making quite a stir in Parliament.

After the compensation was doled out in year 1989 (though survivors still term it insufficient), Jabbar started focusing on skill development of those who were left with physical ailments after the tragedy. In all these years, Jabbar helped over 5,000 women get jobs through training imparted at his Swabhiman Kendra (an economic rehabilitation centre) in Old city.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bhopal-gas-tragedy-activist-awarded-padmashri-posthumously.html

70,26-1-20,Govt moots ‘Sikh Circuit’ to promote pilgrimage in UP,"To promote pilgrimage in Uttar Pradesh, the Yogi Adityanath government has mooted development of ‘Sikh Circuit’ comprising all religious places associated with the religion and ‘Gurus’. Sikh museums and research centres will also be set up in Lucknow and Agra. Earlier, the Chief Minister had directed the Tourism department to work on the concept.

Taking the agenda forward, Principal Secretary (Tourism) Jitendra Kumar met representatives of different UP-based Sikh organisations, including UP Punjab Academy, historians, Culture department officials and directors of state museums.

Lucknow Gurudwara Management Committee president RS Bagga suggested the state government to set up a Sikh museum and research centre in Agra as the city has several spots and relics associated with the life and struggles of Guru Tegh Bahadur. Since Agra is close to the National Capital Region (NCR) and well connected with New Delhi, the proposed centre is expected to be developed as a major tourist destination and attract a large number of national and international visitors. The proposed Sikh museum in Lucknow will be dedicated to the preservation and enrichment of Sikh culture, heritage and history.

A survey of the Sikh places and personalities — who contributed to art, culture and history — will also be undertaken as a preliminary step towards the development of ‘Sikh Circuit’. Last year, a four-point charter of demands was submitted to the CM and it included the proposal for setting up of a Sikh museum.

Meanwhile, UP is already working on several other tourism-centric religious circuits like Ramayana Circuit, Mahabharata Circuit, Buddhist Circuit etc.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-moots----sikh--circuit----to-promote--pilgrimage-in-up.html
71,26-1-20,Our goal is to make villages leprosy-free: DDC,"We have freed every village of our country from life-threatening diseases like polio, measles, rubella including others, similarly, in the coming years, our goal is to identify each and every leprosy patient and make the district leprosy-free, said Ravi Ranjan Mishra Deputy Development Commissioner Bokaro.

Leprosy is not a hereditary disease. It’s also known as Hansen’s disease is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae which mainly affects the skin, the peripheral nerves, mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract and the eyes.

This leprosy-causing bacteria enters the body through the respiratory system through infection and can take anywhere from a few weeks to 20 years to show its symptoms, he said. “Leprosy is known to occur at all ages ranging from early infancy to very old age. Leprosy is curable and early treatment averts most disabilities,” added Mishra. Leprosy is treated with multi-drug therapy. Free leprosy treatment is available in every government health center we are aalso providing financial assistance to the identified patients for better food and others, he said.

The symptoms of leprosy are Discolored patches of skin, usually flat, that may be numb and look faded (lighter than the skin around); Growths (nodules) on the skin; Thick, stiff or dry skin; Painless ulcers on the soles of feet; Painless swelling or lumps on the face or earlobes; Loss of eyebrows or eyelashes said a medical expert.

Meanwhile, the symptoms caused by damage to the nerves due to leprosy are: Numbness of affected areas of the skin; Muscle weakness or paralysis especially in the hands and feet; Enlarged nerves especially those around the elbow and knee and in the sides of the neck; Eye problems that may lead to blindness when facial nerves are affected, said the expert.

The symptoms caused by the disease in the mucous membranes are: A stuffy nose; Nosebleeds and others.

Since leprosy affects the nerves, loss of feeling or sensation can occur. When loss of sensation occurs, injuries such as burns may go unnoticed, he said.

“If left untreated, the signs of advanced leprosy can include Paralysis and crippling of hands and feet; Shortening of toes and fingers due to reabsorption; Chronic non-healing ulcers on the bottoms of the feet; Blindness; Loss of eyebrows; Nose disfigurement and other complications that may sometimes occurs are Painful or tender nerves; Redness and pain around the affected area and Burning sensation in the skin,” added the expert.

Addressing a meeting at Civil Surgeon office DDC said, our health workers will visit door-to-door to identify leprosy patients very shortly. On the other hand, it is also the responsibility of the common people if any such symptoms are seen on them, they should immediately inform to the health department officials and companions. “As any delay in care and treatment can leads to disability,” added Mishra.

Aiming to raise awareness among the mass about leprosy, we are going to begin ‘Sparsh Abhiyan’ on 30 January, on the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/our-goal-is-to-make-villages-leprosy-free--ddc.html

73,26-1-20,‘Design makes life excellent’,"A week-long academic workshop on Sustainable Heritage Development organised under the joint venture of the International Centre for Inclusive Cultural Leadership, Anant University, Ahmedabad, Gujarat and the Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Manav Sangrahalaya, Bhopal, concluded on Saturday.

Speaking on the occasion, Prof Amareshwar Galla, Director, International Centre for Inclusive Cultural Leadership, Anant University, said that design makes life excellent. The work of heritage conservation has been mainly done by the people of the community.

Design is an important source to achieve an outcome at organisational or social levels that involves engagement, personal connections, interactions, partnerships.

Ethics provides an ethical, reversible and socially responsive approach to community engagement that is responsible for understanding community needs, ideas, and expectations, facilitating strong relationships between community members.

Besides, Galla said that Australia is the only country in the world where heritage conservation work is done by the communities and for that, subsidy is also provided. In each country, various heritage works are being done, but no one pays attention to its maintenance. At the same time, in today's time, the construction of various valuable heritage is being done through the local vendors, rather than by the experts of the said art, thereby eliminating the originality of that art. He laid special emphasis on studying contemporary planning and architecture in the context of Indian culture.

He pointed out that the buildings built by British architects have given special attention to the characteristics of other cultures along with their local culture inherited.

At last, 25 Interns (architects, engineers, designers, artists) gave a presentation their observation and suggestions about the Tribal Habitat and Rock Art Heritage open air exhibition through slideshow.

The conduct, assessment and conclusion of the program were given by Dr. P. Shankar Rao (Assistant Keeper, IGRMS) and the vote of thanks was presented by Dr. S. K. Pandey (Assistant Keeper of IGRMS).

SC to hear enhanced settlement amount

New Delhi: The Supreme Court will hear from January 28, a petition filed by the Central Government seeking an enhanced settlement amount from Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) and reimbursement of relief and rehab expenses incurred by State and Centre after the Bhopal gas tragedy.

A five-judge Constitution bench will hear the petition, which was filed in December 2010, from Jan 28.

The petition seeks additional compensation of Rs 7,413 crores and a re-examination of the apex court's February 14, 1989 judgment which fixed compensation at USD 470 million.

The Central Government reportedly stated before the Supreme Court that the earlier settlement was based on incorrect assumptions on the number of deaths, injuries, and losses.

The Bhopal gas tragedy, touted as the world's worst industrial disaster, had claimed the lives of over 15,000 people after the deadly methyl isocyanate gas leaked from the Union Carbide India Limited pesticide plant on the intervening night of December 2 and 3, 1984.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/in---brief.html

78,26-1-20,Ayodhya temple foundation likely to be laid on Ram Navami,"The foundation stone ceremony of Ram temple in Ayodhya is likely to be held on the occasion of Ram Navami (April 2). Though a final decision on the issue will be taken at the meeting of the proposed Trust, religious leaders of Ayodhya are of the view that the foundation stone should be laid on Ram Navami.

Several prominent Hindu seers, including chairman of Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, said that Ram Navami is an auspicious day for beginning of the temple’s construction work.

The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) said that the construction could be started any day between March 25 (when Vikram Samvat starts) and April 8 (Hanuman Jayanti). The start of Vikram Samvat (Hindu new year) also marks the beginning of Navratri. The VHP plans to celebrate ‘Shri Ram Mahotsav’ during that period.

As per the deadline, the process for setting up of the proposed Trust has to be done by February 9, as per the Supreme Court verdict of November 9 last year. Sources said the Centre may issue a notification for setting up of the Trust to take up Ram temple construction before the due date. The VHP had convened a meeting of Kendriya Margdarshak Mandal at Prayagraj on January 20 and it was attended by the Sant Samaj. The meeting deliberated on the various aspects related to temple construction in the wake of the Supreme Court verdict.

“Though we organise ‘Shri Ram Mahotsav’ every year, we are going to do it in a big way this time. We have called upon people to light lamps at their homes in the evening during this period,” VHP spokesperson in Ayodhya Sharad Sharma said.

“During this period, we plan to reach out to 2.75 lakh villages across the country from where consecrated ‘Shri Ram Shilas’ (bricks) were sent to Ayodhya in 1989. We also plan to identify ‘Ram bhakts’ who took part in the Ram temple movement, and honour them. We would like them to be associated with the construction work,” he said.

As per plan, the VHP will ask the ‘Ram bhakts’ from each district to reach Ayodhya in groups and assist in the construction work. Besides, those living in different parts of the world will also be involved. The VHP has made it clear that it will not seek donations from anyone for the temple construction work.

“However, the proposed Trust may take donations for the purpose. We have made our stand clear that no government fund should be taken by the Trust. Also, there should not be any representation from political parties in it,” Sharma said.

Sources said the proposed Trust may seek public donations starting from Rs 11 per family to fund the project.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ayodhya-temple--foundation-likely-to-be--laid-on-ram-navami.html
79,26-1-20,‘I believe in giving 200%’,"Jassie Gill Known for giving hit songs like Bapu Zimidar, Nakhre, Dill Tutda and many others, Gill is now seen opposite Kangana Ranaut in Panga. He tells Musba Hashmi how he came on board for the role, stories of the tough times and upcoming projects

What is your role in Panga?

I play Prashant Shrivastava, a railway engineer. He is a supportive husband who wants to fulfill his wife’s dreams. The concept of the film is how a woman who had to sacrifice her dreams because of her marriage gets another chance to chase her them. The character is inspiring and the audience is loving it.

What made you take up the role?

When I got the call for audition for this role, I didn’t know much about the film. However, I made a video and send it to the team. Fortunately, I was finalised for the role. It was only during the narration that I got to know about the story. The one thing that I loved about the film was that it is a real-life inspired story which many people can relate to. I took it as an opportunity of giving my best and playing a part in bringing real life stories to the audience.

How was the experience working with Kangana Ranaut?

It was a wonderful experience. We had to shoot at a lot of different locations but the vibes and the atmosphere at the set remained the same. For Kangana, she is such a professional to work with. I always say that whenever you work with good actors there’s always a learning experience with them. One can learn so many things just by observing them. It was the same with Kangana too. Also she is very sincere with her job and always gives her best during the shoot.

You made your Bollywood debut with Happy Phir Bhaag Jayegi alongside Sonakshi Sinha. How did that happen?

The Colour Yellow Productions team called me for a meeting after seeing one of my song’s video. I thought that they were calling me to sing a song in the movie. When I went for the meeting, I was asked if I was ready to play Khushwant Singh Gill in the film since I best suit the character. I said yes and we went for a look test. I was selected. That’s how I got that project.

A singer turned actor. What is your approach towards acting?

I always try to give my 200 per cent in whatever I do. When I am singing, I feel a bit relaxed because I have written the song and I can experiment with it. But when you are acting, you are doing a job for someone. The director relies upon you. There’s a sense of responsibility. The only thing I keep in mind is to give the best I can.

You were born as Jasdeep Singh Gill. How did you get the name Jassi Gill?

It’s a very Punjabi thing. In Punjab, people have the habit of giving nicknames to their children and so did my family. Jassi comes close to Jasdeep, that’s how I got the name. When I entered the industry, there was no page with this name on the Internet. It sounded unique back then so I decided to go by this name.

You struggled before entering the industry...

Yes. I was in college and used to perform in fests. My friends liked my performance and encouraged me to take it up as a profession. That’s when I realised I could make it big in singing and acting. But had to put the idea on hold due to financial constraints. Amidst this period my visa for Australia got approved. I decided to earn some money. I washed cars for three months and returned to India with the money. Then I joined the Punjabi film industry.

What kind of roles attract you?

I like to play roles that most people can relate to and that are inspired by real life.

Any actor or director you wantt to work with?

It will be unfair to name any one person since our industry is full of talented people. I will grab any good opportunity that comes to me.

Upcoming projects?

I have completed shooting for a Bollywood project and we shall make the announcement for it soon.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/talktime------i-believe-in-giving-200-----2020-01-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/talktime------i-believe-in-giving-200----.html

81,26-1-20,New coronavirus as dangerous as SARS? No clarity yet,"New coronavirus as dangerous as SARS? No clarity yet Novel (new) coronavirus (termed “2019-nCoV”) — a new strain of virus from China — has the world on edge because it’s a close cousin to viruses that killed hundreds in separate outbreaks. While it’s too early to tell if this latest threat will prove as deadly, health authorities are drawing on lessons from that grim past.

WHAT’S THE LINK

The new virus comes from a large family of coronaviruses, some causing nothing worse than a cold. But in late 2002, a coronavirus named SARS erupted in southern China, causing a severe pneumonia that rapidly spread to other countries. It infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 — and then it disappeared, thanks to public health measures.

In 2012, another coronavirus dubbed MERS began sickening people in Saudi Arabia. It’s still hanging around, causing small numbers of infections each year. The World Health Organization has counted nearly 2,500 cases of MERS in the West Asia and beyond, and more than 850 deaths.

So far, deaths from the new virus have been a small fraction of the roughly 1,300 confirmed infections, most of those cases in China.

WHERE DO THESE VIRUSES COME FROM?

SARS and MERS came from animals, and this newest virus almost certainly did, too. The first people infected visited or worked at a seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

SARS initially was traced to civet cats sold in a live animal market, but later scientists decided it probably originated in bats that infected the civets. People can catch MERS from infected camels, although again, bats likely first spread that coronavirus to camels.

That animal-to-human jump is a huge concern for all kinds of viruses. Every so often, new strains of bird flu make the jump from Asian live poultry markets to people, for example.

“These wildlife markets are a risk,” said Dr Ian Lipkin of Columbia University, who assisted the WHO and China during the SARS outbreak and advises Saudi Arabia about MERS.

HOW SIMILAR ARE THEY?

Experts can’t yet tell whether the new virus called 2019-nCoV — it stands for “novel coronavirus” — is more like SARS or MERS. Genetically, they’re all closely related but “they really are different viruses,” said Dr Anthony Fauci, infectious diseases chief at the US National Institutes of Health.

One indication of a virus’ danger is how easily it spreads from person to person. Unlike SARS, “it looks like it doesn’t transmit through the air very easily and probably transmits through close contact,” said Dr David Heymann, who headed WHO’s global response to SARS.

And while it’s too soon to be sure, Heymann said the new virus appears most dangerous to older adults who have other health problems. .

Complicating matters, if this new virus is fairly mild, it may be harder to stem the spread. That’s because people who aren’t sick enough to see a doctor and thus don’t learn they should be isolated could keep spreading it, noted Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London, who has consulted for WHO. Nor is there any way to know yet how often people become infected but show no obvious symptoms.

“We may see more mild cases as the surveillance intensifies,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said Friday in Geneva. “So the issue is not so much really numbers that we know will go up.”

HOW WILL PEOPLE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE?

Since symptoms are similar — fever, cough and in more severe cases shortness of breath or pneumonia — it’ll take a medical test to tell. There is one, but health authorities in China, the US and elsewhere are working to make it more widely available. Given that it is flu season in China, too, it’s “all the more impressive that they were able to recognize this outbreak quickly,” Dr Brian Garibaldi of Johns Hopkins University said.

Precautions that hospitals often use for flu season and for other infectious diseases should help for this, too, Garibaldi added. For example, in many US hospitals people are given masks if they arrive with a fever and cough during flu season. And a legacy of the 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak — which also resulted in infected travelers — is that doctors and hospitals are supposed to ask about recent foreign trips.

HUNTING VACCINES

While there is no vaccine — or specific treatment — for SARS or MERS, Fauci said it is technically possible to create a vaccine against this new virus. NIH did develop a potential vaccine candidate for SARS. It proved safe in a small first-step study in people but never was tested further because by then, the outbreak was ending.

This time around, scientists have more of a head start. Just weeks after the first unusual pneumonias were reported, Chinese scientists mapped the genes of the viral suspect and shared them with world health authorities.

Now, NIH is among several groups working to create a vaccine for the new virus, using newer and faster technology than was available during SARS. Fauci hopes to begin first-step safety tests in about three months, but something ready for real-world use would take far longer.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/new-coronavirus-as-dangerous-as-sars--no-clarity-yet-2020-01-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/new-coronavirus-as-dangerous-as-sars--no-clarity-yet.html

83,26-1-20,Raj becomes third State to pass resolution against CAA,"Congress-ruled Rajasthan on Saturday became the third State to pass a resolution urging the Centre to revoke the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) even as the party announced its plans to move a resolution in the Assembly in Kerala, where, interestingly, it is in Opposition, to seek Governor Arif Mohammad Khan's recall for ""violating"" all democratic principles and ""publicly questioning"" the pride of the legislature. The Government said the passing of the resolution is a conspiracy to divide the country and is not acceptable, the BJP accused the ruling Congress of pursuing appeasement politics.

Governor Khan welcomed the recall plans but said whatever he did is part of his duty as per the Constitution and as interpreted by the Supreme Court also. The Governor's statement came hours after Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the party will move a resolution in the Assembly seeking his recall. Chennithala said that he has given a notice to Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan seeking his permission to move the resolution in the Assembly under the rule 130 of the legislative business.

Left-ruled Kerala and Congress-ruled Punjab were the first two States to pass such a resolution. The Rajasthan Assembly passed by voice vote the resolution urging the Centre to repeal the CAA. The resolution also asked the Centre to withdraw the new fields of information that have been sought for updation in National Population Register (NPR), 2020.

""It is evident that the CAA violates the provisions of the Constitution. Therefore, the House resolves to urge upon the government of India to repeal the CAA to avoid any discrimination on the basis of religion in granting citizenship and to ensure equality before law for all religious groups of India,"" Parliamentary Affairs Minister Shanti Dhariwal said while moving the resolution in the House.

Congress-ruled Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are likely to follow suit soon even though a section of party leaders like Kapil Sibal, Salman Khurshid have pointed to the futility of such exercises.

Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria questioned the right to challenge the Act in the State Assembly. ""The Congress should stop doing appeasement and vote bank politics,"" he said.

Union Minister Gajendra S Shekhawat said the passing of resolution in Assembly amounts to murdering the democracy. ""Assemblies are going beyond limited autonomy granted by Constitution by passing these resolutions. This is a conspiracy to divide the country and is not acceptable.""

For his part, reacting to Cheninthala's remarks, Khan said: ""Everyone is entitled to their opinion. I am the constitutional head of the state. It's my duty to advice, counsel, encourage and warn the government. It's part of my duty as per the Constitution and as interpreted by the Supreme Court also.""

Khan also ruled out any confrontation with the government, but reiterated that the state's move to approach the apex court against CAA without informing him was not right.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/raj-becomes-third-state-to-pass-resolution-against-caa.html

88,26-1-20,Life of a zenner,"Zillion dreams, a billion schemes, a million memes, but caught in slipsteams. This is how Dr Debashish Sengupta sums up the:

A radio buzzing in a corner, the transmission is unclear, the signal seems to be wavering. I adjust the antennae that we have fixed near the roof of the room. The voice on the side becomes better. By this time, I had repeated this ritual several times. However, the crackling commentary of the cricket match on the other side made up for all the hard work and irritation. Both my younger brother and myself are stuck with the radio for the whole day. Our parents are not at home. My mother wanted to call our grandma and therefore she went to the post office to book a trunk call. It would take few hours of waiting before her turn comes and she can speak over the government run public land phone, before returning home. We had the whole day to ourselves. It took longer than expected for our parents to come back home. They could not find a taxi near the post office and had to walk for nearly a kilometre before they found a transport. Poor mom, she had to cook the dinner after a long day. Meanwhile, India had lost the match. We spent the whole evening helping our mom in the kitchen. Another uneventful day had come to an end. But we had some excitement coming-up. Sunday was just a day away when we will catch another episode of ‘Star Trek’ and by that time we should also be getting a letter from my cousin brother who was sharing our secret encryption code, as he had promised in his last letter. This was to prevent elders from finding out the contents of our letter. And yes, he was also sending some photos from his recent vacation...

When I tell this childhood story of mine to my son, after listening to me with rapt attention, he tells me that there are technical flaws in my story. What? Technical flaws! I find his expression amusing, he finds it even more. He asks me: ‘Why were you listening to the radio and not streaming live cricket over the Internet?; Why did your parents go to the post office to make a call and not use their mobile to make a video call?; Why did your parents not call an Uber instead of walking a long distance?; Why didn’t you order food over an app instead of letting your tired mom cook the dinner?; Why did you wait for Sunday to watch your favourite show and not stream it over Netflix?; And why were you waiting for days for a letter instead of using WhatsApp or Instagram?’

Not his fault, how will his generation that has been born in the cradle of technology and rocked by social media handles understand the times when we were children. They were born in a transformed world where on one hand rapid advancements in technology have opened the realm of possibilities, including space tourism, whereas on other hand the same technology threatens our very existence.

On one hand, the world has been brought closer than ever before with networks that defy limits of distance, and on the other hand, it has been fragmented by economic, political and religious conflicts. Everyone has more friends than before, yet there is dearth of human connection. Today, they take more photos than Kodak films would ever allow, share them over Instagram, yet they will never know the nostalgia of opening an old dusted photo album.

Zeners or Generation Z, born year 2000 and after are a unique generation, shaped by transformed times. Their formative years are shaped by a world that offers them tremendous opportunities and tools on the plate, yet the uncertainty and volatility of the same makes them highly vulnerable. How do you otherwise explain the contrasts, when a 17-year-old boy discovers a planet on the third day of his NASA internship but on the other hand a 12-year-old girl kills herself after being severely cyberbullied.

Ronit has so much information on his tablet that he can crack the most challenging quizzes, yet all that matters at the end of the day are his grades in school where he finds no use of his knowledge of the world.

The high potential, high intelligence and high ability of this generation is true on one hand, but in the world that they live in, they find their homes changing, pressures mounting and the world becoming more predatory. They find themselves prey to anxiety, depression and vulnerable to poor mental health. Their susceptibility is often disproved by many terming it as jitters of growing-up, but such people fail to count the transformed environment that actually magnifies their challenges.

While writing the book ‘The Life of Z: Understanding Digital Pre-Teen and Adolescent Generation’ I had the opportunity of talking to countless zeners, their parents, teachers, tutors, child counsellors, child psychologists, pediatricians and I came across such contrasting stories. There are a group of school children who have turned their school project into an entrepreneurial journey while there are many others struggling to realise their dreams because they find low acceptance of their ideas with their elders.

There are also parents like Subalaxmi who after understanding the aptitude and personality of her child has dared to homeschool him, and her son, Akash, has excelled in many ways including being invited by a well-known scientist to work in his lab. There are parents like Mukta and Sudhanshu, who have supported their five-year-old daughter in her pursuit of art and their five year old daughter Kamakshi’s name has entered the India book of records for being the youngest Mandala artist. Interviewing Bollywood celebrity kids like Jannat Zubair (of TV series Phulwa fame), Ricky Patel (Tubelight with Salman Khan), Jineet Rath (Talash with Aamir Khan) their life stories are interesting and filled with insights on parenting this modern generation. But, I also came across parents torn apart by trauma whose only twelve-year-old son killed himself in Bangalore, depressed by bullying and his inability to share his anxiety; another parent who lost their child who killed himself unable to cope with a relationship stress.

Being a parent of a teenage zener myself, and in the profession of teaching and dabbling with social psychology, I can understand that parenting, teaching or counselling the zeners is not at all an easy task. This generation is nothing like we were as kids or even what millennials were when they were growing-up. They live in a different time, grow in a different environment and mature early in many ways, yet are susceptible to falling prey to online and offline predators.

There is a need to understand them and their life issues that are often complex. Without doing the same, the path is that of ignorance. Recently I came across a message shared in zest on a WhatsApp group. It read: “Today’s 13-year olds have relationship stress. When I was that age, I used to close the fridge door slowly to see how the light goes off.” This was shared by a 40-something person, parent of a zener. Some thought this was funny, but frankly I do not find it funny at all. This is just an evidence of how less we understand this generation.

I would not blame the zeners, or their parents, teachers or whoever manages them. Often, we are ourselves confused or our thoughts are not integrated and zeners get confused by the varying voices. Take little Ishaan’s example. He studies in an alternate school. Ishaan loves reading story books. But of late his mother has told him that she will not buy him story books as they need to care for the environment and save paper. Ishaan does not quite like reading story books on a digital reader. Anyways, he studies everything academic on the tablet and even writes his notes on that, plays games on mobile, but when it comes to story books, he like them printed. He has read in his books that environmental sustainability means not adding non-biodegradable wastes, keeping the surroundings clean and recycling wherever possible. Ishaan did not quite fathom how buying story books is not caring for the environment and is quite vocal about his disagreement.

During his recent visit to the pediatric ophthalmologist, the doctor told him to reduce exposure to digital devices as it is not good for his eyes. He hardly knows what it is to write with a pencil or a pen as he uses stylus instead. He remembers a physician who visited his school for medical check-up of kids told his class that writing is not only important to have a good handwriting, but it is also like an exercise that strengthens finger muscles and improves general health condition. Ishaan does not know whether to believe his mother or his teacher or his doctors.

Who do you really blame here? Hard to tell. But one thing is absolutely clear that the older generation has to assume responsibility. The contrasting stories also make it clear that right understanding and right guidance of the older generation can do wonders, but failure is seldom an option. The parents/teachers have to stop projecting their childhood or their issues on the present generation pre-teens and adolescents; make a concerted effort to understand the times that they live, empathize with them and their life issues; and then manage them. Only then the efforts will be synchronised at home, at school and in the society at large, and we will be able to connect with this generation and raise them to be functional happy adults.

Zeners make close to 32% of the world population and together with millennials hold the key to our future and the future of this planet and human civilization. Any short-sightedness in understanding them will be catastrophical, to say the least.

89,26-1-20,Maluti: Jharkhand’s own terracotta land,"Dating back to the 15th century, temples of Maluti in Jharkhand bear a testimony to India's rich yet hidden heritage, writes Somen Sengupta

Spectators gathered along Rajpath to witness the Republic Day parade on January 26, 2015 were surprised to see the tableau of Jharkhand. Ever since the state was formed, it was perceived to be the land of jungles and a rich tribal culture. Beyond that were its industrial cities like Jamshedpur and Bokaro, but largely, it remained unexplored.

The 2015 tableau of Jharkhand was a re-creation of a few terracotta temples and the face of an unknown Goddess enshrined in one of those temples. It created a huge wave of interest among the audience present, as well as those who watched the televised version. For many, it was their introduction to the terracotta temples of Maluti, a small village in Dumka district of Jharkhand. Up till now people were only familiar with the Bengal terracotta temples. This small village Maluti has 72 terracotta temples, most of which are embellished with exotic panels of baked clay.

Few months later, Maluti attracted attention once again, when in newly built Ranchi airport, tourism department of Jharkhand placed a huge poster of Maluti with an objective of encouraging tourism in this almost unknown heritage village. Today, Maluti is counted among the unique heritage spots of India.

No where else can one find an instance where within a radius of 1,150 ft, a few generations of zamindars have built more than 100 terracotta temples instead of palaces and pleasure chambers. Even in Bengal, a state that houses several world class terracotta temples, there is no such distinctive a village. Incidentally, Maluti is just a few kilometres from Bengal border and its dwellers speak Bengali and not Hindi. The village cult and customs are more Bengali than Jharkhand.

Though not much information or knowledge is available on these temples, the local folklore/legend has it that this place was known as Mallahati, a zone owned by Malla dynasty that ruled Bishnupur of Bengal. It is the same place that houses many world famous terracotta temples.

The place, it is believed, derives its name from a local Goddess named Moulakshi, who has no reference in Hindu mythology. It is assumed that this Goddess came from Tantrik cult of Buddhism in which she is described as elder sister of Tara. Later, she may have been adopted by the Hindus as their Goddess and started attracting devotees. Based on this information, many believe that this place was once influenced by Vajrayana Buddhism, in which shadow of Tantrik cult is said to be profound.

A website claims Adi Shankara visited this place when he was touring India in his mission of re-emerging Hinduism over Buddhism. The conversion of a Buddhist Goddess into a Hindu Goddess may be a testimony of that forgotten past.

Legend has it that in the 15th century, a new rule was established by an orphan named Baj Basanta, who got a huge tax free land/property as gift, courtesy the then Sultan of Bengal, Alauddin Hussain Shah (1495-1525).

It is said that once during his hunting expedition, Sultan lost his pet falcon and was deeply depressed. Basanta, the village boy, salvaged the falcon and got the bird back to the Sultan. Happy to have his falcon back, Sultan rewarded Basanta with a sizable land. The boy thus got famous as Baj Basanta.

Baj Basanta founded his capital at a place named Dumra. His several generations ruled the area as prominent tax collecting landowners.

In 1680, Baj Basanta’s great grandson, named Rajchandra, was killed in a battle with another king of Rajnagar in Birbhum. Following the incident, his four sons shifted their capital to Mallahati. They found the place to be very peaceful. Once settled, the family branched into four and started expanding by building a plethora of temples. It is believed that all four branches started founding temples instead of building palaces and pleasure houses.

Gradually, in the next 200 years, a time came when it was found that the village had 108 temples dedicated to various Hindu Goddess and almost all decorated with exceptionally beautiful terracotta panels. Today, only 72 temples can be found in Maluti. Rest are either grounded or in a dilapidated condition.

These 72 temples are situated in 4 clusters in the village and one needs to take narrow lanes and beaten tracks to visit all. It is a different matter that the village is very small and thinly populated, and so it does not take much time to visit all clusters. Poor maintenance and lack of public awareness has marred the charm of the place to a great extent.

The first cluster is known as Madhyam bari. The second and third clusters are located very close to each other and appear as one. They are known as temples of Rajbari and Sikhir bari. The last group of temples which are in equally bad condition is known as Chayer taraf. Apart from these temples, there is a hexagonal rasmancha.

While all temples were originally embellished with terracotta, due to weathering and random defacing of walls, many of these temples lay painfully bare now. In many temples, panels are continuously crumbling. The temples have developed cracks and wild vegetation grows uncontrolled. In a few temples, walls are defaced with writings and cattle roam inside. Some temples are still in use and hundreds of people continue to cause damage to its rich art works. During Diwali, on occasion of Kalipuja, fairs are organised at temples clusters, attracting large crowds. These fairs are yet another cause of continuous damage to the temples.

The beauty of the terracotta panels found on the walls of Maluti temples is distinct from the panels found on the walls of the various temples of Bengal. In Bengal, apart from mythology and epic references, various social aspects also feature in terracotta panels, whereas in Maluti stories of Ramayana appears to be the main theme.

The central arch and its surrounding areas are all decorated with the battle sequence of Lord Ram and ten-headed Ravana. In some panels, Ram is shown on the shoulder of Hanuman, whereas, in some temples the same warrior is shown fighting on his feet. In some panels, Ram sports a manly moustache. In a similar manner, Ravana is also visualised in different forms and shapes. He has his usual ten heads and ten hands but his postures are distinctive different and vary from temple to temple. While Ram is accompanied by Laxman and Hanuman, Ravana is followed by demon warriors elegantly dressed up and spirited. The panoply and shoes of Ravana in every temple are beautiful and distinctive. In some panels, Ravana can also be seen fighting alone on foot.

Some of the divine figures are very unique and not commonly found in other terracotta temples. Musicians, flying demons, foot soldiers with naked swords etc are in plenty on each front wall of temples. Social sequences like a royal man on palanquin, worshiping, goat sacrifice and so on are also found aplenty.

The numbers of panels on the side walls and back wall, however, are unusually few and appear to have been removed. A row of small chariots is carved under every figure of Ram and Ravana. These rows of chariots are placed just on the apex of main entrance and again, those are very richly decorated with warriors fighting with deadly weapons, either on horses or elephants. Beautiful floral designs with various hindu motifs are etched all over the wall.

Mahishasurmardini Durga is another common feature to be found on these terracotta decorated temples. Here, she mounts an animal which neither looks like a lion nor a horse. However, some panels depict excellent horse statues. In some panels, she appears with Laxmi and Saraswati on her either sides and in some, she is depicted by herself.

Even though these temples are largely believed to be made of terracotta, there is a contention that these panels may actually be carvings on a very soft type of sandstone, locally known as phool pathar. Which is a possibility because in Birbhum district of Bengal, some temples are actually decorated with phool pathar and are commonly confused for terracotta.

The locals have also been using the hexagonal roof less rasmancha (platform) to celebrate Holi and Raas Utsav of Radha-Krishna, which is causing considerable harm to the structure.

Temples of Maluti follow the Bengal school of temple architecture but sadly not much variation found in that. Most of the temples are made in charchala style, that has single pinnacle with four sides slopes. Only a few temples are made of atchala and deul style. So a monotony grips while taking a tour. However, the thrill of photography sees no bound of satisfaction when one gets to capture a plethora of similar looking temples in a single frame.

As for now, the temple village of Maluti is a victim of sheer negligence from the government side. The village remained lost to world and even to the people of its own state, the undivided Bihar, as well as Bengal even before 1979 when ASI official named AK Sinha first undertook a project on this village and submitted a detailed report of his work

Despite this report, no basic minimum amenities were built in Maluti and the place did not find mention in any of the tourism promotional literature. In 2009, Global Heritage Fund surveyed this village and marked it as one of the fastest vanishing heritage of the world. Even after that, no major Government fund was sanctioned to protect these temples.

It is heartening to see that the present government is atleast making that effort to promote it as a unique heritage site of the state. At an individual level, a local resident named Gopaldas Banerjee who has been observing the gradual decline of the heritage has done excellent work to record and protect these temples. As someone born and bred in the village, Banerjee had heard various legends and stories from his early childhood and has penned several authentic books on the subject. He was recently felicitated by Jharkhand Government for his work of recording history.

The temples of Maluti are a burning testimonial to India’s rich yet hidden heritage and if proper protection and exposure is not given these beautiful structures, all will be lost. Their dilapidated condition is only worsened by overgrown vegetation and massive water leakage from the roof and the walls. A few of the temples have already crumbled owing to neglect and many are awaiting the same fate. Though some restoration work has started recently, but no amenities can still be found for the tourists. It would be a pity if these temples are lost — a sin beyond pardoning.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/maluti--jharkhand---s-own-terracotta-land-2020-01-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/maluti--jharkhand---s-own-terracotta-land.html
90,26-1-20,Planning to travel overseas? Be well-insured,"Not many are aware that there exist a variety of customised travel insurance plans that offer region or risk-specific cover, writes Rohan Kumar

When travelling abroad, travel insurance is no longer considered optional. Escalating costs of healthcare, theft and loss combined with availability of affordable insurance makes it a no-brainer.

Take an example of a couple honeymooning in Thailand with plans for sightseeing and adventure sports. While a regular insurance would cost a few hundred rupees, any health emergency and evacuation could end up costing tens of thousands of dollars. Hospitals, even in Asia, can easily cost US$ 500 a day. Stolen papers, wallets, baggage — stories all too common for most travellers — are also covered in most plans. In the case of such travels, care should be taken to ensure that accidents during adventure sports are covered in the policy they purchase.

A variety of customised travel plans are region or risk-specific, like it is mandatory for an individual to have a Schengen travel insurance policy or a health insurance plan along with the Schengen Visa. Schengen travel insurance policies generally include benefits like emergency medical expenses, repatriation, accidental bodily injury, death or permanent disability, extended protection for the family, etc in Schengen countries. Meanwhile, to provide an effortless globe-trotting experience to senior citizens there is comprehensive travel insurance that has additional benefits like cashless medical services, medical concierge services, state-of-the-art health care facilities, distress allowance, etc. Many travellers are unaware that their travel insurance can be extended if their stay is prolonged. Different insurers offer specific extension periods depending on the travel destination and the type of traveller.

There are niche products in the market as well, depending on the kind of travel you are planning: coverage for races and adventure sports like bungee jumping, mountaineering and parasailing, plans that cover medical costs pertaining to pre-existing conditions by offering a waiver to the exclusion, kidnapping etc are some of the value add-ons available for policies. We’re hearing of policies that will cover “ cold feet cancellation” for guests heading to a destination wedding, or inconveniences related to being hijacked — a daily benefit if you are delayed in reaching your destination due to this.

A good idea when choosing insurance policies is to first take a look at what is covered in your existing plans — sometimes your homeowners or renters’ policies will cover valuables, or your health insurance will cover emergencies abroad. Next, look at any risks you are taking on the trip(s) you are covering (scuba diving, hiking, cruises may require a niche policy), and then choose a policy that covers them all.

Another thing to consider while buying a travel plan is to keep an eye out for the deductible. The deductible is the amount that the policyholder agrees to pay if they need to make a claim. The insurance company then reimburses the costs over and above that amount. With most travel insurance policies, the deductible is applied to emergency medical care costs. It may also extend to baggage or trip cancellation/interruption coverage. Insurers usually offer a range of deductible amounts. Generally, higher the amount, the greater the discount on the premium. So, adding a deductible is especially beneficial for people paying high premiums-e.g., those staying abroad for months at a time. The growing trend is for policies that have a zero deductible, meaning there will be no out-of-pocket expenses if a claim is filed with the insurance company. In countries with extremely high medical costs, like the United States, finding an insurance plan with a zero deductible is always wise and almost imperative.

In the event of buying insurance online (obviously the most convenient option), the customers should consider checking the travel insurance coverage, quote for the travel duration, claim settlement ratio and ease of contacting customer care. Fine print matters — accidents under the influence of intoxicants are not covered, acts of war or terrorism are often not covered — but for all purposes, if you don’t have time to go through the various checklists, remember that the important thing is to be covered.

91,26-1-20,Habit tendencies can derail venture,"Picking up threads from the previous issue, let us now look at the prognosis of the young man’s endeavour since his session with me. He was advised to reflect upon his inner frame of mind in a meditative mode, identify the inherent fault lines, acknowledge them, and make necessary amends from the root level through fresh educative inputs. He did reflect for a while, but not in a meditative mode. In fact, he used to seek guidance on how to modify his conduct. As also, on how to relate to his parents so as to keep them in good humour. The saner side of him was then driving his thought process, as would Jupiter beneficially aligned to mind signifying Moon may mean.

He, thereafter, began consciously evading getting into unnecessary argument with his parents, unlike earlier when he would react to everything. That helped improve his relationship with parents over a period of time, but not without intermittent bouts of aggression. His habit tendencies would then temporarily overtake his thought process. But after offending them, he would regret, seek clarification on where and why he went wrong, and as advised, say sorry to mend fences. Remember, habits die hard, and would not spare you unless the thought-seeds to which they are rooted in the inner realms of mind, are resolved from the base level. That is only possible through self-reflection in meditative mode. Otherwise, when caught unguarded, the inherent tendencies will come into immediate play, and evidently to one’s detriment.

On work front, he was not contended with just his family business, which being considerably big demanded fulltime engagement. His sense of insecurity played heavy on his mind, coming as it may with the Sun placed adverse to Saturn. The trigger was, not being named a director in the company, whereas his first cousins were inducted into the board of his uncle’s company. He felt that he was being denied his due. He was afraid that because of temperamental differences with parents, he would be deprived of his legacy. It could not register in his mind that they were in fact grooming him in a way that before he was handed charge, he gets time and space to get over his attitudinal limitations, so that he could lead with prudence and patience.

The man in hurry wished to hurriedly create something of his own. True to his nature, he was toying with many entrepreneurial ventures. For, mind signifying Moon is posited in a Mercury owned sign, a planet identified with multiplicity. He was advised to take up one project at a time, take it to its logical end, stabilise it, before getting into another venture. But given his habit, he kept arguing to prove his point and won’t listen.

He tried to enter into partnership with one start-up company that was assisting him in one of his projects. But the promoters refused. That raked up his ego, as would the Sun placed adverse to Jupiter imply. He could not digest refusal and thus got trapped in his own bind. In reaction, he rushed through partnership with another start-up company that was also assisting him in his project, just with the intent to outsmart the other company. Made disproportionate investment despite stiff resistance from his associates. Later, he realised that the return he expected may take some time. He forgot that any maiden venture has to go through mean down time before giving returns. He then lost his nerves. Following which, he on the strength of money power began playing all tricks in his hand to take over the company, which met with stiff resistance from the original promoters. Eventually the partnership broke off and he lost heavily.

If all that would not be enough, he spent heavily in branding himself. His illusionary perceptions made him ignore all advice to wait till his venture took off well, as would the Sun opposite mischievous Neptune imply. Being young, he had enough time in hand for image building. But he was in a hurry to rough shoulders with the bigwigs in the Business world. In the process he went out of proportion to pay a hefty sum to become a member of an International organisation.

Now, because of economic downturn, on completion of his project, his product line is not moving on expected lines. Consequently, he is now under severe financial pressure, making it difficult to push through his product in the market.

92,26-1-20,mind bender,"Simon Baker in the TV show The Mentalist wows the viewers with his cold reading and hypnosis to track down real criminals. Does this mean that there is science behind mind reading? SHALINI SAKSENA chats up self-styled mystifier and supernatural entertainer LIOR SUCHARD to tell you more

Could you give the notepad, he asks, and tells you to think of a number. You think, here comes the trick. In the meantime, he scribbles something on the paper. He then asks you to share the number you had thought of. Lo and behold! It is the number on that paper. What is new here?

After all, we all saw Patrick Jane, (Simon Baker) in The Mentalist using his special but fraudulent powers to solve crime. He studied the body language of the person to find out the true killer among suspects. Is there a science that allows a person to read minds and body language to predict things that common people can’t pick up? Or it is just a fantastic trick by a magician to wow his audience?

Lior Suchard, renowned Israeli mentalist, mystifier and a supernatural entertainer, tells you that what he does is more than parlour tricks.

What exactly is a mentalist and how what he does different from a magician? Suchard mixes visual magic, mind reading, body language and keen sense of observation to influence people. Mentalists usually don’t mix normal magic tricks for the amazing feats they do to keep their audience captivated. A mentalist will always dissociate himself from theatrical tricks that a magician performs on stage — like the Water of Ganga — the famous trick of PC Sircar Senior. From a small cauldron, at the beginning of the show, he would pour water into a basin. All through his performance, he would pour water from that cauldron, till the end of the show. The water never ran out!

The 39-year-old is in India after a long gap and there is a reason. “It has been a few years. There was a time when I used to visit often. Then I stopped. This visit comes after a long wait. To begin with, I used to come here often, do tours — visit 20 cities. After doing many shows, I collaborated with Ace Production and created a big show. But then I went away on a break. I am back now. I was supposed to come earlier, but was busy with other performance the world over but I had a window of time for this trip and created three shows — one in Delhi and two in Mumbai. Everything this time is new — the acts and crazy interactive sessions. We also wanted to combine this show which would benefit children as well. We are helping Create Foundation, I will interact with children and have a fun-filled interactive session,” says Suchard who was in the Capital and staying at the Ambassador, IHCL, SeleQtions. He tells you that there is no such thing as a normal mind reader.

He decided to stay away from India as he wanted the market to miss him and also to keep his imitators at bay. Back then, when he used to visit and perform across cities, many started copying him and calling themselves mentalists, performing across India. What they were doing, Suchard says, was copying his acts. But he takes it in his stride and as a compliment. “If someone is copying you, it means what you are doing is good,” he says.

“I opened the floodgates. I was always a mind-reading master mentalist. A mentalist is not a magician, I don’t do card tricks, I don’t levitate people, I don’t do bowling tricks. I work on the mind. I know how people think. I use underground psychology influencing hypnotics, body language reading, non-verbal communication, extra-sensory perception, strong memory and mathematical skills to read the mind. I combine all these skills with my love for the stage and share an experience with audience participation,” Suchard says. He goes on to prove he is good at what he does.

Pointing to a person, he asks how well one knows him. He asks him to write a name on a strip of paper and destroy it. “To get rid of the evidence,” he explains. He looks at the person for a few seconds and begins. “When I look at the body language, the name that was written is that of a woman. It was a name that came immediately to you. The name you have written is uncommon. I am not sure. It has three-four alphabets, like a nickname but in this case, it is her given name. It is not accurate science; sometimes I make mistakes. But right now, the name that comes up is Mini,” he tells you, leaving a trail of amazement. For Suchard, it is simple. He just observed the person and used his skills to arrive at the name.

“What I do is not a trick. What people think is real or not real, it is all part of the show. For me, the most important thing is for people to be happy, enjoy and have an amazing experience. It is not about believing or not believing. people are welcome to be sceptical; they can have fun with the show. If people believe, that’s good. Albert Einstein said: ‘There are two ways to live life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle’. If you are choosing that nothing is a miracle, you are many doors. I don’t try to talk about power, it is about ability. I tell people in my show that everyone has the ability to do amazing things. One just has to believe in himself,” Suchard explains.

Almost all mentalists say that they are not magicians and what they do is a different art form altogether. A mentalist on the other hand has a great knowledge about psychology of human nature and understand how people think. Instead of sawing women in half or making wild animals appear from big boxes, a mentalist tries to enter the most sacred and closely guarded place — our mind. Because of this, the audience experiences incredible things like bending of the spoon, like guessing the correct number that he wrote on the paper, like coming up with the correct answer every time the dice is rolled — all this and much more even when he is not looking at the person. One can say that it is crazy thought manipulations.

Magicians, on the other hand, don’t hide the fact that that they are doing is a trick in a manner that entertains. The audience too understands that what he is witnessing is an illusion and what he is actually seeing can’t really be done. A perfect example is the sawing of the woman into two and putting her back again. We all know that the magician really didn’t cut her into two. But this doesn’t mean that they don’t mix a bit of trick with mind games thrown in for a good measure. Some of us have watched the TV shows of people like David Blaine, an American illusionist, endurance artist and extreme performer, who perform mind-blowing mind-reading stunts that leaves the audience in awe.

A special mention for The Amazing Kreskin — an American mentalist who became popular on TV in the 1970s. The story goes that Kreskin would ask someone from the audience hide the payment he was to receive from the show. If he couldn’t find it by the end of his performance, he would not get paid! Such was his talent.

One is told that while there are many great magicians, there are very few – only a handful of people who are true mentalists. “If one had to think of a name, it will be difficult for people to come up with the name on the spot. Our world is very small. We are just a handful of people who are true mentalists.

His own journey began when he was very young. He tells you that there is no school that teaches mind reading – the high academics of mind reading. He is self-taught and tells you on a lark that maybe he should open a school that teaches what he does.

“It was a combination of things that he developed and learnt when he was young. He read a lot of books, travelled the world, he invented things and ideas, met people from radical Math calculations to spirituality. What I do moves from accuracy, to Math to precisement to spirituality, meditation and Zen. It takes skills that I have into account and combines that with a lot of fun, humour and craziness that I love. I studied all this and mastered what I do today.

The mentalist has a cup of activities waiting for him once his India tour ends.

As of now, he has two TV series in the US with celebs. He is also in the process of developing a new show and going to part of a big talk show. For this he has to be on top of the game; he practices, constantly thinking of new ideas and inventing all the time.

Interestingly, what he does can be taught and learnt. “It is similar to playing the piano. If I learnt the art from a tutor for 10 years, I would know how to and be pretty good with practice. But it doesn’t mean one will become Mozart. One can me taught. I have written a book — Mind Reader: Unlocking the Power of Your Mind to Get What You Want. It has been translated into eight languages. The book teaches a little about how one can influence others, to read people and mind techniques. I wrote it with the belief that people can be taught to do it. But there is a point up to which one can teach. Something has to come from within just like any other art form say like a sport. One can learn to play cricket but not everyone will be a Sachin Tendulkar. I take his name since he is a good friend of mine. You need to have that little extra to be right at the top,” Suchard tells you.

Self-belief and hard work are important pillars for a mentalist. “Take risks is another aspect. All these ties together to be a professional and be very good at what one does. Taking risks doesn’t mean putting oneself or others in danger but it means to do things that out of the extraordinary and think out-of-the-box. There a phrase – the difference between try and triumph is the little bit of ‘umph’. One needs to really hard work to even put out the simplest of acts,” he tells you.

He draws inspiration from travelling, meeting people and getting into a store. He tells you that the show that he is preparing for to be aired in the US, the act that it has were thought of three years back. I drew the ideas and then thought of combining it with a few things. Some of the acts that I showcase that takes years in process. For this tour, I have totally new ideas. The good part about this collaboration is that the production house and I have a good match, I am a high-end performer and I want everything to be perfect — from lighting to sound to stage. I prepared new acts that is going to blow the minds of the audience. Some of the acts are so big that it will involve the entire audience. In this instead of one person coming on the stage while the others watched, if the audience has thousand people, each will experience it and be part of the show. This is a rarity. It is tough to do as well. When one wants to be good at something — have showmanship, charisma, performance and the acts – if one has greats ideas but doesn’t know how to deliver it or if one is good but doesn’t know how to put out the idea, in both circumstances, it is not good. One needs to have ideas and know how to deliver it. For this tour, I am going to dazzle, confuse and make those present happy at the same time,” he says.

Dazzle he did. The act that involved the entire audience showed how optimism and the metaphor of finding love, everyone found it withing themselves through a crazy interactive experiment. There was mind-reading, mind influencing and predictions. Things moved with super high-end camera crew, lights, screens and sounds.

He tells you that what he does is 90 per cent real and 10 per cent trick. “I do tricks just to have fun with the audience. The 90 per cent is based on psychology and how the mind works. The human mind is the same. I don’t know what one is thinking, I know how one is thinking. I can take advantage of it and influence the person. That is how I could predict the number and gave that name,” Suchard says.

Even though he can predict what the other person is thinking, it doesn’t bother him since what he does is used for the positive purpose.

“I never think of negativity. Like when I came up with the name, the person is going to call her and tell her what happened and the other person would be just as amazed. I am a perfectionist. I am constantly improvising. Sometimes, I look at the place and change my acts. Sometimes, I improvise on the spot. This means that I change my acts depending on the people gathered. I love to invent new acts,” Suchard tells you. He is the best in his profession, he insists.

One can’t call oneself mentalist on a whim. One has to be a purist. Mentalist is a sacred art. There are many magicians making millions of dollars from their art. But many call themselves a mentalist because it is more prestigious. Being mentalist is tough. Some people think that being in the presence of a mentalist is scary. Charlie Chaplin said: A day without laughter, is a waste day. I laugh everyday and do the same for others,” Suchard says.

He tells you that people are scared because they think he can read their mind. “I am very sensitive to people. It is hard for a person to lie to me. I am not hearing thoughts of people and that could be why they are wary, what I do is a process that I have perfected over the years.

To end on a positive note: Always have happy thoughts; one never knows who might read them,” Suchard says.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mind-bender-2020-01-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/mind-bender.html

Other income growth was 18.77 per cent to Rs 4,043 crore, with the core fee income increasing 17 per cent, the bank said.

Gross slippages came at Rs 4,363 crore for the reporting quarter, highest during the fiscal year, but the recoveries from assets like Essar Steel and a Rs 2,000 crore write-off ensured that the same was down on a net basis.

Its president Sandeep Batra said two well-rated accounts – a troubled broking company and a south-based industrial group — led to the spike in slippages during the quarter, along with Kisan Credit Card loans which is a fallout of the farm loan waivers.

Without offering any numbers or an outlook on asset quality, he said the exposure to the broking company has been fully provided for, while the same for the industrial company has been done “prudently”. Its standalone provisions came at Rs 2,083 crore, down 51 per cent from the year-ago period. Gross non-performing assets ratio was at 5.95 per cent as against 7.75 per cent in the year-ago period.

Its overall recoveries, upgrades and deletions from the NPA book was at Rs 4,088 crore and the bank did not divulge the benefit on the Essar Steel recovery.

Just like its smaller peer Axis Bank, the bank has also classified an exposure to a telco as below investment grade, which led to the increase in the overall BB and below book to Rs 17,403 crore after two consecutive quarters of a reduction.

Its overall exposure to the sector has been stable at 1.8 per cent and includes two top companies, he said, adding no extra provision has been taken on account of this.

Batra said the bank’s core operating profit excluding the impact of the benefit was up 23 per cent at Rs 7,017 crore, seeking to drive the point of a healthy overall growth for the bank.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/icici-bank-posts-over-two-fold-rise-in-q3-profit-at-rs-4-670-cr.html
100,26-1-20,"EU, 16 WTO members sign pact for interim appeal arrangement","The European Union and 16 WTO members including China and Australia have signed a pact to develop a multi-party interim appeal arrangement at the global trade body. The arrangement, signed on Friday on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting, will allow the participating WTO members to preserve a functioning and two-step dispute settlement system at the World Trade Organization (WTO).

This initiative was launched in mid-December 2019 by the EU and a number of other WTO members following the effective paralysis of the WTO Appellate Body due to the blockage of new appointments since 2017.

EU Commissioner for Trade Phil Hogan said: “This statement testifies to the high importance that the EU and the participating WTO members attach to retaining a two-step dispute settlement process in WTO trade matters. The multiparty appeal arbitration arrangement will guarantee that the participating WTO members continue to have access to a binding, dispute settlement system among them.”

“Let me underline again that this remains a contingency measure needed because of the paralysis of the WTO Appellate Body. We will continue our efforts to seek a lasting solution to the Appellate Body impasse, including through necessary reforms and improvements,” he added.

The multi-party interim arrangement will be based on Article 25 of the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding. It will secure the participating WTO members (Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the European Union, Guatemala, Republic of Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Singapore, Switzerland, and Uruguay) an effective and binding dispute settlement process for potential trade disputes among them.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/eu--16-wto-members-sign-pact-for-interim-appeal-arrangement.html

102,26-1-20,NIA probe: Opp slams Modi Govt for case takeover,"With a major turf war having broken out between the Centre and the Maharashtra Government over the take-over of the 2018 Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case by the NIA, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Congress’ former president Rahul Gandhi and State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Saturday slammed the Modi Government for havingexceeded its brief for sheer political reasons.

A day after the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) handed over the investigations in the Bhima Koregaon-Yelgaar Parishad case to the National Investigation (NIA), a miffed Pawar charged that the ruling BJP – with an acute fear of being exposed in the Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case – had hurriedly handed over the investigations to the NIA. He demanded that an independent panel to set up to hold comprehensive probe into the manner in which the Pune police had investigated the case. “Only an independent probe will bring out truth in the case,” he said.

“The re-investigations are necessary in the case, because the Centre’s move has aroused suspicions. The Centre’s decision to hand over the case to the NIA within hours after the State’s deputy chief minister and Home Minister reviewed the case with the state’s police officials. Under the Constitution, powers of dealing with law and order have been vested with the States. The Centre might have apprehended that if a re-investigation is ordered into the case, the previous BJP gove3rnment and its hand-picked officials might be exposed,” Pawar said.

“Prima facie it appears that the Pune police misused their powers during the investigations. The Centre may have handed over the case to the NIA, but there is a need for the state government to investigate if the Pune police misused their powers to frame the activists in the case,” Pawar said.

On his part, Gandhi alleged that the move to hand over the case to a central agency was part of the “MOSH ( Modi-Shah) agenda of hate”. “Anyone who opposes the MOSH agenda of hate is an “Urban Naxal”. Bhima-Koregaon is a symbol of resistance that the Government’s NIA stooges can never erase,” the Congress’ former president tweeted.

State Home Minister Deshmukh alleged that the Centre had hurriedly handed over the case to the NIA, after apprehending that the BJP leaders from the previous saffron government might be nailed for botching up investigations in the Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case in the re-inquiry planned by the MVA government. “Before setting up a team to re-investigate, the state government will seek legal opinion in the matter,” Deshmukh said.

Meanwhile, former chief minister and senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis welcomed the Centre’s decision to hand over the Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case to the NIA. “When the incident took place, said the state police had unearthed a huge network of “urban Naxals’ and submitted all the evidence gathered to the court. The Supreme Court had also supported the police action. “The urban Naxal network is spread all across the country. The decision to hand over the probe to NIA is appropriate,” Fadnavis said, while talking to media persons.

The MHA’s move to hand over the case to the NIA came a day after the MVA government reviewed the charge sheets filed by the Pune police in the case in the light of Pawar’s charge that the previous BJP government had vengefully implicated several activists in the case. On its part, the Maharashtra government had indicated that it would hand over the case to a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to ascertain whether the Pune – acting allegedly at the behest of the then ruling BJP – had acted against several activists based on “trumped up” charges.

Pawar had shot off a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and State Home Ministry early this week, seeking an SIT probe into the questionable manner in which the Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case and to ascertain if the BJP, the principal ruling party in the previous BJP-led government, had conspired to frame the activists in the case. Following the letter, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar chaired a meeting to review the charge sheets filed in the case.

That the MVA government was taken by the Centre’s move to hand over the Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case could be evidenced from the fact that it was only late on Friday night that State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh reacted to the development, saying: “I strongly condemn the decision to transfer the investigation of “Koregaon-Bhima” case to NIA, by the Central Government without any consent of Maharashtra State Government”.

Addressing a news conference at his “Silver Oak” residence here, Pawar said: “The BJP-led Centre has handed over the investigations in the case to the NIA. It is not the case that all those who speak against injustice and atrocities by the government are naxalites. To bring out truth in the case, it is essential for the state government to set up an independent team to investigate the case”.

“Had the state government set up an SIT to re-probe the case, the skeletons of the previous BJP-led government and the officials who investigated the case would have come out. That’s why the Centre hurriedly took away the case from the Pune police and handed it over to the NIA,” the NCP chief said,.

“It is essential to review the investigations carried so far by the Pune police. Retired Supreme Court Judge P B Sawant, retired Judge of the Bombay High Court B G Kolse Patil and several other people have objected to the manner in which the investigations have been conducted in the case. In this case, several activists hqve been arrested and they have been declared urban naxals. The charge-sheets registered against the accused are not based on facts,” Pawar said.

Pawar recalled that then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, while making a statement on the floor of the State Assembly, had not described the arrested activists in the case as Maoists.

“Based on what supposedly transpired at the Elgaar Parishad, the police had arrested activists, branded them as Maoists and booked them treason. From the information I have got, poems of Marathi Dalit poet Namdeo Dhasal were read out at the Parishad. The speakers spoke against injustice and atrocities. That means the police acted in a highhanded manner, branded the activists as Maoists and booked them for treason and other serious charges,” Pawar said.

The cases registered against 20 activists in connection with the violence that erupted on January 1, 2018 at a gathering of thousands of Dalits At Bhima-Koregaon in Pune district who were celebrating 200th anniversary of January 1, 1818 victory of British troops over Peshwa Bajirao at Bhima Koregaon in Pune district, and the provocative speeches delivered by the activists at an Elgaar Parishad held in Pune on December 31, 2017, a day before the celebrations at Bhima Koregaon.

It may be recalled that the police had arrested ten CPI (Maoist) activists in two batches in connection with the Elgaar Parishad-cum- Bhima-Koregaon riots case. They were among the 15 activists against whom the police had registered cases. The five are still absconding.

The activists against whom charge-sheets have been filed for serious offences are: Sudhir P. Dhawale, Rona J. Wilson, Surendra P. Gadling, Shoma Sen, Mahesh S. Raut, Varavara Rao, Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Pereira, Sudha Bharadwaj and Gautam Navlakha. They have been booked for their association with the Elgaar Parishad held in Pune a day ahead of the January 1, 2018 Bhima-Koregaon riots and their alleged links with the Maoists.

All of them have been booked for serious offences under unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), 117 ( abetting commission of offence), 120-b ( conspiracy) read with 34 (common intention), 121, 121 (A) (Waging or attempting to wage a war, or abetting waging of war, against the Government of India) 124A (sedition), 153 –A (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot..) and 505-1b (statements conducing public mischief) of Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Among other things, they have been charged with involvement in a conspiracy to kill Prime Minister Narendra Modi and overthrow the democratically elected government in the country.

“The Centre is trying to save its skin. The Centre says the case involves the national security. If it is a matter of national security, then why did the former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis not hand over the case to a central agency? The people who have been arrested have nothing to do with the Elgaar Parishad. How long the arrested activists will languish behind the bars?,” Dalit leader and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi president Prakash Ambedkar asked.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nia-probe--opp-slams-modi-govt-for-case-takeover.html

In his customary address to the nation on the eve of 71st Republic Day, Kovind cited Mahatma Gandhi’s gift of ‘Ahimsa’ (non-violence) to the humanity and said that his talisman for deciding whether an act is right or wrong “applies to the functioning of our democracy”.

Stressing that both the Government and the Opposition have “important roles to play”, the President said “while giving expression to their political ideas both must move forward in tandem to ensure that development of the country and welfare of its people are promoted consistently”.

Earlier, on the occasion of the 10th National Voters Day, Kovind lamented that there are some voters who do not understand the importance of their right to exercise franchise and reminded them that in several countries people had to struggle to get it.

106,26-1-20,Sedition case against Shaheen Bagh protest ‘mastermind’,"The Sarbananda Sonowal-led BJP Government has filed a sedition case against Shaheen Bagh protests organiser Sarjeel Imam for his ‘cut Assam from India’ statement.

Speaking at the anti-CAA rally in Shaheen Bagh Imam instigated the mob saying if 5 lakh Muslims are organised then we can cut the North-east from rest of India.

Talking to the media, Assam Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that State government has taken cognizance of this seditious statement and has decided to register a case against him.

“Our responsibility is to cut the Assam from India as only then the Government will hear our voice. If we have to help the Assam then we will have to cut the Assam from rest of India,” Imam had said claiming that people in the State were being sent to detention

centres. The Siliguri corridor which connects Northeast India to the rest of India is called the Chicken Neck and is strategically important.

The standoff between India and China in 2017 in Doklam was an attempt by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to gain control over the corridor.

Imam has made many controversial statements over the CAA in the past.

In his Facebook post yesterday, he urged Muslims to organise nationwide chakka jam and told them to know the difference between chakka jam and sit-in protests. He further said that people should sit on the national highways in the country and protest against the CAA and nation-wide NRC.

109,26-1-20,Iranian FM: Tehran still willing to negotiate with US,"Iran is not ruling out negotiations with the United States even after an American drone strike that killed a top Iranian general, the country’s foreign minister said in an interview released Saturday.

Mohammed Javad Zarif told Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine that he would “never rule out the possibility that people will change their approach and recognize the realities,” in an interview conducted Friday in Tehran.

There has been growing tension between Washington and Tehran since in 2018, when President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the nuclear deal with Iran. The U.S. Has since reimposed tough sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy.

But Zarif suggested Iran was still willing to talk, though reiterated his country’s previous demand that first the U.S. Would have to lift sanctions. “For us, it doesn’t matter who is sitting in the White House, what matters is how they behave,” he said, according to Der Spiegel.

“The Trump administration can correct its past, lift the sanctions and come back to the negotiating table. We’re still at the negotiating table. They’re the ones who left.”

Trump has maintained that the 2015 nuclear deal needs to be renegotiated because it didn’t address Iran’s ballistic missile program or its involvement in regional conflicts.

The other signatories to the nuclear deal — Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia — have been struggling to keep it alive.

Following the U.S. Drone strike on January 3 that killed Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran announced it would no longer abide by any of the deal’s limitations to its enrichment activities.

It then retaliated January 8, launching ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq housing American troops, causing injuries but no fatalities among soldiers there.

Zarif did suggest Iran was also still prepared for conflict with the US, though was not specific.

“The U.S. Has inflicted great harm on the Iranian people,” he said. “The day will come when they will have to compensate for that. We have a lot of patience.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/iranian-fm--tehran-still-willing-to-negotiate-with-us.html
110,26-1-20,Democrats conclude opening arguments,"House impeachment managers on Friday night concluded their argument before the Senate to remove US President Donald Trump from office, saying he misused his position and indulged in obstruction to the Congress.

The house managers closed their marathon 24-hour argument spread over three days with an impassioned plea that the trial be fair.

The ruling Republican Party enjoys 53-47 majority in the 100-member Senate. Democrats, who have majority in the House, have alleged that the Republican leadership in the Senate will be partisan during the trial.

“I implore you - give America a fair trial. She’s worth it,” said Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Adam Schiff.

Trump is only the third president in American history to have been formally impeached by Congress.

From Saturday, Trump’s attorneys would begin presenting their defense. Like the House managers they too have 24 hours over the next three days for their argument in support of the president.

Trump has asked the Senate to dismiss both the charges against him. He argues that he has done no wrong.

In his concluding argument, Schiff outlined what he thinks Trump’s attorneys will say.

“So what do all these defenses mean? What do they mean collectively when you add them all up? What they mean is under Article 2, the president can do whatever he wants. That’s really it, stripped of all the detail and all the histrionics, what they want us to believe is the president can do whatever he wants under Article 2, and there is nothing you or the House can do about it,” Congressman Schiff asserted.

On Saturday, Trump’s team would present their argument for three hours.

“I guess I would call it a trailer, kind of coming attractions would be the best way to say it. Obviously, we have three hours to put it out so we’ll take whatever time is appropriate during those three hours, kind of layout with that case will look out like, but no, next week is where you’ll see the full presentation, but there will be plenty to see,” Trump’s personal attorney Jay Sekulow told reporters. In an interaction with the media, he slammed Schiff.

“Adam Schiff just said that this idea of the solicitation of foreign interference is deplorable,” he said.

“I wonder if he thought that about the fact that the Clinton campaign had sought when it’s completely corroborated, it’s uncontested, that (the) Steele dossier who is utilising both supposedly assets that a former British spy had in Russia to get information on the president then candidate. Was that not foreign interference? Was that not an attempt for foreign interference?” he asked.

The Steele dossier is a private intelligence document pertaining to alleged misconduct, and co-operation between Trump’s presidential campaign and the Russian government during the 2016 election.

“So you can get on your horse and act haughty and proud about it,

but you know what? Let’s look at what the evidence says. And here’s what the evidence says. There was foreign involvement, but let’s not forget where it originated from. Let’s not forget, and we haven’t even begun to put on our case yet. We still will not begin until, actually, tomorrow morning. But I want you to think about this. Where did that foreign intelligence come from? Foreign information come from?” Sekulow asserted.

“It came from connections from the Federal Bureau of investigation, the number three, whose wife happened to work for Fusion GPS, who happened to be hired by the DNC to happen to do an investigation on Donald Trump,” he argued.

“She didn’t just do it with that Steele dossier, she was also involved with, guess what, Ukraine. We haven’t put our case out, obviously, haven’t begun to, but you should be able to get a sense from what I’m saying right now that this is going to -- you’re going to hear we’re going to rebut and refute and were going to put on affirmative case tomorrow. But that’s just one, just one issue,” he asserted.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the House presentation has been strong, detailed, comprehensive and, at many times, compelling.

“Just drew you right into it. They successfully in advance, preempted just about all of the arguments that the President’s lawyer will make. They anticipated what those arguments would be and they answered them even before the President’s lawyers got there and then they have to do that because they don’t’ get another chance to rebut the way McConnell set out the rules,” he told reporters.

The House managers did an amazing job and set a very high bar which will be difficult for the President’s lawyers to overcome, Schumer asserted.

Referring to the arguments made by his Democratic colleagues from the House, Schumer said the argument was incredible and strong.

“It has become clear that President Trump demanded complete immunity, participated in a blanket obstruction and had absolute defiance,” he said.

“Trump in saying he wanted immunity for everything past, present and future said I’m not a President I’m a king and no one can stop me. Nobody can oversee me. Nobody can put a check on me. That is not America. It what President Trump has demanded and what justifies the House bringing these articles is totally out of sync with the Constitution, the founding fathers and every other impeachment trial,” Schumer said.

“Neither President Andrew Johnson, President Nixon or President Clinton had the gall, the temerity to come close to even asking what President Trump is asking for,” he said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/democrats-conclude-opening-arguments.html
111,26-1-20,Iran condemns ‘inhuman’ US treatment of its nationals,"Iran condemned Saturday what it called the “illegal and inhuman” treatment of its nationals by US border security officers, after reports a student was deported despite having a valid visa.

“Such absolutely discriminatory measures that only happen over people’s race, nationality or religion are against international human rights laws and principles,” foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said.

“These individuals were questioned by America’s border security over their political views and beliefs, and their social media accounts were forcefully entered,” he said in a statement.

US media reported on Monday that an Iranian student headed to a Boston university had his visa cancelled at the airport and was deported by immigration officials.

Tensions have soared between Tehran and Washington since a US drone strike killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad on January 3.

112,26-1-20,Turkey quake kills 22,"Rescue workers raced against time Saturday to find survivors under the rubble after a powerful earthquake claimed 22 lives and left more than 1,000 injured in eastern Turkey.

The magnitude 6.8 quake struck on Friday evening, with its epicentre in the small lakeside town of Sivrice in Elazig province, and was felt in neighbouring countries.

Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said 39 people have been rescued alive from collapsed buildings in Elazig province, with a further 22 people estimated to be trapped under the rubble. He said the death toll had risen to 22.

Among those found alive was a pregnant woman who was rescued 12 hours after the quake hit, state news agency Anadolu said, while an AFP correspondent saw an individual saved 17 hours later.

Nearly 2,000 search and rescue personnel were sent to the region while thousands of beds, blankets and tents have been provided, the Turkish presidency said. The rescue efforts have been taking place in freezing temperatures as wood and plastic were burned to keep crowds warm.

Hundreds of people were anxiously waiting on the other side of police barriers including a man who gave his name as Mustafa.

“I have three relatives in that building: one man, his wife and her mother. They are still under the rubble,” the 40-year-old told AFP.”May God help us, we can do nothing but pray.”I was home during the earthquake. It lasted for so long, it was like a nightmare.

113,26-1-20,Global airline passenger fatalities decline sharply,"Airline passenger fatalities around the globe has declined sharply over the past decade as new research has revealed that the fatalities rate is now one death per 7.9 million passenger boardings, compared to one death per 2.7 million boardings during the period 1998-2007, and one death per 1.3 million boardings during 1988-1997.

The commercial airline fatality risk was one death per 750,000 boardings during 1978-1987, and one death per 350,000 boardings during 1968-1977, said the study published in the journal Transportation Science.

“The worldwide risk of being killed had been dropping by a factor of two every decade,” said study author Arnold Barnett, Professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Sloan School of Management.

“Not only has that continued in the last decade, the (latest) improvement is closer to a factor of three. The pace of improvement has not slackened at all even as flying has gotten ever safer and further gains become harder to achieve,” Barnett said.

The new research also revealed that there is discernible regional variation in airline safety around the world.

Nations housing the lowest-risk airlines are the U.S., the members of the European Union, China, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Israel, showed the results.

The aggregate fatality risk among those nations was one death per 33.1 million passenger boardings during 2008-2017.

For airlines in a second set of countries, which Barnett terms the “advancing” set with an intermediate risk level, the rate is one death per 7.4 million boardings during 2008-2017.

This group -- comprising countries that are generally rapidly industrialising and have recently achieved high overall life expectancy and GDP per capita -- includes many countries in Asia as well as some countries in South America and the Middle East.

For a third and higher-risk set of developing countries, including some in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the death risk during 2008-2017 was one per 1.2 million passenger boardings -- an improvement from one death per 400,000 passenger boardings during 1998-2007.

“The two most conspicuous changes compared to previous decades were sharp improvements in China and in Eastern Europe,” said Barnett.

Overall, the rate of fatalities has declined far faster than public fears about flying,” Barnett said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/global-airline-passenger-fatalities-decline-sharply.html
114,26-1-20,Libya says oil shutdown caused over $255 million in losses,"The closure of Libya’s major oil fields and production facilities has resulted in losses of more than USD 255 million in the six-day period ending January 23, the country’s national oil company said Saturday.

The closures came when powerful tribal groups loyal to military commander Khalifa Hifter earlier this month seized several large export terminals along the eastern coast as well as southern oil fields.

Hifter controls the eastern and much of the southern part of the country.

The moves were meant to challenge Hifter’s adversaries in the west, the UN-backed, but weak rival Government that controls the capital, Tripoli.

The National Oil Corporation, which dominates Libya’s critical oil industry, said its assessment showed that “the illegal shut down of its facilities has resulted in losses of nearly 256.5 million USD until January 23.”

It said oil production has fallen from over 1.2 million barrels a day to 320.154 barrels a day.

“Until January 23, 2020, the cumulative production losses in barrels reached 3,907.318 barrels in six days,” NOC said.

The corporation has sought to reassure Libyans.

It said “fuel is still available in most regions” and that it had “sufficient storage in Central and Eastern regions.”

The closure was seen as part of Hifter’s efforts to take control of Tripoli and punish his adversaries there for sealing security and maritime agreements with Turkey, opening doors for unlimited military support from the Turks.

Oil, the lifeline of Libya’s economy, has long been a key factor in the civil war, as rival authorities jostle for control of oil fields and state revenue.

Libya has the ninth largest known oil reserves in the world and the biggest oil reserves in Africa.

The closure “almost certainly was meant to remind foreign states that Hifter retains control over the country’s oil and gas facilities, which generate almost all the country’s income, even as he enjoys no access to the revenues, which accrue to his Tripoli rivals,” the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, said in a report earlier this week.

“His message: the conflict must be resolved in a manner that reflects the actual power balance on the ground, which he views as being squarely in his favour,” the report said.

The closure came just two days before world powers with interests in Libya’s long-running conflict pledged in a summit in Berlin to respect a much-violated arms embargo and push opposing factions to reach a truce.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/libya-says-oil-shutdown-caused-over--255-million-in-losses.html

117,26-1-20,"Brexit to help global growth, says Lagarde","European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said global growth is likely to get a boost from abating uncertainties on trade issues in the wake of new pacts being signed.

Speaking here at a session on the global economic outlook on the last day of the WEF 2020 on Friday, the former IMF chief said uncertainties have abated on issues like trade and Brexit, and it is likely that income growth and low unemployment will eventually be reflected in prices.

“Trade has been dramatically low recently and didn’t help growth much. So we are delighted to see trade agreements being negotiated and completed. I believe this will remove uncertainties the world over,” she said.

“ I think the distribution of benefits and costs as a result of trade diversion remains to be seen because it is not going to be win-all arrangements.

“There will be some downside effect and we at ECB are measuring where the chips will fall and who will lose out of that re-diversion under the various agreements,” she said.

In the same session, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said trade negotiations have started with both the EU and the UK and we look forward to completing both of those deals this year.

The US also expects the second phase of negotiations for a trade deal with China to begin soon.

118,26-1-20,"FPIs pour in Rs 1,624 cr in January so far as US-China trade deal boosts sentiment","Foreign portfolio investors (FPI) have infused a net sum of Rs 1,624 crore into the Indian capital markets in January so far, buoyed by the signing of the first phase of the US-China trade deal.

As per latest depositories data, FPIs invested a net Rs 13,304 crore in equities and withdrew a net Rs 11,680 crore from the debt segment between January 1-24. This translates into a total net inflow of Rs 1,624 crore.

""After starting the year on a muted note, investments from FPIs has picked up pace and most of that flows came after US and China signed a trade deal putting the trade war between them on a pause,"" said Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research at Morningstar Investment Adviser India.

The latest investments came despite challenges such as enhanced geopolitical tension between the US and Iran and dwindling domestic economic growth, Srivastava noted.

On the domestic front, ""there are some signs of India shaking away the slowdown with business activity picking up and this is reflecting in the investments coming into equities. Besides, after the limit to which FPIs can invest in debt instruments has been increased, more inflows into the debt category can be expected,"" said Harsh Jain, co-founder and COO at Groww.

The Reserve Bank of India on Thursday raised the investment limit for FPIs in government and corporate bonds, a move that is likely to bring in more foreign funds in the country.

According to the current norms, short-term investments by an FPI should not exceed 20 per cent of the total investment of that FPI in either central government securities (including treasury bills) or state development loans.

The same norms are applicable on investments in corporate bonds.

The short-term investment limit has now been increased from 20 per cent to 30 per cent in both the cases, the RBI said in a circular.

Additionally, the RBI has also made relaxation in the voluntary retention route (VRR) for FPI investments in debt. The investment cap through VRR has been doubled to Rs 1.5 lakh crore, the RBI said in another circular.

Going forward, ""all eyes will now be on the upcoming Budget to get further cues. This will play major role in terms of shaping up the investment views of foreign investors and decision to invest in the Indian equity markets,"" Srivastava added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fpis-pour-in-rs-1-624-cr-in-january-so-far-as-us-china-trade-deal-boosts-sentiment-2020-01-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/fpis-pour-in-rs-1-624-cr-in-january-so-far-as-us-china-trade-deal-boosts-sentiment.html
119,26-1-20,Hong Kong declares Wuhan virus outbreak an ‘emergency’,"Hong Kong on Saturday declared a new coronavirus outbreak as an “emergency” - the city’s highest warning tier - as authorities ramped up measures to reduce the risk of further infections.

The announcement came as city leader Carrie Lam faced criticism in some quarters over her administration’s response to the crisis.

Of the five people who have tested positive for the virus in Hong Kong so far, four arrived via a newly built high-speed train terminal which connects with the mainland.

That led to calls from some medical experts and politicians to limit, or even halt, arrivals from China, the epicentre of the outbreak with 41 people dead.

Lam held emergency meetings with health officials on Saturday morning after returning from Davos.

“Today I declare the lifting of the response level to emergency,” she told reporters.

Schools and universities, which are currently on a Lunar New Year break, would remain closed until 17 February, Lam said.

All mainland arrivals to Hong Kong will now need to sign health declaration forms, she added, while public events including a new year gala and next month’s marathon, would also be called off.

“We haven’t seen serious and widespread infections (in Hong Kong), but we are taking this seriously and we hope to be ahead of the epidemic,” Lam said.

Ho Pak Leung, a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong, said closing the mainland border would be the “single most effective measure” in containing the virus.

Transport links with the mainland should be re-opened “when the epidemic is controlled, when HK officials are awake, when there are enough masks and hand rubs for all Hong Kong citizens,” he wrote on his Facebook page.

Hong Kong has a recent experience of deadly viral outbreaks.-Nearly 300 people were killed by SARS in 2003, a tragedy that left a profound psychological impact on one of the most densely populated places on earth.

The city’s ability to combat the crisis was hampered by moves in mainland China to cover up and play down the outbreak, leaving a lasting legacy of distrust among many Hong Kongers.

Animosity towards the mainland has intensified in recent years as Beijing tightens political control over the semi-autonomous territory.

The outbreak also comes at a sensitive time for Lam, who has record low approval ratings after seven months of pro-democracy protests.

“We must stand united so that we can prevent and control the disease,” she said, in a nod to the political unrest.

The often violent protests have battered Hong Kong’s reputation for stability and helped tip it into recession, with the recent virus outbreak compounding the city’s economic woes. Hospitals are already struggling with the winter flu season, but officials are isolating anyone with a history of travel to central China and those exhibiting respiratory tract infections that look similar to the virus.

So far some 300 people have been tested and monitored for the virus.

Quarantine centres have been set up in remote holiday parks for anyone found to have come into close contact with people who tested positive.

On Saturday, officials announced a newly built but still-empty public housing block would be used for medical staff on the frontline who did not want to risk returning to their families.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/hong-kong-declares-wuhan-virus-outbreak-an----emergency---.html
120,26-1-20,‘Nobody can leave’: Trapped Wuhan residents stock up,"Police at a roadblock on the outskirts of Wuhan turned away cars trying to leave the virus-stricken city on Saturday, as other anxious residents trapped inside spent the Lunar New Year stocking up on masks and medical supplies.

Authorities have prevented anyone from leaving Wuhan, the city of 11 million people at the heart of the viral outbreak which has so far infected nearly 1,300 people and killed 41 others.

AFP saw a steady trickle of cars approaching the roadblocks around 20 kilometres (12 miles) east of the city centre on Saturday morning, only for police in fluorescent jackets wearing masks to tell them to turn around.

The barricade, at one of the tolls for highways exiting the city, was blocked with red and yellow plastic barriers and cones.

“Nobody can leave,” a policeman told AFP.

A stray dog ran across the empty road in front of the roadblocks, which were shrouded in grey fog and drizzle.

AFP journalists only saw two vehicles allowed to pass the roadblock, including a white van which an officer said was “buying medicines” and would later return to the city.

Authorities extended transport bans to 17 other cities around Wuhan in a gargantuan effort to control the SARS-like virus, restricting travel for around 56 million in Hubei province.

While there are restrictions on anyone leaving Wuhan, a few people were allowed to enter the city through the barricade: Desperately needed medical workers whose holidays were cut short to help overwhelmed hospital.

121,26-1-20,China to build 2nd new hospital to treat coronavirus cases,"China on Saturday announced plans to build a second hospital within half a month to treat more cases of the deadly coronavirus as the fast spreading virus continues to wreak havoc in the country and abroad with 41 people dead and more than 1,300 infected, dampening the Chinese New Year celebrations.

The confirmed cases for the first time crossed the 1,000 mark and rose sharply to 1,287 as of Friday with 237 people in critical condition battling for their lives in China, the National Health Commission said on Saturday.

Almost all provinces, including Beijing, are reporting steady rise in the number of cases mostly of people who travelled from Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.

The pneumonia situation had resulted in 41 deaths, including 39 in central China’s Hubei province and one in north-eastern province Heilongjiang, the health commission said on Saturday.

Additionally, a total of 1,965 suspected cases have also been reported, it said.

China on Saturday said it will build another 1,300 bed makeshift hospital in Wuhan in the next 15 days in addition to the 1,000 bed hospital being built in the city in 10 days, state-run People’s Daily reported.

The feverish pace at which the hospitals are being built indicate that China apparently is preparing to treat far more patients considering the speed at which the virus is spreading.

The virus has spread to Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Nepal, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and the United States as of Thursday.

Japan on Friday reported a second confirmed case.

A chinese doctor reportedly died of the novel coronavirus on Saturday morning, the first fatality among health workers since the pneumonia-like illness first surfaced in late December, state-run China Daily quoted online news website Paper.Cn as saying.

Liang Wudong, a 62-year-old doctor with the otolaryngology department who treats conditions in the ear, nose and throat at Hubei Xinhua Hospital, was suspected of contracting the new virus on January 16. The hospital that he works is in Wuhan.

On Jan 18, he was transferred to Hubei Jinyintan Hospital, which has received the majority of infected patients, and died at about 7 am on Saturday, the report said.

Feng was brought to Nishtar Hospital on Friday night, National Institute of Health officials said.

“One suspected case is admitted in isolation in Multan right now. His clinical condition is stable and it does not seem to be a case of novel coronavirus. Relevant samples have been taken,” the NIH said.

Earlier this week, Pakistan setup counters at the airports to screen passengers coming from China for coronavirus.

Thousands of Chinese nationals work in Pakistan on various projects including under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Many Pakistan students study in China.

Foreign Office Spokesperson Aisha Farooqui said there were approximately 28,000 Pakistani students all over China. “In Wuhan alone, there are close to 500 Pakistani students,” she said, adding that around 1,500 traders from Pakistan travel to China frequently.

The death toll due to the coronavirus rose to 41 in China with 1,287 confirmed cases, China’s National Health Commission announced on Saturday. Of the confirmed cases, the condition of the 237 persons is critical.

127,26-1-20,"People who struggled for ensuring poll victory must be recognised, rewarded by Raj govt: Pilot","Hailing the setting up of a coordination panel by the Congress in Rajasthan as a ""good move"", Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot on Sunday said people who struggled for ensuring victory in polls must be made to feel a valuable part of the ruling dispensation as sometimes one tends to take the party organisation for granted after governments are formed.

Pilot also asserted that the seven crore people of Rajasthan had reposed their faith in and voted for the Congress party, and it was only after that the party decided who will be chief minister, deputy CM and ministers.

His remarks come following criticism of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot's handling of the Kota infant deaths issue and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi forming coordination and manifesto implementation committees in Rajasthan and other Congress-ruled states to ensure smooth working of the party and government in tandem.

In an interview to PTI, Pilot, who last week completed six years as president of the Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee and is the longest serving chief of the state unit, said that as part of the government and the RPCC head, it is his responsibility to ensure that the hard labour of party workers is recognised and they are rewarded for their efforts in bringing the party back to power.

""My years of struggle in opposition as party president helped form a special bond with people across the state -- it's my life's biggest asset,"" he said.

The Deputy Chief Minister, who has consistently emphasised that the government must reach out to people, also asserted that accountability needs to be fixed and corrective measures taken in the cases such as the one in which more than 100 infants died in a government hospital at Kota, so that such tragic incidents are not repeated.

""We should not politicise these issues. Good governance comes from ensuring responsibility and fixing accountability, doing that will at least ensure that there is no repetition of such tragedies and corrective measures are taken immediately,"" Pilot said.

Such issues must be dealt with a lot of compassion and empathy and people must feel confident that there are measures in place that such tragedies don't happen again, he said.

Pilot had earlier said the government could have shown more compassion in the matter and he also met parents of some of the deceased children in Kota.

Asked about the setting up of the coordination and manifesto implementation committees, Pilot said, ""I think it is a good move. The Congress workers, the party cadre, the people who have really struggled and won the elections, their stakeholdership, their contribution (must be acknowledged), and they must feel that they are a valuable part of the government.""

The move will certainly give a lot of confidence to grassroots workers, the 42-year-old leader said.

On whether it will enhance the voice of the organisation in the government, he said, ""When you are in opposition, the party is of paramount importance. When you are part of the government, sometimes we tend to take the party for granted which shouldn't be the case.""

All those who worked to put the party in power need appreciation and respect, said Pilot, who is widely credited for the turnaround of the party and its return to power after having been reduced to just 21 seats in the previous assembly following five years of the previous Gehlot government.

""I think the objective (of the committees) is to have a more smoothened process so that people discuss things thoroughly and the government also works in line with what the party wants and what the manifesto states. So there are two committees. I think both will have positive results in delivering governance on the ground,"" he said.

Avinash Pandey, party in-charge for Rajasthan Congress, will head the coordination committee which has Chief Minister Gehlot, Pilot, ministers Master Bhanwar Lal Meghwal, Harish Chaudhary, former speaker Deepender Singh Shekhawat, along with former ministers Hema Ram Chaudhary and Mahendrajit Malviya.

Chhattisgarh minister Tamradhwaj Sahu has been made the chairman of the manifesto implementation panel for Rajasthan.

Asked whether he was ready for another term as the state party chief, Pilot said he is always ready for any responsibility given to him and to discharge it with utmost sincerity and honesty.

On maintaining a balance between his role in the government and as RPCC chief, he said, ""Once I set a goal for myself, I go all out to achieve it. I am looking after rural development, panchayati raj and they mostly impact rural population and agrarian communities and so we've ensured that budgets are enhanced, schemes reach the remotest parts and strict oversight is maintained.""

He also highlighted that the party recently won three-fourths of the posts in local body polls with people rewarding hard work.

Talking about the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests and the Rajasthan Assembly passing a resolution against the law, Pilot said it is everyone's right to uphold whatever they feel is wrong.

""Parliament has passed a law because the government of India has a majority in Parliament, but that does not mean that it will necessarily meet legal sanction from the Supreme Court,"" Pilot said.

Ultimate decision stands with the Supreme Court on the legality of the Act but every individual has the right to oppose and the government can alter, withdraw or change the law as it deems fit, he said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/people-who-struggled-for-ensuring-poll-victory-must-be-recognised--rewarded-by-raj-govt--pilot-2020-01-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/people-who-struggled-for-ensuring-poll-victory-must-be-recognised--rewarded-by-raj-govt--pilot.html

Greeting the people on the occasion of 71st Republic Day, he said the soul of the Constitution lies in the freedoms guaranteed in part three of the document.

These freedoms were given by the people unto themselves and no government can take them away, the former home minister said in a series of tweets.

""Remember that today as we think of the 70 lakh people of the Kashmir valley whose freedoms have been taken away, including those in custody for over six months without charges. Add to that the outrageous charges, including sedition, slapped against hundreds of protesters by the authoritarian government,"" he said.

Among those still in custody in Kashmir are former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti, Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar.

""As long as freedoms are denied to any part of the people, the whole of the population is denied freedom,"" Chidambaram tweeted, adding, ""As we raise the flag today, let us also raise the level of protest.""

Besides Delhi, protests have unfolded in several parts of the country against the amended Citizenship Act since it was passed in Parliament on December 11 and have led to clashes at several places.

According to the amended law, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 due to religious persecution there will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/let-us-raise-level-of-protests--says-chidambaram-on-republic-day-2020-01-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/let-us-raise-level-of-protests--says-chidambaram-on-republic-day.html

131,26-1-20,"Coco Gauff, 15, crashes out in tears at Australian Open","Coco Gauff's bid for history at the Australian Open ended in tears in the last 16 on Sunday as the 15-year-old crashed out in three sets to fellow American Sofia Kenin.

The 14th seed Kenin recovered from a set down to win convincingly 6-7 (5/7), 6-3, 6-0 and Gauff left the court crying.

Kenin plays Tunisia's unseeded Ons Jabeur after she defeated China's Wang Qiang to become the first Arab woman to reach a Grand Slam quarter-final.

""I just did the best I can. I just tried to take it like any other match,"" said Kenin, who also had tears in her eyes afterwards.

""I know she's (Gauff) playing well, I just tried to play my game and fight for every point and just not focus on anything else.""

Gauff, the youngest player in the draw, has been one of the stories of the Australian Open, beating Venus Williams in the first round and then stunning reigning champion Naomi Osaka in round three.

The supremely talented teenager, who turns 16 in March, was attempting to become the youngest player to win a Grand Slam in the Open Era, which began in 1968. The current record-holder is Martina Hingis, who triumphed at the 1997 Australian Open at 16 years old and nearly four months.

Gauff was under the cosh immediately against Kenin, the 21-year-old breaking in the first game at Melbourne Arena and comfortably holding for a swift 2-0 lead.

There was no mistaking who the crowd wanted to win -- each point for Gauff greeted with cheers and screams; there was only polite applause for Moscow-born Kenin.

The 67th-ranked Gauff recovered to gain parity for 4-4 and they went to the tie-break after Kenin saved set point.

Gauff then stepped it up a gear in the tie-break -- aided by two Kenin double-faults -- to take the first set in 58 minutes.

Kenin ramps up pressure

The younger American's serve is powerful but she was totting up the double faults, her seventh of the match offering Kenin a second break point with the latter 2-1 up.

A resurgent Kenin -- the determination etched on her face -- broke at the third time lucky to lead 3-1, triggering a rare show of anger from the teenager.

Kenin took the second set in 38 minutes and carried the momentum into the deciding set, breaking Gauff to love in the opening game and racing towards victory.

Touted as heir apparent to Serena Williams, Gauff burst onto the scene when she beat Venus Williams in the Wimbledon first round last year on her Grand Slam debut.

She went out in the fourth round to eventual champion Simona Halep, but a star was born.

Gauff lost to then-number one Osaka in the third round at the US Open, but got her revenge at the same stage in Melbourne, more evidence of her huge potential.

That made Gauff the youngest player to defeat a reigning Australian Open champion in the Open Era.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coco-gauff--15--crashes-out-in-tears-at-australian-open-2020-01-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/coco-gauff--15--crashes-out-in-tears-at-australian-open.html

Wearing his traditional kurta pajama and jacket, Modi paid homage to the fallen soldiers at the newly-built National War Memorial here on the Republic Day for the first time instead of the Amar Jawan Jyoti beneath the India Gate arch.

Bandhej is a print developed using tie and dye method practiced mainly in states of Rajasthan and Gujarat.

Turbans have been a highlight of the prime minister's sartorial choices at Independence Day and Republic Day events.

Modi had sported a multi-coloured turban when he gave his sixth Independence Day speech from the rampants of the Red Fort last year after securing a second term.

For his maiden Independence Day address as the prime minister in 2014, Modi had opted for a Jodhpuri bandhej turban in bright red colour with green at the tail.

A yellow turban covered with criss-crossed lines in different shades of the same colour, along with a few in red and deep green, marked his 2015 look, and he chose a tie and dye turban in hues of pink and yellow for his appearance at the Red Fort in 2016.

The prime minister's turban for 2017 was a mix of bright red and yellow with criss-crossed golden lines all over it followed by a saffron turban the previous year.

From bright red bandhni turban from Kutch to mustard Rajasthani 'safa', the prime minister has sported varied turbans at his Republic Day appearances too.

In 2019, he had worn a yellowish orange headgear with a red tail on the Republic Day.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pm-modi-continues--safa--tradition--sports-saffron--bandhej--turban-on-71st-republic-day-2020-01-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/pm-modi-continues--safa--tradition--sports-saffron--bandhej--turban-on-71st-republic-day.html

They said around 30 students, all minors, were attending classes at the coaching centre when the two upper floors of the four-storey building collapsed, trapping them under the debris.

The fourth floor of the building was under construction and did not have a roof, the officials said.

The fire department received a call around 4.30 pm, following which seven fire tenders were rushed to the spot, the officials said.

The area has very narrow lanes and rescuers struggled to get access to the building.

Thirteen people, including minor students, have been shifted to Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, they said, adding that Umesh Kashyap, the owner of the building, is also among the dead.

During the rescue operation, all the persons found under the rubble were shifted to hospitals, police said.

Arif Sultan, the father of one of the deceased, identified as Farhan Sultan (6), said, ""My son was studying on the second floor along with 10 to 15 other students. My daughter, who was in eighth standard called me and informed about the incident. I rushed to the spot and climbed the stairs. I took out my child by myself after around one-and-a-half hour. He was not breathing. We took him to the hospital where he was declared brought dead.""

Laxmi, the mother of deceased Krishna and injured Nitin, said, ""My children were studying there from past six months.

136,26-1-20,"Four explosions rock Assam, no casualty reported","Four powerful explosions - three in Dibrugarh and one in Charaideo districts - rocked Upper Assam on Sunday morning, as the country celebrated its 71st Republic Day.

All four blasts occured in a span of 10 minutes - between 8.15 and 8.25 am, a police officer said.

There has been no report of any casualty, as Republic Day being a holiday, people were mostly indoors, he said.

The first blast was reported outside a shop at Teokghat in Sonari police station area of Charaideo district.

Three explosions followed soon after in Dibrugarh district - two at Graham Bazar and AT Road, beside a gurudwara, and another at the oil town of Duliajan Tiniali, just 100 metres from the local police station, Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Padmanabh Barua told PTI.

CCTV footages available at Duliajan Tiniali showed two motorcycle-borne youths lobbed a grenade and sped away, the ASP explained.

The blasts at Graham Bazar and AT Road were carried out with time-induced Improvised Explosive Devices, he stated.

Senior police officers have rushed to the site of the explosions and a probe has been initiated, Barua added.

According to sources, the explosions were suspected to be the handiwork of the ULFA(Independent), but nothing has been established as yet.

The ULFA(I), along with several other proscribed outfits in the Northeast, had called for a boycott of the Republic Day celebrations.

Taking to Twitter, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal condemned the blasts and vowed to take strong action against the culprits.

""Strongly condemn the bomb blasts in a few places of Assam. This cowardly attempt to create terror on a sacred day only exhibits the frustration of the terror groups after their total rejection by the people. Our Govt will take the sternest action to bring the culprits to book,"" he tweeted.

The iconic memorial in the India Gate complex behind the canopy was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 25 last year.

Amar Jawan Jyoti is symbolised by an inverted bayonet and soldier's helmet over it with an eternal flame burning beside it. It was built in 1972 underneath the India Gate arch to commemorate soldiers martyred in the Indo-Pak War of 1971.

Spread over an area of approximately 40 acres, National War Memorial comprises four concentric circles, namely -- the 'Amar Chakra', 'Veerta Chakra', 'Tyag Chakra' and the 'Rakshak Chakra' with names of 25,942 soldiers inscribed in golden letters on granite tablets.

It also includes a central 15.5-m obelisk, an eternal flame and six bronze murals depicting famous battles fought by the Indian Army, Air Force and the Navy in a covered gallery (Veerta Chakra).

The memorial is dedicated to soldiers killed during the Indo-China War in 1962, Indo-Pak Wars in 1947, 1965 and 1971, Indian Peace Keeping Force Operations in Sri Lanka and in the Kargil Conflict in 1999, and also those in the UN peacekeeping missions.

The 42 m-high India Gate was built during the British Raj as the All India War Memorial Arch to honour the soldiers who died in the First World War (1914-1918) and the Third Anglo-Afghan War (1919).

138,26-1-20,European Parliament to debate on anti-CAA resolution,"The European Parliament is set to debate and vote on a resolution tabled by some of its members against India's Citizenship Amendment Act, which it says marks a “dangerous shift” in the country's citizenship regime.

The resolution, tabled by the European United Left/Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) Group in the Parliament earlier this week, is set to be debated next Wednesday and voted on the day after.

It makes a reference to the Charter of the United Nations, Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) as well as the India-EU Strategic Partnership Joint Action Plan signed in November 2005, and to the EU-India Thematic Dialogue on Human Rights as it urges the Indian authorities to ""engage constructively"" with those protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and consider their demands to repeal the ""discriminatory CAA"".

""The CAA marks a dangerous shift in the way citizenship will be determined in India and is set to create the largest statelessness crisis in the world and cause immense human suffering,"" it notes.

""Instead of addressing the concerns, offering corrective action, calling for security forces to act with restraint and ensuring accountability, many government leaders have been engaging in efforts to discredit, rebuke and threaten the protesters,"" the resolution states.

The CAA came into force in India last December amid protests in India and around the world.

The Indian government has stressed that the new Act does not deny any citizenship rights but has been brought in to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries and provide them citizenship.

As background, the resolution sets out that since the May 2019 election, the government of India has “reinforced its nationalistic orientation” as it also makes a reference to the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, which removed the special constitutional status of the region.

The draft resolution, which falls under the category of “Resolutions on topical subjects”, expresses deep concern that India has “created the legal grounds to strip millions of Muslims of the fundamental right of equal access to citizenship” and that the CAA could be used, along with the National Register of Citizens, to “render many Muslim citizens stateless”.

It seeks to remind the Indian government of its obligations under the 1992 UN Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, which establishes the obligation of countries to protect the existence and identity of religious minorities within their territories and to adopt appropriate measures to ensure that this is achieved.

Such a resolution, which has been characterised under the “Relations with Asian countries” section by the economic bloc, are used as a basis for engagement of EU member countries with specific nations.

If it is passed next week, it will be formally sent to the Indian government and Parliament as well as to the European Commission chiefs.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/european-parliament-to-debate-on-anti-caa-resolution-2020-01-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/european-parliament-to-debate-on-anti-caa-resolution.html

""Rhinitis is associated with asthma, which is closely linked to air pollution. That is why we thought it would be interesting to investigate whether long-term exposure to air pollution also plays a determining role in rhinitis,"" said study researcher Benedicte Jacquemi from Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) in Spain.

For the findings, published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, researchers analysed data from 1,408 patients with rhinitis from 17 different European cities, including Barcelona and Oviedo (Spain), Paris (France), Antwerp (Belgium), Umea (Sweden) and Erfurt (Germany).

The participants answered a questionnaire regarding the severity of each one of their rhinitis symptoms and the extent to which the condition interferes with their day-to-day lives.

According to the researchers, airborne particles, the diameter of which can vary from micrometres to millimetres, are solid or liquid bodies present in the air. Particles with a diameter under 2.5 (PM2.5) and under ten micrometres (PM10) are of particular interest in this context.

As the study shows, people living in cities with higher levels of PM10 and PM2.5 report the most severe rhinitis symptoms. An increase of 5 ï¿½g/m3 in PM2.5 was associated with a 17 per cent higher probability of severe rhinitis.

These particles were associated with increased severity of congestion, nasal irritation and sneezing, whereas exposure to NO2 increased the severity of nasal discharge and congestion, the study said.

Airborne particulate matter and NO2 are both traffic-related pollutants.

""The role of these pollutants in the severity of symptoms is probably linked to oxidative stress, apoptosis (a process by which irreparably damaged cells are eliminated) and inflammation,"" said study lead author Emilie Burte.

""Our findings suggest that the effect of airborne particulate matter differs from that of gaseous emissions (NO2), probably because their respective mechanisms of action provoke different inflammatory responses in the respiratory tract; however, more studies are needed to validate this hypothesis,"" Burt added.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/air-pollution-linked-to-more-severe-rhinitis-symptoms-2020-01-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/air-pollution-linked-to-more-severe-rhinitis-symptoms.html
141,26-1-20,"Daily yoghurt intake may reduce risk of breast cancer, scientists say","Consuming natural yoghurt on a daily basis may reduce the risk of breast cancer, according to a new study which says the probiotic supplement may help replace harmful inflammation-causing bacteria with beneficial microbes present in the food.

Researchers, including those from Lancaster University in the UK, said their idea -- as yet unproven -- is supported by the available evidence that bacterial induced inflammation is linked to cancer.

According to the study, published in the journal Medical Hypothesis, bacteria induced inflammation in breast ducts disturbs undeveloped cells, or stem cells, waiting to mature into specialised ones, and may be a cause of breast cancer.

""There is a simple, inexpensive potential preventive remedy, which is for women to consume natural yoghurt on a daily basis,"" said study co-author Auday Marwaha from Lancaster University.

According to the research team, the lactose fermenting beneficial bacteria, or microflora, commonly found in yoghurt, is similar to those found in the breasts of mothers who have breastfed.

""We now know that breast milk is not sterile and that lactation alters the microflora of the breast,"" said Rachael Rigby, study co-author from Lancaster University.

""Lactose fermenting bacteria are commonly found in milk and are likely to occupy the breast ducts of women during lactation and for an unknown period after lactation,"" she added.

The researchers believe these bacteria in the breast may be protective since earlier studies had reported that each year of breast feeding reduced the risk of breast cancer by nearly 5 per cent.

A similar effect seen in yoghurt, the scientists said, may be due to the displacement of harmful bacteria by beneficial bacteria.

""The stem cells which divide to replenish the lining of the breast ducts are influenced by the microflora, and certain components of the microflora have been shown in other organs, such as the colon and stomach, to increase the risk of cancer development,"" the researchers noted.

""Therefore a similar scenario is likely to be occurring in the breast, whereby resident microflora impact on stem cell division and influence cancer risk,"" they concluded.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/daily-yoghurt-intake-may-reduce-risk-of-breast-cancer--scientists-say-2020-01-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/daily-yoghurt-intake-may-reduce-risk-of-breast-cancer--scientists-say.html

146,26-1-20,5 die in coaching centre collapse,"4-storey Bhajanpura building in N-E Delhi caves in, 10 injured

A four-storey building housing a coaching centre collapsed in Northeast Delhi’s Bhajanpura on Saturday evening, killing five people, including four students, and injuring 10 others. Around 30 minor students were attending classes on the first two floors of the coaching institute, when the roofs of the upper two floors caved in, trapping the students under debris, officials said.

The deceased have been identified as Kirti (10), Deeshu (14), Krishna Bharti (9), Farhan (6), all students, and Umesh (30). They were declared brought dead at the Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) Hospital. Deceased Umesh was the younger brother of Shankar, who owns the building and runs the coaching centre.

“The fourth floor of the building was under construction when suddenly the upper two floors of the building collapsed. Some of the students were rescued by locals, while 13 others were rescued by the fire department and police,” a senior DFS official said, adding a call regarding the tragedy was received at 4.30pm.

Laxmi, the mother of deceased Krishna and injured Nitin, said, “My children were studying there for the past six months. They should not have moved them to the third floor as we heard from locals that the construction material was stored there. I lost my son Krishna and Nitin is injured. He is admitted to the GTB hospital.”

Arif Sultan, father of deceased Farhan, said, “My daughter who is in Class VIII called me to inform about the incident. I rushed to the spot. I climb up the stair and I myself took out my child from the debris after around one and a half hours. He was not breathing. We took him to hospital where he was declared brought dead.”

Taking note of the incident, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted: “Receiving bad news from Bhajanpura. Praying to God for everyone’s safety. I will reach the spot soon.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/5-die-in-coaching-centre-collapse-2020-01-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/5-die-in-coaching-centre-collapse.html
147,26-1-20,9 honoured with Shaurya Chakra,"Nine personnel, six from the Army and three from Central Paramilitary Forces (CAPF), were awarded Shaurya Chakra, the third highest peacetime gallantry medal, on the occasion of the Republic Day. In all, the President approved 409 Gallantry and other defence decorations for the armed forces personnel.

Squadron Leaders Siddharth Vashisht and Ninad Mandavgane, pilots of Indian Air Force (IAF) Mi-17 helicopter that was accidentally shot down in Budgam on February 27 last year, were posthumously awarded Vayu Sena Medal (Gallantry). Last October, IAF Chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria acknowledged the helicopter crash was a case of friendly fire and was a “big mistake.”

On the morning of February 27, as fighters jets of India and Pakistan were engaged in a dogfight over Naushera sector, a day after the Balakot air strike, the Mi-17 crashed in Budgam shortly after take-off from Srinagar killing all six personnel onboard and one civilian on the ground. The Court of Inquiry ordered to investigate the crash confirmed that it was shot by Israeli origin ground based Spyder surface to air missile system of the IAF.

The Air Chief Marshal had also said disciplinary action will be taken action against two officers involved and those who lost their lives will be declared battle casualties.

Meanwhile, the overall list of awardees include nine Shaurya Chakras, 28 Param Vishisht Seva Medals(PVSM), four Uttam Yudh Seva Medals, 53 Ati Vishisht Seva Medals (AVSM), 10 Yudh Seva Medals, 123 Vishisht Seva Medals, four Bar to Sena Medals (Gallantry), 107 Sena Medals (Gallantry), five Nao Sena Medals (Gallantry), four Vayu Sena Medals (Gallantry), four Bar to Sena Medals (Devotion to Duty), 36 Sena Medals (Devotion to Duty), eight Nao Sena Medals (Devotion to Duty), one Bar to Vayu Sena Medal (Devotion to Duty) and 13 Vayu Sena Medals (Devotion to Duty).

While two officers including Lama and Bam Bijendra Singh were given the medal for their actions against militants in Manipur, the remaining awards were given to personnel for gallantry in Jammu & Kashmir last year. Northern Command chief Lt General Ranbir Singh was awarded the Param Vishisht Seva Medal(PVSM).

Lieutenant Colonel Jyoti Lama created a vibrant intelligence network in Manipur and after meticulous planning relentlessly led his team in apprehending fourteen hardcore terrorists.

Naib Subedar Sombir was posthumously awarded the Shaurya Chakra. He was killed during an encounter with terrorists in Jammu & Kashmir in February last year. During the encounter, three hardcore terrorists were killed. One of them was a foreigner and an ‘A++’ category terrorist, and he was shot down by Sombir in a close quarter battle.

Major Bijendra Singh led a team through dense jungles and when pinned down by hostile fire from militants in Manipur dashed towards them and in the ensuing firefight killed two militants.

Naib Subedar Narender Singh, while deployed on the Line of Control(LOC), detected a team of infiltrators and chased them. In the close quarter battle, he managed to kill two militants.

Naik Naresh Kumar, while deployed in a village in Jammu and Kashmir, came under heavy fire and sensing grave danger to his team led the assault killing one category A+ + militant.

Sepoy Karamdeo Oraon’s post on the LoC came under heavy fire from the enemy posts across the border. Some terrorists were also firing and in an effort to discourage them, the soldier took action and was hit in the chest and leg. Unmindful of this, he rushed out of his bunker and fired at the terrorists killing two of them. He returned to the post and kept firing his light machine gun thereby averting danger to his post.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/9-honoured-with-shaurya-chakra.html

“A petition has been filed under Article 32 for judicial review of the manner of rejection of the mercy petition in terms of the judgment of the SC in Shatrughan Chauhan case,” said Vrinda Grover, who is representing Mukesh.

Earlier, a Delhi court rejected charge that Tihar jail didn’t hand over documents to convicts to file mercy pleas.

The court said no further directions were required on a plea by the lawyer of the death row convicts in the case alleging the prison authorities were not handing over certain documents required to file mercy and curative petitions, and disposed of the petition.

Additional Sessions Judge Ajay Kumar Jain said the convicts’ lawyer can take pictures of the relevant documents, notebook and paintings or sketches from the Tihar jail authorities.

The court noted that the jail authorities had already complied with the request made by the convicts by supplying the documents whatever was lying with them.

The warrant for execution of death sentence for the four convicts has been fixed on February 1 at 6 am.

Mukesh had moved the mercy petition after the Supreme Court had dismissed his curative petition against his conviction and death sentence.

Along with his, the apex court had also rejected the curative petition of another death row convict Akshay Kumar (31).

Other two convicts Pawan Gupta (25) and Vinay Kumar Sharma are yet to file curative petitions before the Supreme Court.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/nirbhaya-convict-moves-sc-against----no----to-mercy-plea.html

151,26-1-20,Interesting ode to comeback women,"panga *ing: Kangana Ranaut, Jassie Gill, Richa Chadda, Neena Gupta, Yo Yo Honey Singh

Rated: 8/10

Panga is an ode to comebacks after motherhood and to women who give up blossoming careers, celebrityhood and presence to nurse their children and families. Tat their is a disclaimer that it is a purely fictitious story, takes away the mirth attached to sporting movies. But having said that, Kangana kind of glides into the role of a yesteryear kabbadi captain now engrossed in raising her cute child and cuter husband, at the expense of the international kabaddi mat and a career all her own. She makes the movie and her character entirely believable though you might want to credit director Ashwini Iyer for not even once playing to the gallery.

The movie and its music comes with a Dangal kind of rustic influence though this is Bhopal not Haryana that the action is centred around. The film holds on to the chords of sensitivity not just for the woman who gave it all up for her premature child but also for the gentle relationship she has with her husband and the scenario from where she is drawn out to dream again, to perform again, this time against all odds.

The pace of the movie is slow and steady and despite the fear of it getting hijacked by ennui, Iyer keeps her calm and let’s the proceedings fall out of the home and the stadium without much of a fuss. Richa Chadda as Kangana’s friend and co-player now turned coach, is a breeze adding interesting moments to the film whenever it starts to flag. However, the role of this straight speaking Haryanvi girl, is slim in the film and that makes you yearn for some more flesh on her being than the footage permits.

Same is the story with Neena Gupta who could have been much more than a laddoo-making nani she is reduced to being in the film. a word about Jassie Gill. He is cool as the side spouse. It is Kangana all the way to yet another performance of the day.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/interesting-ode-to-comeback-women-2020-01-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/interesting-ode-to-comeback-women.html

If one is looking for a story that is a little beyond dancing, love thy neighbour and how one think of others and their plight, then Street Dancer 3D is not the film that will hold one’s attention for long. But this doesn’t mean that the movie has nothing to offer.

There is some great dancing. Those who are far removed from this art form, it will amaze them no end to where dancing stands today — from flips to head spins that will spin your head to break dance steps that one would have thought would actually break bones.

Then there is the music and songs. It is a film of dance, so yes, there are some noteworthy music and songs that will remain with you till the next chartbuster is released.

Then there is Varun Dhawan, Shraddha Kapoor and Nora Fetehi. It goes without saying Varun Dhawan is a great dancer. he is most certainly give Tiger Shroff a run for his moves. Nora Fatehi is fantastic. But the surprise here is Shraddha Kapoor. Her size zero and moves are truly great. Efforts of choreographer Rahul Shetty needs to be lauded.

The icing on the cake is the presence of Prabhu Deva all through. Usually his appearance is in bits and pieces and only a few dance moves. There is a treat waiting for all those who are his fans and love the way he dances.

153,26-1-20,Trump's Mideast peace plan will be 'historic': Netanyahu,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday said he expected US President Donald Trump's peace plan for the Middle East to be ""historic"" ahead of a trip to Washington.

""An opportunity such as this comes once in history and cannot be missed... I am full of hope that we are on the verge of a historic moment in the annals of our state,"" Netanyahu, who has been invited to meet Trump at the White House on Tuesday to discuss the plan, said in a statement.

Trump on Thursday said he will release his long-delayed plan before meeting Netanyahu in Washington.

""It's a great plan. It's a plan that really would work,"" Trump said. Netanyahu's political rival Benny Gantz has also received an invitation to attend the White House talks.

Gantz told a news conference in Tel Aviv on Saturday that the ""peace plan devised by President Trump will go down in history as a meaningful landmark"". He expected the initiative to allow ""different players in the Middle East to finally move ahead towards an historic regional agreement"".

The Palestinian leadership was not invited and has already rejected Trump's plan amid tense relations with the US president over his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's undivided capital.

""This step only reaffirms our absolute rejection of what the US administration has done so far, particularly the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital,"" Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas' spokesman said in a statement earlier this week.

The Palestinians see east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state and believe that Trump's plan buries the two-state solution that has been for decades the cornerstone of international Middle East diplomacy.

World powers have long agreed that Jerusalem's fate should be settled through negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.

Israel has occupied east Jerusalem and the West Bank since the 1967 Six-Day War. More than 600,000 Israelis now live there in settlements considered illegal under international law.

Trump's peace plan has been in the works since 2017.

An economic part of the initiative was unveiled in June and calls for $50 billion in international investment in the Palestinian territories and neighbouring Arab countries over 10 years.

Trump came to power in 2017 promising to broker Israeli-Palestinian peace, which he labelled the ""ultimate deal"".

The US president has repeatedly boasted that he is the most pro-Israeli US president in history.

Netanyahu on Saturday again called him ""the greatest friend that Israel has ever had"".

""For three years, I have spoken with President Trump and his staff about our most vital national and security needs, which must be included in any diplomatic arrangement.

""I have found an attentive ear in the White House to these needs,"" Netanyahu said in his statement.

Gantz also showered Trump with praise during his news conference. ""The United States is Israel's closest ally and friend and under President Trump's leadership, the alliance between Israel and the United States has grown stronger, deeper and more significant than ever,"" he said.

""I wish to thank President Trump for his dedication and determination in defending the security interests that both Israel and the US share,"" he said, adding that he will meet the US president on Monday.

Trump's meeting with Netanyahu and Gantz comes a little more than a month before new Israeli elections, with polls showing Netanyahu's right-wing Likud and Gantz's centrist Blue and White party neck-and-neck.

Israeli media speculated that Trump had chosen to announce the event in support of Netanyahu's election bid -- the third in a year.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-s-mideast-peace-plan-will-be--historic---netanyahu-2020-01-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-s-mideast-peace-plan-will-be--historic---netanyahu.html

The film features Disha opposite actor Aditya Roy Kapur and the on-screen chemistry of the duo has been appreciated by the audiences.

The 27-year-old actor believes being comfortable with the co-star is the key to great chemistry.

""I am lucky that I get to work with people I have admired. That admiration shows on screen. People I have worked with are so easy. If you feel comfortable with each other then that works well. That's the major key to chemistry.""

Disha said having worked with notable directors like Puri Jagannadh in ""Loafer"", Neeraj Pandey in her Bollywood debut ""M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story"", Ali Abbas Zafar in ""Bharat"" and Suri, taught her a lot about the craft.

""I am a director's actor and I am completely dependent on them for telling me what to do because they know the script well. I have been very fortunate to work with these great directors... I am blessed to work with directors, who are good actors,"" she added.

Also featuring Anil Kapoor and Kunal Kemmu, ""Malang"" is scheduled to be released on February 7.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/angelina-jolie-was-my-inspiration-for--malang---disha-patani-2020-01-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/angelina-jolie-was-my-inspiration-for--malang---disha-patani.html

157,26-1-20,India chase modest 133-run for 2-0 lead as bowlers trouble NZ batsmen on slow track,"Exploiting a slow track, Indian bowlers struck intermittently to restrict New Zealand to a modest 132 for five in the second T20 International, here on Sunday.

Opting to bat, the Black Caps could not generate enough momentum in the middle overs and finished with a sub-par total.

Martin Guptill top-scored with 33 off 20 balls, while Tim Seifert was unbeaten on 33 not out off 26 balls.

Guptill and Colin Munro (26) provided a measured start to New Zealand putting on 48 runs for the first wicket.

Surprisingly, India held back Jasprit Bumrah (1/21) as Shardul Thakur (1/21) and Mohammed Shami (0/22) bowled four overs in the power play. The tactic worked as Thakur got rid of Guptill at end of six overs.

India then used the slow nature of the used-wicket to put brakes on the scoring rate. Wickets came at a regular interval as the Black Caps struggled to pull off big shots.

Yuzvendra Chahal (0/33) and Shivam Dube (1/16) combined well after the powerplay, while Ravindra Jadeja was the stand out bowler with figures of 2-18 from four overs.

Overall, India also raised their fielding effort barring a surprise drop chance from Virat Kohli late in the innings.

Dube got rid of Munro in the ninth over while Colin de Grandhomme (3) failed to get going once again. Jadeja gleefully accepted his return catch.

The hosts were reduced to 81-4 in the 13th over when skipper Kane Williamson (14) became Jadeja's victim, caught in the deep by Chahal.

The wheels had truly come off the New Zealand innings as they were struggling to get the big shots away and squandered their measured start away.

Ross Taylor (18), struggling for timing throughout his 24-ball stay was a prime example. Without Seifert's effort, including a four and two sixes, the score wouldn't have achieved any respectability.

Shreyas Iyer walked off the field in the last over after hurting his left knee whilst fielding.

158,26-1-20,India beat NZ by seven wickets in second T20I,"Ravinder Jadeja and K L Rahul played pivotal roles as India produced a disciplined all-round effort to outwit New Zealand by seven wickets in the second T20 International and take a 2-0 lead in the five-match series here on Sunday.

Indian bowlers, led by Jadeja, made life difficult for the hosts on a slow wicket, restricting them to 132 for five after New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson won the toss and elected to bat.

While left-arm spinner Jadeja picked up two wickets for 18, Jasprit Bumrah (1/21), Shardul Thakur (1/21) and Shivam Dube (1/16) snapped one each at the Eden park.

India then returned to overhaul the target with consummate ease, scoring 135 for 3 in 17.3 overs, riding on an unbeaten 50-ball ball 57 by Rahul and a 33-ball 44 from Shreyas Iyer.

Rahul sent the ball across the fence three times and also smashed two sixes, while Iyer's innings was studded with one four and three sixes.

Earlier, the home batsman struggled a bit on a slow wicket, which was also used in the opening T20 on Friday, but opener Martin Guptill (33) and wicket-keeper batsman Tim Seifert (33) help the side put on board something to fight for.

India are leading the series 1-0.

Brief Scores:

New Zealand: 132 for 5 in 20 overs. (Tim Seifert 33 not out, Martin Guptill 33, Colin Munro 26 ; R Jadeja 2/18, S Dube 1/16).

159,26-1-20,"Bowlers stood up and took control, says captain Kohli","India captain Virat Kohli lauded his bowling unit for taking control of the proceedings from the onset after an emphatic seven-wicket victory against New Zealand in the second T20 International here on Sunday.

Ravindra Jadeja (2/18 in 4 overs) and Jasprit Bumrah (1/21 in 4 overs) were primarily responsible for restricting New Zealand to 132 with the help of a steady Mohammed Shami (0/22 in 4 overs).

""I think we had another good performance today, especially with the ball. The bowlers stood up and took control of what we wanted to do out there. Sticking to one side of the wicket was a very good feature for us as a team to restrict a good New Zealand team to 132 which I think was below par,"" Kohli said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

The low target led to India chasing down the total with 15 balls to spare.

""The low total led us to bat in that manner but we thought the pitch was good for 160 in the first half. We understood the angles of the field better, how the pitch was playing and I had to think on my feet as a captain,"" he added.

Jadeja had the advantage as the ball gripped on this surface which was different from the first game.

""The ball gripped for the spinners and I think Jadeja was outstanding. Chahal was a banker. Bumrah was amazing as well, and Shami and Shardul and Shivam making very good contributions with the ball but I think we backed it up in the field more importantly,"" he added.

Kohli's opposite number Kane Williamson reckoned that the pitch was tough for batting compared to the first match and that they were 20 runs short.

""It was a tough day. The wicket was quite different from the first game. I think as a batting unit we needed another 15 or 20 to make it a little bit more competitive. But credit to the way India bowled,"" Williamson said.

He termed India as a ""class side"" which put them under constant pressure.

""They're a class side in all departments and they put us under pressure in that middle period. Even though we only had 130 on the board on a small ground, we still knew if we were able to take early wickets and build pressure like they did, then you never really know.

""But they showed their experience and took the game much deeper than we were able to in the first innings and they were very clinical.""",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bowlers-stood-up-and-took-control--says-captain-kohli-2020-01-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/bowlers-stood-up-and-took-control--says-captain-kohli.html
160,25-1-20,Elephants over an airport,"At a time when there’s a drought of good news in the country, a report from Jharkhand that the construction of an airport has been halted to ensure the jumbo corridor isn’t affected is welcome

At the time of a drought of good news in the country, there comes one to celebrate. The Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has halted the construction of an airport at the site of an abandoned World War-II airstrip near Jharkhand’s Dhalbhumgarh town. The reason? It would disrupt an elephant corridor used by 200 pachyderms.

The airport near Dhalbhumgarh was to be the first of 400-of-its-kind, which the Airport Authority of India proposes to build throughout the country. Its halting represents one of the rare occasions when a concern for animals has won out against a grandiose plan for so-called development. The disruption of the corridor would have forced the elephants to look elsewhere for passage, including urban and semi-urban areas, thus taking them to new places and creating new dangers of elephant-human conflict.

The resultant casualties would have had an adverse impact on Jharkhand’s elephants, whose numbers have been declining. From 772 in 2002, the figure came down to 624 in 2007. It increased to 688 in 2012 only to come down to 679 in 2017, according to the elephant census titled, ‘Synchronised elephant population estimation India 2017’, released on August 12 (World Elephant Day), that year.

The causes, related to conditions created by continuing human encroachment upon and activity in elephant habitats, include habitat loss, electrocution by contact with sagging and/or low-hanging high voltage transmission wires, running over by trains, conflicts with humans besides poaching, poisoning and old-age related medical problems. According to a report in May, 2017, 32 elephants had been killed by electrocution and 22 in train accidents in Jharkhand until then.

One hopes that the decision to stop the construction of the airport will not be reversed under pressure and will prove to the precursor of many similar decisions concerning all animals. Elephants, doubtless, need particular attention. They have been listed in Schedule One of the Wildlife Protection Act of India, 1972, which gives them the highest level of protection. Project Elephant was launched in 1992 to protect the Asian elephant (the category to which Indian elephants belong), its habitat and corridors and address the human-elephant conflict. The elephant was declared India’s National Heritage Animal on October 22, 2010.

Yet serious challenges remain. Almost all the factors adversely affecting elephants in Jharkhand apply to the species throughout India. The most important of these is habitat loss, caused principally by continuing human encroachment. This is clear from the Elephant Task Force’s report, Gajah: Securing the Future for Elephants in India, submitted on August 31, 2010. Dwelling on how various elements contribute to habitat loss and the latter’s impact, it states, “Large developmental and infrastructural projects when not planned or located with adequate care are fragmenting habitat[s], while other local pressures degrade them.” It further states, “The physical presence of the roads and railway lines in the habitat creates new habitat edges, alters the hydrological dynamics and creates a barrier to the movement of elephants and other animals, leads to habitat fragmentation and loss, apart from death due to train and vehicular hits.”

It adds, “Rail and an increase in road traffic operates in a synergetic way across several landscapes and causes not only an overall loss and isolation of wildlife habitat but also splits up the landscape in a literal sense. Various developmental activities also come up on either side of the highways and railroads, thereby further fragmenting the habitat and increasing biotic pressures.”

With shrinking habitats, elephants searching for food raid cultivated areas, devouring and destroying crops. Attempts to turn them away constitute an important cause of human-elephant conflict, which is taking a growing number of lives. Replying to a question, Babul Supriyo, Union Minister of State for MoEFFC, told the Lok Sabha on June 28, 2019, that 2,398 people had died since 2014. According to other official statistics, a total of 1,465 people were killed between the years 2013-14 and 2016-17. In turn, people kill 40 to 50 elephants every year, apart from those slain by poachers for the ivory of the tusks.

Habitat loss also forces elephants to move into other areas. They are now seen in States like Manipur, Mizoram, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and the Union Territory of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, where they had not been present earlier. Other factors have also contributed. A major drought in Tamil Nadu had caused herds of elephants to cross over to Andhra Pradesh where they had no presence for over two centuries. The result is an extension of the area witnessing human-elephant conflict.

The impact of habitat loss is compounded by that of elephant corridors, which account for much of the rail and road accidents. According to the report, Gajah: Securing the Future for Elephants in India, train accidents had killed as many as 150 of these behemoths since 1987. According to a Ministry statement in the Rajya Sabha, 49 elephants were killed in railway accidents between 2016 and 2018.

The Elephant Task Force’s report has recommended several measures to protect habitats and prevent elephants from being killed in road and rail accidents. These include the announcement of principles of forest area, railway track and highway management, the grant of mining licences and rules governing the drawing and maintenance of power cables through forest areas.

Besides these, attention has to be paid to nurturing elephant reserves as the basic management unit for their conservation in the country. At present, there are 32 of these across India, covering over 69,000 sq km. The problem is that more than over 40 per cent of these is not under Protected Area or Government forest. Hence, the main emphasis has to be on managing land use patterns in the areas outside the preserves to reduce human-elephant conflict. Also, the havoc bush fires continue to play in Australia reminds us of the need to be ready to cope with such calamities which have been taking a severe toll in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh and may occur in other parts of India thanks to climate change.

All this will require huge expenditure and effort. The Government must not balk from either. Besides, it needs to reach out to organisations like Wildlife SOS, TREE Foundation and Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre, which have been doing outstanding work in rescuing and nurturing elephants.

161,26-1-20,White House say voters should decide if Trump remains in office,"White House lawyers began their defense of Donald Trump at his historic Senate impeachment trial on Saturday, saying the president did nothig wrong in his dealings with Ukraine and American voters -- not Congress -- should decide his fate.

White House counsel Pat Cipollone said it would be a ""completely irresponsible abuse of power"" if the Senate follows the lead of the House of Representatives and votes to remove the 45th US president from office.

""They're asking you to do something that no Senate has ever done,"" Cipollone told the 100 senators gathered on a rainy Saturday morning for a rare weekend session at just the third impeachment trial in US history.

Democratic prosecutors from the House, which impeached Trump last month for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, had not convincingly made their case that he had committed ""high crimes and misdemeanors,"" as demanded by the Constitution, Cipollone said.

""We don't believe that they have come anywhere close to meeting their burden for what they're asking you to do,"" he told a hushed Senate chamber.

""We believe when you hear the facts... You will find that the president did absolutely nothing wrong."" House prosecutors spent the previous three days laying out a detailed case that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting to pressure his Ukrainian counterpart to open an investigation into political rival Joe Biden and the former vice president's son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.

Adam Schiff, the chief House prosecutor, said the real estate tycoon turned politician poses an ""imminent threat"" to American democracy and his guiding principle is ""Trump first, not America first."" Cipollone argued that Democrats were asking the Senate to ""tear up all of the ballots"" from the 2016 presidential election and attempting to prevent Trump from running for re-election in November.

""They are here to perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in American history and we can't allow that to happen,"" the White House counsel said. ""Let the people decide for themselves.""

The Democratic-controlled House impeached Trump on December 18 in a party line vote, setting up a trial in the Senate, where Republicans hold a 53 to 47 seat edge and the president enjoys the support of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

A two-thirds majority, or 67 senators, is required to remove a president from office and Democrats do not appear to have made any significant inroads so far in Trump's wall of Republican support.

Senator Mitt Romney, a Republican from Utah and occasional Trump critic, said he was ""likely"" to support a Democratic demand for further witnesses during the trial but other Republicans indicated that their minds were all but made up.

""Today we heard a case that was strong, that was clear and that completely undermined the case of the Democrats,"" Senator John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming, said of the White House defense.

Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican from Iowa, said that in just two hours, ""the White House counsel and their team entirely shredded the case that has been presented by the House."" Shortly before his lawyers took the floor, Trump fired off a tweet with insulting nicknames for leading Democrats and told his supporters to tune in to the live television broadcast.

The White House lawyers kept their opening arguments short -- just under two hours -- in part, perhaps, because Trump, a former reality television star, had complained that Saturday is the ""Death Valley"" of TV viewership.

Following the defense presentation, Trump claimed it had demonstrated how ""unfairly"" he has been treated and showed he was the victim of a ""partisan Impeachment Hoax."" Trump's lawyers will resume his defense on Monday. They will have 24 hours spread over three days for their arguments but have said they are unlikely to use all the time allotted.

Saturday's brief session was a relief to the four senators battling for the Democratic presidential nomination, allowing them to return to the campaign trail.

Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar and Colorado Senator Michael Bennet have been forced to remain in Washington while Biden and other candidates campaign in Iowa, which kicks off the nominating process on February 3.

Senators will have 16 hours next week to direct questions to both sides and consider whether they should subpoena witnesses, something Democrats have sought but Republicans have opposed.

The questions from senators will be submitted in writing to US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial and will read them out loud. Americans appear about evenly split on whether Trump should be removed, though several polls show a healthy majority want the Senate to subpoena witnesses for Trump's trial.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/white-house-say-voters-should-decide-if-trump-remains-in-office-2020-01-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/white-house-say-voters-should-decide-if-trump-remains-in-office.html

163,26-1-20,"Death toll in China's coronavirus rises to 56, confirmed cases near 2,000","The death toll in the deadly new coronavirus in China rose to 56 on Sunday with confirmed cases of viral affliction reaching 1,975 and 324 of them being critical, Chinese health authorities said.

The new type of pneumonia, officially being described as 2019-nCoV, has resulted in 56 deaths, the National Health Commission said.

A total of 2,684 suspected cases have also been reported so far, it said.

While Wuhan and 17 others cities in Hubei province remained the epicentre of the viral disease outbreak with most of the deaths having taken place there, the cases have started rising steadily in most of the Chinese provinces and cities, including Beijing.

Hubei province added 323 new confirmed cases of infection on Jan 25. It also reported 13 new deaths.

A total of 1,052 cases of coronavirus were reported till Jan 25 in the province, with 129 being critical, besides 52 deaths, state run Global Times reported.

Ten new coronavirus afflictions were reported till Saturday in Beijing, taking the number of cases to 51 in the city, the report said.

Shanghai, China's biggest city has reported 40 cases so far, it added.

Amid the situation becoming grim, Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday said China is facing a ""grave situation"" but he exuded confidence that the country would ""win the battle"" against the coronavirus epidemic.

Stepping up all-round efforts to contain the fast spreading SARS-like virus, China on Saturday announced it would build another 1,300-bed makeshift hospital in Wuhan in the next 15 days in addition to another 1,000-bed hospital being built presently in the city and expected to be completed in 10 days, to treat more cases of the deadly virus.

The feverish pace at which the hospitals are being built indicates China is preparing to treat far more patients, considering the speed at which the virus is spreading.

The virus has spread to Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Nepal, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and the US as of Thursday. Japan on Friday had reported a second confirmed case.

The confirmed cases in China crossed the 1,000-mark for the first time on Friday, rising sharply to 1,287 with 237 people reported critical, the Commission had said on Saturday.

China's Communist Party has set up a leading group to manage the coronavirus epidemic, state media reported on Saturday.

The decision was made at a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee - the party's top leadership tier - chaired by President Xi.

In the meeting, Xi said people from different ethnic groups and sectors should work together to support efforts to contain the spread of the deadly virus. The country is facing a “grave situation”, he was quoted as saying by the South China Morning Post.

“As long as the nation has strong confidence and makes joint efforts with scientific and targeted measures, the battle of the prevention and control of the contagion will be won,"" Xi said, chairing meeting on the day of the Spring Festival or Lunar New Year.

Xi also called for all-out efforts to prevent and control the coronavirus-related pneumonia and extended his heartfelt gratitude to the frontline medical staff, struggling to control the outbreak.

He also called for strengthening the protection of medical staff, ensuring the steady supply of requisite materials and intensifying disclosure of related information to guide the public opinion and mobilise social forces to uphold the overall stability of society.

The CPC meeting urged concrete efforts to ensure access to adequate supplies of materials to Wuhan.

The participants of the meeting also urged to ensure all-out efforts to treat patients, and disclose disease-related information in an accurate, open and transparent manner to address concerns from both at home and abroad, it said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/death-toll-in-china-s-coronavirus-rises-to-56--confirmed-cases-near-2-000-2020-01-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/death-toll-in-china-s-coronavirus-rises-to-56--confirmed-cases-near-2-000.html
164,26-1-20,Hong Kong Disneyland closes over China virus fears,"Hong Kong's Disneyland announced it was shutting its doors on Sunday until further notice over the deadly virus outbreak in central China, a day after city authorities classified the crisis as an emergency.

The park said it was taking the step to protect ""the health and safety of our guests and cast members"", mirroring a similar move by Shanghai's Disneyland.

Ocean Park, a rival amusement park on Hong Kong's main island, said it was also closing its doors.

On Saturday, Hong Kong classified the outbreak as an ""emergency"" -- the city's highest warning tier -- and announced ramped-up measures to reduce the risk of further infections.

The move came as city leader Carrie Lam faced criticism in some quarters over her administration's response to the crisis.

Calls have been made by politicians and some medical experts to halt, or limit, arrivals from the Chinese mainland where the epidemic began.

Of the six people to have tested positive for the virus, five arrived via a newly built high-speed train terminal which connects with the mainland.

On Sunday, a newly formed union which represents healthcare workers threatened industrial action from February 3 if the government does not ban all arrivals from mainland China.

And in the district of Fanling, local residents held a protest against plans to earmark an empty public housing block as a temporary quarantine for patients and frontline medical staff who don't want to return to their families.

Lam has resisted closing the border, saying the crisis is not yet at a point where such a drastic measure is needed.

But she has announced all mainland arrivals must now sign health declaration forms.

A series of public events, including a Lunar New Year gala and next month's marathon have also been cancelled while the re-opening of schools after the holidays has been delayed.

On Sunday, the nearby gambling hub of Macau announced three more cases of the novel coronavirus, bringing its total to five.

All three new cases were women who came from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. One of the women had arrived in Macau via Hong Kong, authorities said.

The closure of Disneyland and Ocean Park will pile fresh misery on Hong Kong's tourism, leisure and retail sectors which have already been battered by more than seven months of often-violent pro-democracy protests.

Ocean Park is on track to receive a HK dollar 10.6 billion (USD 1.3 billion) government bailout over grim ticket sales in recent years.

Combined with the US-China trade war fallout, the protests have helped tip Hong Kong into recession and the virus outbreak has only compounded the city's economic woes. Lam's approval ratings are languishing at record lows after the protests but Beijing has doggedly stuck by her.

Hong Kong has firsthand experience of deadly viral outbreaks.

""I have started everything with my music career. Through music video, I was offered my first Punjabi film. My first Bollywood film, too, was offered because of my music video. Everything started with my music career and I am enjoying this journey,"" Jassi told IANS.

Jassi made his debut in 2011 with the album ""Batchmate"". He made his acting debut with the Punjabi film ""Mr & Mrs 420"". He stepped into Bollywood in 2018 with ""Happy Phirr Bhag Jayegi"", alongside Sonakshi Sinha, Diana Penty and Jimmy Sheirgill, and returned on the Hindi screen opposite Kangana Ranaut in ""Panga"" this weekend.

With acting coming into focus now, will singing take a backseat? ""I don't think that this (acting) will affect my singing career. Acting and singing have been parallel for me because I started acting through my songs (music videos). So, I dont think that way. It's become so easy nowadays that you can sit in your room and make music. So, whenever I get time I make music. I don't think my music will be affected because of my acting career,"" he said.

In ""Panga"", Jassi plays a supportive husband role to Kangana Ranaut's character, who wants to make a comeback as a kabaddi player several years after marriage and motherhood. The film is directed by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari.

Working with Kangana was a ""great experience"", he said. ""I have no background in acting and I never thought of get into acting. So, you get to learn when you get a chance to work with such famous and talented stars. So it was something similar for me. Before this, I worked in the Punjabi film industry with people like Gurdaas Mann ji and Jimmy Sheirgill. I have always tried learning from the talents I have worked with and this was also thecase on the 'Panga' set. I used to observe Kangana and how sincerely she works,"" he said.

Why did it take so long after ""Happy Phirr Bhag Jayegi"" to sign a Bollywood film? ""'Happy Phirr Bhag Jayegi' was my first film and this film has released one-and-a-half years after that one. The main reason is I signed 'Panga' even as I was working in that film. The shoot of this film was done in two or three schedules, for which it took time to release. This film is extremely special to me and so I waited for its release, and then took a decision,"" he said.
